“I prefer face-to-face conversations. In case the situation turns bad, I know exactly who needs to be blown up.”Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a hybrid 2-D space simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company Minmax Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and tactics.  Atmosphere & presentation:+ Large amount of ships with creative designs guarantee a lot of variety and enable a corresponding learning curve.+ The salvage and mining mechanics keep up the motivation to explore new star systems.  + Size and mass of ships influence movement and inertia of each vehicle.+ Late game introduces an ever shifting equilibrium of power.o The faction system adds an interesting dimension to the game, but it has little impact on the behaviour or decision making of the player.  - Amount of side missions and randomly generated events throughout the galaxy are limited and repetitive. - The musical background lacks variety. Combat & gameplay:+ Fluent combat mechanics create a dynamic battlefield with focus on tactical positioning.  + Each ship offers different customization options for weapon and auxiliary systems, which benefits the tactical spectrum of the game.   + Easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master skill tree challenges the player to gain more experience.  + Late game requires a more strategic approach of the evolving situation. o Everything on the map can be attacked and destroyed.Characters & story:+ Story telling has a surprising and refreshing twist.+ Well done integration and development of the zombie threat.o Stereotypical portrayal of characters. - Very little voice acting during the entire game.Summary:Minmax Games succeeded in creating a well-rounded game with only a few rough edges. SPAZ delivers much more action and tactics than one might expect of this indie title. The urge to unlock the next ship class, spending points on the elaborate skill tree or collecting credits for the next weapon upgrade will keep you up late into the night. And the entertaining zombie plot will come around the corner when you least expect it.

												When I first got SPAZ, I remember playing about 5 minutes and just not being interested; I never gave it a chance and now I really regret my initial judgements.Space Pirates and Zombies is a top-down, twin stick style shooter set in a randomly generated solar system. You operate out of a main “mothership” and tackle quests and missions piloting smaller craft alongside AI Wingmen. The combat is difficult, but rewardingly so, and requires thought and sound tactics especially at the later stages of the game. I definitely judged this book by it’s cover when it was first released, but it is certainly no run of the mill twin stick shooter.The RPG elements are shockingly deep; you gain levels, rescue crew specialists upgrade weapons, collect ship designs, outfit your wingmen, and participate in a simple but very effective economy trading rez (currency), goons (crew) and data (xp).Visually the art is great, lots of vibrant colors, really unique ship designs, combat effects are satisfyingly meaty, characters are well drawn and the dialogue, while crude, is interesting and humorous.The only issue I have come across is playing SPAZ via in home streaming. Considering the visual fidelity of the game, it seems like my gaming rig has an abnormally hard time encoding the video of it. I’ve found that using “DirectX Compatibility” and “Capture Mouse” helps make it playable, but there are still numerous visual artifacts and glitching seen on the remote computer.Overall a brilliant game, and I’m truly looking forward to the sequel!

												SPAZ is an awesome game, you gather resources and manage your own fleet of starships, everything can be customized, from engines to missiles. Took me about 22 hours to finish the campaign, the map is huge, the more you explore the more ships and technologies you unlock, and to complete the package the game support mods, you can simply download a Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica mod that will customize all your ships!

												SPAZ does almost everything right as a 2D arcade space shooter. The game is fun, features a considerably deep ship designer; as challenging as you wish it to be and it looks good. The low points are the dialogue, which is thankfully sparse; early balance (good luck getting anywhere if you choose to research beam weapons instead of cannons!); lack of information regarding the effectiveness of your ship design and, for some, though not for me, the control scheme. These issues, however, do not detract from the experience in a significant way. 8/10, looking forward to the sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finished this game in 64 hours. That wasn't a wasted time, not at all. Because I like tactical strategies and I like RPGs. This game is mainly strategy with active pause. RPG elements is mostly for technical purposes like skills and leveling. So don't expect tons of talking. But be prepared for tons of space explosions, destroyed and captured star bases, lasers, missiles, dozens of skills, upgrades, ships and all that stuff which should be in game like that. Yes, this game has it all. And all of that in open, procedurally generated world.VERDICT:If you like space adventures, you will like this one.If you don't, better change your mind.If you really don't, why the hell did you start to read this at all?Like this review?

												SPAZ is a gmae which I can heartily recommend based on a few short facts.1. The game's graphics are beautiful with a unique and disticive art style and lots of interesting and diverse weather conditions.2. The ship designs are distinctive with their own mix of strengths and weaknesses and each has fully customisable loadouts to better suit whatever your style of play.3. The game is long. Very long in fact but still manages to make each system feel unique and mysterious.4. I controls are natural and destinctive with hotkeys that allow all sorts of game changing things to occur including ejecting cargo, jettisoning spare crew and releasing the ship's armour all of which improve the handling of the ship.5. It's cheap and worth every last dime you drop on it.If you like exploration, space combat and custom ships then you can't go wrong with SPAZ.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You know that game where you check on steam and it says you've played 200+ hours and you are just like.... holy.... That's this game. Btw If you are a soldier and you are deploying to the land of crappy internet. This is a must buy. It will really help pass some of that extra time you've got.			",86,31,0,18,6,0,20

The atmosphere to the game is great, the graphics look really colorful, the combat is frantic and fun and the universe you explore is massive.

												Wow. I've spend about 5 days straight playing this one, and I still hungered for more.SPAZ, or Space Pirates and Zombies (And Bounty Hunters) feels unique. You've got a small fleet of spaceships, and your objective is to reach the center of the galaxy, in search of a fabled load of Rez, an exceptional element discovered in the future capable of being transformed into any metal you need - starting ALL THE WAY BACK from the edge of the Perseus arm, where Earth is currently situated. You can assume direct control of any of your ships at any time in the field - being able to switch back and forth at a moment's notice, while the AI takes care of your other ships for you. You also have a Tactics panel, from which you can evaluate the situation of the entire battlefield and give orders to your fleet, set action stances, order reinforcements, etc. You can also DESIGN each and every one of your ships - you can unlock different hulls, weapons, modules, you name it.You'll find yourself dragged into a MARATHON once you get a hold of it. There's only one problem, though: the game is a bit grindy. The Milky Way is ENORMOUS, so there can be quite an expanse between your location and your objective in it. You'll find yourself battling through a load of star systems just to reach your next mission or unlock the newest upgrade, and that takes time and resources - most of which you'll be grinding out of mining stations/enemy fleets if you're careless. If it weren't for the grinding, this game would be perfect on my book. But still, it's VERY enjoyable.Has a great story - but I don't want to spoil it. Play your cards right and the game will go easy on you. Screw up, and expect to spend a few hours grinding for Rez.DEFINITELY recommend. You'll need some patience, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Delivers that old-school skill based freeflying space shooter gameplay (say that three times fast) just like the developers wanted and manages to combine it with fast paced naval style tactics in a 2 dimensonal battlefield to keep things interesting. On top of that they shift gears at the end game and throw in a light turn based strategy system on top of it. Resource mangement can be a grind and a drag at times as your progress comes to an almost literal deadstop because your enemies are simply way too strong for you to even make a dent in their armor. Time has to be spent collecting resources to build ships while buttering up the factions for each system you visit for the tech upgrades they have unless you want to blow their stations to pieces so you can just take it instead, either way you're going to have to stop and smell the roses a few times, more than a few if you lose a lot of ships.The plot is a throwback to the classic days as well, no ""deep"" triple A slop here, just a decent story to keep the action going with a predictable unfolding if you pay any attention at all and a great ending to lead into the second game which I am now highly anticipating. Overall an excellent title for anyone who likes classic action, tactics and maybe a small sense of conquest and conquering at the same time.			",319,32,9,82,28,2,71

												Definitely the strongest point for me was the atmospheric nature of this game which pushed me to complete it twise. The combat gets more exciting after you level up, get larger ships and stronger weapons. It has some strategy elements and the combat will require you to have proper ship set, timing, aiming and moving if you want to complete it on harder difficulties. I personally had some troble getting used to the moving system, but it became natural after little bit.Unfortunately the story isn't great and the whole moving from system to system gets repetitive after a while because of small amount of intriguing encounters, yet that serves as a push to try new things, like different ship and weapon sets or different relations between forses. In the end it gets you even more interested in it.			",371,87,10,51,28,5,41

												+RPG levelling+Wide-variety of ship types+Physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles+Easy-to-learn resource management+Dark humored-Grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types)-Sub-Par AI teammates-Low variety of equipment types-Low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching)Listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up.The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for Universe is easily the star, but Big Fight for Beef is also very good.Even though SPAZ 2 is out, this is still definitely a buy.			",124,27,0,23,7,0,33

												Despite the odd title, this is a fun game if you like 2D space action, like collecting new ships and weapons, and don't mind having to grind a bit if you do poorly for awhile. SPaZ is a top down space combat game where you mine resources and fight other ships. You gain power by gaining favor with two factions and buying weapon blueprints. You get ship blueprints from beating those ships. For me, getting those blueprints and seeing what each new ship or weapon could do was the most fun part of the game. There are many different types of equipment and you have limited upgrade points, so you'll have to pick a few trees to go down until late game when you can really pack on the level up. This gives the game some replayability if you like.Combat is fun and you have a lot of options. You can put out a big, expensive ship and just mow down enemies, or you can put out a small fast ship that can't take much damage. While the small ships do die quickly, they are much less expensive, making it an important issue to consider. If you get low on resources, you can't build your big ships and have to either do easy missions or go mine. There are places to do so relatively safely, but that's the slight grind I mentioned.I only had two issues with the game. The first relates to the factions. There are two and in each system they will have different feelings toward you. If you make them happy or mad in one system, it won't affect them in another. This is actually good. The problem is that one faction is always the one blocking the warp gates leading to other sectors. They must be cleared before you can move on. So you must either bribe the guards, which is extremely expensive, or attack them and♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. The second problem is that the end game got very boring and ""samey"" as I cleared system after system. However, that was me being completionist. You can finish the game without doing so but more systems cleared will give more aid in the last battle. Overall, I had a lot of fun. I'm not ready to jump into a second playthrough yet, but I'm happy with the time spent with this game and I will be keeping an eye on the second.			",111,43,0,29,5,0,12

Posted: October 12, 2014
												The style and idea behind this game are appealing, but the game is made unpleasant by several glaring design flaws.You only ever seem to have around 3 ships to control at once. That doesn't really give you much in the way of tactical options. You're frequently put into situations where you go up against way more ships than that, so it feels strange to have only one large ship and two small ships and be expected to feel like you're being strategic/tactical.The issue with the tactical options is compounded by the need to grind a lot to have weapons strong enough to take on foes of a given tech level. The damage system is interesting, you have shields, then armor, then hull. Beams are strong against shields, cannons are strong against armor, and launchers are strong against hull. However, according to the DEVS THEMSELVES, a good strategy is to only focus on upgrading one of beams/cannons. What was the point of the damage model if you're just going to suggest people not worry about trying to match up the correct weapon based on the situation of the enemy ships? Because I didn't know about this, I was getting to the point where most of my time was spent grinding to at least 1.5x the tech level of the enemies I would go against. It seems like the designer didn't really think about how the damage and tech level system really affected the fun of the gameplay.There's a lot of time spent just doing repetitive mission types over and over again to get data so you can level up your tech. It gets old after awhile, even though there's a decent variety of mission types, once you play a certain type once, it isn't really fun to play it again. The only thing to keep you going is a desire to progress through the story or feel like you're ""being productive"", but really you're just doing the same stuff over and over again. It doesn't make for very fun gameplay.The whole idea of the Bounty Hunters is also an issue. Bounty Hunters in space is really thematically appropriate, but the way it's implemented in this world just adds unpleasant busy work. Every time you do missions you accrue ""bounty"". Whenever you jump, if your bounty is high enough and your near a bounty hunter lair, you'll be attacked by powerful ships and probably will have to reload a save. The only way to get rid of bounty is to go to a lair and pay them, or complete ""arena challenges"" which net you some Rez and relieve some bounty. The arena challenges are very fun, but I frequently found myself in a situation where I had maxed out my Rez so I just had to pay a bunch of money and never really felt a reason to play the challenges. It's just a resource sink without much fun behind. If it was possible to beat bounty hunters when they attacked you I would consider this fixed. There's plenty of other ways it could be improved, of course.Other than that, there's just lots of little annoyances throughout the game that indicate a lack of polish. One petty example is that, on escort missions, the ship you are escorting might have cloaking, but will be invisible to you, which makes it difficult to tell where you need to be. Escort missions have other problems, like the behavior of the escorted ship (it will sometimes go in the opposite direction, won't follow you, etc...). This is just one example of a minor design issue. There's others; like the heavy reliance on saving and loading (breaking immersion and breaking up the flow of the gameplay).Overall, it's insulting to Mound and Blade to call this game ""Mount and Blade in Space"". Mount and Blade lacks a lot of the issues that make SPAZ unpleasant (after a few hours of playing). Unlike games like Mount and Blade, I just never feel like I'm becoming more powerful. I don't feel like I'm interacting with the galaxy because all the solar systems are very closed off from each other. If you're looking for a game that actually gives you a sense of strategy, tactics, and power, you should look into Starsector (formerly Starfarer), which is currently playable though in-development. I think it does a better job of providing the sort of experience this game was trying to provide.			",216,50,8,24,23,3,32

												Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top down space shooter game with a level up system for technology and a rudimentary economy system.  The majority of the game is space combat similar to the old multiplayer game “Subspace” but with no power ups (and you kind of design your own ships).SPAZ technically has a story but you probably won’t pay attention to it for most of the game since you’ll be exploring the galaxy for long stretches between “story missions.” You play part of the crew of the Clockwork, a ragtag mother ship headed for the galactic core to mine precious minerals.  Unfortunately the galaxy is mostly controlled by the UTA, a powerful organization kind of like the Empire in Star Wars, except not really evil. The UTA has its own problems though, the colonies are rebelling, and everywhere you go in the galaxy there will be fighting between UTA and colonial warships. The game’s galaxy is randomly generated when you start a new campaign and is made up of about 100 different star systems randomly connected like a spider’s web (if you’ve played FTL, it kind of looks like that, only much bigger). Each star system has a number next to it, representing the “tech level” of the star system. In practical terms, you can think of this as the “difficulty” of the star system. In order to progress to different stars, you need to somehow unlock them. For example if you go to one star, it might be connected to 2-3 other stars and each of those 2-3 stars has a separate warp gate that needs to be unlocked. You can unlock a gate by either killing all the UTA ships around it, or by bribing the UTA to let you through. This bribery brings up an important aspect of the game. Every time you enter a star system you are given a relationship status with the colonists and UTA. If you’re hostile to one of the 2 factions, they’ll attack you on sight and you won’t be able to trade with them. To bribe the UTA, you need to be on friendly terms with them. You change your relationship status by taking missions for that faction. For example to raise status with UTA, take missions destroying colony ships (which will lower your colony relationship). The relationships aren’t galaxy wide. You can be friends with UTA in one system and their enemy in the system right next door. You do not get chased from planet to planet no matter how bad your relationship is.Combat in SPAZ is pretty straightforward. You control one of three ships in your little fleet and can switch freely between them. The mothership stays in a safe place rebuilding your ships if they get destroyed. When enemy (or allied) ships are destroyed, they drop a “blueprint” which you can pick up to unlock that type of ship. Later ships require more copies of the same blueprint. For example to unlock a particular fighter, just destroy it and pick up the blueprint it drops. “Data clusters” dropped by destroyed ships are the “experience” of the game, and you gather those to level up. On level up, you can put skill points into various technologies, such as shields, beams, missiles, etc. This allows you to use more powerful tech (that you have to buy separately). Money in the game is a mineral called rez that you can mine from asteroids or pick up from destroyed ships. The money is used to buy tech from space stations (as long as you’re friendly with that faction). New tech items are actually pretty scarce; you need to make do with your combat skills most of the time.Pros:+The game is surprisingly complex. This would be a great game if I had no backlog to keep me going. Years ago when I had not many games to choose from, I would have spent a lot of time on SPAZ.+There is no difficulty option, but if you’re having a hard time, just go to a lower level star system. There is nothing keeping you from backtracking or skipping entire star systems. Also, very often a star system will have open battles between UTA and colony ships when you are neutral to both factions. You can just sit there in the battle and wait for a ship to be blown up so you can snag the data/blueprints. Obviously this works better on high level star systems where you’re too weak to fight either side by yourself.+Interesting weapon / defense dynamic. Beams do extra damage to shields, cannons do extra damage to armor, and missiles do extra damage to hull. Your ships can only load 1 or 2 weapon types each so you need to have a nice variety in weapons to be able to take on all enemies. Plus, combat is very fast paced and some weapons are easier to hit enemies with than others (missiles are homing). Cons:-As I mentioned above, new tech is few and far between. A star system will probably only be selling 1 item, and it probably won’t be what you’re looking for. And in order to actually buy the item, you need to be friendly with the faction that’s selling it. That means doing missions for them (and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the other faction).-The game is a tremendous grind. The faction relationship thing mentioned above is one example. Another is unlocking additional ships. You have to hunt down and destroy specific ship types to unlock them. Not so hard in the beginning, but in the end these are massive battle cruisers that can easily kick your♥♥♥♥♥ And you need like 10 blueprints to unlock them.-The technology level up system is weird. You need to save up skill points to unlock higher levels of tech, for example unlocking level 3 missiles requires 3 skill points, level 4 requires 4 skill points. Yet the game will keep nagging you if you try to save the points. If you try to diversify, you’ll end up at a disadvantage. (If you’re playing an RPG, you don’t put a point into every skill).Overall, I’d give Space Pirates and Zombies a tentative thumbs up. You can sink a lot of time into the game if this is your cup of tea, but for me there’s too much grinding. The pluses outweigh the negatives, but only just barely. ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												The game started out sounding very nice.It sounded, and looked, from the trailers, to be very enjoyable.Then I bought it and played for a little while.The concepts are all there, they're all done as well as can be expected, and, if it were paced a little better, the game would be pretty good.The problem is right there, though - pacing. Half of the time I was playing, I was just mining rocks to try and get more money to upgrade my ships. When I finally managed to get into combat, my enemies would take a small amount of damage and just run from me. Over half of my combat time was chasing down enemies in the vast nothingness that exists everywhere in search of that one last ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ needed to complete the mission.			",327,70,3,49,33,2,32

												Though initially i was drawn into SPAZ, after a few hours i realized that the bulk of the game boils down to grinding the handful of recycled randomly generated missions you will come across in every sector. Its not really avoidable, to avoid being steamrolled by each group of enemy ships you will have to grind data to ensure your tech level is consistently 5+ levels higher than them not to mention you'll need to grind for blackbox data to build better ships. Assuming youve stuck it out that long you'll find yourself with extremely limited hangar space, which means that in the vast majority of battles you are greatly outnumbered by superior ships. I tried addressing the game's shortcoming with mods but the modding component of the game appears to be broken as none of them function and i cant be arsed to fix something that should be working when the game is just not compelling enough to warrant it.

												First impressions - I'm so far, thoroughly enjoying this game more that I though. I've had this for a while thanks to a bundle and I've seen it pop up on Steam, TotalBiscuits WTFis and probably some other sites saying this game was good. I was thinking I wasn't into the Newtonian movement kind of games, like Asteriods, which is a good classic of course, but it's kind of annoying to control your ship. I started playing and it reminded me of the Dreamcast game, Armada, which I bought for cheap long after the systems death and got really into. There's that ""one more level"" factor as you gain levels to improve your ships, gather rez as currency, kill enemies for data (XP) and Goons that can help you at your base, be sold to traders, or automatically ejected from your ship if they aren't willing to work (in which they comically flail around and scream before either dying in space or being shot or ran over - it's quite amusing). I'm playing on normal with reduced bounty hunters and increased tech, so i'm kinda playing on easy and I'm not sure how much I'll like it (I feared I wouldn't because it might be too hard for me). If you're into space exploration, it's great. If you have a copy of this, but haven't touched it, give it a go for 15 minutes or so and see if it's your taste.			",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												Extreamly complex space fleet management.  SPAZ is basically FTL meets Mount and Blade.  The action feels like an addicting top-down space-shooter.  This game is not for casual gamers.  It can be a bit overwhelming but if you stick with it SPAZ can be quite a rewarding experaince.			",245,58,7,37,28,3,45

												You go from solar system to solar system, and from planet to planet, and all you do is fight and mine. Well, not really, you'll also upgrade ships and play with all kinds of setups. You're always in action or close to it, and because it's a pretty fun and addictive game it can really hook you up. I'm a bit of a sucker for bright colors and this game provided those in spades in an aesthetically pleasing way. You can customize your universe, but if you choose from a medium one and up, you'll have a lot of grinding to do until the end of the game.Pros: pretty colors, overall fun and keeps you engaged.Cons: it can get grindy.Rating: PEW!

												Great game, I pirated about 3 years ago and liked it for the few hours trying it. Then I found it agian on Steam a month ago and bought it on the summer sale for only 2,5 euro, more than worth it if you like tactical 2d space shooters!The game starts out simple, but becomes more and more advanced as you research new ship parts and discover more in the game. I can't believe how much a game made by only TWO PEOPLE can be so well developed and have great tactics! After 11 hours of playing i'm now level 21, and I can say for sure that you need to know a lot about the game and it's tactics to progress further. If you don't learn them, you're gonna get crushed by the UTA and civilians until you have to retreat to mine for resources with the ""short bus"".The game has some pretty graphics and a variety of good looking space backgrounds, effects and sound effects. The ambient soundtracks are nice, sometimes chilling and gives a great feeling to the game. Theres barely anything to complain about SPAZ.Things i'd like to see in the next game that is coming: Multiplayer battles and/or co-op, and voice acted characters in game and/or cutscenes :)			",98,17,6,11,12,1,12

												You are a group of mercenaries, traveling through randomly generated galaxy, gathering resources - actually there is only one main resource - ""rez"". You're trying to reach the galaxy core to discover the origin of ""rez"". That's how the story looks like, pretty simplistic, but by no means boring. SPAZ is almost completely non-linear - You can visit a lot of galaxy sectors without touching the main storyline. Gameplay reminds me of another great game ""Escape Velocity Nova"". You build ships, gather resources, research new technologies, fight against 4 game factions - Civilians, UTA, Zombies and sometimes Bounty Hunters. Built-in tutorial is all You need to learn basics of SPAZ.SPAZ features top-down 2D graphics, and I find it a big advantage - everything is nice and simple. Sounds are also good, music nicely blends into the gameplay.To sum this up - If you're a fan of space games, at least try SPAZ - it's a true gem among the genre.PROS:Nice 2D graphicsNon-linear gameplay, high replayabilityEasy to learn, difficult to masterRPG elementsLots of ships to discoverCONS:Combat can be frustrating at higher difficultiesBecomes repetitive at times			",316,59,7,56,24,3,69

												While I'm a bit late into the game of reviewing SPAZ, writing it anyway couldn't hurt. Space Pirates and Zombies is a action-strategy space shooter with elements of random generation. While you have some control over how random it is, it only serves to increase or decrease the difficulty in the long run.Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty solid. You pilot your ship around with WASD keys, and shooting your weaponry with the mouse. What makes it special if that you don't point and shoot, but the direction of your ship controls where your shots are. If you place a weapon on the front of your ship, expect it to shoot forward until the higher class ships which have rotating turret mounts that do just that. Even then, anything other than lasers will still need to lead the target, as nothing is hitscan. This makes shooting more skill based.At the same time, you have to pilot your ship to avoid incoming shots from enemy ships. This ends up leading to dog fight type scenarios where you and your opponent are dodging around each other trying to get a shot in. This is where a lot of the enjoyment of the game is, since a lot of battles will be decided on whether or not you can out-maneuver the AI, especially on higher difficulties when the enemies become too strong to kill in a head-on fight.As you kill enemies, you can pick up orbs of Data to level up and gain research points. The tech tree is nothing complex, since it is mostly just a direct % increase in damage and other stats for each weapon or ship subsystem. This is however needed, since more powerful versions of equipment are unusable until you level up that system. But before you can even  equip something, you must acquire the blueprints of each item. Naturally, higher level equipment requires more blueprints, which can be obtained by the faction bases. Either buy from them, or blow it up and loot the charred remains of the base, if you can.The Bounty Hunter system adds in some extra challenge to the mix, if you choose to allow them to spawn. Killing enemies within their territory increases the bounty on your head. Eventually, if left unchecked, the hunters will come after you in an attempt to collect that bounty. The higher your bounty, the higher the chance. You also have the chance to be extorted on the way out of one of their systems. Failure to pay and you'll need to fight them off. You'd think this would increase your bounty further, but instead gives you respect, which lowers the bounty. If the bounty falls into the negative, you start to gain respect points. This acts as a buffer before you will start accumulating a bounty, and ensures you won't be attacked until you drain all of your respect. Another way to gain respect, as well as money and Data, is to fight in arena matches set up by the hunters. As you progress, harder challenges are unlocked, each with 3 difficulties. If you want to avoid ambushes every are or two, you may want to take advantages of these arena matches. They can even be repeated for a lesser reward if you are out of fresh fights. And if you really have no other option, you can pay your bounty off yourself. As a whole, this system adds more challenge to the game, which is welcome when not playing on the highest difficulty.There's much more to gameplay, but I don't wish to drag on. So I'll end with one major flaw I found, and that mostly comes with the late game. If you fail to kill one of the smallest ships but weakened it to critical health, it will flee. For several thousand feet. If you don't switch to a small ship of your own that is just as fast, it will get away, and you'll spend minutes at a time waiting for it to come back. This becomes a huge pace breaker, and sometimes even causes you to be put in more difficult situations in the late game, when enemies can spawn just by you staying in an area for long. Maybe if they would retreat from battle, leaving the area entirely, this wouldn't be an issue.Story: The setting is that of a far future, and space travel has advanced to that of colonizing other star systems. This is mostly thanks to the currency of the game, Rez. This subtance is mined from deposits floating in space to craft vessels. In order to become rich, many set off to mining colonies to gather as much Rez as they can. Legend also has it, there is a grand deposit in the center of the universe. This deposit is what our protagonists are looking for. The only problem is getting there. Warp gates between star systems are guarded by the UTA, the police space force, essentially. Not only this, but the grand warp gates to the planets near the center are locked down tight. A nice twist comes in the zombie part of the title, which you discover upon finally reaching these center systems. I'd elaborate, but I don't wish to spoil it.Graphics: I care very little for graphics as long as they are serviceable. Meanwhile, SPAZ has great graphics. Each ship looks nice, if simple at times, and the lighting is bright and colorful.Sound: The music of the game mostly boils down to ambient noise, but there are a few tracks here or there that are enjoyable. Cutscenes are also narrated by TotalBiscuit, who does a fine enough job. Though even he says he did terribly, and it is clear enough that he could have done better if he tried. The sound effects are all well and good, meanwhile. Each weapon has its own shot sound effects, and the sounds of another ship being hit are clear to hear. But after awhile, hearing the pew pew pews of the game gets old.Overall, the game is a terrific time. It serves as a challenge when it needs to, and is just pure fun to shoot stuff in space. I'd recommend this to anyone who thinks they might enjoy this when shown any gameplay.			",55,3,0,9,1,0,4

												Space Pirates and Zombies is a good old fasioned 2D space battle and exploration game with strrong ARPG elemements. While the story is somewhat shallow, the game universe is procedurally-generated and randomised, there's plenty of area to explore and conquer, although at times, it gets to be a bit of a grind, although if you're careful, you can reduce the amount of grinding necessary by trading with civilian stations. The tutorial is actually quite good and the game will stop and show you new mechanics as they come into play. Totally worth buying, I've sunk over 235 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.			",190,28,7,35,25,1,39

												SPAZ is one of those oddball games that is just surprising. It has surprising amount of depth due to the variety of random bits and pieces it offers you. The premise is simple: you have a mothership, and it builds these tiny remote ships (of 4 different size classes) that you can take out to do things with. You start with the tiny-size and mine asteroids. Soon you'll mount attack lasers and armor and other components as you take on tougher and tougher missions while you encounter the threat to humanity... Space Zombies! Different systems have different factions (government, rebels, and bounty hunters) who have different feelings toward you! Attack, defend, ally, betray, it's all up to you. Depending on relations, some will trade, others will not. The actual game is just pretty much ""asteroids"" as you control one craft but due to different components on the ship (you outfit yourself) it can feel very differently. AI ships will fight against you or be on your side. Give fleet orders while you do your own things... it's all up to you. Don't let the 2D graphics turn you off. This game has some serious depth into it.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												Very nice surprise, had it on wishlist for a while. Got it and was shocked when I saw the download size, less than 200meg. So almost lost hope, but when I got into it the game turned out to be remarkebly in depth. lots of goals and a HUGE game system you can play with as you dominate a huge universe. Learning how to move the ships can be pretty horrid , especialy if you have sinus/equilibrium problems as the fluid movement can make you dizzy if you take things too fast..lol Highly recommend this game for it's zanny fun and in depth aspects, conquering this galaxy would give you years of play, and replay and replay again. Will most certianly be looking to get the new one when it comes  out if it stays true to this formula.And as always a plus....they took the time to make a trading card set for us Badge/card collectors. Always an extra selling point!			",424,68,5,71,85,2,150

												A great top-down space game with good combat, OK story and a decent amount of replayability.The ship customisation is key to the game, and while it isn't as free and expansive as some other space games, the amount of variety is significant and creating that ultimate ship (or fleet of ships) that mows down everything in its/their path is very satisfying.Unlocking every blueprint and reaching the highest tech levels can take a long time, so focus is generally what will be needed.The standard missions in the game, to earn reputation with the factions, currency and experience are fairly varied but eventually you'll have seen them all; however each time will have different ships which can alter the difficulty and reward you with new parts.Sometimes the random generation of the map is extremely unfair - there was a point where I had access to systems up to level 50, and the connection to systems above that (including the story objective at the time) were linked by just one system, which was level 68. It took a awhile of grinding on the lower level systems before I managed to force my way through the gate. This is a game where going up against ships 5 levels higher can be brutal, but can also be fine, depending on what the ships are given in the area by the random generation.The addition of bounty hunters gives another edge to the game, with their special challenges (which involve a specifically designed ship and not yours) based on skill, not your current progress.The game mixes it up when you reach act 3 by introducing the zombie faction, which plays against the other two factions (Civs and UTA, or 'police'). While the first two can be befriended, the zombies are always aggressive. When a zombie ship is killed, it explodes into spores and zombies, which can corrupt your ships into zombie ships. This can be devastating if they get your best ship.In the final act, act 4, the game again changes it up my adding a system control element because (story spoilers:) the zombies are now a much larger threat so the UTA and Civs now work together with you as allies. This bit feels a bit weird, but these systems now gather resources for you (rez (main currency), goons (crewmen, secondary currency) and data (experience)), which can help in the endgame area, where your ships cost significantly more, your levels take a lot of data, and you chew through goons and rez upgrading systems.In summary, good fun game, great combat, eh story, can get grindy at times and the ship customisation is great.

												I really enjoyed this game, I put a lot of hours into it, and was rewarded with an interesting story, lots to explore and heaps of combat.What I like about it is that there's unlimited fights to have and things to explore, you can just wonder around the galaxy and fight endlessly. You can see the challenge rating of each star system, so you know what you’re in for before you go there, and if you want some relaxing fun you can just pop back to an easy system and kill everything with impunity. There are lots of spaceships to discover, and lots of weapons, that will suit your playing style and dexterity.Combat is the central part of the game, you have a number of ships to field, and the AI is decent. Combat takes place on a 2D playing field, and you have a God’s eye view of the whole map, so finding things to shoot is easy. Sometimes it gets tedious racing around the combat map to reach waypoints, or protect space ships with no self-preservation instinct.However, by the time I was ¾ of the way through the game it was getting tedious. I was only driven to complete the story, I could barely tolerate entering more combat because it was becoming repetitive. I did finish the game, and I did enjoy completing the story, but I can’t see myself playing a second time**Overall, I recommended this game as a good distraction. Exploding enemy ships and capturing or shooting their crew after they eject is satisfying for a gamer like me.** Edit: It's almost 2 years since I wrote the original review, and I am playing through the campaign again. The desire to blow up spaceships is still strong!			",27,5,0,9,3,0,21

												Overall a great game.Personally, I like to play games while I drink (hey, it keeps the replayability factor up when I forget :-P), watch Netflix and BS with buddies. This game is great for that in the sense that I can step away from it while it's running and not come back to a dead toon or missed out on something extremely important. Also (bonus points) if I get a little too far gone, chances are good that I again didn't miss something that I can't look back on the log to figure out what happend. I think this game may have been made specifically for me.I love leveling up. I love keeping an eye on resources. I love the discovery aspect. I love upgrading and discovering new weapon/ship models. Oh and there's a fun storyline with multiple characters. The best part is that each one of them are friggin♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hate dainty little do-gooders when it's a universe they just wouldn't survive in. Every character I've come across in this game thus far has been such a friggin @sshole and I love it!I can't wait until SPAZ 2 comes out if it's anything like the original!Play it, or don't.

												I've played through this game several times. I originally bought it on sale through Amazon.com, long before they added the Bounty Hunters to it. I purchased my Steam version when it went on sale recently, just for the added joy of getting the achievements. I mention this to note that my hours in game are far more than my Steam account suggests.This game is actually fairly simple to play and even master. Though the graphics look awesome, they are just 2D, which makes the game run fast and smooth. The controls are easy, and the galaxy is totally customizable in terms of size and difficulty. Obviously, the game has some replayability value, since I've played all the way through at least 3 times, collecting all the tech I could find each time. For me, this is one of those games where I don't come back for a while after playing through it, but when I just want to blow something up, I can come back and be pretty close to my old skill level.Be warned: the story and writing are kind of weak. I haven't looked too hard for mods that might help improve this aspect of the game. I just wanted anyone expecting a grand space opera to be aware. The game's charm lies in the concept and ease of the controls.If the game goes on sale, I'd highly recommend it to people who like top-down, sci-fi shooters, as well as those who like RPG style build-up-my-force-as-I-go games.

 Review: Space Pirates And Zombies  SCORE: 9.0 / 10 - An Indie Masterpiece=== Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Immense variety of weapons and modules (100+) to suit any play style+ Astonishing variety of spacecrafts, from tiny fighters to massive capital ships+ Customizable galaxy: decide number of systems, tech availability, difficulty and more+ Many types of side-quests with always random enemies and objectives+ Beautiful 2D art style and effects+ Arena challenges: you get to pilot a random ship against random enemies for fame and fortune+ Unrestricted gameplay: want that upgrade but don't have the money? Blow up the trader and take it. Or die trying.+ Faction system with allies, enemies and an ever-growing bounty on your head+ Tactical map to give orders to your fleet, with customizable AI behavior and commands+ Modding supported and easy to use with a modular mod selection function+ Good story, albeit a little stereotyped+ A long journey: at least 30-35 hours on high tier difficulty levels. More if you aim for 100% everything. Lot more. - Cons - - In late game it takes a lot of rez (money) to do anything and often you will have to grind for it the long and boring way. Or let your AI ships do it while you tab the game and do something else.- Booster Modules are REALLY overpowered used in certain ship designs / weapon combinations- A particular quest in the Main Questline is borderline broken and WILL make you REALLY mad- Respec debt is way too big: whenever you respec a skill tree you get your points back, but also a debt of XP equal to all the XP it took you to make the points you refund. Basically, you have to do that XP again after refunding and redistributing those points, and it takes AGES specially start and mid game. So think REALLY WELL what you want to put your points into.===This game is brilliant. A true space exploration action with RPG elements done the RIGHT way. Fun, addictive, simple enough but not simple enough to be boring or too easy.Extraordinary gameplay mechanics, almost perfect balance, great variety of stuff to do.This is a game you have to get, leave SPAZ 2 in the shelf and get the original, the true SPAZ.

												I haven't spent much of my time playing this game, but what I have experienced I have enjoyed. With many ship types, equipment combinations, and faction choices, this game will offer you many space age hours of enjoyable gameplay. I look forward to getting further into it when I have more time to dedicate. If you can get it on sale, don't miss out on the opportunity.			",227,76,4,43,31,5,67

												This is a very well done game.Music is okay, graphics are clean, story is alright.The gameplay is where it shines.You start off pretty weak but gradually level up and earn upgrades, eventually being crazy powerful. Lots of different paths to take in regards to upgrades, weapons and play style.While it does get a little repetitive, blowing up zombies and spaceships is pretty damn fun. Very good purchase, solid game and good replayability. ",1229,376,57,122,119,15,131

												As a game inspired by Star Control, it desperately, desperately needs controller support. Instead it uses awkward mouse-aim + WASD in a top-down game, and ten hours in I haven't seen any ship or weapon that really takes advantage of that. Speaking of ships and weapons, there isn't a wild diversity in either - you pick a size of ship, decide whether you want the slightly faster one or the one with slightly more weapons, and kit it out with variations on lasers, projectiles, and homing projectiles. Bombs are basically big missiles with long cooldowns, and fighters are just missiles that fire more often. Combine this with a tech system that results in weapons/systems you don't use much being typically weaker, and the game at hour ten feels very much like the game at hour one. Point your ship at the other ship and hold down both mouse buttons.The great big open starmap looks good until you realize the only real variant from system to system is the level of enemy ships and the presence or absence of bounty hunters, which seem to exist primarily as arena locations and also as another way to slow down the player by putting bounties on their heads. The missions in a level 1 sector are the same as the ones in a level 35 sector.The in-game chatter is terribly repetitive after only a few hours, though it can be turned off.So yeah, kind of a dull game.

												At first I couldn't stand this game because the controls/ui were a little cryptic and ""home made"". But once you get past that stuff there are some really good mechanics at the core. The way the game occurs on different ""scales"" helps this space game not feel so empty (as many space games so often do).At a large-scale, you are making choices about which system to go to and juggling faction reputation to gain all-important research.At a mid-scale you are trying to build a diverse set of ships that can deal shield and hull damange.And at a small-scale you are working with positioning and ship crews to gain an edge in fights.All-around, an interesting take on the ARPG, and something you should at least consider buying.

Pros: While the graphics of the game is only 2d, it is generally very pleasing on the eyes, especially the procedurally generated backdrop of the various solar systems. You can outfit your own ships. There are multiple technology trees to choose from, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. The music and the sound of the game is good, although not outstanding. The possibility of using a different technology path, outfitting the ships in different ways and the procedurally generated galaxy gives the game significant replay value.Cons: The AI of the ships in combat are very aggressive and stupid. This is most problematic with your wingmen as they have a tendency do die a lot, so you either have to micromanage them in the tactical interface, or accept that you can easily lose 1-2 craft per mission. It can get a bit too “grindy” at times.Overall score: 8/10 ",36,32,0,4,6,0,9

												This game is great and many other reviews say so.What I want to talk about here is MODS.As you know, a game can be several times funnier (and longer lasting) with mods, and SPAZ is great modding material. On the official game forums you can find several, from small ship adjustments up to game overhauls.My personal suggestion is to get a mod to increase the size of your fleet. Not only the game gets prettier (moar lazers), but also it helps to make the endgame more interesting.			",84,16,0,13,4,0,11

 Originally posted on October 28, 2013 SPAZ reminds me why Escape Velocity excited me when I was a kid. It's an all out blast of a top down space shooter, and has a cool sense of humor as well. There are a solid variety of balanced ship types and weapons, and the faction relationships being different for each star system makes it hard to really mess up. The one complaint I had is it felt like a real grind having to build yourself back up after losing a big fight. There should be a faster way to regain resources at high level. Other than that, the game is a great. I would definitely check it out if you're into that sort of thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is brilliant. There's no other way to describe it. The sense of combat this game gives you is absolutely among the best I've ever experienced. If you're ripping the enemy a new one, you can tell. If you're getting ripped a new one, you can definitely tell.This game can be punishing too, forcing you to grind your way through certain areas, which is a bit of a downside. However, you shouldn't really face that issue unless you're playing on INSANE! and are fighting 10 tech levels above you.There's a lot more I could talk about but all in all, this game a great buy for a cheap price. As of now I've already sunk 16 hours into this game and I plan on sinking many, many more into it. 9.5/10!			",227,24,3,15,16,0,42

												An obvious labor of love, and a love letter to Star Control 2... and a leading candidate for exemplifying the necessity of polish in games. It is so mind-bogglingly dull thanks to really poor pacing and a nasty set of balance issues that I really can't recommend it at all. Supposedly it's still being worked on, and I can see modders fixing almost all the problems with the game, but right now it's just garbage. There are ideas and systems in place that could almost certainly be fun, and they simply aren't, thanks to some bad math, for the most part.As an addendum, I feel the need to point out that combat is mindless and broken. Examples: AI is brainless and employs its weapons for minimal effect, often failing to use their full complement of weaponry. Enemy AI uses a simple tactic of running away when their health is low, which can lead to endless chases if you happen to pick a slow set of ships. Your own AI is almost impossible to control precisely and loves to wander into range of enemy weapons, and shoot your allies. In a late-game mission, you are tasked with defending four generators simultaneously: attempting to do so will get them all blown up. But, if you concentrate all your ships at one generator, the enemy completely ignores the other three. The list goes on. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IN THIS STATE.			",759,224,23,90,104,9,146

												If you have fond memories of playing Subspace back in the day, but always wished the game had a single-player mode, SPAZ is the game for you.A top-down shooter, your ships handle like the one from Asteroids, with thrust and momentum affecting your crafts as they goes flying across the battlefield. You have an entire squadron at your disposal, but can only directly control a single ship at a time. The others are handled by the AI, but you can and you swap between ships with the press of the button. Each ship can be upgraded or swapped out for different ones better suited to the challenges at hand.Instead of flags and bases, the game pits your squadron against varieties of enemy ships. Your squadron jumps from system to system in the galaxy, mining for resources to upgrade your ships while completing different missions. There isn't too much variety in the gameplay, with most of the missions boiling down to ""blow up everything that isn't yours."" There is a story, too, but it is pretty thin.I got a kick out of the game, mostly for the nostalgia of playing something similar to Subspace. The lack of variety and paper-thin story hurt the game, and give little reason to grind your way to finish. But for the price, it's fun while it lasts, and I'm hoping for a sequel or add-on that fleshes out the core gameplay further.			",89,23,1,10,4,1,25

												This is an extremely open ended game, and while the core systems are established early and relatively easy to pick up, there is alot of depth and agency in exactly how you chosoe to navigate through the game. That being said, it is most definitely an RPG, and while the game will never stop you from trying, there are plenty of times when you just aren't tuff enuf for what you are going after just yet.I find this game incredibly soothing, just drifting from one system to the next doing randomized event, blueprints for new tech, weapons and ships trickle in at a constant rate, and you have huge freedom when generating your game when it comes to difficulty, the size of the galaxy, and even the pace of the progression by way of blueprint rarity and the spawn rate of bounty hunters, long and short, its a randomized, extremely streamlined meditative romp through space that operates on the very specific terms you decide.As with the rest of the game, the combat is simple but hugely satisfying, there is just the perfect level of depth to combat systems when it comes to things like the difference between shields, armor and hull, as well as what sort of weapons work best against them, and the presence of multiple hangers and AI controlled ships (whatever ship you aren't using the game takes over for you) means you can create very specialized fleets to address problems the way you want to.As for minor gripes, the game can get a little repetitive, as with the exception of some quests that inject interesting litle subplots (some of the side quests are also insanely funny, the whole game has an air of dark humor to it), you will mostly spend countless hours just knocking over one system to the next, farming research levels and either grinding relations or flat out nuking NPC bases to get their blueprints, and beyond that formula the game doesn't change itself up much from start to finish.Last point, and this is super subjective, but I personally felt that the default hanger slots, as well as the max ship size allowed for each hanger is far too conservative, even with the higher teir mothership in the later game they just don't give you enough ships and size to really flesh out the satisfaction of leading a squad of ships of your own making. Thankfully there are multiple developer sanctioned mods that increase hanger slots and size relative to the rank of the mothership that can be used to solve this if you feel the same way I did,  http://www.minmax-games.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3108 being the one I choose to use. Be adviced that in the case of this paticular mod, it only modifies the hangars and nothing else, which means that other than potentially losing some AI ships faster (Cus you have more of them) and thus burning rez to rebuild them, it does not rebalance the difficulty of the game at all, so keep that in mind when deciding on the difficulty settings.All in all, fantastic game if you are looking for a progression based experience to mellow out and sink countless hours into.

												I have been playing this game for quite some time. It may get a little repetetive but still fun. Hunting for blueprints might be boring for a while but in the end I was blowing up bases whenever I wanted something. The only problem I have with the game is that some weapon types clearly outclass others in the long run so trying out new weapon loads may turn out to be handicapped runs.

												SPAZ (Space Pirates and Zombies) is my lastest game addiction. With well over 100 hours played I am still kind of sad to have finished. It is a nifty space shooter/strategy game with witty banter, shiny lasers and purple zombieplague foes. While it can be a little repetitive (if you mess up a mission and lose resources it can be a grind to get them back), certain dynamics alter throughout the story, changing things up enough that it never gets dull.I would like (in an ideal world) to have more variety of species or zones in the galaxy - there seem to be no other life forms around, apart from us. The warring human factions and the added Bounty Hunters are interesting (the Bounty Hunters always turning up when I am already in a struggle), but it feels a bit lonely being the only sentient species out there.Despite these niggles I had a great amount of fun with SPAZ. It is uncomplicated, with an easy learning curve and is quite nice to look at... generally just good pew-pew-laser-shooty fun.			",35,20,0,6,11,0,12

												This is a great game. Deffinately worth the normal $10.00, or the current $2.50 sale price. This game was developed by two guys over the course of a few years. That said, it's difficult to tell it had such a small team because this game is pretty well polished. The only giveaway is the voice-overs. They sound as though they were recorded by friends, family members, and the developers themselves. This doesn't detract from the game, it just brings the player closer to the developers and gives him/her a sence that they are contributing to the lives of these men while they enrich ours through this game.The gameplay is pretty solid with an easy to use upgrade system, navigation system and customization system.

												There are those indie games that truly captivate your attention and keep you engaged for hours on end, and you know it's a gem when you find yourself spending the whole evening mining, collecting, running and blasting your way through zombie space. MiniMax Game's Space Pirates and Zombies was developed by two blokes in Canada and boy, for two guys this game sure does outstand in the indie pool. You start out as a little 4-hardpoint ship, just plunderin' the good plunder. As you progress through the story you'll find out something crazy has stirred up at the centre of the universe. Something that allows flesh eating monstrosities to biologically enhance and drive their own ships, despite being mindless husks. The story has an enormous gravity to it; as the plot progresses, your fleet of AI-controlled ships, blueprints, hull types, weapon types, subsystem effectiveness, mining ability and the like go on the up as well. Doing this makes the player feel the gravity of the situation: there's a huge threat of space zombies capable of surviving without oxyen floating about at the center of the universe and you're going to need all the help you can get.I suppose the reason why I find this game so enjoyable is an amalgamation of perfect game dynamics; the tactical RTS-like command of your own ship, with a main player-controlled ship and up to 4 other AI controlled ships, all of which are available for the player to directly take control of any time during flight. Missions are undertaken for either the civillians of a star system or the UTA - the universe's private military force, and doing favours for one faction often angers the other. The ever expansive tech tree is a delight, as well - research data, the space equivalent of experience points become increasingly important to get that rank of weaponary, subsystem, engines, or armour that you know you're going to need at the current system. As time seems to go forward when you jump from planet to planet and star to star, the players get used to planning a route according to a star systems ecosysem, 'difficulty' (measured in civillian or UTA strength) and managability. With the addition of vicious money-hungry bounty hunters to the mix, I've never enjoyed any space-sim-top-down-physics-based-shooter as I have with this. I've found myself dedicating chunks of my gaming sessions to mining, exploring, trading, or fighting in this game. And when you finally get all the blueprints, all the ship hulls, and high-tier tech skill upgrades,  you're still finding yourself having a blast dealing with pesky space zombies. In a nutshell, I haven't quite experianced any game like this but I can sum it up into two expressions: YARR and BRAINS.			",160,37,0,12,6,0,13

												It's a 2D top-down level-based space ship shoot 'em up where you manage a small fleet of enhancable ships.It is also amazing.There's a solid storyline, even though you're rather free to ignore it, and you can always just jump on and explore a corner of the galaxy you haven't been to yet.A long and deep game, which for me is great but might put other people off a bit (don't expect to run through this in a weekend).

												Amazing game. Nice graphics, tight controls, even the story is pretty good. But the best part, it's a carrier-full of fun!It's not all perfect, balance seems a bit wacky. Some weapon systems do not seem to be as good as others (cannons are amazing, drones not so much for example). But it's still a lot of fun. Definitely recommended if you like like space games, but get motion sickness with 3D games (I do). So this is perfect for me.The devs did a really good job with this. Amazing what 2 people can accomplish.			",24,7,0,18,4,0,14

												A MUST BUY. EXTREMELY GOOD GAME.An awesome 2D top-down space shooting and exploring game, well balanced, with a strong if a bit predictable and cliched main plot. Delivers an extremely satisfying experience in combat, has a light design-your-own-spaceship element - you choose a weapon layout for pre-determined hulls with some ability to modify the bahaviour and handling of your ships - which is excellently done and delivers a ton of fun.All the elements of the game are extremely well done, polished and provide a ton of fun and relaxing space shooting experience. Highly recommended. Probably the best 2d top-down exploration-style shooter ever created.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SPAZ is a hidden gem in my book, I have played this game more than evey other game in my libary (which includes some 60 dolar games). THe replay-ability is extremely high becuase the uniqueness of every ship makes you want to unlock them all especially the later tiers of ships. The randomness of each system ensure that every place to warp to is a surprise. The zombie mechnic(although implemented much later into the game) provided a rush of fresh air (lol) so far into the game that grinding through systems to the center became tiring. The highe level ships are very impressive, providing yet another reason to finish the game. One of the most fun times i have had with this game was when i traveled back to the first couple systems, with fully upgraded war shi[s and absoluting dominating all of the ships/stations that gave me grief at the begining of the game.There are many features that I still have not mentioned, but I will spare you them for the sake of both our mornings/afternoons/nights. I cannot stress how amazing this game is, if a could rate it it would definitly be 10/10. Keep it up MinMax games!			",75,9,0,10,8,0,9

												Highly recommended.This is easily one of the best games I have played in years.Althought it does not have the fancy 3D near human modern graphics that most ""players"" want in today's games, I find it far more preferable to those.The game plays exactly as advertised, like the old Star Control games.You are a small band trying to find the magic pot of gold at the center of the universe and travel along the universe, up to 300 systems, fighting and exploring and building up your fleet.The beauty of this game is there is no right or wrong way to play it.  You jump into a system and if you feel like fighting you can or you can dock at a station and bribe the guards.  You can fight one side in a map then jump into the next one and be that sides friends.  Or you can fight both sides if you feel like it.There is enough variety in the ship classes and equipment to keep it interesting for many games yet to come.  Also, the maps are randomly generated each time so no 2 games will ever play the same.What makes this game truly awesome is it was made by 2 people who loved the product and were not out to make a quick buck at the players expense.I can not wait for SPAZ2 to come out later.  I hope I will be the first one to buy that one.!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think the name SPAZ actually make the game seem less than it actually is. The zombie aspect of the game is more like Homeworld Cataclysm than another dumb zombie shooter game. The game itself is very solid and to a point very satisfying with all the ship customization and upgrades available to the player. The little downside is, in my opinion, that it drags on a bit towards the end of the game and tends to be quite repetetive. Nevertheless, I recommend it to anyone who likes solid sci-fi games and doesn't necessarily want all the drama and weight of a AAA title.			",118,19,3,29,11,1,33

												I have to admit, this game is extremly addicting to me, i am not 100% sure why. Its a bit like the Torchlight of space games, you collect and fight and go just on for the next level - again and again.It gets a bit repetitive after you have explored a good part of the galaxy and you have seen most of the missions, but still its fun for me, after more than 20 hours. Well worth the price from a play time / price perspective. And I havent even seen any zombies yet... so theres more of the story still for me =)There is a Storyline to follow and side missions, some funny ones too. You have alot of technologies and shiptypes to discover, different tactics you can try out, and the graphics are pretty and colourfull.I also played the beta before it was on steam, it allready has improved alot since that version and the Developers want to deliver even more content. You can register this game on steam wherever you have bought it, thats also great.If you dont have it allready - get it!			",3872,1555,168,489,657,65,667

												SPaZ is kind of a throwback.  Flying 2D spaceships and accepting missions is a lot of fun, and I have fond memories of other games of this type.  This one, though, feels a little lacking in some areas.  You get a decent variety of ships and weapons, plus a tech tree to spend your upgrade points on as you level up.  There's a big galaxy map, except that all the systems feel kind of the same.  There's only 4 factions (military, civs, and bounty hunters, plus the titular zombies that come in later on).  Oh, and your reputation with 2 of these factions, instead of being global, is system-by-system, and randomly determined.  So, you could hop into a new area wanting to do business with one of them, only to find out they hate your guts, and you'd have to take missions for them (or bribe them) in order to turn that around.  There are plenty of randomly generated missions to undertake, but aside from a few plot-related side missions these are all repeatable and repetitious.  The main obstacles standing in your way are the warp gate blockades, preset enemies you have to fight to proceed to the next system, so a lot of what you're doing is just knocking these guys down to get from A to B.  Sometimes you have to train up and get more resources to take on a tough outpost, but other than that..  The big draw here is the combat, and customizing your ships, outfits, and tech the way you want them.If you like 2-D spaceship-flying games, this'll be right up your alley.  If not, there isn't a whole lot here that'll change your mind.			",42,8,0,5,6,0,11

It is a steal, complete steal.Also, mods.Also, sequel is coming...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For some reason this game really clicked with me. Top down 4xish space shooter. Think Star Control 2 or Starscape (maybe even Solar Winds?).  It has a nice just one more go feeling. Plus hard to get stuck in a corner, you can always fall back to earlier systems to build up your fleet again. It does get a bit grindy though.			",375,160,8,53,29,2,49

												SPaZ is kind of a throwback.  Flying 2D spaceships and accepting missions is a lot of fun, and I have fond memories of other games of this type.  This one, though, feels a little lacking in some areas.  You get a decent variety of ships and weapons, plus a tech tree to spend your upgrade points on as you level up.  There's a big galaxy map, except that all the systems feel kind of the same.  There's only 4 factions (military, civs, and bounty hunters, plus the titular zombies that come in later on).  Oh, and your reputation with 2 of these factions, instead of being global, is system-by-system, and randomly determined.  So, you could hop into a new area wanting to do business with one of them, only to find out they hate your guts, and you'd have to take missions for them (or bribe them) in order to turn that around.  There are plenty of randomly generated missions to undertake, but aside from a few plot-related side missions these are all repeatable and repetitious.  The main obstacles standing in your way are the warp gate blockades, preset enemies you have to fight to proceed to the next system, so a lot of what you're doing is just knocking these guys down to get from A to B.  Sometimes you have to train up and get more resources to take on a tough outpost, but other than that..  The big draw here is the combat, and customizing your ships, outfits, and tech the way you want them.If you like 2-D spaceship-flying games, this'll be right up your alley.  If not, there isn't a whole lot here that'll change your mind.			",42,8,0,5,6,0,11

												Space Pirates and Zombies is addicting, funny, and exciting. The game was made by a small team of independant developers which did a wonderful job with SPAZ and this game definately has a lot of content for your money.  When I was first playing the game, I often found myself saying, ""WHAT IS THAT?!"" because some new giant ship had decided to turn its weapons against me. Thinking back, this game produces a nostalga now and again which brings me to play it even after beating it multiple times. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, sci fi, rockets, lasers, and strategy. I only have one problem with this game, that being its lack of multiplayer capabilities, but if you get passed that it is definately worth a buy.			",141,28,3,19,16,1,25

												Now this, ladies and gentlemen, is a piece of work.It's got an interesting storyline that surprises you with not exactly plot twists- but... surprises. I was using some awfully small ships when I encountered a group of extremely large enemies coincidentally sitting right where an object I need to grab is. I was told to take them out. With difficulty I finished the job.Now, that may seems insane, but when you learn how the CPU ships are going to try to attack you, you'll set your ships to different modes to make use of their evasive moves and such.This game is great, there is a ton to do, from persuading people you're on their side to blowing up bases. Before you know it, you'll have played so much (if you like it as much as me and my friends do) you'll go from taking out a weak Dart ship to blowing up Lvl 3 Bounty Hunter Bases. There's always somewhere to go to upgrade your gear or to open warp gates and such.Fun game. 9/10			",196,38,5,20,16,3,17

You can buy a fast ship and go in reverse while disintigrating your enemy or buy a large torpedo ship and stealth bomb. It has a good upgrade system, not complicated.

You have farming for currency, scavenging ruined ships, the level of 'customisable tech advantages' you can put into play is astonishing and the micro-management of your little fleet is a lot of fun!I have played this game for a while and after struggling, cursing, inventing new curses to use and then giving up and reverting to just wordlessly shouting at my screen; Acheived every achievement (dat arena... aw man...)It was a labour of love and at no point did I think something was missing.the designs of the ships you can unlock are all unique and can be used differently and by picking them carefully, you can customise your 'fleet' for any occasion (other than dating...

												I spent a few hours on the demo version of this game before purchasing the full version. I am completely in love. It's simple, yet complex in it's own ways. I love the variety of ship hulls and weapons to choose from, as well as the side missions and factor relationship system, not to mention the art style. Not only that, this game will never play the same way twice. I am very much looking forward to SPAZ 2, and I would most certainly recommend this game. 10/10, would buy again.			",58,1,0,5,2,0,1

												A great game which combines 2D with modern graphic capabilities. A vast gameplay that allows players to customize their play style, explore the unknown, enhance your spaceship arsenal, get involved in the factions evolved and enjoy the humorous storyline of the game. Spaceship models are well designed, weapons and modules too. And all the above have been developed by two people who happen to love such games and put a great effort into this game.

												If there is one word to describe SPAZ, it would be ""ambitious"". If there are two words, they would be ""over ambitious"". It has all the parts needed to make a grand space adventure but ultimatly the various systems are not deep enough to support this. The game is divided into two parts.The strategy part has you designing ships, plotting a course around the galaxy and managing relationships between three factions. But those relationships carry only over between systems for one of the factions so there's no long term planning in relationship building. And those relationships can be turned very easily so ticking someone off only takes 1 or 2 missions to fix. The one faction that does perist relationships is only ever hostile towards you so your interactions are limited. The ship design system is deep enough but it requires way too much farming. Advanced ship designs require several blueprints which can only be obtained by destoring enemy (or friendly) versions the ship. Advanced weapons also require several blueprints which can be bought or stolen from the faction bases. On top of all that, the weapons can only be used if you reach a certain tech level which again means more farming.The second part of the game is the tactical action combat. This part has you commanding your ships and piloting one of those ships in space battles. This is where you use the ships you grinded for. Ships handle differently and learing to lead your shots and manage your momentum is key to success in this section of the game. However, because of the slow build of new ships and weapons many battles are the same.But despite all the negatives, it is possible to loss yourself in the universe and just enjoy the ride. It's a fairly cheap game and is often on sale.			",353,113,6,60,40,4,72

												This game is one of those ""one last turn"" games. It's very easy to wind up sinking entire weekends into this game. The gameplay and content are good. The pool of voice acting is a little small, so you will often think ""didn't I hear that ten minutes ago?""However, I often found that I needed to grind in order to progress, and the difficulty follows a more stepped scheme, rather than a curve. This means that the beginning of an area will be overly hard and the end will be overly easy. It never really feels like it's at the right difficulty level. Overall though, it's fun and worth the price.			",140,24,0,6,6,0,9

												I haven't completed the story mode yet (only 21 hours into it so far and I haven't even started fighting zombies yet), but I can already say the game is definitely worth buying.While the story feels a bit cheap in places though sometimes interesting, dialogues feel childish a lot of the times, Total Biscuit admitting to being a bad narator for this particular game (though I can't say he was terrible at it), and the enemy flying away preventing you from killing them is really annoying making a simple small battle take forever to complete (usually resulting in you changing ships just so you can keep up with it and kill it), and among other little flaws the game has... it's a great game. Where this game really shines is the gameplay itself. You can try out a lot of different ships, which they do actually feel like different ships with completely different hardpoints and options. Some ppl think the balance is a little off, but I disagree for the most part, losing ships once in a while is to be expected which is why you have resources to make more in the first place, plus, if you stay in the ""green"" leveled areas (or yellow if skilled), you never have to worry about being overpowered by stronger enemies. I also like the fact that the more skilled of a player you are, the more chances you can take by going in the more difficult areas of the world (so you can either take your time and not have much difficulty or you can go hardcore on it and fight enemies way stronger than you and complete the game much faster).Even at full price, I highly recommend this to anyone who is into this kind of game.

Tons of missions and side missions in a huuuuuge galaxy that you explore at your own leisure.For a two man indie company to produce such a fine game, it renews my faith that the little guys can compete with the big development giants, but just on a different level.I was almost choked up when in the opening screen the developers leave a very personal message thanking you for buying it.I will be playing this game for a very long time.Bravo MinMax!and to everyone elseBUY THIS GAME!!!!

												Space Pirates and Zombies is a point and click adventure game in the vein of Lucasarts classics such as Monkey Island, as well as Sierra classics such as Leisure Suit Larry and Police Quest. It tells the unlikely and comedic romatic tale of Space Pirates Falling in love with Zombies, and their misadventures as they try to make it work. With the Bounty Hunters addition, it turns into a love triangle and will tear at the strings of your heart. Youll laugh, youll cry, the writing is exceptional throughout the twists and turns of the story. Overall this game is a fantasic release from a studio run by just two gentlemen for a knack for releasing heartwarming adventure games. I look forward to their future releases. 8/10.

The artwork is nice to look at (other then the character portraits, which are comically bad to look at), and the writing isn't terrible. As far as combat goes it plays great! Being able to have multiple ships flying with you that have decent AI is a wonderful thing.			",255,41,0,50,16,1,37

												SPAZ is yet another game that the screenshots and trailers do no justice. The game was made by only two people.The universe you are set in is randomly generated and has a small amount of customization in size. The smaller the universe, the harder the difficulty between each galaxy. The bigger the universe, the longer the overall game and the more stretched out resources are. The game tells you not to do your first playthrough on the hardest difficulty. I immediately went and ignored this because I love a good challenge.And boy does SPAZ deliver. You have up to three of your own ships in play at once. You can manually control one of the three ships at any time and the AI will take over the other two. The combat can go beyond mindlessly killing at times in the harder difficulties and thought is needed to plan out what you are going to do. Getting a game over is rare but progression is also challenging.Good for casual and hardcore players. I'd write more but I've run out of room.			",514,34,8,48,27,1,64

												It's a no for recommend, even though I've enjoyed the game. The end game is wretched. When I say wretched, I mean it is nothing short of a chore.  ""Hunting"" down the infected aliens is less of a hunt, and more of a mindless chase. They run the opposite direction at speeds near yours, only they'll be at distances like 30,000+ . . . The goal is to ""clean up"" a system, or you're labeled as a ♥♥♥♥♥ for not completing the mission. The problem is the real ♥♥♥♥♥ is the coders that can't think of a decent combat. The combat will be over, long over, like ages  . . . and ages  . . . and ages over, yet another stupid tiny infected alien will spawn on the other side of the system. At this point, the only thing you can do is turn around, and have a mindless wait as you drag your ship slowly across the ""system"" (a needlessly large grid) to get to the point where you easily pop the tiny ship.There are great battles, don't get me wrong, it's the hell that is mis-labled at the game that gets my ""No"" for recommend.On top of the lame ""zit popping"" adventure, there is a new element added to the targeting system, where the turrets refuse to aim toward anything you are choosing to shoot at. Something went horribly wrong with an update, and I seriously doubt it will ever be fixed.			",123,20,0,20,27,1,22

												There's lots to enjoy about this game apart from the gameplay.Every system appears to be the same. Blast through endless (literally, infinitely spawning missions) of dull ships by shooting at them with your [weapon choice], fly through the debris and hoover up exp and money and crew members.I honestly don't see why I even have to be at the computer. The AI could be taking care of this with a ""go to enemy and fire fire fire"" routine... and in fact that's exactly what my AI teammates do.That I would rather have this game running without playing it shows that it's not enjoyable to play, just to level up and find out the next % increase on my laser beam length.

With a name that includes the word Zombies, I passed on the game originally, but it's quietly short-listed its way into my heart, and onto my top 5 indie games of the year.

												SPAZ ( and bounty hunters ) is a very good game . The 2 d style works wonderfully , its a verry colourfull game, the planets in the background make you want to visit them . The story is captivating though to advance you have to get to higher levels so you will be able to do the missions , since if you didn t grind you get overpowered by the enemy fast , and the grinding takes too long . Even so you have a lot to do : upgrading ships , destroying ships to take black boxes for more blueprints to have more ship models. ",66,6,0,4,2,0,12

												SPAZ is one of my top 3 games, only second to Borderlands 2. Don't let its silly name and kinda weird storyline decieve you. SPAZ's simple 2D top down style and insane amount of customization will keep you entertained for months. Installing a mod is easy, and creating your own is just as easy but even more satisfying, because even the smallest changes can completely change gameplay style giving it an amazing replay factor. Aside from the gameplay, the dialogue is hilarious, and side story missions are very rewarding when it comes to stat bonuses. Speaking of stat bonuses, SPAZ's uniquely simple research system can make all the difference in life and death situations. If I could change any one thing about this game, I would make it more popular. Why? Because the TWO developers (yes, ONLY TWO PEOPLE MADE THIS!) deserve more credit and support than they are currently getting. Fore what it's worth, on a scale of one to ten, I give this a nine.

												Quite an amazing little game, came to fruitition by just 2 developers in a timespan of almost 2 years.S.P.A.Z. is a must play for anyone who likes space combat as it was seen in the older days. S.P.A.Z. succesfully incorporates a simpe but effective levelling up system, organic space combat and quite a nice plot, in a visually amazing game.After putting nearly 60 hours in this game after only paying about a dollar for it on the Humble Bundle, I realized that this was a game i just have bought a very long time ago. Cheers to MinMax Games for an amazing experience!			",255,46,3,41,60,2,72

												Top-down space-shooting RPG action!The sense of progression here is really great. Unlocking new upgrades for your ships is really rewarding, and there's plenty of challenge to be had using alternative weapon setups and attacking hardened enemy blockades. A long list of different upgrades and hull designs keep you configuring new and interesting loadouts for a good long time.It's lengthy, free-roam, and very intutive. Excellent controls and performance, definitely a steam classic.[I did most of my playing before STEAM tracked it.]			",159,24,5,23,25,0,21

												This game is a treat if you like to nerd out by customizing your in-game toys. I recommend playing on a fairly challenging difficulty and playing a very large game (as in, the largest). I powered through a small, not-too-challenging game and then could not stomach a second go at it and I am sad because of it.The often requested feature of multi-player support would make this a true gem of a game. I would spend endless hours playing this with friends were that made a reality.As it is, tweaking out the ever growing ships and dialing them in exactly to your preferred methods of destruction is a great treat. Playing with ""unorthodox"" load-outs can be a game in itself and the game on a whole is being continually expanded upon and improved by a couple of independent developers.All in all a great game and absolutely worth owning, there just is not much more to say about it!

The graphics are very neat for a 2D game, there's humor and lots of finetuning options for your ships. High replayability and easy to start up and play for a short while and on the other hand you can also completely forget about time playing this game.

Explore a randomly generated galaxy while building and customizing your fleet of ships. Collect blueprints to widen your available equipment and pour research into tech trees to make your fleet more effective. The game can get a little repetitive, friendly AI seems to suck often, and the difficulty can seem like a roller coaster sometimes.

												A little mundane at first; there's a lot of information to be conveyed (not information overload, but it pays to read the tutorial screens). The progression of weapons, armor, shields, ship types, and much more keep you playing till the end. Then, in my case starting over on a harder difficulty. There's a lot to like here; the one thing that's a little hard to get used to is the controls are relative to your ship, and not to the screen. I suspect it would have been too easy if they were relative to the screen, but finding that perfect balance of cargo hold, crew capacity and firepower at any given time is great fun.

												Over all, this is one of my favorite games on steam. I was very surprised to see how much fun it all would be and I totally recommend giving it a try and if it goes on sell, you likely can't go wrong picking up a copy.S.P.A.Z. reminds me a whole lot of one of my fav games of all time, EscapeVelocity. I remember playing EV on our Mac years and years ago. It left such a good impression that I watched the companies website like a hawk for almost a decade for signs of windows development, and promptly bought a copy.There isn't any market trading in SPAZ, it's all about the combat and ship upgrades. And it's incredibly satisfying to finally unlock that next high capacity ship and beef up your little squadron and go tearing through hostile territories. I was delaying what I thought would complete the game, and then I finally went forward with the quest and realized that a whole new world of gameplay opens up toward the end of the game. It feels a little more tedious than the rest of the game, but still something I will go back and play quite often it was so much fun. The visuals are great, simple sprites unleashing very pretty particles of destruction all in front of really beautiful galactical backdrops. The music is more ambient and moody than pulse pumping ""ReallyBigSky"" type stuff but it fits the situation very well.There were a few mechanics that are sticking points because of how vaguely they're explained (if at all) and I played a great deal of the game blindly before I realized that mousing over systems would show me the info I wanted to know about them in a popup window (what type of exchange I can do there, and how much of that exchange I can do) without having to warp to each and every system and just trial-and-error it all out. So a word to the wise, watch those popup highlights change, they contain lots of time-saving info.			",245,49,20,30,41,5,60

												Note: This review might be biased as I am a huge fan of the 2D space combat genreOh my god do I love this game...even with over 70 hours (Edit: Now over 100 hours! Weee!) invested into it there are still high replayability, and that's some of the most engaging 100 hours I've had from start to end, just for the cheap price of 10USD. Amazing, simply amazing.The Pros-CustomizationWith 5 tiers (tiny, small, medium, large, huge) of ships (43 official ships in total, but there are mods that add in even more ships), each with a wide variety of slots to put different kinds of modules (weapons, boosters, subsystems etc.) as well as armor plates, shields/cloaks and reactors. The tech tree has 15 categories to invest into up to 10 times each, which is also nice. You can easily shape your fleet into killing machines with powers matched only by gluing 3 death stars together (or small cloaked dodgey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if you so desire).-ReplayabilityEach galaxy is randomly generated with multiple options and difficulty settings to further refresh your experience each run. The abundant amount of research also allows you to spec into another weapon type in the next run, allowing experimentation.-Reasonably Priced-Multiple Save Files and Autosaving-Modding-friendlyThe Cons-AIThe AI in this game will definitely not impress you. Even on the highest difficulty (insane) enemy AI behaviours don't deviate much from their normal cousins (they are, however, significantly more deadly.) The worst offender in this category is the friendly AI, as they are going to be your major source of fustration in the game, especially on higher difficulty settings. The commands you can give them aren't much either, but sufficient.-Death ScreamWhile thankfully, only your own units performs death screams occasionally when they die, the default death screams in this game are ear-shatteringly loud, and almost made my heart stop the first few times. You can counter this by sliding the unit chatter slide bar all the way to the left, while keeping most other sounds intact.-GlitchesWhile highly infrequent and never game-breaking, the game is also not well-polished enough, and glitches and bugs do pop in at times. Thankfully all I've encountered so far can be resolved by restarting the mission or reloading a save.Everything else (plot, music, art, graphics etc.) are relatively okay.ConclusionI highly recommend this game to fans of the genre, it is simply a masterpiece at its core with a few rough edges sold at an alluring price.

												A fun top down space adventure survival game. Run missions and and engage in piracy on a quest to the galactic core researching, salvaging, and stealing technology and ship types all along the way. It is great fun to tweak and optimize ship combinations and weapon loadouts, as well as dump excess crew into the void of space when the ""zombies"" breach your hull.			",421,97,1,56,36,3,60

												Space pirates and zombies contains just what it sais on the package. You play as a space pirate and venture into danger. The gameplay feels nice and if you are playing on a low difficculty and huge galaxy the difficulty is not raising too much.If that is too boring then there are still some higher difficulties and some nice bounty hunter challenges.Certainly one of my favourite games of all times.

												So, I""ve got lots of very expensive big budget games in my little library. This little indie game is much better, and played far more often then many of them. It puts you in command of a little squad of ships, one of which you control directly. You hop around from system to system doing jobs for factions and trying to upgrade you ships. The ships are very configurable, and there are quite a few of them to play around with. All of this is very addictive. I've blinked and realised a couple of hours have flown by while I've been hopping accross the galaxy looking for that next level reactor part, or missle launcher, or new hull. The size of the galaxy is configured at the start of the game, and a huge galaxy is really huge. Looking back at that statement, it sounds funny, but it's true :). If you find the whole zombie craze very tired (like myself), don't be put off by the fact that it's in the title of this game. The zombies aren't really a ""more brains"" kind of thing, but more like the reavers in the movie Serenity.I've gotten a lot of value out of this game. I really don't think you can go wrong if you decide to pick it up. Oh, and they're working on spaz 2 right now. Yay :). ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm enjoying the heck out of this game. It's top-down 2D space combat primarily, with some exploration and slight RPG-ish aspects. The game features pretty good AI, has lots of outstanding ship customization options, a fun story, and it's got a pretty small hard drive footprint. SPAZ can get somewhat repetitive if you generate a large galaxy to explore, but a big galaxy also allows you plenty of areas to grind for levels or items to beat down a story mission or particular system. I've had a great time setting up my fleet for different play styles, such as all cargo/mining, area exploration, stealth, and having many many different enemy abuse options. There's a whole lot of trade-off going on with more advanced items not necessarily being automatically better in all circumstances, which I like very much. On top of all this goodness, there are zombies. Space zombies. So love/hate toward them. Check SPAZ out, it's a good one!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You get to micromanage every hard point of every ship you control.  Researching new toys is based on XP which you gain by blowing things up and winning missions.  Enemy forces are constantly pushing back and retaking territory, opening up new missions which are dynamically created and never exhausted.

												A little mundane at first; there's a lot of information to be conveyed (not information overload, but it pays to read the tutorial screens). The progression of weapons, armor, shields, ship types, and much more keep you playing till the end. Then, in my case starting over on a harder difficulty. There's a lot to like here; the one thing that's a little hard to get used to is the controls are relative to your ship, and not to the screen. I suspect it would have been too easy if they were relative to the screen, but finding that perfect balance of cargo hold, crew capacity and firepower at any given time is great fun.

												SPAZ is yet another game that the screenshots and trailers do no justice. The game was made by only two people.The universe you are set in is randomly generated and has a small amount of customization in size. The smaller the universe, the harder the difficulty between each galaxy. The bigger the universe, the longer the overall game and the more stretched out resources are. The game tells you not to do your first playthrough on the hardest difficulty. I immediately went and ignored this because I love a good challenge.And boy does SPAZ deliver. You have up to three of your own ships in play at once. You can manually control one of the three ships at any time and the AI will take over the other two. The combat can go beyond mindlessly killing at times in the harder difficulties and thought is needed to plan out what you are going to do. Getting a game over is rare but progression is also challenging.Good for casual and hardcore players. I'd write more but I've run out of room.			",514,34,8,48,27,1,64

												This game is a treat if you like to nerd out by customizing your in-game toys. I recommend playing on a fairly challenging difficulty and playing a very large game (as in, the largest). I powered through a small, not-too-challenging game and then could not stomach a second go at it and I am sad because of it.The often requested feature of multi-player support would make this a true gem of a game. I would spend endless hours playing this with friends were that made a reality.As it is, tweaking out the ever growing ships and dialing them in exactly to your preferred methods of destruction is a great treat. Playing with ""unorthodox"" load-outs can be a game in itself and the game on a whole is being continually expanded upon and improved by a couple of independent developers.All in all a great game and absolutely worth owning, there just is not much more to say about it!

												I would recommend this game for fans of the genre. It's not for everyone, but definitely a pearl of it's kind. A huge galaxy, a lot of ships with even more modules to customize.The story line is OK. It makes sense in the sense that it carriers th games progression, but it wasn't engaging enough to get me back to playing. What got me back was the urge to finally explore all systems, find all blueprints, max my stats and kick zombie♥♥♥♥♥The game has it's downsides, of course. For example the huge galaxy in the standard setting. While it forces you to engage in fight so you level up, you just visit most systems once while passing through. The weapons aren't balanced, some types are rather weak even when upgraded all the way. Weapons also have a fire rate cap, so more weapons will not always result in moe DPS. I also would have wished for a way to change the control from relative to absolute but after a couple of hours I adapted quite well.Overall a ""good"" game which has it's downsides but still manages to bring a fresh wind to the genre!

But I'm not that good at english to describe all the fun and joy I had playing SPAZ.I really recommend you folks to try Space Pirates And Zombies, old-school gamers and Space Control II fans will not be dissappointed, I'm sure.

												Great mix of dogfighting action and strategy, with RPG elements and a fair amount of flexibility without being overwhelming. The ""fleet"" of ships you pilot is greatly overstated though.

												Simple, easy-game to learn how to play that is engaging, thrilling, and full of plenty of explosions.  You could call it a simple, mindless shooter, however the way the developers present the story-line, different quests and plenty of gear-ships to experiment with, I would give it more credit than a simple shooter.PS: cannot wait for SPAZ 2 (please have workshop)			",66,4,0,12,13,0,38

												One of the nicest indie game I've ever played. You destroy ship to get XP and ressources to buy bigger, better ships to be able to destroy more ships. Each planetary system has 2 factions, and you can choose one faction or the other in each system. Later in the game, you can destroy some zombie ships, and it gives a little more challenge to the game. There is even bounty hunters that are not part of any factions and that can hunt you down if the bounty on your head is big enough.There is one big problem in this game : there is a time when you need to grind a lot. I've played 24 hours and I still haven't finished the game because I need to grind the XP and the ressources to go further in the game.It's truly a good game and I had a lot of fun playing it but it takes a lot of time to finish.

												Great game. Top down two dimensional view arcade-y space sim-lite. A mouthful! Side with the UTA (the established military forces) or the civilians of countless star systems while keeping safe from zombies and bounty hunters in your quest to the core of the universe. Power up your ships, find blueprints and build new ones, customize them with a variety of weapons and systems, or maybe just mine asteroids until your eyes bleed. It's your choice, and it's deep enough to be engaging but not so deep as to completely ward off newbies.			",166,24,3,29,16,1,35

												This is one of my favorite indie games on Steam - a true gem. Even though it's made by a two-man team, this is an awesome 2D space combat game. It's not laden with overly complicated interfaces and rule systems like a lot of strategy games, yet has enough customizability and complexity to keep the player engaged. Ignore the story, and focus on configuring your ships. My 40 hours on a single playthrough is proof of how much fun I had. Some may find the combat repetitive eventually, but I found the steady trickle of new weapons enough to keep me invested. I love this game and am very excited for the sequel!			",402,96,9,45,29,1,69

												I ended up putting in way more hours than I ever thought I would in playing this game. All in good fun, though. It's a good top down space shooter with a lot to do, some quirky humor, and several different ways of playing (though maybe only a few work best in Insane difficulty -- canons and stealth are your friend until you build up the tech to face things head on). It can be a bit grindy at times, especially when you get to the Zombies part of the title, as you'll want to acquire powerful tech and ship blueprints to deal with them (and this goes double especially on Insane difficulty). But, if you get into it, you'll barely notice all the time pass until you've suddenly put in over 100 hours. A good, well-put together game at a cheap price. Worth the full price. A no brainer when on sale. :)			",380,74,10,28,16,1,21

												""If any of the hostages give you any lip, throw em out the airlock with the rest of the trash."" Space Slaver Sim 2011, 10/10 would buy again.Seriously though, I regret not picking this up before. Its a 2D isometric space ship pew pew game that kind of tends to lead you along with the promise of new and better ships and upgrades, but along the way teaches you the complexity of said upgrades and combat. The only downfall I'd say it has is the repetitive ambient chatter, and the godawful character faces/avatars, but then again it was made by just two people. I'm going to put a lot more hours into this. Highly recommended.			",214,35,1,67,10,1,22

												Space Pirates and Zombies. such an amazing game just amazing the amount of ships there are is broad with each ship being diffrent in its own way allowing you to add diffrent types of weapons and utilitys like drones and tractor beams allowing you to mine when you need currency of which there are two credits and goons which can be spent on diffrent things such as items and passing points without violence, the game can be difficult or easy depending on who you ally with and what ships you use and which star you go to, over all the game is a very fun and enjoyable expansive game which i would highly recommend.

												Space Pirates and Zmbies is a top down space shoot em up. Having not completed anything other than easy or medium, try not taking this review into account for the harder difficulty settings.The game itself starts off slow when you are given the worst of the worst ships named the Short Bus. This thing's beam cannot kill pretty much anything. But new and better ships start coming along very soon with the player going from the worst laser ever to lasers and cannons. (For the cannon think of a rifle in those games where you can hold down the trigger or whatever, where it shoots at a moderate speed.)Even though the guns get better some poeple may still think of them as utter crap as the better stuff comes in much later.Also new players may find the shooting with both lasers and cannons very frustrating and have the A.I do most of the work.The game also features 3 resources. rez, goons and data.  Rez a brightly coloured space rock that doubles as the currency of the game  as well as the raw resource that you build your ships with. The game does a very good job of allowing you to collect rez and not loose it. The enemy ships, you will be fighting, nearly always drop a nice chunk of rez for you to loot whereas your ships deposit your supllies of rez into a large pool that you (mostly) cannot lose.The next resource is goons. Goons are workers/slaves/mercenaries that you pick up in escape pods floating around in space. Picking them up ads them to your goon pool much like your rez pool. Unlike rez, goons are used to keep your ship in tip top shape once it is flying, rather then build it. The amount of goons that join you when you pick them up depends on your crew skill.Your crew skill is an indication of how well you keep oder/how much they like you. At first this skill will be very low, level zero in fact. At this low level most of the crew get thrown out of the air lock of your ships instead of being crewed. This could be a bit frustrating as 6 crew can suddenly turn into 3 crew as half are chucked out the air lock for being troble makers.But there is usally so many crew pods, you rarely have this problem.Then there's the last resource data. Data are little bits of trashed computer parts and what not, scattered about the place after you trash a bunch of your foes. Data is unique in the fact that it can generate itself as well as goons.  Every time you collect a certain amount of data, starting at about 100 (eazy to do as you collect it in tens at a time) you clone a certain amount of your current goons into new ones.Data also allows you to progress along a tech tree of sorts as each time you level up you gain 3 points to spend. The points can be spent in things such as shields thrusters or drones. Each certain amount of points you put into a certain category upgrades it a bit. And with the best weapons upgraded to the full level (10) or even a little below it (8) you can blast and melt your way through whatever even looks at you funny without a care.Next up(ALERT! ALERT! SPOILERS INCOMING!) Zombies. Zombies come into the game at a very late point which is a bit weird considering the game is called space pirates and zombies. They can be a bit of a pain if faced without the right equipment, for example without a point defence system (a little red cricle that shoots a red laser at incoming zombies and missiles) they can swarm your ship, take down its sheilds, kill its crew and infect it, turning what was once your best ship, against you. Another slightly annoying thing they do, is spawn the very tiny ships called ticks that, once injured enough, will fly faster then you can to the edge of the screen causing you to retreat back to your mother ship and then warp to a new place, rather than just warping, as you cannot warp when there are enemies nearby.2nd last on this reveiw is bounty hunters. Bounty hunters can be a HUGE pain in the backside as they track whoever you kill, causing your bounty to rack up. Once this bounty is high enough it will cause the bounty hunters to come after you for that sweet bounty on your head. If not prepared properly these guys can wreck you and your ships pretty fast. That's why I recommend for any new players to turn them down to low in the starting settings. This will make sure you are not getting smoked by them every time you warp to a new sector, but also allow you to find out what they are like and how they work.Lastly are space stations. Space stations are big shielded things that stay in one place. But be careful who you anger in this game. As flying to a space station, when either it is to high a level for you or you are to low a level for it, can leave you with no rez or ships if it blows them all up. Also a tip for a mid level mission, in which I got stuck on for a while, where you have to shoot a space station untill it gives up its reactor for you. My tip is if you can't beat it at first just grind a bit of low level stuff first. Trust me, at first it may be boring but it defenitly is worth it when you beat the station and move on to the better parts of the game.Well, that just about wraps up this review and my few last words are: A good game for most poeple, but better if you're patient and don't mind a bit of a grind.

I'm barely into it but I'm recommending it to anyone I know or game with. Looking forward to future titles from these people.			",89,6,0,4,10,0,13

												Space Pirates and Zombies is a open-world space action adventure similar to a classic game on my ""all time favourites list"" called Star Control. It was the resemblance to Star Control which really atracted my attention. You captain a mother ship, travel to a multitude of star systems, gather loot to upgrade your existing ships,advance your technology by doing research, trade, mine for resources, customize your ships and experience glorious 2D battles. This is a more modest open-world adventure game, its not on the grand scale of The Elder Scrolls: Skryrim. The story line is a bit shallower with more of a focus on combat and customization, but if you enjoyed the old Star Control, you should enjoy Spaz.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game with a great core gameplay loop - load up a couple of ships with various items and fly them around frantically through a swarm of other ships blowing stuff up. The action-oriented 2D combat is great fun, with surprisingly great physics and object interaction for such a seemingly simple game. The fact that the plot and the elements in play radically changes halfway through the game is a bonus, and works great even though the zombies are spoiled by the game's actual title.There are a few issues I had with the game though. Grinding for resources and data can be quite a hassle - the less you grind, the harder the combat is, because your equipment simply won't be as good. Updating your tech RPG-style is really compelling, but unfortunately not every tech is created equal. Techs all cost the same, but it seems clear to me that investing 50+ skillpoints in, say, Hull strength or Shields is vastly preferable to investing the same amount of points in something like Bombs (a really specific type of weapon) or Crew (only situationally useful). Maybe this depends on playstyle, but I tried investing in things like Subsystems or Launchers at first and found the benefits just weren't as tangible.Also, for a game that probably takes even experts 30+ hours to complete, the fairly small number of mission types gets old fairly quickly.That said, the core gameplay is really fun and made it worth it for me, and the sense of progress you get teching up and defeating fleets that would have smeared you to a paste several hours earlier is tangible and rewarding. If you've got a lot of time and like a simple 2D action game, give this a shot!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not let the price of this rare gem fool you, Because the content this game can offer is well worth more! SPAZ is a fantastic, well-made game developed by only two people who had a dream and made it reality, Creating a stepping stone for others to do the same. After 300+ hours into this game, Here's my experience so far.PROS: 1. What initially brought me to this game was how alive it felt, With something always going on around every corner of the galaxy. There are many events and little side-missions that make it feel like it's a living, breathing environment2. While on the surface the mechanics look simple, there is a surprising amount of depth put into how you can personally tailor and customize your ships to your own liking, Giving you the chance to get creative and make many different layouts and strategies on how you want to play.3. The exploration, With the choice of either a minimum of 150 stars or a maximum of 300 stars, You can set the pace at which you play the game to your own standards. Regardless of what you choose, It takes a considerable time to explore each and every different system, Giving you a reasonable space to scavenge for tech that you may need.4.The combat, the main focus of this game, Is very engrossing and addictive. The controls are tight, The gameplay is fluid and it's all easy to pickup, But hard to master. From blasting your enemies away with cannons to steadily melting them to scrap from far away, There's plenty of options for you to take down your enemies. (Or civilians, if you're not in the most merciful mood!)CONS:1. The game can become very repetitive, With most side-missions being recycled, And many tasks needing to be done in order to progress with reputation.2. It can feel very grindy, especially early on in the game when you need to farm resources and levels if you ever get stuck on a quest.3.  The Zombies in the game can become very tedious to clear out later on in the game,  This game has brought me tons of priceless joy, I hope I had shared some of that experience with you all, Because even with all that I said, I still can't express or put into words how much I love this game, Thank you for reading this far, Have a pleasant day.

												This is a great game to sink hours upon hours into, still only got to the middle, but I am hooked, as simple as it is, building ships and fitting them with weapons you grinded for and blowing up enemy ships has some retro-ish vibes that scratch an itch that modern games just don't give you anymore.SPAZ is kind of like a forgiving rouge like, it has many elements of a rogue like, but you don't loose much if you die, if you have ever felt like going all in guns blazing in a rouge like, but went the safe route because you didn't want to loose your stuff? SPAZ will scratch that itch.The ""cling cling cling"" sound of missiles detaching from your ship, the radio chatter, getting used to your new customized ship's drag while you whiz around firing and dogging enemy fire is such a satisfying experience.Also its nice that you have multiple ships to command and can switch to with ease, you can build your fleet in such a way that is very specific to your tactics, which would not work if the ships are controlled by AI.It does get tedious to grind for materials, but not to the point its annoying.I actually bought SPAZ 2 before this, but I don't plan to move my way up to it just yet, SPAZ 1 is just too addicting to let go.

												I normally do not write reviews but i had to do it for this game.SPAZ (Space Pirates And Zombies) is really a beautiful love letter to the old days of top down space shooters.Pros: Stellar Presentation (hehe) good 2d graphics nice music upgrades ship fitting challenges (bounty hunter) different enemy types even asteroid mining is fun mutliple ships in your fleet fun and diverse combat (lasers/cannons, fighter drones, cloaking, mines, rockets, bombs, boarding, ...)Cons: Can sometimes become a little bit grindy, but there are almost always ways around the grind.Btw. I absolutely love TotalBiscuit (John Bain) as the narrator.Buy it, play it, you won't regret it.			",292,39,4,44,23,1,45

												Oh hell yeah. Not only is it randomly genereated but theres lovely nice 2D graphics, satisfying combat, varied missions to a point and loads of different items to use. The only negative point i would give is that you often dont know what kind of battle your getting into until its too late.			",186,18,2,7,13,3,30

												The first thing you'll notice about SPAZ is the customization.  Do you want to play in a massive galaxy?  Do you want to be starved for technology?  Do you want to turn off the Bounty Hunters entirely?  You can do that.  The customization of course applies to the many different ship types, such as what armament to use and even the level-up system, so maybe you want to focus on shields first or maybe you like the punch of cannons so you focus on those.  SPAZ is not an RTS, but it has some elements, like having resources to manage (albeit it's just REZ for money and Goons for slave labor), which you use for the production of your up to four ships for your small fleet, and both are used for the purchase of new weapons blueprints.  You also have to maintain relations between you and two factions, or three with the included And Bounty Hunters expansion.  Do you fight the UTA for the benefit of the CIVs, or do you backstab both groups for your own profit?  This is complicated by the fact that every sector has its own faction relation to you, and anything you do in one sector has no effect on the rest.  But that's where the Bounty Hunters come in.  There are light RPG elements too, mainly in how you spend your upgrade points in what trees to bolster your ships and enable the use of better equipment.  There is a good variety of missions, like destroy X many crates without being seen, or destroying a big ice meteor before it plows through a research station, or the simple ""kill everyone of this faction"" and everything rewards you with money, people, and typically a change in faction relation.  Or maybe some new equipment, or even a little bit of story.  The game changes pretty drastically during the final chapter, though you are given advance warning before this point.  And you don't even have to do missions all the time.  You can just pop by the mining colony and chip away at meteors for money...only for one of the groups you ticked off to suddenly warp in and you're now scrambling to send away your mining ships for battle ones.  There's a good bit of stuff to do and collect and kill in this game.  I especially like the fact that you can custom-tailor your experience to start, though there's no way to change that once you've started.  Battles are oftentimes difficult and relying on your AI allies is an exercise in frustration, but learning the nuances of the weapons and how much impact the different gear you can equip to every ship is essential for victory.  Do you want a massive battlecruiser with extremely strong shields and armor?  Or maybe a tiny ship with extreme speed for hit-and-run tactics?  Why not both?  You can only directly control one ship at a time, but the ability to swap at any time might be essential to keep everyone alive and to keep your coffers full.And this game has no discrete ""game over"" condition, as you can always fight back from zero even in the final chapter, though it will be tedious and difficult to rebuild your fleet when you've no REZ nor Goons.  And while you're slowly chipping away at stray rocks in the Short Bus after a massive defeat, you'll be thinking up a plan to exact your revenge.  It will be glorious.  So yeah.  SPAZ is a game I like.			",519,139,12,130,27,8,81

												This is a great game. If you know Star control 2 then this is basically a tribute to that, but then with an ARPG twist. It's a bit like Diablo in space. You can explore a very attractive looking 2d universe and shoot lots of interesting and increasingly powerful spaceships and then you can build them yourself and customize them with weapons and upgrades.The story has some interesting twists to keep it fresh and you will feel a great sense of progression. In a nutshell, this game is awesome. It was developed by a small indie company so it is sometimes a bit rough around the edges but the gameplay is very solid and if you like space shooters with progression then this should keep you busy for many, many hours. I highly recommend it.			",314,71,13,29,31,4,60

Cannons maxed, shields maxed, lots of point im secondary system, almost no points in unused systems... get wrecked by AI ships. Well, sometimes it's still pretty ok, but then you have two enemy ships with equal tech as yourself, but you don't need to know a lot about the game that this won't work.Searching for answers about how to deal with this brings up countless players having the same issue.Trying other stragtegies is no fun because of the random nature of the game and the fact that losses will end up in grinding money to get on track again. Add to this that every respec costs tons of data/XP and stops your progress for hours.Very disappointed.			",450,243,16,45,49,3,86

												I'd seen SPAZ go on sale a few times but never really paid much attention until it went on sale for $2 and I had a spare bit of change in my Steam wallet.Best $2 that I've ever spent, unless you could the 3 sausage rolls for a pound (about 2 dollars more or less) from Greg's bakery.I am a huge fan of Star Control and never thought that any game could live up to the standard that it set way back in the days of the Sega Megadrive. I was wrong. Whether it was inspired by SC or not, I don't know, but if you liked SC and want a modernized version of it, SPAZ is the best that there is.If you haven't played Star Control, I will give you the gist of what SPAZ is. Spaz is a top down space shooter. You are in command of a band of Space pirates. With humble beginnings, you can gradually work your way up and become more powerful, reverse engineering ships that you destroy, gathering resources to build researched ships and to buy blueprints for new modules to go on them. You can fly into combat with a small fleet of AI controlled allies, toggling between the ships at will to command for yourself.If you like games with depth and action and don't care about graphics, I fully recommend this game. I got it for a bargain, but even it's full price is well worth the expense. A must have.			",190,15,6,21,39,4,42

												I picked this up in the winter sale and I quite enjoy it. I remember playing a game called Star Control when I was a kid and SPAZ seems very keen to evoke those memories.The bulk of the game is spent carrying out missions (i.e. quests) which will reward currency and/or reputation with each system's faction. Speaking of which, each system has two sides: UTA (Empire) and Civilians (Rebels). You don't always have to butter up one or the other, and which side you'll have to♥♥♥♥♥♥off will vary from system to system. It's very much up to you how and where you want to go questing, but the levelling process can feel a bit grindy.The combat is fun but not overly deep, and things can get a bit repetitive. I've put 30 hours into it so far and I've only really just got into the meat of the campaign I think. At a sale price, I'd say it's worth it. I wouldn't be disappointed to buy it at 50% off so anything else is a bonus.p.s. If you're on the fence, TRY THE DEMO. It's a good taster.			",1215,444,41,177,151,18,208

So when the game play gets really choppy ~1fps, the missles still hit their targets, no need to worry about aiming turrets or cannons or beams, or have the auto aim not hit things. Beat game last part was surpisingly easy. Guess I'll go back to save before that and try and destory a bounty hunter base or all of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reminds me a lot of Star Control II in terms of gameplay mechanics, but with more overarching strategy and customisation going on. The opening blurb says that they wanted to make games that they don't see a lot of any more compared to days gone by and I think they did a fine job of it. The only problems are it can get a bit grindy sometimes, and the AI for your assistant ships is beyond moronic. Apart from that though, I would recommend this.			",73,26,0,10,10,2,8

												I picked this up in the winter sale and I quite enjoy it. I remember playing a game called Star Control when I was a kid and SPAZ seems very keen to evoke those memories.The bulk of the game is spent carrying out missions (i.e. quests) which will reward currency and/or reputation with each system's faction. Speaking of which, each system has two sides: UTA (Empire) and Civilians (Rebels). You don't always have to butter up one or the other, and which side you'll have to♥♥♥♥♥♥off will vary from system to system. It's very much up to you how and where you want to go questing, but the levelling process can feel a bit grindy.The combat is fun but not overly deep, and things can get a bit repetitive. I've put 30 hours into it so far and I've only really just got into the meat of the campaign I think. At a sale price, I'd say it's worth it. I wouldn't be disappointed to buy it at 50% off so anything else is a bonus.p.s. If you're on the fence, TRY THE DEMO. It's a good taster.			",1215,444,41,177,151,18,208

												I'd seen SPAZ go on sale a few times but never really paid much attention until it went on sale for $2 and I had a spare bit of change in my Steam wallet.Best $2 that I've ever spent, unless you could the 3 sausage rolls for a pound (about 2 dollars more or less) from Greg's bakery.I am a huge fan of Star Control and never thought that any game could live up to the standard that it set way back in the days of the Sega Megadrive. I was wrong. Whether it was inspired by SC or not, I don't know, but if you liked SC and want a modernized version of it, SPAZ is the best that there is.If you haven't played Star Control, I will give you the gist of what SPAZ is. Spaz is a top down space shooter. You are in command of a band of Space pirates. With humble beginnings, you can gradually work your way up and become more powerful, reverse engineering ships that you destroy, gathering resources to build researched ships and to buy blueprints for new modules to go on them. You can fly into combat with a small fleet of AI controlled allies, toggling between the ships at will to command for yourself.If you like games with depth and action and don't care about graphics, I fully recommend this game. I got it for a bargain, but even it's full price is well worth the expense. A must have.			",190,15,6,21,39,4,42

												If you got a slower computer (Pentium 4 2.4ghz) go for Missles and 1 ship to take out sheilds. The Homing missles are the best. They Just wipe out just about everything, Hunter SIM. So when the game play gets really choppy ~1fps, the missles still hit their targets, no need to worry about aiming turrets or cannons or beams, or have the auto aim not hit things. Beat game last part was surpisingly easy. Guess I'll go back to save before that and try and destory a bounty hunter base or all of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Becomes quite addicting, constantly exploring / fighting / completing missions to find those upgrades & ship designs in order to get more & more badass equipment.

												I did not find the combat enjoyable one tiny bit.  The ship handling is sloppy.  The ships have tons of momentum and terrible acceleration so changing directions is a pain and takes way too long.  You spend most of your time flying past your enemies and missing your shots, then trying to turn around for another pass, only to miss again, and then turn around again, and so on and so forth.  Actually killing anything took way too long and was simply more trouble and aggravation than it was worth.  I was mislead by an idiotic comment by a curator, describing the game as ""arcadey"", it's anything but.  Do not expect to get your space combat thrills here.			",178,26,4,37,4,0,10

												Grind, wait, grind, wait... You grind though the galaxy. The same simple fights to collect technology and experience to get stronger. If your resources get low you camp at a mining station for some minutes. Enough time to cook or go to toilet.In the late game you start parking in front of your enemies. My last fights had a boss I was camping 10 minutes in front of him and a visited stations where I just waited for some minutes, because the enemies are faster fleeing than you can follow. They flee one minute and then travel back one minute...My tech was maxed and I tried different builds. This game could have been a good 5 hour game, but it is stretched to 40+.

												This game is a very interesting type I've never really tried in the past. It's based on this group who end up having their main station destroyed and reduced to the lowest tech and losing all tech, but you manage to have some to make ships and continue to claim blueprints through the game.As the titles suggest it's in space and you fight against Pirates and Zombies as wll as military and civilian. You can either do jobs for either sides to gain Rez (currency) to buy schematics for new ships or weapons. You can also gain tech points for research into using better weapons, shields and armour.It's certainly a very long game with a lot of grind, but you don't have to buy stuff from space stations as if you are well enough equipped you can destroy their station and steal all they have for free, but it only depends on the balance between how many times you've died and what you get out of it as the payment for making your ship can be very big if you spent a lot of money to make your Ship massive.

												Do you like spending a looooong time fighting your way through 999999 systems that all feel pretty much the same?Do you enjoy mindless circle strafing and trivial aiming?Do you like a ship customization system that basically amounts to little more than ""give your ship the overpowered machine gun laser""?If so, you'll like this game. Otherwise, not so much. Say NO to strafing in physics-based space shooters!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this all the way through (offline) back in the day. It's strange because the shallow gameplay would normally cause me to give it a thumbs down, but there is something about this game that got me totally hooked and I've recently played it halfway through again. Now that I've come here to write a review I've discovered that SPAZ2 has just gone to early access and the video for it it making my heart thump already. Anyway, back to my review...Cons (none of which matter to me)The game universe is enormous but to be honest all a bit samey. You have to complete endless tasks to gain the technology and resources to upgrade your ships, but these tasks mostly involve battling enemies which is really the be-all and end-all of this game. In theory you're supposed to tailor your ships/weapons to the task at hand, but in practice it doesn't really seem to matter, you just equip the best weapons you can find and use them for everything. It's not the most intellectually challenging game.Con (which does matter)There is a storyline to this game, with an ending. After it had finished, to my dismay, I discovered that it was impossible to go back and play some more with the massive battleships I had worked for hours on end to build up. Bear this in mind before you tackle the final task, or make a data backup!ProsIt's all about building bigger and better ships with more and more firepower and watching the battle mayhem. Especially towards the end of the game when huge battleships are blasting each other to smithereens it's a sight to behold, and the amazing thing is that all this glorious graphics action doesn't seem to lag or stutter at all, it's smooth as silk.Now enough of this, I'm off to buy SPAZ2!

												This is very reminiscent of older space exploration games I used to play (whose names I can't remember which is why I picked this up on a whim). You start off piloting a flying trash can and through the tutorial fix it up enough to control a small fleet. There is some seriously deep customization with your ships. With carriers that can support their own miniature fleets to turret covered behemoths that can shoot 360°, both the pea-shooters you get at the beginning and the imperial destroyers you get near the end all have their uses throughout the whole game. There are some balancing issues with weapons (cannons are a swiss-army knife that destroy everything while missiles are useless late game because of point blank defense systems, etc.) and framerate slowdown once the zombies joins the fray, but patches are being worked on to fix these issues and add more content.If you enjoy 4X games, this $15 variation is worth your money just for the nostalgia rush.

												Earlier it came to my attention that none of my friends own this game, so I am here to inform. Space Pirates and Zombies is an open-world, 2D space-themed shooter and everyone should buy this game. Not only is it amazing that a team of two created this, but they did a really good job on it. They did a better job than some large game corporations have done on games before. Amazing combat, soo much to do, hilarious dialogues, really cool story, and you have ultimate control of how you get to point B. You can power your way through, or take your time and get everything one step at a time, just depends how you like to play. This game is for all styles of gamer and you should get it!

												Frustrating, tedious, hard.  Sometimes SPAZ makes me want to eat my keyboard at times.Yet I come back to it.  Why?  Why?  Why?Update: The frustration outweighed the fun, finally.  I stopped coming back to this game.  Too grindy later in the game.Actually, I know why.  The game doesn't have the most balanced mechanics, nor does the difficulty ramp up all that smoothly (more like, brick-walls on you if you aren't careful).  But it's a 2D space combat simulator with a teeny little bit of RPG tossed in for good measure and a heavy exploration element, and by God's Bones, they dun make games like this no more.There's lots of ships to unlock and lots of goodies to toss onto said ships, so at least if you feel bored using one sort of build you can swap it for another.If you put in lots of hours in games like StarControl, Escape Velocity: Nova, StarFlight and Solar Winds, then buy SPAZ and enjoy it.  If you have no idea what any of those games are, then you might want to pass.  Then again, it's on sale at times for just a few bucks, so what do you have to lose?  Aside from a few bucks.Pros:* Nobody makes these kinds of games anymore, OH WAIT, they did!* Lots of ships and weapons/upgrades to discover.* Big universe to explore.* Nice visuals and sound effects.Cons:* Big universe to explore.  Becomes tedious after a while since systems must be unlocked one at a time.* Chunky and slow during big space battles, especially later in the game with lots of ______'s flying about spewing chunks.  (*Spoilers!)* Space battles can end up near-stalemate battles of attrition, which take a long time to resolve.* Less story-telling versus games like EV:Nova, etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top-down, 2D space pirate combat game where you explore the galaxy completing quests, finding resources, and upgrading your ships.  There is a story here, but in between heavy grinding sessions, I forgot what was actually going on.  Overall, the game is fun and the combat is exciting, but I did get frustrated many times after getting thoroughly whooped on the battlefield (battle-space?).  Hopefully SPAZ 2 will be released soon with improved features and gameplay.PROS+ Controls are intuitive once you get used to them (WASD oriented towards mouse pointer)+ Combat is mostly fun and exciting+ Large number of ship upgrades and modules to purchase and find+ Customizing ships is fun (weapons, armor, subsystems, specialists)+ Resources (currency, data, and manpower) are plentiful+ Each star system has factions to interact with via quests and events (but...see CON)CONS- Mothership can only be upgraded after certain story missions (required for most other upgrades)- Grinding is necessary to advance- Most missions ultimately feel the same (battle after battle after battle...)- Since faction respect doesn't carry between systems, it feels rather unimportant long-term- Needs autosave function			",66,27,0,28,30,0,16

												There is a bit of a learning curve up front, but this game is a gem once you get going. Along the lines of Starscape (which I've previously recommended), you are gradually exploring the galaxy using small ships deployed from a larger mothership. As you go, you will develop relationships with local civilian or military factions, fighting missions for them to gain experience and advance your research. Upgrade all aspects of your mothership and deployable crafts, and iteratively gain the ability to explore more of the galaxy. Oh yes, and there's zombies, too. Good times.			",340,123,7,82,40,3,79

												I traded a GayMod steam gift for this game and let me tell you that it was well worth it.This game is sort of like an online game i've played for like 7 years: Darkorbit except that spaz is a singleplayer game unlike darkorbit, in darkorbit you are overwhelmed by cheaters left and right.What i like about the game:- Really RPG like, i LOVE RPG's- You have to plan out a strategy before you go guns ablazin or else you'll end up mining for rez for the next half hour to repair your fleet- Doesn't take me 5 hours to beat the game, i can see myself sinking 20+ hours into this gameWhat i don't like about the game:- Low amount and repetitive missions- Not much to do except whoop some♥♥♥♥♥and mine rez- The solar system is BIG but not big enough, WE NEED BIGGER!!!!!- Small amount of ship classes you can choose from- Small amount of weapons you can choose fromOther thoughts:It'll be REALLY cool if you could upgrade your weapons, for example having a level 1 mining lazer and paying to get it to level 2 so it might be 1% faster or have a longer burst. Over all this is a REALLY fun game, highly recommend it.			",257,67,12,29,10,1,13

												This is an awesome top down space game with that accent that if you die, you can just go to another ship.WIth this action, it allows you to get deeper into the fleet combat that other top down space games do.With many different ships, weapons, and parts to choose from, you can easily customize your fleet to match your fighting style.Beware that this game and many other top down space games take a lot of time to complete, because of the jumping from system to system and the difficulty of getting money.Space Pirates and Zombies is a great game, and was well worth the $10 I spent on it.

												This won't be a review that shows all the facts, the pros and cons. It's rather going to be my personal love letter for this game. I picked up Space Pirates and Zombies a few years ago, not long after the release. Since then it really found a straight way into my gamer heart, making me play it again every few months. I can say without doubt, that this game is among my Top 3 favourite games of all time!Who didn't want to fly around in big space ship discovering the universe when they were young? SPAZ made this dream come true for me... at least on the screen. It is the perfect mix of flying around, discovering, building up your small fleet, fancy and colourful explosions, tactics, ship management, looting and a simple but funny told story, which matches the title. There's always this next blueprint you wanna get in order to upgrade you ships. There's always this next planet or galaxy you wanna visit to find out what treasures it withholds from you. There's always this next mission you want to complete, this next ship you want to destroy, this next achievement you want to achieve. And just like this hours passed by and I experienced how evenings turned into nights turned into mornings, until I was finally too tired to continue with the adventure of my small space fleet.In the end I highly recommend this game to everybody felt a little of the joy and excitement while reading this. Even if you won't get as much out of it as I did, I can still pretty much promise you quite some hours of fun. And if this game is on sale, it really is a must buy!			",160,16,1,21,21,3,21

There's a lot of grinding there.But That doesn't mean i shouldn't recommend it, because i'm sure there's a lot of people who's searching and wanting to play a game like these.

												Buy this game, seriously, do it now. Had it for 2 days and ranked up 13 hours of gameplay already and by the looks of things I'm not even half way though the game yet. Different layout each time you play though due to randomly generated maps. There is a little message that pops up at the start of the game that explains that it was made by two guys working out of their homes for 2 years but how it plays you would think it was made by a standard developer.

												Buy this game, seriously, do it now. Had it for 2 days and ranked up 13 hours of gameplay already and by the looks of things I'm not even half way though the game yet. Different layout each time you play though due to randomly generated maps. There is a little message that pops up at the start of the game that explains that it was made by two guys working out of their homes for 2 years but how it plays you would think it was made by a standard developer.

												Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is a top-down, 2D space pirate combat game where you explore the galaxy completing quests, finding resources, and upgrading your ships.  There is a story here, but in between heavy grinding sessions, I forgot what was actually going on.  Overall, the game is fun and the combat is exciting, but I did get frustrated many times after getting thoroughly whooped on the battlefield (battle-space?).  Hopefully SPAZ 2 will be released soon with improved features and gameplay.PROS+ Controls are intuitive once you get used to them (WASD oriented towards mouse pointer)+ Combat is mostly fun and exciting+ Large number of ship upgrades and modules to purchase and find+ Customizing ships is fun (weapons, armor, subsystems, specialists)+ Resources (currency, data, and manpower) are plentiful+ Each star system has factions to interact with via quests and events (but...see CON)CONS- Mothership can only be upgraded after certain story missions (required for most other upgrades)- Grinding is necessary to advance- Most missions ultimately feel the same (battle after battle after battle...)- Since faction respect doesn't carry between systems, it feels rather unimportant long-term- Needs autosave function			",66,27,0,28,30,0,16

												I HATE HATE      HATE HATEHATE          Trying to learn new complex games that are a really great but it's fun.  What I mean is that I just learned how to play Project Zomboid(coincidence, not on a zombie kick), FTL and a couple others and I wanna know how to play instantly because my brain is about to explode.   I Just got the basics down on this and got through my first gate and did a couple side missions and can tell this is gonna be a great one(game that is) and I'm going to compare it to FTL and hope to not get yelled at and because I just wanna say that it's kinda like FTL but much more better because graphix and seems to be deeper in stuff and mechanics and well everything.   9.5/10 so far.  I guess -.5 for the tutorial skipping on a few much needed pointers/tips. I highly recommend reading and/or watching some tutorials.    There is one on youtube that I watched where a dude plays through the beginning but doesn't do a great job explaining what each thing is so it's probably best to find other info out or play the demo and then watch his vid like I did   Yeah, I did the demo for an hour and kinda kept it in the back of my head that dying was ok because it wasn't the real game yet, so this may be a good strategy for others. Also S.P.A.Z. 2 is coming out soon I think and hoping I get enough play in here to help me there.    Hope this helps and that the ""and's"" were a bit humorous and not annoying(eek...)

												This game is decent. It's got a really good concept and the story is well fleshed out. But after a while the difficulty curve becomes steep and pushes you into grinding too much. There are a few things that could be done to balance this out but the game needs more things in it. It feels like it needs more polish. Worth a few hours if you liked FTL or similar games. Otherwise I would skip it.			",99,13,0,15,6,1,8

												This game could be so good, but you're so underpowered and even the lowest enemies take a solid 10 minutes of laser fire to kill. You have to constantly get these ""resources"" called ""rez"" for some reason to build ships, but each of your ships can only hold about 2 units of ""rez"" before it has to take it back to base. But you can't make it back to base, because your ships are basically made out of paper and you have ♥♥♥♥ing flashlights for laser beams and you keep getting torn apart by every enemy in sight. So you have to keep using resources to build more ships, which keep getting blown up...It just feels like everyone's having a party and I don't belong there. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			",160,33,1,14,11,0,16

												This game has provided me 122 hours of entertainment. Which is an absurd amount for many games of its type out right now. Granted, I never want to play it again due to both doing all there was to do (within reason) and being completely obsessive about looking at every ship, every part, and every configuration thereof. It has this weird feel about it that makes me remember the ""games you can't find anymore"" as the authors call it. Without actually being able to call to mind what games it refers to exactly.The art is quite unique and detailed. The character portraits are randomly generated for specialists which can generate some amusing stuff. The plot-relevant portraits are made using the same dada-style copy & paste technique that the specialists do, just not randomly generated. It's pretty charming really.			",212,50,0,19,13,1,17

												Call me a casual but . . . it seems like this game needs a little more instruction in the beginning.  I would quickly get to a point where I would fulfill the tutorial objectives, but then after that have no idea what to do.  I tried experimenting with no success, and the game didn't have the draw to encourage me to keep experimenting.  There's no indication if you're doing the right or wrong things.  At least with other games if you suck you die.  Here, you just kinda float around.I tried to like this game, but after hitting a brick wall on a few different playthroughs relatively quickly, I shelved it.			",181,32,3,27,12,0,35

												I quite liked this game- the playstyle, the graphics, even the atrocious, cheesy writing. As a quick aside, they apparently even got that TotalBiscuit fellow to do a great deal of exposition, and while he’s not the greatest narrator of all time, it does lend a certain gravitas gravy to the cheese. Kudos all around.However, once the zombies get introduced, I quickly lost interest. I was actually rather looking forward to playing as a space zombie, which doesn’t appear to be a thing, but more than that there seems to be a distinct lack of good ways to deal with them. I’m sure there’s something I’m missing, but I take umbrage at having to do research on a game to defeat zombies- I, like general use of zombies these days, am a little tired…			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even on lower difficulty settings against enemies of a lower level than you, this game can easily turn into an exercise in banging your head into a brick wall until one or the other breaks.Ultimately the gameplay just isn't varied enough to keep up with the grind.

												SPAZ is a top-down space shoot-em-up that has pretty graphics and some nice RPG/upgrade elements for a variety of unlockable spacecraft.  It's a great game to play when you need to kill some time, but the repetitive missions keep it from being much more than that.  However, SPAZ is a great companion to FTL: Faster Than Light;  where FTL requires you to adequately manage infrastructures amidst turn-based combat, SPAZ does that♥♥♥♥♥♥for you, and lets you just kill things in real-time until you get bored.

												Game goes fine until a mid-game ""change"" (trying to avoid spoiler). After this, the game becomes nigh unplayable IMO. The simplest of missions will involve you taking down 30+ ships.....with your 4. They do come in waves somewhat, but thats little consolation. Your reward for this slaughter, should you succeed? Not enough enough resources to rebuild a single huge ship (the largest hanger size you can field). The only other game i can think of that i've played where i hit a ""wall"" akin to this was Diablo 3 in torment. Maybe some hardcore people enjoy beating their head painfully against walls like this, but unless you consider yourself one of them. Dont waste the initial 20-30 hours getting to that point. Save yourself the effort and just go bash your head on the nearest doorframe.			",34,9,0,43,11,0,15

												Game's annotation says what it is open world sandbox, but truly you will always be clamped by the main story quest. This game also doesn't have enough side quests. Each 10 space systems you can find only 1 side quest, so this game turns to ""collect resource, kill 1000+ weak enemies to get tech lvl up"" and then repeat it hundred times to complete another main quests and unlock new ships and new space systems. So if you really want to play old school open world space action game you should choose  Space Rangers . This two games like earth and sky, like perfect ancient masterwork and new poorly made copy of it. Don't waste your time on SPAZ. It doesn't worth it.			",99,21,1,15,14,0,16

												This game really should have been called Galactic Renegade Interlopers, Nefarious Desperados, Interstellar Nasty Ghouls, as grinding is all you do.  You go to a system, see how much the local two factions feel about you, see what you can buy from the faction that likes you, chill out by a friendly mining station to get resources, see what missions you can do that don't♥♥♥♥♥♥off the faction that doesn't like you, go bribe the other faction so you can buy their stuff, find some way of getting more crew to replace the ones you lost bribing your new friends, and then when the system is done, either bribe some more to unlock the warp gates, or shoot your friends in the back.  Story missions are massive spikes in difficulty requiring a lot of leveling from you.  They didn't make a massive randomly generated galaxy for the fun of it, as you will be wandering around picking fights and strip-mining it to get the xp and tech needed.  Just not for me as I don't have the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I expected more of a strategy game, but the bulk of the gameplay in Space Pirates and Zombies (SPAZ) is about twitchy 2D space combat.I struggled to master the controls. I would have preferred a basic twin-stick control system, like Robotron. Instead, SPAZ features an awkward combination of using the keyboard for thrusters, and the mouse for direction and aim. The result is a game that looks like hockey pucks on an ice rink flying around, shooting wildly at each other. It's really unpleasant to play.I've played the tutorial mission through twice now, and each time I have come away wondering why I would want to continue. The gameplay is poor, and the various elements of SPAZ don't come together to make a pleasing whole. I'm underwhelmed, and happy to set this aside.			",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												The game seems to have alot of potential, but it uses none.I found it extremely annoying, you just spin around in circles trying to hit stuff.The most accurate description of this game is ship building simulator as your ships gets destroyed all the time,but that is okay! Because you can insta spawn new ships! If you have enough resources you can basically just pain out the game untill you win. But its gameplay is very boring.This might just be me, but it seems like the humor/story is like an inside joke going around the devs, and they have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of story in their head that we never get to know about, then they write in parts of it and you are left going... uuh... what?I outright disliked the game and it is the worst thing I have ever spent my money on.Sorry for the harsh review but that is just how I feel about the game.

												I am trying to get into this game but I am finding the combat and movement controls very awkward. Most times if feels like you are just spinning around on one spot shooting things. Very little manovouring. Movement is similar and sometimes it's difficult to see if you are moving since there is usually a large planet in the background, which barely moves, so it throws you off. As well during combat there is little feed back visually or physically. Meaning your ship hardly reflects any damage or somehow impacts your movement. I know the game is created by a small team and is well done for what it is, but the above really is important, I think, for a game to have. I might give it more time. But I don't feel I can.

												I want to love this game so much, but two things keep me from really being able to get into it.First are the walls of text you have to read. It would be different if the writing were better, but as it is, it's just boring.The second are the controls. It's the M+K equivalent of a twin-stick shooter, which is incredibly finicky.

												The worst game I ever played in my entire life. Everything is boring, nothing gets you entertained.SPAZ is a space ""shooter"" game and when you are used to control fast engines, in this game it's freaking slow and for the best part of the game, you're shooting lasers, because missiles are mainstream.You mostly take 10 minutes to kill a piece of sh*t with those lasers and again, when you think you're almost having fun, the ennemies are flying 20 000 km away but they won't leave the area, no, because you're having fun chasing them for nothing. In the end I got with a ship I couldn't destroy because he was escaping me anytime he's almost dying. And when he's out of my sight, he regenerates.The game has more than 100 areas to explore, all of them look the same and are infinite in length but empty of things.Each area has missions, pretty boring ones and repetitive. It also has a level system, 100 levels it seems, but totally useless because every ability you increase does no effect! It's only useful for new engine parts: lasers, shield, cloak, etc.The level can also tell you how hard an area can be. But you will always die more than 20 times before clearing one.There's plenty of ships to unlock, each ranged by class: small, medium, large, huge. You won't get something good before getting a huge ship, that means, in the end of the game when you have nothing else to do.However, mods can give a great visual but nobody gives a.. and only 2 mods are available: halloween and xmas. wow.I admit I played with a trainer but even with that it's a pain to play this horrible game.2.5/10			",269,51,20,20,7,3,6

												This topdown shmup isn't just a arcade top down shmup like astroids. The game has rpg elements where you have to do missions and upgrade your fleet. In Mount&Blade style you have a fleet just control one ship in battles. It's a nice twist on the genre. But the problem is that the shmup gameplay is boring. The controls are bad. You need to play with the mouse+keyboard and the mouse is used for steering. Also because of the rpg elements the combat is slow and the missions aren't interesting. SPAZ has potential, but just isn't very fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before you ask, no, i dont have a steam copy, my copy of this game is actually non-steam (humble bundle, look it up), but this is a really cool ship combat game that i suck at.  Despite the cheesy title, this game is actually a really fun game all in all, mixing all sorts of things into the game.Storyline in a nutshell: New element, Rez, is discovered. This one government, the UTA, uses this element to make warp gates that can let ships travel to different solar systems. However, they're total warp-gate nazis and the civilians dont like it, so they get their own ships and start fighting UTA (peaceful civilians... who said that?) ships all over.Just a little background knowledge.Now, what you do is use these ships to take a side on factions... don't worry, whatever you do will only affect faction relations in the system you're in, which means you can go take down a huge UTA convoy, go to a different system, and poof! Aside from that system, nobody gives a crap! Very fun gameplay, and when it comes to taking sides, its always open for change. However, you will start at different levels of relations with factions per system, and... whatever. Just play the game already.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												If you are offended by foul language, steer clear. It isn't just enemy pilots about to die; it isn't just in dialogs with lowlifes; it is in the ambient sound for the game itself (presumably intercom chatter aboard your own vessel). Totally unnecessary, and adds no value to the game.Now, after turning the noise completely off, and ignoring the dialogs (which you can probably get away with, since the in-game indicators tell you what you need to do next), you can get around that objection, so what is left?A lot of grinding. I don't mind grinding, generally, but I appreciate some sort of appreciable reward for grinding. Admittedly, I didn't go far in the game, but the whole time I felt behind.Regrets that I can't give a positive comment. Building and maintaining a small space task force is right up my alley, so I thought it would be great. It isn't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""There is potential here, the ship customization is nice.But the game also feels very grindy. Some missions are fun, others just feel like BS-Also the control sceme is somewhat awkward.""The bit above was my original review, i wrote it about 3 or so hours into the game.Now, having finished it after about 45hrs of playtime (that's a single playthrough, so if the game can keep you engaged, there is very good playtime value in it... Most of it was repetive/grind-ish missions however), i am somewhat torn. In the long run it was better,  than my first impression. Certainly not terrible. However, was it good enough, to change my vote? I don't think so. On a more refined scale, i would have voted differently - a 6 out of 10 perhaps. But with only ""Yay"" or ""Nay"" as possible votes, i'll stick to my initial negative vote.After all, after wrtitng that original bit, i stopped playing for a few days. Might havenever returned, but was really-really bored, so took it up again.A few nice extras came up, but my two main complaints - grind and awkward controls - remained in place.The story was ok for a open world-ish combat game, where no one really cares about story anyway. Predictable and very cliche, but enough to keep you moving from chapter to chapter. Actaully, when changing chapters there were a few interesting changes in the mechanics. Late game even had something a kin to a basic strategic layer, with defense chokepoints and ressource management - very-very-very basic, but nevertheless, an interesting change of pace.However, it did not do away with the grindy-ness. Rather the need for ressources increased. To progress the story i had to do the same missions over and over again (same objectives, slightly different maps). In the end i was just cherry-picking the missions, that i could do the fastest (cloak, destroy the target, get out).I had unlocked all the ships, all the modules about half way through the game. Picked my favorites rather quickly too. Most new unlocks i only tried for a short while (one or two fights), found them inferior, to what i already had and never used them again.Now, i am willing to believe, that there is some bit of personal prefference involved - other player might select other ships at some point. However, there is also somewhat poor balance - some ships of the same class, are clearly and stricktly superior to others - more health, more equipment slots.Bounty hunter designs in particular seem very strong - perhaps a sort of power creep in the development process.My main complaint remains the control scheme, even after 45 hours of gameplay i still wasn't fully used to it. I can't even rightly describe it - it's just not intuitive. Basically the strafe controls are pivoted on the ship, rather than on the screen. And since the ship can be spinning all willy-nilly, depending on where you aim your mouse (which is where your target is, so you can't just say ""screw it"" and steer with the mouse), the direction of strafing is kinda flipping around, so sometimes ushing left, will make you move left, while other times you push left, yet go right. That made strafing completely unviable for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A conceptually good game that ultimately suffers from being very grindy and surprisingly difficult.  The grindy-ness is kind of just the nature of the game and if you can deal with the controls and feel immersed in the universe and enjoy the combat, you probably won't care.  Most games are repetitve after all.  But I found the universe to not be quite as interesting as advertised and the rpg-like elemnts of the game to be not bad per-se, but not really compelling or interesting either.The difficulty is at least to some degree, a by-product ofthe awkward controls.  This game needs controller support, it begs to have twin-stick controls.  Its just too hard otherwise it would be a fine little game.  A lot of people apparently adapted to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls but I just couldn't as a long time Geometry Wars type player I just can't get the hang of the combat........and thats the entire game so yea.  Its slightly unfair of me to knock the game because I suck at it......but how much foresight and budget would it really have taken for them to include controller support?  Ring Runner Flight of the Sages manages it at a similar price-point and would be the game I would recommend instead.			",93,26,2,18,13,0,41

												I do not recommend this game.Gameplay: Way too repetitive.  At the end, you're just holding down the mouse button while your turrets do the work.  And the game likes to start throwing 'attacks' against you after the first few levels, keeping you from warping out unless you hit one of the menu keys quickly enough.Story: Garbage.  It also impacts the gameplay too heavily (prevents you from researching / building / etc. until you get past certain story missions), killing replay value.  Also, way too long on the default settings.Audio: S'alright.			",99,20,2,11,9,2,11

You can set the amount of star systems, the difficulty, the tech advancements and randomize the tech tree. That's pretty much it. I've played a game with 300 systems and started one with 150. I honestly don't see the difference, which already brings me to the biggest issue I have with it:This game is utterly and truly boring. You are going to do the same thing over and over and over and over again. That is: Fly to a subsystem, complete missions to raise your standing with 1 of the 2 factions, which of course hate each other, in order to gain resources you need to (re)build ships, gather upgrade points and buy new modules like better shields, etc.There is a main mission to follow, but honestly after 10 hours of gameplay I've not been able to progress this very much, since every main mission is multiple sub systems apart. Now, you've got to understand that these subsystems have a level requirement attached to it, which means you need to break a blockade to access a new subystem. That in turn means grinding out levels to get more upgrades and fighting against superior foes either technologically speaking or just sheer numbers. The next problem with this is that you only get new and better ships by destroying these same ships multiple times first to get the blueprints. In my first playthrough I just didn't get any good ships that would even survive against the enemy for a few seconds most of the time. It doesn't help that most damage is unavoidable and your ai ships are dumb as ♥♥♥♥.In the end this means ginding, grinding, grinding...and that's not what I was looking for in a space exploration and combat game. Not to mention that after 10 hours there are still no zombies, so I can't even comment on how the gameplay changes after you reach that stage, but since I was finally able to complete another main mission, only to realize I need to grind another TEN levels to even GET to the next mission area I said ""♥♥♥♥ you"", as this is a bottomless pit. Even with just 150 subystems you're going to be doing this for 100 hours I feel. Not worth it, especially since the gameplay does not change at all throughout the whole game. The only difference is that you get bigger ships that move slower, but the main combat system and weapons stay the same. Pretty disappointed in this one. :/			",210,55,12,41,26,3,66

												You should not play this game. Especially not for more than $5. Ship control is exactly like Asteroid. EXACTLY. Combat is absolutely horrible. Graphics are on par with NES maybe SNES. The story is also far too cartoonish and corny right from the very start. Not a good experience even in the slightest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh, look! A game set in space where you to read tons of witty text to learn how to build ships! And it got ""Zombie"" in the title! Not boring or ripetitive at all! SO indie and original! I really do not like this game. Often compared to Star Control, it has neither the charm nor the entertainment of the game. It tries to imitate an old game style that died for a reason; it's not very good. The game starts off promising, shoots itself in the foot. The game is Repetitive, with a capital R, with such abysmal lack of content I don't understand how it got released in like so. You get maybe a handful of ships to play with, and the majority of them you will never use. At no point in time through playing the game did I ever concern myself with resources, as there was never any need. If you play well you're given everything you ever need. The missions feel tedious and the grinding for blueprints is aggravating, not to mention the restrictive modular system it presents. Why make such an amazing modular setup, then take it away, forcing specific pieces on the ship designs? So instead of getting a massive fleet of awesome variety, you get... cookie cutter setups. It makes the whole system feel a waste.Perhaps I am too hard on the game. It gave me 2 hours of entertainment! But afterwards, it felt so old, so repetitive			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												It's been a few years since I played this, but I really did enjoy it quite a lot. The story was fun and compelling, the challenge was inviting and encuraged you to explore around for resources before progressing, but without it feeling too grindy. The Bounty Hunter update also improved many of the problems the game originally had. I'm really looking forward to SPAZ2 as well, which I know is quite a different type of game.

												Really engaging top-down rotary shooter with collectable loot and ship customisation. Some RPG elements like being able to use levelup points to increase battle abilities also drive the action on. The story is original and entertaining, but ultimately this is an action game that allows a lot of freedom for the player to roleplay and enjoy at their own pace.Rewarding, and more interesting as the game goes on.8/10			",170,26,9,33,58,9,54

												Top down space shooter with an addictive progression system. It feels like a 2D Freelancer flying around upgrading ships, blowing up pirates, civilians, zombies, police cruisers all the while upgrading your little band of mercenary ships makes for an absolutely fantastic time. The open ended nature of the game gives the player freedom to go where they like while the narrative gives a general direction on where to go next. Combat is fluid and each ship handles a little differently as a space game should. All this made by two people. Weapon and ship upgrades keep the player going for 'just a bit longer' into the wee hours of next week.Get it, play it, love it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is really a good game.  And, it's only about 150MB to install.  It's a space exploration, resource gathering, space combat strategy.  I'm not much into RTS games, and this game doesn't play like one.  You have a mother ship, and then control individual ships in your fleet.  You can switch between any ship, and also set up AI for those ships you aren't currently controlling.  The galaxy is proceedurally generated when you start a new game, and you can control the number of star systems up to about 300 total.  Each star system has a level requirement before you can visit it, and you have to deal with the ships guarding the Jump Gates (bribe or destroy) before you can move freely between systems you have access to.Really, try the demo.  The tutorial is for the first system but seems to open up after about the 1st or 2nd mission you take.  This 2 person dev team deserve your money.			",117,33,1,87,1,0,17

												If you remember Escape Velocity and miss the good-ol-days of 2-D space battles, then SPAZ may satisfy your hunger.  The very beginning is hard, but the difficulty smoothes out over time and you can expect to be butchering the enemy towards end-game (on the non-insane difficulty settings).  A surprisingly well-polished game for only a two-man indie crew. The only real gripe I have  the lackluster AI which seems to only have one rule set: KAMEKAZI! and the lack of mission types.  Expect to be going from point A to point B and killing everything or collecting X amount of things.Overall an enjoyable game with a good amount of customization.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game of a style (had I the time and the talent) I have always wanted to make.  It's a very pleasant combination of genres.  The closest game I can think of that would be similar is Starscape.Shoot asteroids for resources, kill ships for xp and crew.  Defeat a new type of ship and you get their blueprint.  Get enough of that blueprint and you can build that ship.  Blast your way through blockades, or trade and bribe your way past.The loadout interface is surprisingly easy.  It's fun experimenting with different components and weapons on different hardpoints of different hulls.  Do I add a way stronger blaster and hope I don't run out of reactor power in the middle of a fight?  Do I prefer speed or maneuverability?  Cloak or shields?  Bombs, drones, torpedoes or missiles?  Tracking turrets or forward-facing sheer oomph?The middle-end of the game gets a bit grindy, but the collector/completionist in me still has plenty to do.  The developers are cool and keep adding stuff!			",272,77,3,25,24,1,69

												This was going to be just a game I decided to get that was cheap and could kill time. Turns out I got really tangled into the cool storyline of the game and more than likely had no hope of hating it as combines Space, Pirates, And Zombies!The graphics seem simple but there's a lot more detail than I expected and the backgrounds to the levels are designed beautifully. Probably somethings you might be able to see in space with the right filters.Gameplay can become a bit repetative though. It mostly consists of moving to the next planet, destroying an enemy and possibly mine an asteroid. Buy some parts and upgrade your ship.Still, I've already put a couple of hours into this game and I don't intend to put it down anytime soon.			",113,22,0,14,11,0,8

												All the fun of a top-down space shooter and RPG. Very reminiscent of Star Control II in many ways. Fun strategy and great battle and upgrade options. Story is OK - but like many RPG's, can get a little repetetive and straightforward.			",164,46,9,25,12,2,52

												A neat little space arena that brings back distant memories of Subspace. Probably worth buying  only because there's virtually no competition in the genre. It can be frustrating not being able to zoom out more when you're being shot off-screen, and the drawn graphics such as pilot avatars and Civ relations come off as very sloppy when I think they were going for charming. The main story gets monotonous because you don't choose to grind if you want better tech, you HAVE to grind for better tech. But the gameplay does get a breath of fresh air when you start to battle zombies and build up your uninfected armada. But the real draw is the core gameplay of top-down, space dog-fighting. Taking out an enemy ship on your own is very rewarding and subsequently, being killed will have you cursing under your breath. If you're a masochist like me, there's worse ways to spend three bucks. Plus, it's easy to tell that the devs could do a lot with a little more funding.  ",134,18,0,19,15,1,14

It piqued my interest because it looked vaguely similar to a game I used to play in my younger years (Inner Space, look it up!) but I was not prepared for the awesomeness contained within. This game is my new addiction, I can't get enough of it! The upgrade system is stellar, the different ships and upgrades are varied and lend to an amazing assortment of strategies, suited for multiple play styles. The reputation system within each system independant of each other means you can have fun and not screw up what you were doing in another place. I just love it. I can't wait for #2 now!

												It's like space pokémon. Not in the way of being space pokémon, but as in you have to be a bit OCD and enjoy grinding. Definitely has its wobble-wobble-click moments, though, but if you have bad luck they can be few and far between. The strategy is actually pretty deep once you get used to hammering the space bar and pointing ships places and holding onto your precious goons. I have played this game for 36 hours, apparently, and I haven't even reached the zombie level, so it's pretty long, or I'm pretty terrible.If you're a bit CDO (hahahaha), and enjoy min-maxing and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the pigs, I'd completely reccomend it.

												After following the development of this game for a while I am pleased to say that the wait was worth it. As with games like Terraria and Super Meat Boy, do not be fooled by the simplified graphics as it more than makes up for them in playability and addictive content.The game universe is HUGE, hundreds of star systems each with multiple planets for you to explore. Each planet within a system offers missions or events for you to encounter. As you complete one mission another is generated as the universe evolves with every action you take.On release there are over 30 ships for you to obtain and dozens of technologies to research. In order to advance the available technologies or ship designs you will have to blast your way through the galaxy and salvage the blueprints and data you need.The only criticism I would make is that there is no multiplay feature but the developers are continually adding content to the game and hopefully they integrate multiplayer mode(s) in the future.

												An interesting 2D shooter with RPG and strategy elements. There is not as much variety to weaponry as I would like, however this can be rectified with 3rd party mods. The moment to moment gameplay usually consists of blasting enemy ships to pieces, then swooping over their dropped black boxes to pick up blueprints to build more ships, and resources to level up and purchase new weapons.The Zombies in the game do provide an interesting mix up to the standard space combat, manifesting as infected ships that can shoot zombies at you. The UI could be more intuitive, some interesting options are buried in drop down menus that may not be obvious to most players; the ability for turrets to autofire is extremely useful, but is hidden in a drop down box and thus went unnoticed for a very long time. Graphics wise, the game will win no awards; however the textures and effects are servicable and lean more toward the humorous side of things. The tone of the game is not overly serious, this is quite succintly conveyed by the cheesy dialogue. The story is enitrely forgettable, as is the back story. It all reads like some terrible work of fan fiction; I understand that such a small dev team is unlikely to be able to afford a decent script writer, but attempts could have been made to hone their writing skills through free online courses.The game is fairly customizable upon start up, and runs well even on a back - up Intel GPU on a laptop. Overall, given the price, I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in space games or 2D shooters.

												SPAZ is truly one of the best games i have played since years.Sure, it does not offer the brilliant uber graphics from many modern shooters, but hey - that is neither intended nor necessary.The whole rest - including gameplay itself, long-term motivation and simply FUN to play - is totally worth it. It is as if you can feel around every little corner of the game how much heart has been put into it.Considering the fact that this game was created by mainly only two guys, it is a true masterpiece.Very good job, guys!

												I haven't run into a game quite like this one, and even if someone wanted to make one, they might look at this and give up, because SPAZ seems to do everything right. If you're like me, you will relish the experience of improvment in games... levelling up, getting better gear, the kind of stuff that RPGs and dungeon crawlers are known for. But SPAZ takes that same ambition and does it in a different way, offering a fresh experience that will still satisfy your thirst for being the very best.			",232,66,1,16,22,3,35

												This game hooked me in quickly. 2D space exploration reminiscent of some classic games, but with the scope of controlling several ships at once. Lets you slam into walls rather than holding your hand, but is designed so you can always recover. If names like Star Control 2: The Ur-Quan Masters, Starscape, or Escape Velocity ring a bell as games you've enjoyed, you should definitely give this great indie title a try.			",166,48,2,19,9,0,40

												It's like space pokémon. Not in the way of being space pokémon, but as in you have to be a bit OCD and enjoy grinding. Definitely has its wobble-wobble-click moments, though, but if you have bad luck they can be few and far between. The strategy is actually pretty deep once you get used to hammering the space bar and pointing ships places and holding onto your precious goons. I have played this game for 36 hours, apparently, and I haven't even reached the zombie level, so it's pretty long, or I'm pretty terrible.If you're a bit CDO (hahahaha), and enjoy min-maxing and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the pigs, I'd completely reccomend it.

It does remind one of Star Control 2, but it really comes at things from another angle as well.  There's nothing like cruising around with your fleet.  Try the demo!  You have nothing to lose.  The first 30 minutes were confusing for me, which is apparently actually a good sign, because after that, I was powerfully hooked.  I'm going to play the hell out of this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let my play time be missleading, I owned the non DRM version of SPAZ well before getting a Steam version of it in some humblebundle, I have a good 80+ hours more into the game then Steam says.In any case, this game is a very enjoyable game even with how simplistic its mechanics are. Its combat is enjoyable and the Ally/Hostile factions being seperate in each system allows for you to get what tech you want to get without worrying about if in a different sector you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that faction or not to get tech from the other side in that other sector.It is definitly worth the purchase price even if you don't want to bother getting far enough into the game to have the zomie ships start infesting and would rather just screw around and do combat purely for combats sake.

												The game is hands down one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years, easily in my top 5 indie games when you consider it's ""fun factor"". The graphics are very pleasing especially for a cartoon look. The sound fit's the game well as does the artwork. SPAZ has several difficulty settings ranging from ""casual just play for fun and never lose"" to ""please just kill me now"". On it's most difficult setting even the most experienced gamers will be tested. The galaxy can be created relatively small (still very large offering many hours of gameplay) to massive offering literally hundreds of hours of play time. The map is also randomly generated so replay value is high. Bounty Hunters (free DLC) adds a fourth faction to interact with adding new ways to explore or destroy star systems!All in all a highly suggested purchase that will offer something to all gamers, casual and hardcore alike.

Like first game set it to difficulity casual and turn off bounty population increase stars to 300. When you comfortable playing than change settings back to default. Also remember in battle you can scroll out using the scroll on your mouse makes it so the enemy isn't always going off your screen which it first really made me hate the game. good luck friends I think you will enjoy this and it's on sale at bundlestars atm for 2 bucks!

												SPAZ is great fun initially, but repetitiveness tends to wear off the whole space-faring laser-shooting vast-exploring novelty.It can get frustrating trying to figure out if you're losing your battles because you haven't grinded your tech level up enough, or if you just suck at dogfights. I still haven't figured out yet.7/10, but with little replay value.Great job for an indie game though, definitely worth checking out.			",140,26,4,19,12,1,25

												A grinding yet addictive indie game. If you've played Asteroids back in the day or more recently Moonpod's Starscape game - SPAZ won't be something new to you. Equal parts top down space shooter and RPG elements make for an entertaining experience. I can't wait for a sequel!			",334,46,3,23,17,1,41

												For a two-dimensional space shooter, this game has a lot to offer.  It makes me think of what EVE Online might have been if it had been concieved as a single-player game back in 1995 or so.  It excells as a casual stress reliever and is pretty much guaranteed to keep a player engaged in short bursts for a good time.  However, the set pieces begin to repeat themselves after a while- after all, it is still a work in progress- (In the same manner that Team Fortress 2 is a work in progress.) but a damned good one at that.

												A space scum captain and morality unhindered scientist drag their passive aggressive conscience around the galaxy wiping out and enslaving solar systems for every minor tech upgrade. Narrated by Total Biscuit doing his impression of the most boring voice actor ever. Managing the bits and bobs on your ships to create the ultimate slave-running death boat team is fun and the Bounty Hunters dlc adds a ship that is a forward wall of lasers.

												Score BasedChallenge - A- Game is intuitive, presents a reasonable difficulty progression, and a excellent learning curve Starting Tutorial is fun and engaging presenting the necessary information without being boring Minus a few points for content that wile interesting, where also tedious and overly time consuming.Game Quality - C Game is very well designed and provides a fresh and unique feel that sets it apart from other similar games. Content is fun and varied, supports a large number of play styles and tactics, all retaining use throughout the game Biggest hit was for low Replayability.  after beating the game i just didn’t feel any need to keep playing.Refinement – A Played the entire game, start to finish, and never once crashed or encountered a noticeable bug  Balance and effectiveness of ship types and equipment scale well with difficulty (altho some ships never get used due to late availability in the game, making some of the contents use questionable) Developers seam to take an active role in the games player community (very impressive for only a handfull of people)Presentation – B Not a graphics intensive game, however what is included is well themed and well implemented User interface is intuitive and easy to use Kind of hokey in an odd sort of way.  Story line is a little weak, however still fun and interesting enough Hype was dead on.  This game is exactly what it looks like, exactly as advertised, and well worth the play time.Additional Content – B+ Game supports all manner of Mods and additional content Developers have released a small number of fun holiday themed mods for community use Modding utilities have also been released to general community, they are complete and effective they do however require some investment in time, energy, and learning to use correctly  Relatively active player community, including a functional wiki, and several active modding forums.Fun – C+ Surprisingly Immersive, despite its rather primitive look, engaging and enjoyable Intensive enough to keep the players attention, however some aspects did become tedious and frustrating. Wile not in my top 10.  It defiantly has several core quality’s that make it a 'Must Have' for any game collection  Total Grade – Solid 'B+'this is a very good game.  A solid experience all the more impressive due to volume of content, and the relatively small development staff.  At the time of writing, this the game is priced at $9.99 and it is worth every penny.  Will likely get SPAZ 2 when it comes out.			",245,15,1,34,56,1,73

												I played the SPAZ demo, and I liked it, though maybe not enough to buy the full game if it hadn't been on sale, at a reduced price. Good thing for me that it was, because now I'm 20+ hours into it and I'm loving it!I'm finding a surprising amount of depth and customization in this little indie game. At first, I was a wee bit turned off by the arcadish, Asteroids-like combat. Eventually, I learned that I could build a mid-size command ship with an automated turret armed with a cannon or beam weapon, with me manually controlling the ship's guided missile launchers. With this, I could return fire on an enemy ship while circle-strafing around it, keeping my weakened shields/armor facing away from it. Meanwhile, I could have a couple of small, AI-controlled teammate ships to pepper the enemy from its flanks.So, I grew to love the combat! Especially as I got even deeper into the tech research/acquisition and ship customization/optimization. (Now I'm starting to explore the use of a carrier as my command ship, which launches squadrons of fighter-drones into battle.) The game has become, for me, less arcadish and dependent on hand-eye coordination/reflexes, and more tactical and dependent on thinking/planning.And not just tactical, but strategic as well. Strategic in battle, when figuring out how best to deal with enemy fleets and space stations, but also strategic when plotting my overall route across the star map and  my individual routes within the separate star systems; and also when dealing with the game's three factions (the military-police, the rebel colonists, and the anarchistic bounty hunters).Yes, a great little indie game, especially for a two-man design/developer team. I've already placed the upcoming sequel for SPAZ on my wishlist!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The interface, while remeniscent of StarCon is actually quite different, and the overall goal of jumping from sector to sector, trying to get to the core is quite absorbing...

Just when I start to get bored with the current gameplay, it switches up in an unexpected way.

In short, it's beautiful and charming and a time eater. Now I just need to build up my fleet one ship at a time and head for the core. See you there.			",84,18,6,26,8,0,29

												Goofy name, amazing game.Keeping it short this game is amazing if you're into customizable ships, strategic real time combat, and an open world to travel and explore as you see fit but with a storyline and a specific overall goal. In many ways it's kind of like a real time Space Rangers. And it has a ton of replayability. There are a wide array of skills that dramatically increase the effectiveness of certain mutually exclusive parts (like a shield or a cloaking device) and also allow access to interesting and unique versions of said item. So for instance you might play through one game using cloaks and missiles, whereas another game you might not use a cloak or a shield and instead rely on armor, hull and improving the capability of your crew to repair damage while you're taking it. Options, options, options. All quite well balanced and viable, even if some are 'more viable' than others. ",56,16,0,23,8,0,11

												This game is 90% great and 10% rubbish.  Its great when everything is going smoothly and you're rampaging around the galaxy killing stuff and its terrible when you get a certain map with an AI ship (in one of the fastest ships in the game) that shoots at you for a bit then runs off when it is near death, then comes back and shoots you again before running off.  When you have done this for 10 mins straight you will hate this game as much as I do - however, with a bit of patience you will realise that you can re-fit your ships mid-match to allow you to catch the tricky bugger or use drones which are faster than most ships.  .

												My only issues were...Pacing:  It felt like it took forever to upgrade the mothership and I ended up using the same ships for hours.  Also if  you need resources it's kind of a grind to accumulate them.  And the upgrade system kind of keeps you locked with regard to what weapons you use.  Switching to a different weapon type costs you all of the upgrade bonuses which typically doesn't work.Saving the game: If you get invaded when going to the mothership to save, you could be forced to fight another 10-15 minutes of ships and reinforcements before you can save the game.  I just ended up getting bored of playing and quit without saving.			",72,16,0,22,20,0,6

												If you were a fan of the old school ""escape velocity"" or ""escape velocity nova"", this is the game for you. This is by far the best Space Combat Adventure game to modern date with similar graphics and gameplay. I have replayed this game more than six times already. Most of the Main Mission Quest Cutscenes are voice acted. Can't wait for the second game in the series. If you are you new to this genre of space combat adventure style game i would suggest picking it up and playing it on ""easy"". The beginning is somewhat easy, but towards the mid to end of the game deaths can be pretty costly if you play reckless like i do. Easy to learn and pick up, but hard to master... Suggest to casual and hardcore space combat enthusiasts alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now here's a game that quietly passed underneath my radar. I thought it was going to be too strategy based for my liking, but there isn't a whole lot of strategy to it. It's more like a casual space exploration game that integrates action based combat. As you progress, the battles can get pretty intense, but there's no pressure because you don't lose the game if you lose a battle allowing you to experiment and move at your own pace. Usually you just have to reassess your ship configurations if you get into a situation you can't handle.There is a slight learning curve, but nothing overwhelming. The galaxy is very large providing hundreds of hours of potential play and the game always seems to throw you a new challenge as you advance, so it doesn't get repetitively boring. There's plenty to do between the main story mission, side missions, and the variety of faction objectives in each system. Hands down, SPAZ is a game that should be in your collection.

Plus it doesn't hurt that the game seems to one up the whole player experience every time you think you are just about ready to 'win it' and throws you back on yer heels.

You can appoarch the game in mulitple paths/play styles and what i enjoy most about it, is that it doesnt penalize players for making mistakes or trying sometihng new, in fact it encourages on the fly tatics and skill swaps. Download the demo and give it a shot. 3.5 out of 5 for a indie title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really low-strategy 2d space action game. It's less strategic and more action-y than, for instance, AI War. I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of this game, but then a story event happens that causes you to lose all the territory you took, and at that point it wasn't worth it anymore. I don't know how it ends, and it's really not worth finding out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You will spend many hours in this game blowing up tons of others ships for their resources, their upgrades, or just to blow through their stargates. It can get a bit repeditive, but if you're experiancing that, then go to a system that's a higher level than you, and you will find yourself with more than enough challenge.I'm astounded by the quality of this two man made game, and I look forward to their updates, and anything else they make in the future.

Fly around galaxy, upgrade ship, design ships with parts you want, do quests, earn money, etc. Oh plus it has pirates AND zombies in it! Trailer gives a good sense of what the game is about so you can see if you like that sorta thing. I bought it when it was beta before steam, and my key worked to add to steam which is a nice customer support touch. Plus now it has steam achivements. Oh one tip, don't be afraid of angering a star system, each star system has its own reputation system and won't change how other star systems feel about you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At least you're not alone, you have 2 wingman ships to help you out (which you can also customize and control/give orders to your liking)!Definitely recommend!			",38,2,0,14,8,0,2

												The blackness of space is now beset by nebula all the colours of the rainbow; the silence is broken by the radio chatter of miners and pilots and the parts in between are filled with ships of wondrous variety and multiple mission choices. It's a glorious hybrid  of  top down shooter and strategy; sweetened with the upgradeability of an RPG and retaining a very quirky sense of humour. In short, it's beautiful and charming and a time eater. Now I just need to build up my fleet one ship at a time and head for the core. See you there.			",84,18,6,26,8,0,29

												SPAZ is a great space-combat game. I haven't played a space game this fun since Escape Velocity: Nova. If the 2D space genre at all interests you, you need to buy it, now. Fans of this game should also take a look at Drox Operative, which takes a more Diablo-esque stance to space combat, though I find that controls in that game to be less fun.This game, though fun, lacks a fair amount of depth. it has it's problems, and I shall list some of those out here. Make no mistake, my overall rating for this game would still be an 8/10.First of all, alt+tabbing is a bit of a pain. You need an active window to tab into otherwise it won't work.The intro movies, though short, are not skippable.Skipping the tutorial leaves you at a bit of a disadvantage level wise.I cannot figure out enemy aggro. Sometimes, they choose to target exclusively my own ships despite other enemy ships attacking them.On a mission to kill enemy scouts, if the scouts are friendly, it is impossible because my own ships will not target them.I cannot select enemy ships to be targeted from the tactical menu. Targeting specific enemy ships can be a pain sometimes and this would help immensely.Enemy ships will often only attack my escorts. And my escorts will fly way off to attack enemy ships. This has led to all my rez being depleted while I just sit there and do nothing.More AI options are needed. Even defensive AI is way too aggressive. An AI option where friendly ships never leave the screen would be nice.Better yet, formations would be a welcome addition to the game. Even just one basic formation would be extremely helpful in keeping my fleet in line.Friendly AI ships get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off way too easily.There aren't enough missions to weaken the enemy faction in a given system. This forces me to either attack a level 3 space station, or make peace with the enemy at the expense of my ally.As a final sidenote, I love the radio chatter that goes on. You should allow people to upload their own chatter for inclusion into the game somehow.			",36,4,1,6,4,0,2

												10/10 Very addictive game.  I played about 1 hour of this game 18 months ago then came back and started a new game 2 weeks ago.  It took me 80 hrs to complete a new game.  The addictive part of the game is chasing the next upgrade, blueprint or skill levelup.   I recomend game saving alot early-mid game.  The game was very challenging till, Hammerhead ship dropped toward the middle of chapter 3. The game became super easy after getting max level cannons and Mammath during chapter 4.  Mammath is OP with triple mount Partical Cannons, double mount Mass Drivers, and Battle Station.   This game reminds me of a 100x more advanced version of Asteroids, that I played hundreds of times in the mid-80s at the YMCA.  The game has a good story and great 2d graphics.  Another similarly enjoyable game to try is Reassembly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now of course there is room for improvement but it does so many things well. The battles are fun, intense and usually pretty challenging. The management elements have depth and require thought and skill but aren't as daunting as you would expect. Un-lockable hull types with the ability to customize those hulls, weapons, shields and more. A very pretty game graphically, especially for an indie game with a 2 man development team. I've spent time just watching the A.I. battles that play in the background on the main menu screen. Now the ship controls can feel a little odd at first but once you get used to them they make sense. In short, if you have any interest in space battles and fun sci fi stories you have to own this game. I love it and have bought multiple copies for my friends. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed this 2D space game.  I put in about 25-30 hours of casual gameplay into this game before I finally decided to run through to the end.The basic idea is to level up, upgrade skills, and move to higher leveled solar systems.  Doing story missions or misc missions each solar system has.  There is no end to the basic solar system quests.You unlock ships and weapons by killing them or buying them.  Fun to pick what type of upgrades and ships to use in combat.  It can be boring if you want a story or bosses, but it can be fun if you just like collecting things and upgrading.The combat is fun and simple, but sometimes the AI has the advantage.

												The best part of this game comes in the form of the free Bounty Hunters expansion. This is because the Arena matches act as advanced tutorials that teach the player the subtleties of this game, such as kiting and how best to use tactics in order to win matches against seemingly high odds. A far better fit than the 'shoot-em-all boom boom boom' tutorial the game initially has, and it explains advanced tactics to easily bored thickies like me. So yeah, I like this action/strategy/RPG space game quite a bit on the virtue that loot is kept to a ♥♥♥♥ing minimum and grinding is easily escapable.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Similar to that underplayed Starport game (that nobody knows about). It's plays perfectly, although it needs some multipalyer action to be recognized in my opinion. That's where SPAZ 2 jumps in, once it releases. It's a great game altogether, but can get boring and repetitive at times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game! Put simply, this game is amazing! You can upgrade your ships (you choose how and what). You unlock new ships as the game progresses as well as new weapons. Controls are pretty good and what you upgrade matters (never upgrade your engines and your ship will be super slow and turning will require a huge radius and will be super slow. The game looks really good and actually has a pretty good story. Bottom line, buy this game already! its well worth the price and there is lots of replayability.

												If you were a fan of the old school ""escape velocity"" or ""escape velocity nova"", this is the game for you. This is by far the best Space Combat Adventure game to modern date with similar graphics and gameplay. I have replayed this game more than six times already. Most of the Main Mission Quest Cutscenes are voice acted. Can't wait for the second game in the series. If you are you new to this genre of space combat adventure style game i would suggest picking it up and playing it on ""easy"". The beginning is somewhat easy, but towards the mid to end of the game deaths can be pretty costly if you play reckless like i do. Easy to learn and pick up, but hard to master... Suggest to casual and hardcore space combat enthusiasts alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun, but procedural generation is (in general) sort of boring. There are lots of systems, to unlock to get to the core but they are all the same. The thing that adds interest is the progression of unlocking new ships and new weapons and you discover and buy them.Good tip if you are starting: If a faction has things for sale in a certain system, do the quests in that system that make them like you so you can buy it.  Will anyone ever make a game as good as Escape Velocity: Nova? Thats what I want! Seriously if you know of one please send me a message.			",53,8,0,6,7,0,11

												Top-down shooter with RPG elements. Earn experience, gather resources, upgrade skills and ships.Key points: Sometimes humorous, often annoying voice-overs. New game modes introduced as you progress mix things up, but not a lot. Ship upgrades and passive bonuses make some difference in strategy and formation, but require enormous amounts of resources that can be a drag to collect. AI is capable of possessing awe-inspiring stupidity. This game is nigh endless--you'll become exhausted with this game well before you finish it. Hours of mindless fun.Bottom line: Recommended for people who like goal-oriented and hectic top-down action.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the simplistic design and humor fool you, this game can be very challenging at times. The difficultly curve is just right to prove enough challenge to keep things interesting and the progression keeps things fresh enough as to not become too repetitive or dull. I love games that really give you a sense of progression and feel where your actions actually matter. The end-game micromanagement is just tough enough to keep you on your toes but not cause you to rage quit. If you like top-down arcade shooters, flying around as a pirate, managing your own fleet, saving the galaxy, or any combination there of, you should give this a look.			",1444,558,79,226,189,12,328

												I played it yesterday all day long... this is the kind of game that sticks to your subconscious and stays there, I continued playing it in my dreams... all night long. That's why it is difficult to let it go. The crave to advance and enhance your ships, and the way to do it just drains your volition dry. I suspect the design of this game was made taking in to account our neural responses. There is even an evil satisfaction when your crew picks up hostages from the floating escape pods... and some of them will be jettisoned out into space, and teared appart by the ships because they refuse to be recruited... allright I confess I have ran over many of them. Pretty scary.  10/10			",37,6,0,6,6,0,11

												Space Pirates and Zombies appears at first glance nothing more than a retro style, 2d space shooter. But after playing it a lot, multiple playthroughs and challenges, it has a ton of depth lying beneath it's 2d surface.You start as the leader of a small band of merchant pirates yourself seeking your fortune by collecting mineral deposits call rez. There are rumors of enormous stockpiles or rez near the core worlds so you set off to seek them out. Along the way you encounter zombies and eventually take on the gargantuan task of ridding the galaxy of them.The first thing you do is set your world settings. There's multiple difficulty levels, 5 or 6 in total so you can vary your experience immensely, as well as settings for galaxy size, pirate density and tech distribution. You can create a unique experience for every game.Once you are playing the game has three main areas. First is the galaxy and system maps. You travel to different systems and you can select various missions in each one to level up your crew, buy or steal tech and collect rez and ship designs. The systems all have different levels so you have to decide what you can potentially accomplish.The next big part is your ship loadout screens, tech and hangar. In the tech screen you spend data (experience) that you have gather to level up various ship systems like beam weapons or shields. Each level increases the effectiveness of your systems and some levels are a prerequisite to advanced tech. Like you need level three beams to deploy particle beams or something. Then in the hanger you choose which hulls to use and what systems to put on them. You start with three hangars at the beginning of the game and get four by the end with larger capacity for larger hulls.The final major area is actually flying your ships on the planet or area of interest screens. They aren't always combat screens, some missions you might gather rez for example. But while on these screens you can switch control between all your ships as well as issuing orders to the other ships to do certain things like rendezvous over here or attack this target. Sometimes pirates show up, sometimes zombies, all depends on the mission. I found there to be a good variety of events and missions.The actual combat is extremely interesting if you make it challenging enough. Because there are so many types of ships and systems the way you fight can be varied. You might make a fast missile boat ship and whittle targets down while keeping out of their gun range. Or you might make a stealth capable ship, get in close and crush em with high powered beam cutters. Or maybe you want to use rotating turrets to track fast moving targets. It's up to you, there's no wrong way to do it, and a lot of times you have to adjust on the fly based on the tech available.Hull designs are obtained by killing enemy ships of that hull. Sometimes one ship is enough but most need 3 or 4 blueprint pieces. Tech for subsystems like weapons, engines and all that is obtained from planets either by trading with them or blowing up their bases and taking it. There's also specialist crew members who give you distinct bonuses like +10% cannon damage. So that has to be taken into account as well.In all there's a ton of ways to customize your game and your ships and it's very fun. I enjoyed leveling in this game immensely. The only downside is the hardest difficulties are REALLY hard and you end up basically grinding resources in low level areas to advance. But hard should be hard so I commend the devs for doing that. I guess you could fly smarter, not harder, if you're really good and get by with less.Finally there's challenges too via a little space arena the pirates run. It's a good way to make money and there's some achievements with it. Some are very hard.This game simply rocks and you have to try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The grahics are both fun, and don't seem to get old very fast. Space shooter plus customizable space craft & tech tree to support your particular playstyle. Like missles or lazers? Want to use mega-bombers, or carriers with a small fleet of its own craft? You get to decide which ships to build in your 'home base', how they are armed, etc.Well worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Goofy name, amazing game.Keeping it short this game is amazing if you're into customizable ships, strategic real time combat, and an open world to travel and explore as you see fit but with a storyline and a specific overall goal. In many ways it's kind of like a real time Space Rangers. And it has a ton of replayability. There are a wide array of skills that dramatically increase the effectiveness of certain mutually exclusive parts (like a shield or a cloaking device) and also allow access to interesting and unique versions of said item. So for instance you might play through one game using cloaks and missiles, whereas another game you might not use a cloak or a shield and instead rely on armor, hull and improving the capability of your crew to repair damage while you're taking it. Options, options, options. All quite well balanced and viable, even if some are 'more viable' than others. ",56,16,0,23,8,0,11

												After paying two dollars, I really didn’t expect much, but this game certainly delivered. I could tell right away a lot of love and care went into making this. What also made this game great was the amount of customization you could put into your ships, from better guns to shield boosters, you could pimp your little cruiser into a true killing machine. Pros:           Huge amount of customization          Lots of gameplay          no glitches (that I encountered at least)          Vast number of ships to unlock          Very rewarding loot Cons:           VERY, VERY GRINDY          Lots of repreat quests          game is a little too long  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A little slow at first, but once you get your first few blueprints for new ships, the amount of customziation you can do is amazing!Fun top-down space shooter, a blend of space invaders, battletech, and Duke Nukem [the humor]. The grahics are both fun, and don't seem to get old very fast. Space shooter plus customizable space craft & tech tree to support your particular playstyle. Like missles or lazers? Want to use mega-bombers, or carriers with a small fleet of its own craft? You get to decide which ships to build in your 'home base', how they are armed, etc.Well worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I spent a fair amount of time with this version and pre-Steam version, combat is lots of fun with missiles, turrets and mining, game is very atmospheric, and you feel like you are in the groove in the early game. Then.. zombies. Difficulty curve goes way, way up, you die frequently, and start getting stuck in bottlenecks in the map where you have to defeat near-impossible odds to progress. Still, it won't be the first game I never finished but thoroughly enjoyed my time with until it beat the tar out of me. Great game, sequel please....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a ton of fun with this indie gem.  The game is easy to pick up, but delivers on strategic challenge later on.   The battles are usually fast-paced and enjoyable, with many different valid strategic approaches.  Except for a few technologies that go obsolete, all the equipment you find can be used right up through the endgame, because you can equip small AI-controlled helper ships to help you on missions. I did find that the game was too easy, but I could have raised the difficulty.  Also, sometimes the enemy AI will use a fast ship and simply fly away from you, which it can do indefinitely, making it impossible to complete a mission.  This means that you may have to repeat a few missions for no other reason than that.  If you want a multiplayer experience, hold off and buy SPAZ 2, as this one unfortunately lacks that feature.

One unusual item is a list of  ""coming soon"" features on the menu screen. The ""and bounty hunters"" bit is definitely new since I last played, and I seem to see a few new ship blueprints, so obviously they are hard at work adding DLC.

There are also different mission types from destroying fortified positions, escorts, stealth, and assassinations to keep things interesting.Worth every penny for its cost. And with new game mechanics and updates (even official mods) coming out it shows a promising future. However after approximently 70 hours of gameplay it starts to feel a little repetative.

												This could be a good game. Unfortunately, there are a few hoops to jump through to try and get the game to work correctly.It's great that the developer responds to the forum, but it's less than great that so many people have the black screen issue that locks their entire computer up except for sound and mouse movement. Since so many people have this issue, it's a code problem, not a 'my computer' problem. Especially since there are literally no games I can't run except this one and I have a steam library of close to 200 games plus probably another 50 that are installed from other sources.Track down the problem and patch it, don't tell me it's because I overclock when it doesn't affect other games. Half the graphics cards on the market have custom overclocks from the manufacturer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The main twist is that you get to create a small fleet of ships, which you can then fly into combat. During combat, you can switch between any of the ships in your fleet at will. That feature (along with a high level of ship loadout customization) keeps the game interesting.Don't be fooled by the comical title, this the game is a serious work of art and is a worth a buy.

												This game is a wonderful blend of action, role playing, and horror elements.You are part of a crew trying to get rich in the universe while generally aiding the local police/military forces (UTA) or rebels trying to shut them down (Civ). The entire game revolves around you doing pretty much whatever you want, but never making that easy.The variety of ships is sure to appeal to pretty much everyone (Carriers, Battleships, Gunboats, and even a few cargo vessels) and the combat and ship customization is very, very well done.

												Surprisingly much more fun than I had anticipated. The controls need a major revamp, it would do much better as a twin stick shooter, but it's still pretty awesome...

												First my profile: 44y, born in France and living in Canada, I am a casual player for the last 25y ( and an adict the first 5y) so I played tons of games from various genre, mostly on PC.I highly recommend this game, mostly because it's fun.I have rarely completed game twice but as I foundly remembered the game, I tried it once more and realized there was a new update that added bounty hunters and realized they re-balanced the game, which likely explain some of the earlier bad score.I somewhat forgot some of the game mechanic but it all came back and I can  say doing it all over again was pure joy.The game has a good mix of strategy, story telling, action and progression.I love to pilote a small fleet and the many options to go about the difficult missions. Some complain the difficulty curve is too high, especially in mid-game, but I would say that it is a welcome challenge as the AI is quite weak and they are many ways to exploit it. There is a bit of grinding but I kind of like it myself being a bit perfectionist with games and liking to explore all there is to see and find secrets so be warned.It's a two man game and I find that inspiring, those guys have talents and I can't wait to put my hand on SPAZ 2 when it comes out.THe graphics are not for everyone but I personally like it and 2D worked for piloting the ships.The music was repetitive but pleasant and I did not get tired of it. I find music can play a bit part of your long term memory of the joy of playing a game and this one is still lingering in my subconcient.Overall a 9/10 for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An indie game i expected a couple hours of play at best like with most indie games, this however surprised me greatly in gameplay story and gametime.  I spent nearly a week playing this and that is a lot for me, The story is by no means amazing but it is still decent and quite unique, the gameplay is unique as well and is very fun.As you work through the game you make enemies allies and can upgrade 2 to 3 and soon 4 ships of varying sizes and types.  The flying is a bit wonky least for me so I would usually pick a bigger ship with turrets to sit and fight.This game has a demo and at the very least is worth checking out that to see if you wanna buy it, its better than some of the higher priced games I have bought and very much worth the time and money for an enjoyable indie.

												A moderately enjoyable space shooter. The early gameplay and atmosphere engage the player well, but by the time you have giant bloated ships they don't look good and the game throws imbalanced scenarios at the player to compensate for basic 2D mechanics.Overall not bad for an indie game. 7/10, would recommend on a sale.

												SPAZ is an excellent combo of fun, weird, easy to play, strategy, and action! Just the right amounts each of simplicity and complexity. Easily jump in for a little fun, or play for hundreds of hours. Great replay value with random galaxy-creation, randomized quests, and many different ways to build your ships! The developer is so cool that when they finished the Bounty Hunters expansion, which adds a lot to the game, they sent it out as an automatic free update for everyone who already had the game!

												SPAZ... oh SPAZ, how i love you... Space Pirates and Zombies is a game that deserve... Nein! It NEEDS more attention. Its a great game made by 2 great dudes. They are working (slowly) on SPAZ 2.I really have nothing, nothing bad to say about this game. The trailer they got is a great way to show off how to game works, what you see is what you get. So if you like what you see then buy it, its a great game.Here's what i think of the game. The game is a fun little game where you fly around with a small fleet of spaceship. You have a mothership that you can't control and it rebuilds and refit all your spaceships to your need. You start of with only one ship, and gain the ability to use other ships by destroying that type of ship, once destroyed the ship drops a blueprint, collect them to unlock the ship for yourself. The larger the ship, the more blueprints you need. So a small fighter might only need two pieces of that blueprint, destroy 2, collect the blueprint and the fighter is yours. While cruisers and battleships might need up to 8 blueprints, and they usally have alot more health and are harder to kill.You also get the ability to refit your ships with weapons you want to use. Each ship has its own number of hardpoints, you can mix and match and put whatever you want on your ship. Want to fire kinetic rounds? sure. Lasers? Why not. Plasma balls? It's your ship, your rules.Now this might be a minor spoiler but they got it in the title of the game so... Story goes that you are a space pirate, each solar system is cut off from each other so what you do in one system won't carry over to the next. To get to another system (a higher leveled one with more advanced ships) you'll have to fight through a UTA Blockade, they block access to the warpgates you need access to procedd in the game, either destroy them all or bribe them to give you access. Each system has 2 factions. The UTA (Military, always blocks the warpgates with blockades). And the Civvies, they control mining and science operations in deep space and usally let you use their facility freely (So you can mine resource, et.c.). You will randomly get a faction rating in each starsystem, sometimes they love you from the start, sometimes they hate you. You'll never know. Pick your side, start blasting ships from the oppossite side and soon you'll make some great friends in that starsystem.Later on in the game Zombie ships start to appear, and near the end of the game they will be your main enemy. The UTA and Civvies notice the major zombie problem and team up together with you to reclaim the galaxy from the zombies. Zombie ships are unique ships that you can not unlock. They consist of two type of ships, fighting type ships that look like infected normal ships. They will engage anyone mindlessly. And then we got the breed type ships that look like human bodyparts of some sort. They infect ships without shields, if your ship gets infected you have little time to react, either self destruct your ship so the zombies can't gain control of it and use it against you... or make the hard choice and vent the ship of all crew except the captain, so the infection can't spread. It's a hard job late game, but someone has to purge the galaxy from the zombies.There is also a fourth faction that was released freely with the game. And they are the Bounty Hunters. There ships are unique with specific traits and are also very, very over powered. If you go around in a starsystem they ""control"" and wreck havoc, you will start to lose respect with them. Lose to much of it and they will warp in when you least want it (in a difficult fight with another faction) and try to blow you out of the space, for the most part they succedd with this. One of the hardest achivements ingame want's you to destroy their space station in the hardest type of starsystem.So will you use standard weapons like lasers, kinetic rounds or plasma to destroy your enemies? or will you go for missiles and torpedos instead? Why not use EMP weapons and energy drainers to drain all energy from your enemy ships so they can't fire their weapons or escape? Nukes? Sure, SPAZ has them. Drones for carriers, that too. There is alot to do with this game, and it gave me alot of hours of fun.The only three really bad parts about this game are:Interface dosen't look very professional.The story isen't that good, it had one somewhat good plot twist in it tho.The last ""part"" of the game, the ""purge"" all galaxy of zombie threat's is a repeative and somewhat boring job to do. Everything before that is fun tho.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												does exactly what a space strategy rpg should... allow you to pilot awesome ships into combat, apply varied tactical maneuvers that count. There's fleet, sector relationship management and a decent storyline (c'mon). After replaying the game twice, there are some minor flaws but I see how everything went right: The devs focused on EXCATLY what was important, and I enjoyed it immensely.pros:- its fun. command your fleet against a solid AI, where you'll need micro tactics, planning and skill.- rewarding, make the right moves and you won't need to grind.- challenging, difficulty grows with you- requires strategy for star systems- good learning curve at the startcons:- learning curve can be tricky: if you pick the wrong things or try to do something stupid like bashing through a super high level defense... duh you die, and pay for it harshly.- make the wrong choice to leap forward on the story and again you pay for it as costs rise.- some inbalance in weapons and ships. Cannons tend to be more straight forward. Lasers are awesome at the end. Bombs need more tactics to be effective. Enemy will lean more towards throwing heavy weapons to decapitate rather than survive etc			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An indie game i expected a couple hours of play at best like with most indie games, this however surprised me greatly in gameplay story and gametime.  I spent nearly a week playing this and that is a lot for me, The story is by no means amazing but it is still decent and quite unique, the gameplay is unique as well and is very fun.As you work through the game you make enemies allies and can upgrade 2 to 3 and soon 4 ships of varying sizes and types.  The flying is a bit wonky least for me so I would usually pick a bigger ship with turrets to sit and fight.This game has a demo and at the very least is worth checking out that to see if you wanna buy it, its better than some of the higher priced games I have bought and very much worth the time and money for an enjoyable indie.

												I used to love a game called Escape Velocity which is now more or less defunct, but SPAZ has brought back that classic feel and gameplay style of 2D arcade shooter + galaxy exploration in a great way.Really nice art direction and a couple of extra additions in gameplay mechanic to the old EV style.I'm not sure what exactly I would change but it would be nice if the ship and abilities upgrade systems were a little different. I think it's a bit overwhelming at first and difficult to make sense of all the different options.I'm also not a big fan of the mouse mechanic for steering and aiming the ship. While I can appreciate a certain amount of added control, I much prefer a keyboard based rotation mechanism. The static rotation speed combined with the free-motion mouse movement doesn't match up and is difficult to use.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My only suggestion is to play it on normal difficulty or easier, as the harder difficulties compound the problem with this game stretching into the bad end of the repetition scale. Still, with a host of ships to build and customize with many different attachments, it's fun to simply try out new combinations and strategies. The AI is competent enough, though exploitable (and your AI controlled ships are sometimes similarly stupid). This actually works in the games favor, however, IMO. Overall, the controls work great, there's lot's of customizability and skill that goes into your victories and defeats, and this game was made by 2 guys. I want to see what they can do next, personally, so I'd like to see them make some money to do so.			",125,20,0,15,5,1,26

(such as whether a mission should tell you how far you are in it)and the rest being so small and un-interupting that I can no-longer remember them!this game is awesome and i recomend it to everyone (even people who dont like this kind of game as it might confince you other wise because it is easly the best of its kind)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a huge sci-fi fan AND an absolute zombie fanatic...this game is right up my alley.Recommended for anyone who likes the customizability of choosing parts for your ship (better weapons require more power which leaves less power for your other systems such as shields and engines, but a better reactor might require more mass which will slow down your ship...decisions decisions!) and 2-d dogfighting which this game thrives on. At least you're not alone, you have 2 wingman ships to help you out (which you can also customize and control/give orders to your liking)!Definitely recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Apart from extremely long start of game loading time, SPAZ is overall a fun top-down 4X game. Customisation is cool, but also feels like once you die (and if you keep dying) you'll be reset back to square one. Forcing you to mine for very small mineral patches and do low level jobs just to get enough to build you crazy expensive ships. Cheap game, so value for money - 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's very fun and addicting I might say. Even though it's quite repetitive, it makes you want to level up and explore every inch of the game. If you're underleveled in this game it really put you on a difficult spot to win. But that's also a challenge on its own so to me its a win win. There's also a lot of way you can go through galaxies. Stealth tech/Bombs/Turrets.. A LOT OF WAYS!!! That's the fun of it. For now I only use brute strength and upgrade engines and weapon upgrades but little do I know that other give me such a big advantage as well. If you're the kind of person like progression this would be it. Not to mention you can make other ships by reverse engineered the ones that you destroyed. Pretty cool system huh?? No longer you need to feel frustrated over a ship that's better than you. Overall I would give this game 8/10, It's there but after a while it would get a bit of grinding spree since the ships that you fought sometimes overpowered you by a mile.

												This is quite a charming little game. It has a unique gameplay which reminds me of many other space shooter games, but it has a small twist of strategy and RPGs, which grants a good deal of customization. Despite what its looks in the begining, its graphics is actually rather pretty, lending a sense of deep, dangerous space, filled with lots of bright colors and galatic bodies.From 1 to 5, I think I would rate this 4, but being  very close to 5. Some multiplay, more variation (there is allot variation, but the game can be rather long so becomes repetative) and less reading could proberbly get it up on the 5. But to be honest, Its a very satisfied 4 :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is really a good game.  And, it's only about 150MB to install.  It's a space exploration, resource gathering, space combat strategy.  I'm not much into RTS games, and this game doesn't play like one.  You have a mother ship, and then control individual ships in your fleet.  You can switch between any ship, and also set up AI for those ships you aren't currently controlling.  The galaxy is proceedurally generated when you start a new game, and you can control the number of star systems up to about 300 total.  Each star system has a level requirement before you can visit it, and you have to deal with the ships guarding the Jump Gates (bribe or destroy) before you can move freely between systems you have access to.Really, try the demo.  The tutorial is for the first system but seems to open up after about the 1st or 2nd mission you take.  This 2 person dev team deserve your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Space Pirates and Zombies. Remember Starscape? This feels a lot like a very well-done and much-improved sequal to Starscape. You fly around different space zones collecting resources that you use to upgrade your mothership, unlock new fighter chassis and build fighters.So how does it hold up? I think very well. A word about control: Don't bother without a mouse. Personally, there are very few games that require both mouse and keyboard that I will play with a laptop touchpad. This is not one of them. It's a very twitchy game, and the awkwardness of having one hand under my other wrist and having to click both buttons with my thumb is just too clumsy for me.The graphics are fun. The fighter/shuttle designs are different enough to be interesting, and the effects are flashy enough to be from a JJ Abrams movie.They make a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt at realistic physics, which is not really the rule with space games. That is to say: inertia is a thing, but not the infinite thing that it really ought to be. If you cut your engines, you will keep going but eventually stop. Is it always impressive when a game DOES have realistic physics? Yup. Is it always fun? Nope.  To that point, SPAZ makes it fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this game for about a week now. I find it enjoyable and challenging even though it gets a little repetitive after while. You are always a step behind in ships but you can upgrade your weapons, shields, armor, etc before the enemy. Early ships are given to you once you beat it in battle. The smaller ships are done in one battle. As you get to larger ships you have to beat the same type ship from twice to, well I am at level 54 and I have beaten some ships 4 times already and I am only at 80% reverse engineered for that ship type.  You always have ways of getting Spaz (money) to spend, sometimes quickly other times you have to work for it. As you move up to higher levels the battles get more intense and are fun. Right now I have three ships on Level 54 the enemy might start with 4 or 5 then as you beat them they warp in a few more with one a little bigger than what you have sometimes. In between battles you can upgrade and find Spaz. The universe is quite larger with higher levels as you get to the inside systems. I just made it to the Zombie level and came back to upgrade more. I was no where near leveled up enough to stay there.I now have played the game twice. Very repetitive all the way through the game. Same thing in each system just as you level up you have more ships to beat, then the Bounty Hunters start showing up right after or during a battle making it that much harder to beat that level. Very long game to beat. Bounty Hunter Challenges are fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of their last updates added bounty hunters, which change gameplay by a fair amount. You can play with or without the bounty hunters, though, as this game has a good selection of options when you are starting a new game. It's almost a sandbox game, but it's really more of a free-form RPG where you can go wherever you want whenever you want. It doesn't overwhelm you, though, because the difficulty for each solar system is clearly displayed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rough around the edges, poorly explained, occasionally feels like a grind, and I love it regardless. The small team that created this did so ""to make the kinds of games they used to make, but not anymore"" and I can't think of a better way to put it. Like many 90s computer games, you'll start off totally lost once the extended tutorial ends, but that waywardness is the price you pay for the freedom SPaZ gives you.The price has gone down to less than five dollars before, so I'd pick it up then. I should also note I had to install a semi-official hack to make the game run at more than 2 FPS late in the game on a rig that can support games like Shogun II, so your mileage may vary in this regard.

												I decided to write a review for this game because I noted that I've sunk 31 hours into it, yet I have little to no memory of actually playing.  Therefore, I guess the game was addictive enough to keep me involved, yet not engaging enough to leave a lasting impression.  I vaguely recall zipping around a 2D landscape doing missions that were reminiscent of the Escape Velocity series, but I also remember that there was an annoying amount of grinding.  Still, giving it the thumbs up since it kept me playing for so long, but don't expect any great substance out of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												does exactly what a space strategy rpg should... allow you to pilot awesome ships into combat, apply varied tactical maneuvers that count. There's fleet, sector relationship management and a decent storyline (c'mon). After replaying the game twice, there are some minor flaws but I see how everything went right: The devs focused on EXCATLY what was important, and I enjoyed it immensely.pros:- its fun. command your fleet against a solid AI, where you'll need micro tactics, planning and skill.- rewarding, make the right moves and you won't need to grind.- challenging, difficulty grows with you- requires strategy for star systems- good learning curve at the startcons:- learning curve can be tricky: if you pick the wrong things or try to do something stupid like bashing through a super high level defense... duh you die, and pay for it harshly.- make the wrong choice to leap forward on the story and again you pay for it as costs rise.- some inbalance in weapons and ships. Cannons tend to be more straight forward. Lasers are awesome at the end. Bombs need more tactics to be effective. Enemy will lean more towards throwing heavy weapons to decapitate rather than survive etc			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game - the trailer shows the gameplay perfectly.You will have lots of fun playing this game and there will be moments where you genuinely LOL(such as when your cannons blast a hole in an enemy ship and a whole crapload of their crew get squirted out into space, wriggling like maggots.. then get squished by another passing ship). The start is a bit slow but once you've opened up several star systems and obtained blueprints to your first large ship it picks up momentum; once you start collecting blueprints for huge ships it really shines. Another recent reviewer complained about spending half his time mining - you only need to do that very early on, after that it becomes a pastime to blast enemy ships and scoop up what's left of them to get rich.The cons: you may get very addicted!

												Highly addictive, and loads of fun. You collect resources, fight battles, gain levels, build bigger and better ships to take on bigger and better enemies and further unlock an impressively expansive galaxy. It's not a complicated game, but it can challenge you (and that's a good thing), which is where the addictive quality of SPAZ comes along. You never feel overpowered (not yet at least) because there are always more solar systems to explore with higher levels required to clear them, but you never feel underpowered either, because you get out as much effort as you put in to leveling up. You have to level up, and you have to explore, but level-grinding doesn't seem so bad because there are so many activities to do with a certain ammount of variety to them.  I also like the fact that you can play both sides of the coin when it comes to making allies or enemies out of the two factions of SPAZ's lore, and take on missions according to how your favor with either faction benefits you.I've sunk in about a dozen hours so far and have barely scratched the surface of the universe I'm exploring because of the game's exploratory rewards feeding the kleptomaniac in me. Highly reccomended. Oh, and did I mention that this game is loads of fun?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the SPAZ demo, and I liked it, though maybe not enough to buy the full game if it hadn't been on sale, at a reduced price. Good thing for me that it was, because now I'm 20+ hours into it and I'm loving it!I'm finding a surprising amount of depth and customization in this little indie game. At first, I was a wee bit turned off by the arcadish, Asteroids-like combat. Eventually, I learned that I could build a mid-size command ship with an automated turret armed with a cannon or beam weapon, with me manually controlling the ship's guided missile launchers. With this, I could return fire on an enemy ship while circle-strafing around it, keeping my weakened shields/armor facing away from it. Meanwhile, I could have a couple of small, AI-controlled teammate ships to pepper the enemy from its flanks.So, I grew to love the combat! Especially as I got even deeper into the tech research/acquisition and ship customization/optimization. (Now I'm starting to explore the use of a carrier as my command ship, which launches squadrons of fighter-drones into battle.) The game has become, for me, less arcadish and dependent on hand-eye coordination/reflexes, and more tactical and dependent on thinking/planning.And not just tactical, but strategic as well. Strategic in battle, when figuring out how best to deal with enemy fleets and space stations, but also strategic when plotting my overall route across the star map and  my individual routes within the separate star systems; and also when dealing with the game's three factions (the military-police, the rebel colonists, and the anarchistic bounty hunters).Yes, a great little indie game, especially for a two-man design/developer team. I've already placed the upcoming sequel for SPAZ on my wishlist!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a great mesh of the space strategy and space shooter genera's. Like most space games, you start out in a dinky bucket of bolts, and then work your way up to better ships. The main twist is that you get to create a small fleet of ships, which you can then fly into combat. During combat, you can switch between any of the ships in your fleet at will. That feature (along with a high level of ship loadout customization) keeps the game interesting.Don't be fooled by the comical title, this the game is a serious work of art and is a worth a buy.

Content is fun and varied, supports a large number of play styles and tactics, all retaining use throughout the game Biggest hit was for low Replayability.  after beating the game i just didn’t feel any need to keep playing.Refinement – A Played the entire game, start to finish, and never once crashed or encountered a noticeable bug  Balance and effectiveness of ship types and equipment scale well with difficulty (altho some ships never get used due to late availability in the game, making some of the contents use questionable) Developers seam to take an active role in the games player community (very impressive for only a handfull of people)Presentation – B Not a graphics intensive game, however what is included is well themed and well implemented User interface is intuitive and easy to use Kind of hokey in an odd sort of way.  Story line is a little weak, however still fun and interesting enough Hype was dead on.  This game is exactly what it looks like, exactly as advertised, and well worth the play time.Additional Content – B+ Game supports all manner of Mods and additional content Developers have released a small number of fun holiday themed mods for community use Modding utilities have also been released to general community, they are complete and effective they do however require some investment in time, energy, and learning to use correctly  Relatively active player community, including a functional wiki, and several active modding forums.Fun – C+ Surprisingly Immersive, despite its rather primitive look, engaging and enjoyable Intensive enough to keep the players attention, however some aspects did become tedious and frustrating. Wile not in my top 10.  It defiantly has several core quality’s that make it a 'Must Have' for any game collection  Total Grade – Solid 'B+'this is a very good game.  A solid experience all the more impressive due to volume of content, and the relatively small development staff.  At the time of writing, this the game is priced at $9.99 and it is worth every penny.  Will likely get SPAZ 2 when it comes out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SPAZ... oh SPAZ, how i love you... Space Pirates and Zombies is a game that deserve... Nein! It NEEDS more attention. Its a great game made by 2 great dudes. They are working (slowly) on SPAZ 2.I really have nothing, nothing bad to say about this game. The trailer they got is a great way to show off how to game works, what you see is what you get. So if you like what you see then buy it, its a great game.Here's what i think of the game. The game is a fun little game where you fly around with a small fleet of spaceship. You have a mothership that you can't control and it rebuilds and refit all your spaceships to your need. You start of with only one ship, and gain the ability to use other ships by destroying that type of ship, once destroyed the ship drops a blueprint, collect them to unlock the ship for yourself. The larger the ship, the more blueprints you need. So a small fighter might only need two pieces of that blueprint, destroy 2, collect the blueprint and the fighter is yours. While cruisers and battleships might need up to 8 blueprints, and they usally have alot more health and are harder to kill.You also get the ability to refit your ships with weapons you want to use. Each ship has its own number of hardpoints, you can mix and match and put whatever you want on your ship. Want to fire kinetic rounds? sure. Lasers? Why not. Plasma balls? It's your ship, your rules.Now this might be a minor spoiler but they got it in the title of the game so... Story goes that you are a space pirate, each solar system is cut off from each other so what you do in one system won't carry over to the next. To get to another system (a higher leveled one with more advanced ships) you'll have to fight through a UTA Blockade, they block access to the warpgates you need access to procedd in the game, either destroy them all or bribe them to give you access. Each system has 2 factions. The UTA (Military, always blocks the warpgates with blockades). And the Civvies, they control mining and science operations in deep space and usally let you use their facility freely (So you can mine resource, et.c.). You will randomly get a faction rating in each starsystem, sometimes they love you from the start, sometimes they hate you. You'll never know. Pick your side, start blasting ships from the oppossite side and soon you'll make some great friends in that starsystem.Later on in the game Zombie ships start to appear, and near the end of the game they will be your main enemy. The UTA and Civvies notice the major zombie problem and team up together with you to reclaim the galaxy from the zombies. Zombie ships are unique ships that you can not unlock. They consist of two type of ships, fighting type ships that look like infected normal ships. They will engage anyone mindlessly. And then we got the breed type ships that look like human bodyparts of some sort. They infect ships without shields, if your ship gets infected you have little time to react, either self destruct your ship so the zombies can't gain control of it and use it against you... or make the hard choice and vent the ship of all crew except the captain, so the infection can't spread. It's a hard job late game, but someone has to purge the galaxy from the zombies.There is also a fourth faction that was released freely with the game. And they are the Bounty Hunters. There ships are unique with specific traits and are also very, very over powered. If you go around in a starsystem they ""control"" and wreck havoc, you will start to lose respect with them. Lose to much of it and they will warp in when you least want it (in a difficult fight with another faction) and try to blow you out of the space, for the most part they succedd with this. One of the hardest achivements ingame want's you to destroy their space station in the hardest type of starsystem.So will you use standard weapons like lasers, kinetic rounds or plasma to destroy your enemies? or will you go for missiles and torpedos instead? Why not use EMP weapons and energy drainers to drain all energy from your enemy ships so they can't fire their weapons or escape? Nukes? Sure, SPAZ has them. Drones for carriers, that too. There is alot to do with this game, and it gave me alot of hours of fun.The only three really bad parts about this game are:Interface dosen't look very professional.The story isen't that good, it had one somewhat good plot twist in it tho.The last ""part"" of the game, the ""purge"" all galaxy of zombie threat's is a repeative and somewhat boring job to do. Everything before that is fun tho.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Could use a few additions, I'm hoping they do eventually update it with some of the things they wanted to. :) Love the random quests, and I'm not sure what the level cap is, but I'm still playing it on insane, now that i've finished it in all the other difficulty settings. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game - the trailer shows the gameplay perfectly.You will have lots of fun playing this game and there will be moments where you genuinely LOL(such as when your cannons blast a hole in an enemy ship and a whole crapload of their crew get squirted out into space, wriggling like maggots.. then get squished by another passing ship). The start is a bit slow but once you've opened up several star systems and obtained blueprints to your first large ship it picks up momentum; once you start collecting blueprints for huge ships it really shines. Another recent reviewer complained about spending half his time mining - you only need to do that very early on, after that it becomes a pastime to blast enemy ships and scoop up what's left of them to get rich.The cons: you may get very addicted!

												This is quite a charming little game. It has a unique gameplay which reminds me of many other space shooter games, but it has a small twist of strategy and RPGs, which grants a good deal of customization. Despite what its looks in the begining, its graphics is actually rather pretty, lending a sense of deep, dangerous space, filled with lots of bright colors and galatic bodies.From 1 to 5, I think I would rate this 4, but being  very close to 5. Some multiplay, more variation (there is allot variation, but the game can be rather long so becomes repetative) and less reading could proberbly get it up on the 5. But to be honest, Its a very satisfied 4 :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Easily jump in for a little fun, or play for hundreds of hours. Great replay value with random galaxy-creation, randomized quests, and many different ways to build your ships! The developer is so cool that when they finished the Bounty Hunters expansion, which adds a lot to the game, they sent it out as an automatic free update for everyone who already had the game!

												I've played all 3 Escape Velocity games, if that is what these guys were trying to emulate they failed.This game is overly complicated from the beginning, it has a difficulty curve like a mountain and has combat that simply doesn't have a good feel to it, which is important as there isn't much more to this game.  There is a plot, some narration, but honestly the level of the dialouge and the amateur art designs for the charcacters caused me to ignore it after about 10 minutes.This is Diablo in space, you manuever around, try to damage opponents and mostly are just trying to click at the right times to line up shots against VERY agile opponents.   You also constantly have to keep track of how allies are doing, your ship is usually worse then your competitions and there are more of them then there are of your fleet (as opposed to most ARPGs where you have an advantage but you are facing a horde).  It is very easy to die but that's ok, because using your mined resources you can then use them to respawn yourself and your fleet.  But you can and will run out of resources, therefore making you not be able to respawn, at which point the game tells you to go get in a very very very crappy ship and start mining, but anyone with common sense will tell you to reload your save instead to save you the mindless grinding that would entail.This is grossly dissapointing because I feel there is a lot to this game, it generates a new galaxy for every game which would seem to have a huge amount of content but I couldn't get past the second star system and had great difficulty getting past the first (which was the tutorial).  Maybe this game was made for the nintendo hard crowd, or maybe I just suck, but I just don't have the time or patience anymore to deal with that.  Although after looking at the universal badge progress on this game, I can tell I'm not alone.Don't trust the metacritic score, although I will say there is something here but you have to be pretty dedicated/skilled to find it.

												This is probably the grindiest game I've ever played. It's not a bad game at all, but it has a few hours of fun gameplay spread out over 25 hours repeating the same missions over and over. There's no real reason to explore systems, especially if you don't need a technology upgrade. A little blip of story in random systems or random FTL-style encounter would make it more compelling to explore.The devs in the forums confirm that the best way to play is to put all of your points into one type of weapon. If you don't, you'll have to grind 2-3x as much to viably use multiple types of weapons. Despite all the fancy looking weapons, attachments, and mounting points in this game, you'll probably end up with a ship loaded with all of one type of weapon. You'll also quickly learn to never die so much that you run out of rez, or you'll have to grind away at a mining station for a while just to have enough money to start playing the game again.If I played again, I would play without bounty hunters. It looks like they a balancing mechanism, because the only thing they do is provide a constant drain on your resources. The diminishing returns of their arena-style missions weren't very worthwhile.It does look very good, especially when battles involve different kinds of ships, weapons, and drones flying about. The movement and turning speed plays a major role in the game, so I did like how I feels like naval warfare. Throughout the 25 hours there were fun bits unlocking new ships and figuring out what works well too, but once I figured it out it was back to the grind. It's a decent game to play while watching TV or listening to some podcasts, but it wouldn't hold my interest alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the generic name fool you.  Space Pirates and Zombies - or SPAZ for short - is a welcoming addition to an every-growing catalogue of indie games.SPAZ put you in command of up to three vessels as you explore the interconnected story and procedurally generated universe it holds.  Mine, shoot and collect in order to research new technology that allows you to equip better equipment, ships and weaponry to better prepare yourself to a space zombie opera.SPAZ is surely one-of-those games that you can easily pick up for a short session while patiently waiting or those long sessions on a calm, stormy winter night.

												This is really a good game.  And, it's only about 150MB to install.  It's a space exploration, resource gathering, space combat strategy.  I'm not much into RTS games, and this game doesn't play like one.  You have a mother ship, and then control individual ships in your fleet.  You can switch between any ship, and also set up AI for those ships you aren't currently controlling.  The galaxy is proceedurally generated when you start a new game, and you can control the number of star systems up to about 300 total.  Each star system has a level requirement before you can visit it, and you have to deal with the ships guarding the Jump Gates (bribe or destroy) before you can move freely between systems you have access to.Really, try the demo.  The tutorial is for the first system but seems to open up after about the 1st or 2nd mission you take.  This 2 person dev team deserve your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a pretty little top-down space shoot-em-up in a randomly generated size-adjustable galaxy (so there's replay value). I like to dive in now and then and advance a few levels. One unusual item is a list of  ""coming soon"" features on the menu screen. The ""and bounty hunters"" bit is definitely new since I last played, and I seem to see a few new ship blueprints, so obviously they are hard at work adding DLC. Can't go far wrong with this one if you like old style space shooters.			",140,28,0,10,13,0,14

There are also different mission types from destroying fortified positions, escorts, stealth, and assassinations to keep things interesting.Worth every penny for its cost. And with new game mechanics and updates (even official mods) coming out it shows a promising future. However after approximently 70 hours of gameplay it starts to feel a little repetative.

												This game is very addictive.  At first, I was confused as to how to play it, but the tutorial was sufficient to help me get started.  The main draws to this game are the upgrades.  Purchase blueprints from one of the factions, upgrade weapons, engines, crew, armor, shields, etc.  Play smart in combat so that you  can afford the to keep your ships up to par with your tech.Two downsides to this game: 1) it is repetetive.  You'll repeat quests that are very similar many times until you'll come to recognize them.  2) Ship layouts aren't customizable.  Otherwise, I recommend this, and expect great things from S.P.A.Z. 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a bit aprehensive and  couldn't decide weather to buy SPAZ or not .I left that idea for couple of weeks and  I came back to it just yesterday.Well...I have already spent over 15h of playing  SPAZ and I got to tell you :the game is well worth the money ,it is not one dimentional space game as I previously thought. It is rich and deep !You do missions and level up your ships and hangar .You collect blueprints from wreckage's and research and manufacture new components or entire ships. You can hire a specialists and train them to be more efficient as your crew.Dock to the station buy new gear there ,choose which faction you wanna be friends with and which you wanna be seen as foe .But beware there is also a group of bounty hunters that on some stage of plaing SPAZ will start  following your tracks.Travel throu spacious Universe from one solar system to another ,break through enemies gate ,develop your skills and use those ,mine Rez to get rich ,and many ,many more option in SPAZ are waiting for you.Do not hesitate ! :)			",179,46,4,30,11,1,23

												The game is hands down one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years, easily in my top 5 indie games when you consider it's ""fun factor"". The graphics are very pleasing especially for a cartoon look. The sound fit's the game well as does the artwork. SPAZ has several difficulty settings ranging from ""casual just play for fun and never lose"" to ""please just kill me now"". On it's most difficult setting even the most experienced gamers will be tested. The galaxy can be created relatively small (still very large offering many hours of gameplay) to massive offering literally hundreds of hours of play time. The map is also randomly generated so replay value is high. Bounty Hunters (free DLC) adds a fourth faction to interact with adding new ways to explore or destroy star systems!All in all a highly suggested purchase that will offer something to all gamers, casual and hardcore alike.

												I want to say that it is a simple game with all those elements that anyone should be able to pick out and say ""yeah, that's fun"" but that's not the case. This game is great. At times I want to rage-quit and stomp around swearing, and others I want to find the two guys that put this together and shake their hands. Either way they did it right. I haven't found any bugs aside from a spelling error, and things seem to work well for what appears to be a simple game that is in fact possessed of a level of complexety. This game is win.

												Do not bother spending money on this. It's their first attempt, and while it's admirable the flaws are staggering and game-breaking. Their concept of ""fun"" and ""balance"" are skewed heavily towards banging your head against a concrete wall and calling it ""strategy"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We all know if you want something good to play, it's going to be from a Indie developer this day and age, so Just quit reading this and fetch the Demo so you'll know if it's your type of nuts!  ^.^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a grind Jim, but not as we know it. This game is so Zen, it's amazing. It manages to roll up RTS, RPG and fun shooting without the stressful, frenetic pace you'd expect. Play for hours, or a bit at a time; it doesn't matter. Trust me, you'll be floating in deep space with the atmospheric music, comms chatter, and crew shoved out of airlocks...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, the game is not perfect. But it's a great small scale to medium scale top down ship combat game. You manage a capital ship and a small fleet of escort vessels. You can mine stuff, destroy stuff. It's up to you to make your own way through the vast darness of space.Constant support from the dev team and frequent updates are also a plus!

												This game could have been called Starscape 2 (see my review on Starscape, If you have played Space Rangers its also like a much better version of that game).  Its very much similiar except quite a bit better.  First of all you get 2 NPC ships that fight along side you which you can switch between.  Second if you get stuck you can fly around to different areas and try to get better equip.  They try to keep your direction open unless you want to advance the story, then you must accomplish certain tasks. Also requires salvage to unlock ships which is a neat idea.  A bloody shame its only single player. This game is worth up to 10 dollars.  If its 5 bucks don't miss it.  On a side note the game was actually made by only 2 guys which is amazing.

												10/10 Very addictive game.  I played about 1 hour of this game 18 months ago then came back and started a new game 2 weeks ago.  It took me 80 hrs to complete a new game.  The addictive part of the game is chasing the next upgrade, blueprint or skill levelup.   I recomend game saving alot early-mid game.  The game was very challenging till, Hammerhead ship dropped toward the middle of chapter 3. The game became super easy after getting max level cannons and Mammath during chapter 4.  Mammath is OP with triple mount Partical Cannons, double mount Mass Drivers, and Battle Station.   This game reminds me of a 100x more advanced version of Asteroids, that I played hundreds of times in the mid-80s at the YMCA.  The game has a good story and great 2d graphics.  Another similarly enjoyable game to try is Reassembly.			",854,282,32,115,114,9,171
