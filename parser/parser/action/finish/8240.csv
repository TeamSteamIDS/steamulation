												The jokes and puzzles are much more satisfying than I've seen in the series so far. My only complaint now is that there doesn't seem to be enough connection between the episodes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A particularly good episode in the first season of Sam and Max. Rather than going to a new location, it transforms your familiar local city block into a virtual reality setting, at will, via headgear. Good 4th wall humor within aimed at all nerds and gamers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the longest and most ambitious adventure in series 1 for sure. its set at the office and usual locations but has a cool reskin of the environment to make the VR world. its got alot of work gone into it and theres an adequate amount of puzzles. Its puzzles range from harder to crack to blatently obvious.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in their own new adventure.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they go as far as they go in the comic (and further). If you love the Sam and Max type of humor, you will love this series.If I'm going to mark points off for anything, its that the voices of Sam and Max have changed from the original LucasArts version, but after awhile they really start to own it and become the definitive Sam and Max voices.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
