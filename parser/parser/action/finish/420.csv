												So this what it feels like ? So this is what the wait for Half Life 3 feels like. Half Life 2 Episode Two is the sequel to Episode One and begins straight away. We find ourselves in the outskirts of City 17 as the Citadel has now opened a portal to the Combines home world and it's now up to us to find a way to the rebel base and shut down the portal once and for all.The gameplay is identical to previous titles in the Half Life 2 games.  Overall there's not much to say here as it's basically DLC to Half Life 2. Graphics wise this game looks a tad bit better than Half Life 2 due to the range rendering, which I thought was under used in Half Life 2 Episode One. The portal coming from the citadel can be seen throughout the entire game which looks outstanding.There is a reason this is my favorite Half Life title and that's the action sequences. This game is like a great action movie. Action scenes after action scenes after action scenes and it all ends up to one of the biggest cliffhanger endings in history of gaming. I'm not joking it actually pains me not knowing what happens next.I also love the incredible soundtrack. It's beyond kick♥♥♥♥♥and is one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.In the end Half Life 2 Episode Two is a thrilling ride and it should be played by everyone. I'm glad I finally joined the bandwagon. Now I can join the Half Life 3 waiting community. Final Rating:10/10 - A must own and a must playIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Nice told with AlyxHALF-LIFE 2 EPISODE 2 starts immediately where Half-Life 2 Episode 1 ended. Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance must continue their fight, alongside the resistance, against the evil Combine. After the ever so slightly below par Episode 1, Episode 2 is a real return to form. Everything that was so good about HL2 is developed here and made even better. The narrative arc is strong, the dialogue well-written and witty, the voice acting accomplished and convincing, the environments spectacular and varied, and the mix between puzzle solving and combat just right. We meet several new enemies and some of the combat is pretty challenging, especially the final battle which is big on scale and mayhem and requires real strategy to complete. It’s a tough finale but well worth the effort. There’s so much to enjoy in the whole Half-Life series I can’t recommend these games enough.5/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												As with Episode One, there's little to be said besides what I've said about Half-Life 2. Episode Two can be challenging at times, for example fighting the newly introduced Hunters with their sophisticated AI or during the tense finale. Story-wise Episode Two expands the plot beyond City 17 however by the end you'll be left with a 9-year-old and counting cliff-hanger. Regardless, Episode Two is arguably the best expandalone in the entire series; it's definitely worth picking up.			",810,236,5,120,92,7,118

												A more decent follow-up to Half Life 2 than what Episode 1 was. I missed new enemies and new environments there but this episode delivered all of them. The story is interesting and it is a shame no conclusion is reached once you complete the second (and probably last) expansion to Half Life. The Source engine now runs an enhanced version and you can immediately see the better effects and more beautiful surroundings early on in the game.This is a very decent expansion pack; I only wish there was a third and final episode that would conclude the story or perhaps leave more room for Half Life 3.

It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life 2: Episode One.Half-Life 2: Episode Two follows up Gordon Freeman story from Half-Life 2: Episode One after the destruction of City 17. This time you're not going to play in City 17 anymore, the city is gone, and you're going to see more places in Half-Life universe and also, meet some new and more dangerous enemies.Half-Life 2: Episode Two is another good sequel to the Half-Life series.

More importantly  the story was just  BADASS , there were so many amazing turn of events and the way they introduced new enemies, new wepons and stuff and funny aspects, the least I can say is I loved itBut i still have lots of questions in my mind.. like what happens after Alyx's father was murdered? What legendary borelli were they talking about? What ship Alyx's father asked us to destroy? To answer all these question they need to make Half-Life 3 but  according to   Gaben's  maths teacher... gaben used to get sick by hearing the number 3.. so i guess Half-Life 3 is not possible but I see a slight chance of Half-Life 3 in PS4's generation because:ps4+ps3+ps2+ps1add the numbers4+3+2+1=10Divide it by the number of consoles10/4= 2.5 round it off = 3......

												Half Life 2 is a first person shooter game released in 2004. It was awarded as the Game of the Decade in the VGA Awards. The award was received by Gabe Newell, Valve founder.The game takes place 20 years after the Black Mesa incident of Half Life ( The game that chaged it all ) . Gordon Freeman awakes from hibernation in City 17 and become part of the resistance to face the Combine Empire and attempt to defeat it. In the game Gordon meets Alyx Vance,  who is part of the resistance. The game is one of the pioneers in introducing a playmate .Half Life 2 presents different enemies . The Headcrabs still produce that feeling of rejection when they attack. The action is breathtaking but it breaks , not like Call of Duty games where you shoot without breathing.The narrative is implemented throughout the game, not with recording or notes , it is not necessary. The experience is brilliant. The Source engine allows good management of physics and the introduction of a new weapon. The gravity gun . The technology also allows open spaces in addition to traditional outdoor passageways and internal spaces .The handling of the narrative and physics puzzles changed the way the FPS games developed from there into the future . It was a turning point in games history the same way it was the first Half Life .The game was released for PC under Windows , required a 2 Ghz processor . 512 MB ​​of RAM , and a graphics card compatible with Direct X 8.1 . For the few resources sought at that time the graphical quality of the game was very good and ran very smoothly .This is one of the ""must play"" games if one is serious about being a Gamer ,not only for its quality but also for being part of the history of video games.

												Yet again Valve does not disappoint. I started the game and was not happy that I did not get to use the Gravity Gun as much as I did in HL2 and Episode One. But Towards the end, I was not disappointed. I loved how in this Episode there was no ""Final Boss"" but a whole event, which allowed me to use my brain more, as well as use time managment techniques. If you have not played this episode I highly recommend you to do so. ",117,37,0,8,3,1,7

												Episode Two... IMO the most challenging episode so far (especially on hard mode). New areas, new enemies, and a whole lot of fun! If you really push it, you can get 20 or more hours out of it. Episode Two is definitely worth your time and money!And yes, it's true... it has a great cliffhanger :>			",58,19,0,3,4,0,6

												Episode Two is even more amazing.  What is disappointing is why Episode Three has never been released.  Valve, we are your gamers.  We are fans of the series.  We were so hyped after we played this years back, and over time, that hype has slowly faded and much confusion replaced it.  I mean, what exactly happened?  Did developers leave the project?  Voice actors go on strike?  Did a very important voice actor pass away or go missing?I don't get why no clear answers are given.  We would understand if something went wrong that would cause major delays or a halt on the project.  We just want answers.  It's been 8 years.  Don't we gamers deserve a response?In any case, Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and all the episodes are fantastic.			",63,9,0,3,0,3,4

												I was concerned about the lack of content from Valve so I beagn an inquiry into it. After finding nothing and getting ""I don't want to comment on this yet"" from thier CEO Gabe Newell, I decided to give up. I noticed gaben with a large grin on his face as i walked away from Valve HQ it saddens me more. Then I look up as a woman asks me ""Are you that guy investigating valve?"". ""Yes I am"". She then said ""I'm Gaben's old maths teacher and when looking through his old maths tests I found one question he got wrong!"". ""What was it?"" I asked. ""2+1""she said. A true look of surprise crossed my face. I looked back to where Gaben had been. He looked concerned and frightened. I began running as fast as I could back to Valve HQ. But Gaben was faster he used his long fall boots to jump straight down the stair well. He then boarded the front exits with filling cabnets using his gravity gun. I shouted at gaben to let me in but his only reply was ""THESE THINGS THEY TAKE TIME!"". I was to angry to give up now. I sparta kicked the door and filling cabnets down. Gaben ran for the stairs throwing a barrage of crowbars at me. I refused to stop. Chasing him up the stairs I found him in his office. In one hand he helled one of his many swords and in the other a copy of the illusive Half Life 3. ""If you come a step closer I swear to god i'll destroy this and bury it where no one will find it, in a mexican land fill!"". ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" I screamed. I jumped at gabe and grabbed half life 3. However Gaben managed to stab me in the proccess. Gaben tried to grab half life 3 but I wouldnt let him. I dived out the way as Gabe charged at me. He missed and hit a wall and was knocked out. I ran as far as i could from Valve HQ as I could which was about a metre. I fell to the ground in an alley way just to the side of Valve HQ. I layed up against the wall slowly bleeding to death. ""We made it Gordon"" I said. but we hadn't, just then Gaben came round the corner. He kneeled down in front of me. He stroked his finger down my face ""shhhhh"" he exclaimed and threw an egg at me. ""It will never be oger"" he wispered gently to me. I began to fall unconcious as he walked away. I felt myself slipping but as I died I let out a tremendous ""33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333!"". HALF LIFE 3 COMFIRMED.			",66,4,0,4,7,0,13

												It's almost poetic, really. Half-Life 2: Episode 2 details the struggle of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance as they struggle through hardships on their way to White Forest. The game, after a few surprises here and there, ends on a high note - the Combine have, for now, been defeated. Everyone is celebrating, but also awaiting anxiously for what comes next.But there is hope.Then, as the game ends, that hope has been shattered, sucked dry in a few, agonizing moments. With Eli gone, the Resistance has lost some of its will to fight. Even though the Combine have been crippled, they do not die, and the Resistance must struggle yet more against the shadow of their malefactors.Time will tell whether or not they succeeded. Perhaps the Resistance, after waiting for over a decade, will finally get their wish - to be free, at last. They can finally rest a little bit easier at night, knowing that they now have what they wanted.Until such a day, however, this is the end of the line. This is the final stop until they finish building that railroad ahead.In the meantime... This is where I get off.			",22,2,0,1,2,0,3

												Half Life 2 Ep. 2 came out in 2007, a year after Ep. 1. Just like Ep. 1 it's quite short, this time ~5 hrs. But compared to Ep. 1 it actually has some new content to deliver other than the story.New enemy types were added. The Hunters for the Combine and the poisonous arachnids.The game also has awesome levels. The arachnid lair for example. At one point of the game, you will also get a car - much better than HL2's. Finally, there is epic battle in the last chapter. Personally this is my favorite.Come on Valve. It's time to raise the bar for the 3rd time. We have waited long enough for a sequel.

												Episode Two starts off with City 17 blowing up and a spectacular bridge crashing behind you.  From then on it's a fight to get to safety and find Alyx's father.  With a lot of exterior battles and action, this game in the series feels very large while still maintaining the short packed with action game that an episode should be.  However, you should know that the game ends with a huge cliffhanger and that there is no sight of Half Life Episode 3 or Half Life 3 coming out in the near future.  This is rather disappointing, but at the same time has kept many a fans chomping at the bit for a new release in the series.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												It has been officialy 10 years since Half-life last showed life. Back then, it literally shocked and blew the gaming industry away and I'm gonna tell you right now that Half-Life is THE reason why gaming is so big as of the present day. And I'm pretty sure that Valve would never keep a successful franchise away, that amazing and fun gameplay, including a great story, emotional characters that you are always attached to and a great variety of weapons. The graphics still look amazing as of today. Valve just nailed it back then with the Source engine! And with all these years that have passed and no sign of Half-Life 3 on an Episode 3, gamers are getting more and more concerned throughout the years. Let's cross our fingers and pray to Lord Gaben, he might do something, but I think it's gonna release in 2018 or 2019. Let's have our hopes up!			",19,0,0,0,2,0,0

You will be angry. Because atmosphere in this game amazing and non stop action taking you. After a couple of hours you  are starting to think you are Gordon Freeman and when the game finish you can not save yourself from ambient. Suddenly it finishes and your all enjoyable times finish. If you interest with this game, you must play Half Life 2 and Half Life 2 Episode One definitely. There is not too much thing to say for this amazing episode of the main game. Must try and must play definitely.			",66,4,3,4,1,0,0

*SPOILERS* I was never really hyped for Half-Life 3 to come, but that ending man. That ending really made want to see how the story unfolds even more. Episode Two is better than Episode One of course, but the ending just leaves me hanging by so much that I just keep on asking myself so many different questions like what happens next. But this is a game I would play again and again. The nice flowing story, the fantastic level design, puzzles, and voice acting just makes this feel all the more worth your time. I would totally recommend this game regardless of the ending valve gave us.			",95,17,9,11,5,2,4

												Great game, played through it when it came out, as I did with the other Half-life games. However, after waiting nearly 10 years for the promised ""Half-life 2: Episode Three"", my patience has worn thin, especially with the direction Valve is heading these days. I don't recommend getting this game anymore, as sad as that is. The story is not finished, many elements in the story are left unexplained. Why buy a book that is half written, with no ending?Edit: I do recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Episode Two is, while not as ambitious, mysterious, varied and exciting as HL2, a much better paced and focused game, which features the best gameplay HL2 and the Episodes have offered, together with a solid, mature narrative and art direction. As always, graphics, technology, voice acting and visual direction are pretty much at the highest standards here. You'll traverse massive, intricate cave systems, navigate the vast Outland both on foot and via vehicle, all the while encountering unique situations that advance HL2's mechanics in interesting ways. And the final battle is definitely something to be hold, and a remarkable first for the Half-Life series.It's a shame, then, that this is where the story has ended, thus far. Valve have no excuse not to continue it; but then again, you don't have any excuse not to play it, finish it, and understand just what people have been waiting for for almost 10 years.

Finally the Bull Squid from HL1 is back in a much better design a.k.a. Acid Antlion. It is diverse, got lots of challenges and is by all means the toughest amongst the HL franchise; especially at the end. All what the first Episode lacked, they made up for and I am not only talking about the length. Truly worth of the series and a must buy for any HL enthusiast.			",45,2,0,0,0,0,1

+ This is essentially the second stand-alone expansion to Half-Life 2 that starts off at the same moment that Half-Life 2 Episode 1 ended. This is great for those who have already finished Half-Life 2 and Episode 1,  and want more content.+ Same great gameplay as Half-Life 2, same weapons, nothing dramatically new + Expands on the story, answers some questions, while leaving you still wanting more by the end. This game also makes a connection to the Portal series.+ New enemies, Hunters, Antlion Workers, Antlion Guardian, and Combine Advisors.+ New vehicle, a Muscle Car which is just as fun to drive as the Scout Car. + One of the most thrilling final battles throughout the entirety of Half Life 2 which consists of defending a base against an onslaught of Striders and Hunters.+ Visually the game looks even better than the two previous games with some great looking environments.+ Episode 2 has a bit more content than Episode 1, being around 3.5-4hours in length, and is overall a better experience.- Very sudden abrupt ending....- The first half of the game is mostly spent underground in mines, and Antlion caves. I started to feel a bit costraphobic, and just feel like this section went on for too long.~ If you have NOT played Half-Life 2 or Episode 1, do NOT play this game first. I'm not really sure why this is a stand-alone game			",2907,1027,99,266,347,21,392

												The Half-Life Series has left a legacy for a reason. Enough said. If you're planning on buying the games individually, dont. Search the ""Orange Box"" on steam and buy it instead. You get the entire series plus Portal, and it comes out cheaper. The Orange Box was on sale yesterday for $5 on greenmangaming. Its normally 20 dollars however, which is still a pretty good deal. I think i bought it for $10. so yeah, the box can save you some money if you place it on your wishlist and buy it on sale.			",112,20,1,16,6,0,5

												A good piece of Half-Life content but not the ending the series deserves. The community will never get the final conclusion to Half-Life for reasons unknown. If you're not a fan of getting involved in a story with no end, then pass on this one. The base game Half-Life 2 had some semblance of an ending that could stand on its own feet, Not this one. Major cliffhanger with no resolution. Ever. It's a bummer what has become of Valve. I guess making games is too expensive now, ironic considering the company is the most profitable it's ever been.

												Don't get me wrong, Half Life 2 and both of its episodes are great. They're amazing games, and I hadn't played a singleplayer game like this in a while. The reason that I don't recommend any of Half Life 2 is because of where it leaves off. Episode 2 ends on a huge, depressing cliffhanger. Mind you, this game came out 9 years ago. 9 years. And only now Valve says they ""might"" start working on a sequel that would be done in 2018. I mean, if you don't get sucked into games that easily, if you don't care about the characters, if you can't connect with anything this game has to offer, then go for it. Otherwise, you'll just end this with everything feeling incomplete.I don't know, maybe I'm being too harsh. I just hate getting so immersed into a game and then having it end all of the sudden. It would be like watching a movie, and then having the film catch on fire halfway through, and then having it burn down the whole theater with all of your hopes and dreams inside.			",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

												It's 2015 - almost 20 years since first person shooters changed for good after HL 1. If you still haven't played half-life, you probably don't know the definition of FPS at all.Support single / co-op campaign games by buying them. They are really hard to make, and they aren't as profitable as crappy Pay-to-Win / Purchase-Coins-to-Play-on-Facebook games, and they take a really long time and a really big financial risk. Don't use illegal copies, just buy the games if you like them. The gaming world needs more good games like this one, and gaming companies need your money to make more of those games. I promess you, every single Half-Life is worth it.			",124,8,3,6,5,0,16

												Wow! That was an excellent gaming experience.  This is the first time I've played Episode Two and although it is about 10 years old it still rivals and surpasses the modern FPS games in many ways.  Fantastic scripting, wonderful variety, well designed levels and an excellent story.  Can you tell I really enjoyed it?  Half-Life 2 sets the bar for excellence in what story-driven FPS should aspire to.  I was never bored or feeling ""tired"" of sameness. The pacing is near perfect.  The final battle was unique and difficult. Time and time again the game threw the kitchen sink at you and I was left with a feeling that I just barely survived.  Strongly recommended for FPS fans.

												This is Half-life 2........ EPISODE 2 now this game not only diffines GOOD GRAPHICS AND LEVEL DESIGN ALL MIXED IN WITH GAMEPLAY. So I guess yeah. This game also introduces 2 new enimies that you could not interact with in Half-life 2 or Half-life 2 episode 1. This game also has most of the gmod content that you are going to want. This game also introduces a new charactor so do yourself a favor and pick this game up for you and a friend. My final rating for this game is a 10/10.			",80,7,0,3,4,0,2

												So this is what the wait for Half-Life 3 feels like. I'm not joking it actually pains me not knowing what happens next. It all ends up to one of the biggest cliffhanger endings in history of gaming. Its obvious Valve doesn't lack the resources or the knowledge to finish the series. They put out an amazing product that we bought and loved, but they've lost creative interest in that project and moved on. It saddens me greatly because their behavior shows a complete lack of respect for the fans that supported them and allowed them to build the company to what it is. As you might have gathered I've lost both my faith and hope in Valve.			",133,37,6,7,9,2,5

												The world falls apart around you and Alyx as one chaotic battle leads to another in this exciting chapter of the Half-Life series! The most difficult chapter, in my opinion, with an intense story line that begs to be completed in the sacred and long awaited third enstallment of this game series!Once again I reccomend this game to almost everyone, but I warn you. Once you play this game, you will join the many people who wait in earnest for the conclusion. The riviting story and relatable characters will leave you wanting more!			",29,3,0,1,2,1,0

												A worthy successor of the Half-Life franchise, adding new content in and making a great connection to Episode 1 and the original Half-Life 2, plus a callback to Half-Life.Pros:+New enemies+New vehicles+New visuals+Great storyline+Fun moments+Still does not take you out of the game. Want to ♥♥♥♥ around while some people are talking? Go ahead!+No timers, feel free to explore+No DLC+New weapons (in some sense)+Great music+Finally, flashlight doesn't take away from your auxiliary power.Cons:-Short-Level design is quite questionable-Price is also questionable, although you do get many more things with it, such as new stuff to spawn in G-Mod and other things.Should you get it? Yes.			",47,4,1,1,1,0,3

												So because I have no life, yesterday (7/28/2015) I decided to play through ALL of the Half-Life 2 games.. 13.4 hours I can see why everyone really wants HL2 EP 3 or HL3.  These games do not disappoint. They're absolutely amazing, they're so damn amazing that you'll want to play through these games multiple times.Y'know I bought these games in 2011 and I only played through them for a little bit then my dumbass 13-14 year old self got bored. Which explains the funky amount of hours, but I finally beat them all. It wasn't easy, it was at times rage-inducing, but it was my own stupidity that made it rage-inducing. I love these games a lot, and you bet your sweet♥♥♥♥♥I will be playing through them again. Although if you don't own ANY  of the 3 games.. Episode 2 ends on a really big cliffhanger which pisses me off. Come on VALVe, don't do this to us.. Give us HL3. I want to know what happens next. We all want to know what happens next. We want more, and it's been far too long (episode 2  came out 8 years ago).			",203,17,5,7,11,3,4

If you buy one game on Steam, this and the Half Life 2 episodes should be it.The classic story of Gordon Freeman. Exploreable environments and useable / moveable objects, voiceover actors with alternate conversations. Is linear but you can explore alittle of each map. Autosave works good. Has a great story.

The improved graphics, the engrossing story, and immersive game play all had me coming back for much more even after completing it. The level design is beyond brilliant and everything from the ant-lion caves to traveling to White Forest felt unique and very much detail oriented. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that has played any Half Life game in the past, though you will definitely want to play through EP 1 and HL2 first.			",87,10,3,6,11,2,7

And there have been no scarcity of half life marathons in an attempt to reignite this series.There have been rumours that the next (hl3?) is in the works but I just hope that it comes out before 2020 (thats when half life 2 takes place btw) :DBack to episode 2, just get it!10/10			",293,73,4,42,16,2,48

												The continuation of Half-Life 2: Episode One, which is a continuation of Half-Life 2. This game takes a different and  longer path than Episode One, but stunning and gripping nonetheless while following Gordon's adventures. Continuing straight off of Episode One, the game takes you through a tour of the more nature and abandonment parts of the Half-Life 2 universe. The graphics are enchanced greatly, and include some features and characters as well as some new enemies as well. This game sadly leads off a huge cliff hanger, which leads to the development of the very late Half-Life 2: Episode Three, which will come some time in the future. Other than that, the game is absolutely great, and we will all hope the Episode Three will come as soon as possible, but in the meanwhile, we will look forward this great masterpiece of a series that came to Steam. Thank you, Valve.			",63,5,0,5,2,0,0

												Half-Life 2: Episode Two is an amazing addition to the Half-Life series. Episode Two is twice as long as Episode One and is filled with non-stop action in the scenic forest mountains. Episode Two improves upon everything from the first Episode making it the superior Episode of the two and is real treat to play making every moment enjoyable. The story and environments all tie in very well and unfold nicely as the game progresses which you just want to continue going to see what is next. Now we just have to wait for Episode 3 or Half-Life 3... will either ever come out or is this the end of the road of a fantastic series?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After finishing a massive marathon of the half-life series from half-life 1 to this, I have to say, all HL3 jokes aside, that Episode Three NEEDS to be made. Period. For a game made in 2007, this game surpasses most games made nowadays with its simply exeptional blend of gameplay and story. Can you imagine the possibilities with, say, the engine they're using on Black Mesa? To be honest, I don't think anyone (with the exception of REALLY picky people) would care if the graphics weren't updated if this level of gameplay and story quality continues. An outstanding piece, which I would happily pay 100 dollars to have the sequel of. Please valve. PLEASE.			",67,10,0,3,6,0,4

												I have recently played through all the Half-Life 2 games and I believe this one is the best. Let me explain. I am a total sucker for great endings (which is the main reason Portal 2 is my favorite game ever) and this one REALLY delivered. I mean, even for a series that ALWAYS ends on a cliffhanger, this is one damn big cliffhanger. The gameplay is solid, but it's a half-life game so thats a given. The new enemies were a lot of fun to fight. You will die a lot, especially on the final fight, which is a blast. But yeah, go buy it if you haven't yet.*SPOILER ALERT*The reason the ending got to me is that it's something that wouldn't fly in a modern game. It's not even done in a cutscene. The fact that they decided to kill Eli, a character who's been with us since the very beginning, shows Valve's got guts. And I respect them for that.9.5/10			",124,35,0,14,8,3,9

												Arguably the best installment in the Half-Life 2 games, Episode 2 is another brilliant additional to the already amazing Half-Life story and is also the reason behind Half-Life 3's world-wide anticipation. Again. Half-Life 2 and it's additional episodes need no introduction or explanation,  but those of you that have not followed this story or played any of the games in the series, you are truly missing out. There is a reason why these games are globaly acclaimed and admired, so for all kinds of gamers, this is something you simply have to experience at some point in your life.The only benefit of not playing Half-Life 2 is that you wouldn't be a part of the enormous amount of people suffering the extremely long wait for Half-Life 3.

												Here's the moment that it all comes to life: you finally get to play along a vortigaunt that blasts enemies away like in the original Half-life and it all leads to an epic fight that combines driving and shooting perfectly, à la GTA or probably even better, and it all leads up too, hmm, nothingness. Like with SIN: EPISODES, the final chapter was never released. I guess we have to settle for that, at least we got some decent fights with some new enemies (the hunters and acid antlings), but I do wonder why the episodic games using the Source engine never got finished...

												Now I know why everyone has been screaming for episode three!Like the rest of Half-Life 2, it holds up extremely well.  The fight in the antlion caves is claustrophobic.  The later set-piece defensive battle is just the right amount of frantic.  The physics puzzles are interesting and well integrated into the environment and provide a nice break from shooting things.  There is a fantastic ""we're screwed"" battle that I won't give away.  The final fight is unique, wide-spread and tense.  The ending I did not see coming, Chekhov would be proud.The game engine, graphics and physics hold up very well.  The plot, characters and voices remain excellent.  While you're clearly on a rail, everything you do makes sense to progress the plot.  The game features several very distinct areas and types of gameplay, each feel unique, enjoyable and don't last too long.If you still haven't finished all of Half Life 2, go do it now.NOW!

												My favorite game in HL2, this game explored the rural side of the HL2 universe, unlike the dystopian settings of the previous game. I found the part with the car in the jungle extremely good, and the antlion's nest is quite amusing as well. The final battle with the Striders is thrilling. Sadly, the game ends with a cliffhanger, and now we're in a neverending wait for future games.			",18,1,0,0,0,0,0

												To those having troubles playing this game, you can load the files into Half Life 2 Episode 1 then try running it at the lowest graphics, and proceding up from there to see what your computer can handle.To those wondering if they should get it, I highly recomend this, even though there isn't a third episode which we desperately need.SO GABEN, STOP DOING DOTA AND LEFT4DEAD AND ALL THOSE OTHER GAMES! WE NEED A THIRD EPISODE! PLEASE!This game will leave you with a huge cliffhanger, and also has huge references to Portal which I liked.Scenes are intense and will leave your heart pounding, especially the last few. However, the ending will let you down severly, so play at your own risk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What about this expansion, for me it was even better than the base game, a mind-blowing experience that justifies the clamor for a third title for the series. The gameplay in this is even more dynamic than in the base game and the first expansion, there are many action sequences and breathtaking events, new enemies, new locations and the engine is further enhanced in all aspects. In this episode there are many more situations relevant to the overall plot, you stay with Alyx most of the time and there are events that deepen even more the relation of you two and the end can raise any expectation for a third title to another level, just epic. I highly recommend it, as I said, to me this expansion was the best title of the series ever released. 9/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Episode Two is an absolute must-purchase for any FPS fan. It’s an amazing experience from beginning to end. I truly cannot think of a way to improve this game.Any way you look at it, Episode Two stands out, even among the Half-Life series, as something special. It may be shorter than the original, but it's a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more.Episode 2 is an awesome example of packing various kinds of gameplay into a compressed time span without the whole thing descending into a discombobulated mess.

												Half life 2 episode 2 is an excellent game. This game introduce lots of thing such as new enemy, new kind of gameplay, new world to explore and a great story.Half life 2 episode 2 opens immediately after the first episode ended. This episode is better than the first episode mainly because it's a lot longer, new enemy and more.I like the new enemy "" Hunter "" and the new antlion worker. These new enemies are challenging and i love it.The level design is also very interesting just like the part when you're objective is to defend the vortigaunt while healing Alyx from hordes of antlion in the cave and the part when you have to kill lots of strider in white forest base.this game also makes me emotionally invested by the end of it. Half life 2 episode 2 is one of the best game i play in recent years.This game alson have one of the best cliffhanger and makes me want to play episode 3.I hope Gabe Newell do make Half life 2 episode 3 or half life 3 because Gordon's adventure can't end like that. we still have to save Dr. Judith Mossman so....

												I replayed the whole HL2 series recently, and Episode Two really is the standout of the entire thing. The open air, the Hunters, the ominous march of the Combine towards White Forest. All the Half-Life games are made up of distinct and memorable sections, but Episode Two is the only one where each bit is a joy to play through every time. Even the antlion tunnels – I love the steep shadows, squelchy grubs, and the violent fizz of the acid blobs the workers spit at you. “We must have misunderestimated them!”			",695,78,29,62,87,9,129

												WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT ENDING???Episode 2 continues on where Episode 1 left off. Gordon and Alyx have already escaped from City 17 and have to get to White Forest - a resistance base. Throughout their journey they are constantly chased by the Combine.While in Episode 1 the setting was mostly urban, in Episode 2 you traverse through the countryside and the area around it. When you have progressed enough through the game you will find an old muscle car that you will use to get to White Forest, func_vehicle returns in Episode 2, not seen in Episode 1. Not that much puzzles are tied to the passage of the car being blocked, though they still are present.New enemies added include the notorious Hunters. They usually travel in packs and are tough opponents. Alyx is the first to have an experince with a Hunter and it seems that they are too strong, but they can be defeated relatively easy, depending on what you shoot them with. You will also face a lot of striders and obtain a new device used to destroy them - a Magnusson Device.Episode 2 is made with the same engine as HL2 and Episode 1 so the graphics are the same.In the end, if you have played the other games, but not this one, then you should buy it.

 Originally posted on November 24, 2007 Half Life 2 Episode 2 gets right most of what Episode 1 got wrong. It ramps up the pace, and quits recycling content, as the Episode 1 did. The source engine is also improved in this iteration, and although it is starting to age, it bears it well. In short, Episode 2 is a cinematic adrenaline rush, and it really expands on Half Life in an original way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When people said they were begging for HL3, I assumed that HL2 ended like portal 2 (with the bad guy dead and the protagonist waiting for a new adventure).  However, this definitely was not the case.   Alyx's dad was licked to death by the tongue of a telekinetic potato  and it just ended.Despite the enormous cliffhanger that may never be resolved, i still recomend this game and all the others in the Half Life series.  It is an amazing series that deserves an ending.  A must have for any fps lover.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know I am a little bit late to the party, but I thought that you would like to know what I thought.Half Life 1 & 2 are easily classic and amazing games and so are Episodes 1 & 2, but I would like to say that episode Two was definitelly my favorite game.I am very happy that valve chose to step away from the urban theme the half life games have and give it a very rural scenario.It certainly worked well and the strider battle was the most intense and fun moment of the series.

												5.4 hours playtime is reflective of the fact that Steam started tracking that stat after this game was released, not at time of release.As I'm sure most folks know, this game needs a sequel, or at least a finale.  Some semblance of care from the developers for the audience who has shown this series love for so long.  For the uninitiated, this is what you're getting into:HL2:EP2 was (and arguably still is) one of the most immersive FPS campaigns ever released.  Excellent voice acting, excellent world design, gameplay mechanics and plot.  However, if closure is something you desire, steer clear.  In the ~10 years since release of this game (which I purchased in The Orange Box upon its release), Valve has gone from 'we're doing episodic releases!' to 'we're making hats and selling games!'.  Speculation regarding an ending release has gone from hopeful to dismissive.  As of now, the fate of this world is left uncertain and unlikely ever to be revealed.  Unless Valve was shooting for an extremely subtle metaphor for the real world, then this is a cliffhanger whose principals will be forever dangling.10/10 For everything but the end.

												When people said they were begging for HL3, I assumed that HL2 ended like portal 2 (with the bad guy dead and the protagonist waiting for a new adventure).  However, this definitely was not the case.   Alyx's dad was licked to death by the tongue of a telekinetic potato  and it just ended.Despite the enormous cliffhanger that may never be resolved, i still recomend this game and all the others in the Half Life series.  It is an amazing series that deserves an ending.  A must have for any fps lover.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 26, 2014
												I am just going to say this right now. I really loved this game. This is going to be a long review as well. Just sayin'.Now, I do have reasons to say so. I personally disliked Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episode 1. Still buy them, because to get the full experience of Episode 2 you need to know not only the story, but how much the game improved.Now, the entire Half-Life 1 (classic?) series was great, while sometimes buggy. What can I say? Golden Source is golden. The gameplay was smooth, the weapons were nice and powerfull-ish, and you played as a variety of characters.(STILL BUY THIS GAME! SKIP IF YOU DON'T LIKE CRITICISM) Here is where Half-Lfe 2 comes in. Gordon Freeman in a City 17 train, waiting with the rest of the ctizens. Commence with an overly long section without even a crowbar, picking up and throwing spare junk. A little while after, you spend way too long speeding around in an airboat. Then the Gravity Gun, to pick up and throw even more spare junk, but at high speeds. A dunebuggy with suspension level ten thousand, not to mention two types of portable infinite ammo. Last but not least, the 1500 Megawatt Black Mesa Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Gravity Gun. One last way to run around with over 9000 HEV and the one weapon to rule them all. The NPCs in the game? ""Oh, Gordon Freeman. We worship you, even though you basically caused this whole mess and only saved yourself."" Barney Calhoun, the dropout hero of Blue Shift? ""Headhumper. Headhumper. Hey, I finally took one down!""All of these were fun, but too drawn-out. No offense to Valve, but the majority of gamers can learn how to use a gimmick in much less time than otherwise thought. Overall, Half-Life 2 had long expanses of nothing, but in reality some of the best  gameplay experiences I've ever had.(SERIOUSLY, STILL BUY THIS GAME! YOU, THE READER, HAVE THE POWER TO SKIP AT ANY TIME!) Half-Lide 2 Episode 1. Where do I begin? Morg- Gordon Freeman wakes up, and for some reason goes right back into the Citadel. Here he aquires the Conveniently Temporary Over-Powered Blue Zero-Point Energy Manipulator. I didn't think highly of this game from up front, remembering the whimper in which Half-Life 2 ended. From here on,  The gameplay is mostly indoors with airducts, similar to Half-Life 1. But, the story was meh. To add, Alyx's AI walked right up to every enemy, and died too often. The fights were really intense, though. All being said, the game kind of ended after about three hours and one strider.Overall verdict: intense, even difficult action, but compressed into too little time, squeezing out story.vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvHalf-Life 2 Episode 2. This game is EXCELLENT. If I can say this to the entirety of Steam after knocking the rest of Half-Life 2, I must mean something. Gordon now wakes up inside of the train that crashed. As the train slowly topples over, the obstacle course that you need to climb down changes. I also happen to love changing terrain, so good first impression. Now I begin to notice things. The flashlight that wore out in about ten seconds in the other games was replaced with one much more similar to Half-Life 1. Also on an individual battery, allowing you to dash for more than a few seconds. I gaze deeply into my teammate's eyes, she awkwardly turns away to avoid eye contact. Very human of her. The car is come-and-go. You can struggle through most areas either with or without the car. It lasted just as long as it was needed. and no longer. As for action, there was never a point without it. All was unique, as well. Half-Life 2 got stale, while Episode 1 was overwhelming. Episode 2 managed to get just the right mix of the two, combining into THE perfect balance. Rochelle- I mean, Alyx's AI was realistic, even to the level of the player. Then there's the Gnome. My good friend the Garden Gnome. As a display of how much Valve in the greatest compaby on this side of the universe, you get an achievement for carrying this guy through almost the whole game. While a pain as some points, I kind of grew to like the guy. The ALyx Vance mauled by a Hunter? ""Don't look, Gnome. Shield thou purest of eyes."" It's a showcase of how great the gameplay is. You literally could have taken ANY item throughout the entire game. Now, back on topic. The Characters were recovered to what they should have been. Barney as a security guard. Refugees as refugees. The vortigaunts actually using their green electricity bolts. The characters were essential to the rich storyline. The storyline alone could have made a movie, as it was what made me start rooting for Half-Life 3. Basically, every problem that I have found in any other Half-Life game was remedied in this one fantastic sequel.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Seriously, just buy the game.Now.Sell your house if you really have to.

												Few games immerse you in the adventure and characters like this one, despite its short length. The game flows beautifully, with scenes of action, building dread, and those in-between moments that allow you to celebrate your accomplishment at having made it that far. The hype is legitimate.

												Oh weeell. I didn't thought Half Life2 could be even better...it's like you are in cinema on a great movie, and when it ends, you realize it was only a movie before the main program. Episode 2 has perfect level design (which was amazing in Half Life series all the time, but this time it's extraordinary), story is as amazing and breathtaking as before and the upgraded visuals pour new blood into Source's veins. And your flashlight has finally separated battery.			",567,185,18,96,67,9,126

												Because the soundtrack is the best of the Half-Life universe and because you want to see the gnome in the rocket. Alyx's♥♥♥♥♥is also counting if you're a certain friend of mine.The game is starting after the crash of your train and the destruction of City 17. You're alone with Alyx in a forest and after finding an abandoned outpost, you're attacked by an enemy you've never seen before. Alyx is badly wounded and her life is at stake, only Vortigaunts can save her. And from there, you're going to a journey in a mine. And reaching the White Forest base will take time too.This episode was released in the Orange Box, that is including Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Portal and Team Fortress 2. It was the first Half-Life on PC to have achievements, because of the release on X-box.While the game is short, the episode is still intense as you're meeting more Antlions (and new types too), you have to defend the outpost from them in an intense battle, a new car makes its appearance, a new combine type is also making its debut, spicing up the game but also, you're finally face to face to a real Combine. And that's scary because you can't do anything about it. The White Forest ambush is also a good moment but the most difficult passage is White Forest defense against Striders. If they reach the base, it's game over. But with the Magnusson devices, you can quickly kill them. If you manage to make them stick, that's it.However, while this passage is really hard for the achievement with no building destroyed, the most annoying quest (for achievement, you're not forced to do it) is to bring the gnome to the rocket. And the gnome in your car?  Well, it's falling off every 5 seconds. So, in other words, you're going forward, stop the car, get the gnome back, restart the engine, advance, stop the car, etc... And another one that can rival that is to kill every Antlion larva in the mine (333 to crush) and some of them are well hidden.With the cliffhanger, you'll understand why it's since 8 years that we're waiting for the Episode 3. Or Half-Life 3.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												5.4 hours playtime is reflective of the fact that Steam started tracking that stat after this game was released, not at time of release.As I'm sure most folks know, this game needs a sequel, or at least a finale.  Some semblance of care from the developers for the audience who has shown this series love for so long.  For the uninitiated, this is what you're getting into:HL2:EP2 was (and arguably still is) one of the most immersive FPS campaigns ever released.  Excellent voice acting, excellent world design, gameplay mechanics and plot.  However, if closure is something you desire, steer clear.  In the ~10 years since release of this game (which I purchased in The Orange Box upon its release), Valve has gone from 'we're doing episodic releases!' to 'we're making hats and selling games!'.  Speculation regarding an ending release has gone from hopeful to dismissive.  As of now, the fate of this world is left uncertain and unlikely ever to be revealed.  Unless Valve was shooting for an extremely subtle metaphor for the real world, then this is a cliffhanger whose principals will be forever dangling.10/10 For everything but the end.

												I have noticed some serious improvments in the ladder climbing. It is obvious to me that this technology has been in development for quite a few years, which I find remarkable. I commend the developers over at Valve for doing their best. Perhaps by the time Half-Life 3 is released, humans will have completely transcended the need for ladders altogether.			",49,8,0,6,2,0,1

												When people said they were begging for HL3, I assumed that HL2 ended like portal 2 (with the bad guy dead and the protagonist waiting for a new adventure).  However, this definitely was not the case.   Alyx's dad was licked to death by the tongue of a telekinetic potato  and it just ended.Despite the enormous cliffhanger that may never be resolved, i still recomend this game and all the others in the Half Life series.  It is an amazing series that deserves an ending.  A must have for any fps lover.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And again, not much to say. Episode Two continues where Episode One left off, and is so far the last game in the Half-Life series. Once again you have Alyx as a partner, though you'll spend a part of the game by yourself because of story reasons. There's also a lot more driving around this time. It's about as long as Episode One so if you liked Half-Life 2 and Episode One, you'll probably like this. Though be warned, once you finish this game, you WILL be frustrated with the fact that Valve still hasn't come out with Episode Three or Half-Life 3 yet.			",100,31,2,3,4,2,5

												I would recommend Episode Two simply because it's a nice break from the urban enviroments in the first three games. The Hunters in particular are a joy to fight, their tactics are superb. (Handy hint for first time players: You can catch Hunter flechettes with a physics item held with the Gravity Gun, then punt it at them. If you hit them with it at the right moment, when the flechettes explode, the Hunter will disintegrate.) The Antlion Nest in the Victory Mine is another favorite locale of mine. The Antlion Guardian is perhaps one of the scariest creatures in the series, I guarantee you'll♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants the first time you see it.

												The finale of the Half Life 2 trilogy! This game is really split into two different parts for me, the part up until leaving the caves, and then the part after that. The first part resembles Episode One greatly, very tight enviorments and not as memorable. However, the second half of the game is absolutly amazing. The most open world Half Life has ever gotten! The scale just gets so much larger! One of the most notable differences are the Hunters. They are kinda like a smaller version of the Striders. They are yet another unique enemy that takes a lot to get it down. (And they travel in packs, so watch out for more than just one!) There is another driving sequence which is better than all pervious, and the last playable part in this game is so frustrating and yet so rewarding. And the ending... Lets just say Half Life 3 needs to get here now... Pros:+Everything Half Life+Story+Open enviromentsNeutral:*First half of the gameNegitive:-No Half Life 3Overall: This was tough... 9.5/10 If only the first half was as good as the second! Then it would be perfect! I personally think the second half was better than even the orginal Half Life 2! But again, do not buy this seperatly, please get the Orange Box.			",249,33,2,33,17,3,36

												This review makes no sense if you didn't play Half-Life 2 Episode 2Also spoilers.Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is a science fiction first person shooter developed by Valve Software on the Source Engine. It follows the continued tale of physicist-gone-action-hero Gordon Freeman and action-hero-gone-love-interest Alyx Vance as they drive around a lot and help their garden gnome friend live out his childhood dreams of blowing up in space... I think..Episode 2 is an interesting game... whereas I have generally negative comments to make for HL2 and generally positive comments to make for Episode 1, Episode 2 is a mixed bag. As such, I won't give a traditional review, I'll just list my thoughts in order of what part of the game they apply to... hopefully this is interesting.The very first thing I noticed when playing the game is that the flashlight is no longer tied to the sprint meter which is pretty cool. But I don't get why they can't just impliment that into the other two games with an update... they haven't gone anywhere, as far as I can tell they've been preserved for historical record.The first chapter of Episode 2 throws the player for a loop when (after some exposition + befriending a certain garden gnome) they end up witnessing the generally up-beat and entertaining Alyx get stabbed in the back by a new enemy type. It's a fun twist and they don't sacrifice the duo idea for the sake of plot either, which is nice. Now the player gets to fight alongside a Vort.It's funny how the Vorts went from the bad guys slave guy, to the allies slave guys, to your slave guy... but I digress. After this is a very long section in some mines which try and juggle tricky exploration with the antlions as enemies and honestly I can't say it succedes... The antlions in general just aren't very fun to kill, they're annoying and loud and shooting them isn't satisfying. The environment gets really stale too, it goes on for way too long and you only really fights zombies and antlions for about an hour of gameplay.There are some fun bits, like a sort of stealthy chase sequence with an Antlion Guard (although I wish it were easier to recover after getting caught in corners), and a sort of tower defense part where antlions come swarming in and you fight them alongside some comic relief rebel guys and some Vorts. Come to think of it, Half-Life does a lot of things that sound like bad ideas really well a lot of the time... physics puzzle, excort missions, first person platforming, tower defense set peices, all of those sound like awful ideas.. and usually ARE awful ideas.. but work here due to the execution.But one thing that stays un-fun are the vehicular set-peices... I mean the boat thing is the most tolerable out of all of them but none of them are good anyway! The car is finicky and difficult to control, turning manage sto be both too sensitive and not sensitive enough sometimes and the boost is waaaay too fast. Let alone that the levels you drive in are all covered in logs  and debri and stuff that the car gets caught in, it's just poorly executed. The final level especially bothers me, I mean the striders are objectively satisfying to kill and the sticky bombs are pretty cool, but every time I start having fun in the final level boss fight the car gets stuck or I turn too far and miss my target.I mean some things are fun, and I would argue that the final level as a WHOLE is a success. Crashing into the hunters never gets old and neither does blowing up the striders with a single shot and a sticky bomb. Hearing allies react to stuff you do is always really satisfying too, even if I sort of forgot they were there until the final wave. I think Episode 2 bothers me because it was just so almost my favorite HL2 game but it's shortcoming are so much more glaringly obvious because of that and.. I honestly think some of this is because of lazy design.Either way, Episode 2 is fun. A whole lot of fun. Coupled with Episode 1 it's some of the most fun I've had in a game. The plot is still really investing and the finale is satisfying and then also suddenly kind of horrifying... and the garden gnome will haunt my dreams for months,			",34,4,0,1,0,0,0

												This is the best racing game ever! There's a story, but it gets in the way of driving sections. There's only one race, where you race this ""Dog"" thing, it's a fun race but it's missing music, so I played my own. DAAAAYYYYYTOOOONNNNNAAAA is the song I played while racing. My biggist compaints were that you don't gaet the car until much later and it handles like sh*t. Also for some reason you shoot things, and there's a story, I don't get. I also wish there's free roam, but something about some Sauce engine limits or whatever. Overall, I give it a, G4b3n/3.			",82,4,3,1,3,0,0

												Makes you really wish that Half Life 2 was the dark tragic game that it was originally drafted out to be. But playing another Half Life 2 mission pack with slightly better anti alaising doesnt excite me.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Half Life 1 was good.  Half Life 2 was great.  Half Life 2 Episode 1 was terrific.  Half Life 2 Episode 2 was fantastic.  Half Life 2 Episode 3 was so perfect that they couldn't bring themselves to release such divinity on the masses.  Legend says that Episode 3 is now spending the rest of eternity up in heaven chilling with Ghandi and brofisting a T-Rex.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The finał part of Half-Life 2 is as good as two previous. The whole advature is very action-packed due to new scenry and new opponents, puzzles still keep their high level and achievements are very interesting, making a numer of players to start the game again. Great finish of the ""trilogy""!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes. Yes. ""Why don't I have a lot of hours"" well to simply put:1) I've played The Orange Box set before....on the console version. 2) There isn't really anything NEW to add other than certain things that the previous episode didn't have or failed to do.With that being said. Let us begin!For my Half Life 2: Episode 1  review click this link:http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronMinotaur/recommended/380Episode 2 made a lot of changes that the previous episode didn't have. For instance, like in my Episode 1 review. I mentioned how everything was crammed in and not a whole lot of ""spacing"" out was put in between genres. For more explanation check the comment section of this review. Anyways in Episode 2 the ""rush feeling"" that was in Episode 1 is thankfully NOT in episode 2. It gives you time with Alyx and really experience what is (for now) the final Half Life game. You get to feel that semi-open world that you witness in Half Life 2 (The main game).And just like in Episode 1. Plot questions have been further explored in this episode. And like what I mentioned in Episode 1. Once again, you won't be given a full explanation until Half Life 3. Sure you got the basic idea of what Half Life 3 is going to be about but realistically not a whole lot of things were answered. It's still a great game to play. Like all Half Life games. I recommend it			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												I guess it’s pointless to recommend Half-Life 2 in 2013. You’ve probably completed it years ago, or at least have a pretty good idea of what it is and why people like it. So I’ll just use this ‘review’ to recommend a puzzle mod for Episode 2, Research and Development. Simple, but amusing puzzles. Great slapstick humor. Looks really good. There’s plenty of combat too (lobbing things at the enemy for the most part, no actual weapons). Oh, and It’s probably worth checking out just to see Mr. Whirly in action.The mod won’t start out of the box (thanks to the Steampipe update), but it’s easy enough to fix. Just open gameinfo.txt from ‘Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\research and development’ and replace the contents with this stuff[pastebin.com].You can use this technique to fix many of the old HL2 mods, more information here.

-Quick Review-Half-Life 2: Episode Two was the last of the weird counting method Valve used to make sure they didn't need to count to three. Half-Life 2: Episode Two was developed by Valve Corporation and released late 2007.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The story picks up, right where Half-Life 2: Episode One left off; Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman are going to be reunited with Eli Vance and Dr. Kleiner to plan the next step in their battle against the Combine forces.

Gameplay: This game returns to the more familiar setting of Half-Life 2, you aren't forced to rely solely on the Gravity gun like in most of Half-Life 2: Episode One. There is a new NPC that you encounter called “Hunters”, these are savage killing machines that are very imposing and at times down right freighting when encountered.

Achievements: There are 22 achievements on Half-Life 2: Episode Two. One third of the achievements are unlocked just by playing through the story. The rest are pretty tough and require careful planning, or a very long time running around.The most noteworthy achievements in this game are: Get Some Grub (“Squish every antlion grub in Episode Two” – That took forever.), and Little Rocket Man (requiring you to Carry a Garden Gnome from the beginning of the game to nearly the end) – I have an obsession with garden gnomes because of this achievement, stay away from the precious!

Price: Half-Life 2: Episode Two is priced at $7.99, you're better off purchasing The Orange Box for $19.99, where you will gain all the Half-Life 2 games + Portal 1.Conclusion: I think Half-Life 2: Episode One, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, really should have been one amazing game. Separate they're short but sweet. To quickly recap, Story: Excellent. Gameplay: nearly identical to the previous games. Achievements: Getting 100% completed will take longer then Half-Life 2, or Episode One. Price: a bit high, but the orange box is an excellent deal for the whole series.I recommend this game to anyone who's played Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One. You don't want to jump into this game, you will want to play the previous games first.Thank you for reading my review!Related reviewsHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2Here's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode OneHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(Pleaseeeeee Gabe Newell, my life will be complete... my Half-Life!)

												Look, if u didn't play this game yet ... u cannot consider urself as a PC Gamer. This game its a most to play same as the other two, I mean Half life 2 and Half life 2 Episode One. This game has the best storyline, the best character and most of all the best Gman voice scene that u cannot even imagine. Gman scene quotes = Dr Freeman … I realize this moment may not be the most … convenient for a heart to heart but I had to wait until your friends were otherwise occupied. There was a time they cared nothing for Miss Vance, when their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor. When I … plucked her from Black Mesa hehe, I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone, I have learned to ignore such naysayers when quelling them hm ? was out of the question. Still, I am not one to squander my investments, and I remain confident she was worth far more than the initial, appraisal. That's why I must now... extract from you some small repayment owed for your own survival. See her safely to White Forest, Dr. Freeman. I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, but I have agreed to abide by certain … restrictions. Well now, listen carefully, my dear. When you see your … father, relay these words: ""prepare for unforeseen consequences"".For gameplay and story i give it a 9/10 there is so much blah blah and less gameplay and beside there is much secret to be reveal and still episode 3 doesn't came out ""yet"". For graphic and details coming out from Source Engine its look really pretty and awesome 10/10 on this one ... so like i said if u didn't play this game after 7 years then u better start now...

												The second sequel to HL2, where you go through some Antlion-infested mines and defend White Forest rebel bases from combine attacks.Liked:-Soundtrack (Sector Sweep is my favorite track in the whole game)-Storyline-The awesome look of the forest setting-The gnome! Sadly I lost him in the mines. I wanted to bring him to the rocket but I couldn't :(-Hunters look pretty cool, as do Antlion Workers and the Magnusson DevicesDisliked:-I was unsure of where to go sometimes, but a lot less than in the other HL2 games-The jalopy seemed to slide too much when I was driving it-No offense to Valve, but Magnusson seems like a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the resistanceConsiderably the best HL2 game Valve made. 9/10, I would buy this again and recommend it to friends.STRIDERRRRR!!!!

												Great game and sequel to the first episode of Half-Life 2. The setting outside of City 17 was very nice, and the ambushes and new enemies we get to face and engage create a really cinematic and great experience. I also enjoyed the character development, and that little cliffhanger at the end really makes me want to exact revenge on the Combine.

												Strongly rivals Half Life 2 in memorable moments, and includes a stunning HDR Graphic boost over its predecesor. It is one of those games that has you paying close attention, because you get the sense that you are stepping into a world that is rarely found in the game market. Are we waiting for an Episode 3, or a Half-Life 3?

Ive beaten it a few times and still love to play through it. And if you dont like single playes games, down load synergy.

												Praise be to Valve for this masterpiece, easily the best of the entire Half-Life franchise. If you're like me, and have an unsatiable lust for alpine mountain landscapes you'll enjoy Episode Two so much more. If you're not one for taking in the  sights then you'll still be impressed by the urgent sense of duty from getting to White Forest in time, well-paced levels and the heart-stopping adrenaline rush from the glorious antlion caves all lovingly topped off with the weaponry, combat mechanics and clever puzzles that made us fall in love with Half-Life. While again focusing on fleshing out the Alyx character the game also gives plenty of opportunities to get away for some Freeman action time, with and without allied vortigaunts out butt-whoopin'. What I don't like about EP2 however would have to be the final strider battle, it rushes the player in a setting of ""OH CRAP-ON-A-STICK"" that has the potential to ruin one's experience. In summery, Episode Two is a grand achievement that cannot be missed.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

While again focusing on fleshing out the Alyx character the game also gives plenty of opportunities to get away for some Freeman action time, with and without allied vortigaunts out butt-whoopin'. What I don't like about EP2 however would have to be the final strider battle, it rushes the player in a setting of ""OH CRAP-ON-A-STICK"" that has the potential to ruin one's experience. In summery, Episode Two is a grand achievement that cannot be missed.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

												A well done pause to Half Life 2.Why call it a pause, not an end you ask? That is for you find out, but it's done in the same way Portal 1 was.If you haven't played HL2:EP2 by the time HL3 or HL2:EP3 comes out, you should. Half Life 2, while not much of a ""heart pounding"" action game, is about the puzzles and events. Sure story is there, but a lot of people who play through HL2 don't notice it. It's not critical, nor really engaging on any level.So all in all, should play this, but don't expect your socks being blown off. It's more like of those games you play and put in your library to collect dust. I revist the whole HL series from time to time, but that's not common for others.7/10			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												The final part of Half Life 2 fight the newly introduced Hunters as well as Toxic antlions. Fight an antlion guard and a toxic antlion at the same time which is probably one of the funest battles in the game. Fight striders and see a new enemy called an advisor. Team up with vorts to save Alyx and fight waves of enemies as the hero.  Best fps campaign ever. Half Life 2 is well worth it's price just buy the organe box or Half Life complete to play the best fps storyline ever.  Amazing storyline and fun well worth $8, There are 5 Half Life 2 games and Half life has 8 letters in it. 8-5= 3 HALF LIFE 2 GABE HALF LIFE 3The game by iteself is a lil too short 9/10Half Life 2 overall 10/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												I would recommend this game for everyone who enjoyed Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode 1. The opening is mysterious and eerie as you start out in the destoryed train. You then get your first glimpse of the Combine superportal. You try to head to White Forest to give Isaac Kleiner and Eli Vance the data package you found in the Citadel. It's a race against time as the Combine will try a kill you every chance you get. The ending, the ending, WTF VALVE!!!1!1!!! MAKE HBALF-LIFE 3! Sorry, I just had to get that out of the way. Anyway, I would really recommend this game. 10/10!			",80,5,0,0,1,0,0

												Pretty good game. You are a garden gnome, being taken to a ship with your escorts Gordan Freeman and Alyx Vance. Only 4.4% of the time you actually make it. The other times you aren't even noticed or you die. What a shame. When you do make it however, you get sent off, blown up and forgotten about.We need a sequel to find out if we survived the explosion or not. It is important. Thanks for understanding Valve.

Heck, the only thing I'd consider mandatory is having the chance to slaughter the worm that killed Eli in a DOOM style fight of bloody proportions.Everything else is optional for me.

												If you're on the third installment of Half-Life 2, you're probably already a fan. If not, then I'll give you a few details about this game that stood out to me particularly.-Atmosphere: The Half-Life series has, by far, the best atmosphere of any game I've played. The combination of visual aesthetics and aural details immerse you. This is probably the biggest detail I don't see talked about enough.-Combat: Every weapon connects very well and gives you solid feedback which makes the firefights feel fluid and dynamic. The big selection of weapons lets you decide how you want to play.-Movement: As in every Valve game, the movement is very flowing. The ease of jumping and sprinting make the movement feel more controlled than in most games.The Half-Life series is my favorite and I hope you consider these notes to play this game!

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 6 hoursDespite the fact that some of you may have not considered Episode One great, Episode Two really nails the cake. Ignoring the fact that it contains about twice as many achievements and is about twice as long, Episode Two is spot-on on everything it does and I personally think it's the flagship game (well, expansion) of the Half-Life series.The game provides players with as many interesting situations, except, they are somewhat better than the first episode. A new addition, the Hunters, may prove to be frustrating enemies, but they do offer a nice challenge once you get used to it.This episode also comprehends a lot of interesting concepts and sneak peeks upon the Half-Life universe, leading up to the sequel which sadly Valve hasn't made even today. But that should not bother you, however, because Episode Two stands up well even if it were a standalone game. While Episode One may have been liked and disliked by others (it is an acquired taste), Episode Two will certainly be loved by everyone, more or less, and is overall a must-have for the fans of this franchise.

												Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is an excellent continuation of the series, and introduces several fun new enemies and challenges, along with the unforgettable muscle car. I found it to be the most intense and difficult game of the Half-Life 2 anthology, especially in the finale (even on Easy). Episode 2 thrusts you back into the H.E.V. Suit of Gordon Freeman once more, but in a completely new forested environment. As the game progressed, I found it even more emotional than all the precursors, as well as giving a strong sense of buildup to a climax (HL3, anyone?). However, this Episode is not all glitter and sparkles. I did find the first hour or so of gameplay to be a bit redundant, but after that, it sucked me right back in. Anyway, Episode 2 is still a worthy addition to the franchise and a must-play for anyone remotely interested in the series, and still a great experience for anyone else. Totally worth buying.

												A well done pause to Half Life 2.Why call it a pause, not an end you ask? That is for you find out, but it's done in the same way Portal 1 was.If you haven't played HL2:EP2 by the time HL3 or HL2:EP3 comes out, you should. Half Life 2, while not much of a ""heart pounding"" action game, is about the puzzles and events. Sure story is there, but a lot of people who play through HL2 don't notice it. It's not critical, nor really engaging on any level.So all in all, should play this, but don't expect your socks being blown off. It's more like of those games you play and put in your library to collect dust. I revist the whole HL series from time to time, but that's not common for others.7/10			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												The final part of Half Life 2 fight the newly introduced Hunters as well as Toxic antlions. Fight an antlion guard and a toxic antlion at the same time which is probably one of the funest battles in the game. Fight striders and see a new enemy called an advisor. Team up with vorts to save Alyx and fight waves of enemies as the hero.  Best fps campaign ever. Half Life 2 is well worth it's price just buy the organe box or Half Life complete to play the best fps storyline ever.  Amazing storyline and fun well worth $8, There are 5 Half Life 2 games and Half life has 8 letters in it. 8-5= 3 HALF LIFE 2 GABE HALF LIFE 3The game by iteself is a lil too short 9/10Half Life 2 overall 10/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												It is hard to believe this game has been around for nine years.The 8.7 hours I have recorded is below the actual time I have played this game. I have been through it several times, and it has never lost its appeal. It is the masterpiece of the Half-Life saga and embodies the series' ability to do so much with the FPS genre. The game's first segment involves exploring claustrophobic mines and antlion tunnels. After one of the trippiest scenes in all video gaming, Episode Two shifts to lush, open terrain as you burst around the White Forest in a muscle car. The game ends with a massive battle against Combine forces that was completely revolutionary in 2007.This game did it all in a campaign that only lasted a few hours. It is the game most deserving of a sequel.			",106,21,0,11,6,0,18

												Absolutely the best game franchise in my opinion. The story and the characters all combine in such a well written story and game overall If you have not yet played these games, You should. And you can get them cheaper with the steam sale. I don't know if i should hate or love the cliffhanger but i hope to live till Half Life 3. And yes i nominated this for ""The Deserves A Sequal Award.10/10			",56,0,0,1,3,0,1

												The second to last game of the franchise. Lots of fun, new elements, and longer than the last episode. The last battle is one of the hardest of the series. The ending is... well, find out, and tell us how much you despise how they have left us off with that for 9 years			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WOW!!!!   For some reason I couldn't remember playing this after it come out in 2007.   I think it was something to do with the episonic releasing format and I wasn't going to be a part of that then.   Anyhow, flash forward to 2016 and I'm playing through all the halflife games front-to-finish.  This one surprises me, had me by the nose the entire game and I couldn't put it down or walk away.   Finished it finally and NOW after all these nine years I see why everyone has been harping on ""WHERE IS EPISODE 3?  Where is HL3?!?!?!""   Just amazing.  I love it!   Want more.   Want to stomp those suckers too!   Can't wait for the future of this series.   Well... guess I will be, but.... Hey Valve!  Hurry up and take my money!  PLEASE.   :)			",354,112,8,67,23,2,28

												At first I didn't get Half-Life 3 jokes. Sure, I chuckled at them when I saw them, but nothing more than that. Then I got enlightened. My friend held his 9mm against my head, telling me that he'll kill me if I don't play the game. I told him to go ahead, because I wanted to die anyways. Then he threatened that he'll kill my family and my cat, to which I responded that I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them, either. Then he said he'll empty a mag into my laptop, so I had to comply. I played through the original Half-Life 2 and then it's two episodes, and I realized. Half-Life 3 jokes are not jokes... They're pleads. They're moans. They're begs for the series to continue. It's not about shooting dozens of Combine soldiers and synths, it's not about liberating an Eastern European town swarmed by alien forces. This is not a game. This is a masterpiece. I know this is heresy against PC master race but... I must say: ""♥♥♥♥ you, Valve."" ♥♥♥♥ you so hard for doing this to us. You give us one of the best games of the decade, and you end it with a ♥♥♥♥ing cliffhanger, and no conclusion after all we've been through? That's sequel-baiting, but... if you do that... THEN GIVE US A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SEQUEL! Anyways... Do I recommend Half-Life 2 and it's episodes? Depends. If you can swallow the fact that you'll be immersed into a story with no end, waiting for the sequel, which will, let's face it, probably never come out, sure, get it and play it, it'll be one of the best experiences that a game can give you. Otherwise, just play Half-Life 2 without the episodes and act like it ended there, with the Dark Energy reactor exploding..			",65,9,0,6,6,0,4

												Half Life 2 Episode 2.... did you like the story, and gameplay to Half Life 2, and  Episode 1, you will like the story to episode 2. If you did you will like this. It is a continuation to the epic story from Half Life 2, and Half Life 2 Episode 1.Pros.-Great graphics considering its age (over 10 years old)-runs great even on low end machines.-epic story-good weapon selection-good AIcons:my main gripes about Episode 2 is the same as Episode 1, do not take this as a do not buy this however. I bought this game again even though I own it already on XBox 360 and played through it again here. I love this game :).-In Episode 1 and Episode 2 there are no new weapons.-In episode 1 and Episode 2 the story length feels short (the episodes are however cheaper than the base game)-No full controller support (This game does not work witha controller like with the 360.) It is not a big deal, but to say partial controller support is spinning the truth. You cannot celect all of your weapons with a controller. This seems like something that could have been fixed with a patch.All said and done I did play this with a keyboard and mouse. IT was a blast, and the computer version was converted to use a controller (even if with poor support,) so playing with a keyboard and mouse like old school games is no big deal. If you do not already own this game BUY IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.			",94,8,0,13,7,1,10

You then get your first glimpse of the Combine superportal. You try to head to White Forest to give Isaac Kleiner and Eli Vance the data package you found in the Citadel. It's a race against time as the Combine will try a kill you every chance you get. The ending, the ending, WTF VALVE!!!1!1!!! MAKE HBALF-LIFE 3! Sorry, I just had to get that out of the way.

You can see the improvements when looking at graphics, the locations, enemies, the pacing through the chapters and how much longer it takes to complete without a dull moment.  There are some mechanics that simply aren't used in Half-Life 2 or Episode One and they only help improve a fantastic series.			",189,85,0,25,16,1,16

												In an attempt to reduce production time (that apparently didn't work :P), the rest of the story for Half-Life 2 was broken into an episodic structure. This is episode two. It is shorter, but still just as sweet.This continuation of the FPS Half-Life 2 is just as well done this time too. The same interesting characters, shocking events and horror atmosphere pervade. The same enemies and variety of tools are there. It's just more of Half-Life 2, and, like before, it ends with unanswered questions and begs for more. It even teases more in an episode 3 that has yet to come...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It deserves that sequel or at the very least a final episode 3.Look, even if it isn't mind blowing at all just making it a solid, well written ending with good gameplay would be far better than not having any closure at all. Heck, the only thing I'd consider mandatory is having the chance to slaughter the worm that killed Eli in a DOOM style fight of bloody proportions.Everything else is optional for me.

												If you're on the third installment of Half-Life 2, you're probably already a fan. If not, then I'll give you a few details about this game that stood out to me particularly.-Atmosphere: The Half-Life series has, by far, the best atmosphere of any game I've played. The combination of visual aesthetics and aural details immerse you. This is probably the biggest detail I don't see talked about enough.-Combat: Every weapon connects very well and gives you solid feedback which makes the firefights feel fluid and dynamic. The big selection of weapons lets you decide how you want to play.-Movement: As in every Valve game, the movement is very flowing. The ease of jumping and sprinting make the movement feel more controlled than in most games.The Half-Life series is my favorite and I hope you consider these notes to play this game!

												Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is an excellent continuation of the series, and introduces several fun new enemies and challenges, along with the unforgettable muscle car. I found it to be the most intense and difficult game of the Half-Life 2 anthology, especially in the finale (even on Easy). Episode 2 thrusts you back into the H.E.V. Suit of Gordon Freeman once more, but in a completely new forested environment. As the game progressed, I found it even more emotional than all the precursors, as well as giving a strong sense of buildup to a climax (HL3, anyone?). However, this Episode is not all glitter and sparkles. I did find the first hour or so of gameplay to be a bit redundant, but after that, it sucked me right back in. Anyway, Episode 2 is still a worthy addition to the franchise and a must-play for anyone remotely interested in the series, and still a great experience for anyone else. Totally worth buying.

Actually, this is a very good game, go buy it now if you don't have it already. I sure hope it wins an award in the steam awards thingy, but I also want that badge sooo... Anyway, this game is what story-based/influenced FPS' are about. Would recommend, rating 2.9/3.			",37,5,0,2,3,0,2

Or atleast make it final that you're not making it. Please Valve talk with us! Half-Life, Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episodes rated by me is a 10/10!			",45,4,0,2,3,2,0

												A well done pause to Half Life 2.Why call it a pause, not an end you ask? That is for you find out, but it's done in the same way Portal 1 was.If you haven't played HL2:EP2 by the time HL3 or HL2:EP3 comes out, you should. Half Life 2, while not much of a ""heart pounding"" action game, is about the puzzles and events. Sure story is there, but a lot of people who play through HL2 don't notice it. It's not critical, nor really engaging on any level.So all in all, should play this, but don't expect your socks being blown off. It's more like of those games you play and put in your library to collect dust. I revist the whole HL series from time to time, but that's not common for others.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then there's the build up and cliff-hanger ending setting up what is to come next, completely justifying the hype.Overall a brilliant game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Continues on the story, and has a good mix of combat and puzzle solving. Good music, too. Compared to the previous two games, I know this game inside and out, where to go, what to do, and exactly when and how to do it. And it doesn't get old; that's how fun it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well Episode 2 was a lot more interesting than Episode 1. It definitely felt like there was more content packed in, and it shows in the time played. Likes: You get to drive another vehicle! Once again, driving has brought back the exhilarating feeling missing from Episode 1, as long as you don't attempt that Little Rocket Man achievement like I did. Might have to go back and experience the driving again, free of the little gnome that keeps falling off. Everything else felt familiar and it was easy to get right back into the game after completely Episode 1. Dislikes: Once again the ending didn't feel as dramatic as it could have been, but I can't really pinpoint what felt 'off'. There are definitely a couple of things still unsolved which probably will be in Episode 3 or HL3.Overall: good game and smooth continuation of the Half-Life storyline. Could once again probably have been included in Half-Life 2 along with Episode 1 as it is basically the same game, but splitting it into three parts allowed good pacing. 9.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have never been a tremendous fan of shooter games. Although I used to play a fair bit of TF2, I always found the genre a bit too repetitive and mindless. Eventually, I decided to play the Half-Life series; after all, it is supposed to be, arguably, the best game series of all time. I played through HL, HL2, and HL:E1. I thought they were quite good for the genre, and certainly had their own moments of brilliance. However, I could never completely understand why they were so unanimously superior to every other game. I finally decided to play Episode 2. Now, I understand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion HL2E2 is the crowning achievement of everything Valve has released. I have not played with the new graphical mod but even without it this game has some of the most amazing looking graphics I have seen in a video game. This is partially due to its technical achievements but also due to many of the great environments we are taken to. HL2E2 has great new puzzles and is hugely important to the overall story. As I played the game I was brought to new places and met interesting people. Cool new mechanics were introduced and I was on the edge of my seat until the very end. It is hard for me to put into words exactly how amazing this new installment in the HL series was. Know that it is one of the greatest video game experiences to date and it blows HL1 HL2 and HL2E1 out of the water, 10/10 If you play one video game make sure it is Half Life 2 Episode 2.

												Half-Life 2: Episode Two is the final game in the Half-Life series until Valve remembers what it even is that they're supposed to be doing. As such, you might be hoping that it's really, really good as a result.Well, THANK GOODNESS. It's actually worth the play. The worst part of Half-Life 2: Episode Two is when you have to play Episode One to bridge to it from HL2. Episode Two isn't perfect, but there's plenty of fun, and more than enough tension to go around.It starts off with a good sudden WHAM moment, and then loses appeal for awhile as you crawl through endless caverns brimming with Antlions. Because after Episode 1, what players really craved was MORE Antlions. It gets better near the end of the caverns, when you find yourself being chased screaming from tunnel to tunnel by the Antlion Guardian. It's the beginning of a series of tense moments that this installment delivers so very, very well.Over the course of the game, you'll do a fair share of driving, have a large-scale shootout from an abandoned inn, and blow up something around a dozen Striders (which can be a highlight or a detriment, depending on how you are at that section). There are some great sequences, some great plot, and you get the Antlions out of the way early on so you have the rest of the game open for fun! All of this in an episodic installment that's longer than a lot of full-price modern shooters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another expansion in the form of Episode 2. Again, it's short, nothing ground breaking but does extend the overall games' narrative. It ends abruptly and to date has never let you complete the story and probably never will. There is one shocking death, yet as mentioned in my HL2 review you never know who people are from the first HL so when it happened I had no thoughts on the event and quickly forgot about it.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was FANTASTIC. It is easily one of my favorite games to date now. Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is an amazing game, I can't even describe why. DO NOT look up ANYTHING about this game, it is too great to be spoiled. It's not the best game ever, but it is really fun! I loved this more than Episode 1, and there were some parts in this game that I enjoyed more than some of HL and HL2's levels. This is more open than Episode 1, which means there are a ton of ways to take down baddies. There is only one part of this game that I didn't like, and that is a certain level that is a bit tedious and you need to backtrack a lot. Other than that the only terrible thing is the wait for Episode 3 and HL3. If you haven't played HL2, and Episode 2, you will be lost, so play those games first. 9/10 in my opinion.

												I still can't withstand the fact that this is supposed to be the end: ""The game the needs a sequel"", it can't end like this, please...Episode Two is another masterpiece from the Half-Life series and hopefully not the end of the series.It provides you excellent gameplay, deep characters, good humor, references to older and other games and has all in all beautiful story telling. The Half-Life series is one of those rare games that emotional engages you to the characters and especially to the protagonist. From the bare beginning in Black Mesa on you feel somewhat connected to Gordon and you just want to know how his story will continue but we will probably never get to know...Metacritic:90 / 100 Metascore9.2 / 10 User Score			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best experiences ive ever had while playing a game! I love the Half Life series and for it to end in this way, or rather not end..? Is why I realise Half Life 3 should be made. Compared to the other Half Life games, this by far has the best graphics and story line and I felt they did everything right in this, unlike the other games this had the perfect balance of action and story. It ends on the weirdest possible moment, so..HL3 confirmed?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are quite a few new allies to meet and interact with and the battles are just great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much better than the first episode and that is saying a lot, considering this is an expansion it provides a lot of content and if you are a fan of the original you already own and beat this haha, but if you are not consider getting the original and both addons, you won't regret it.

												HELL ♥♥♥♥ING YES! Episode 2 comes out and kicks even more♥♥♥♥♥than episode 1 did! It now has more story,♥♥♥♥♥kicking, and better graphics and physics! Valve continues making the best damn FPS ever!Graphics: So most people would think that because its using the Source engine still would like the same. Well hell no it doesn't! The updated the graphics in the game and now it looks even better than it did before! You have higher resolution textures all over the place. Improved models on some of the characters and improved textures on them. Such as the G-man who now looks ♥♥♥♥ing real. A whole new ♥♥♥♥ing particle system that improves the blood a whole punch and not to mention makes almost anything using particles a whole lot better looking. The green laser beam on the alien slaves no longer looks ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but rather smooth and good looking. The fire is no longer just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sprite and is now done with particles and looks a ♥♥♥♥ing billion times better. Not to mention, Fatty McGabe put in WAY improved lighting for the whole entire game and now it has ♥♥♥♥ing soft shadows which look ♥♥♥♥ing great! I can now zoom in on alex's black/asain ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and jack off to some high resolution textures! Also the environments are now in the forest and hilly types areas with huge open outdoor environments which look ♥♥♥♥ing great. The trees look ♥♥♥♥ing amazing as well! The whole damn good looks improved big time and if you disagree then you are a ♥♥♥♥♥moking ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The art direction is excellent as always and makes the game look just awesome. Oh then there is the physics which have improved ♥♥♥♥ing ten fold! Buildings collapse and fall apart in hundreds of pieces and bridges bend and collapse. They basically just ♥♥♥♥ing improved the graphics alot. The physics still aren't good enough for Alex's face to warp when i smash her in the head with my crowbar. So the game looks damn good.Sound: The sound again is ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT. The voice acting is top notch once again the dialog is just as good. Infact I would say the dialog was even better because its more interesting and its actually funny. Eli makes comments about how he wants you to bone his daughter and gordon is so going to do it. Hes gonna get that ♥♥♥♥♥ whether she likes or it not. He will stick his zero point gravy field manipulator inside of her. I've heard Gordon's♥♥♥♥♥♥is the size of a strider leg. Anyways the dialog and voice acting is top notch as always. They also updated the sounds for some of the weapons such as the pistol now has a better reloading sound. Then the music is all new and sounds ♥♥♥♥ing great. It plays right in the middle of while you are dominating some ♥♥♥♥♥es and it makes you want to ♥♥♥♥ing kill a strider then ram it in the G-mans♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay: Holy dog♥♥♥♥♥♥they took an already great game and made it ten times better. So you travel through the forest to get to the main silo place at wherever and the whole way you kick♥♥♥♥♥ You get to partner up with the vortigaunts and slaughter some stupid ant-lion aliens who deserve it. Then you kick zombie as well as solving all sorts of new physics puzzles mixed in with the action. The puzzles are also way more interesting to figure out then previously such as the balancing of the bridge so you can fly the damn car over it. You also get to kick tons of combine♥♥♥♥♥in the various areas you go to. Such as the house scene where you get trapped in and the house is getting shot up and you have to kick tons of ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention, you eventually get a car that is way better than the dunebuggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ This thing ♥♥♥♥ing flies and you can run over tons of people with it. Not to mention there is a new enemy called hunters which shoot these stupid spikes at you and then they explode. Not even they are a match for the car when i ♥♥♥♥ing floor them into a rock. The whole game just has tons of kick♥♥♥♥♥action sequences but none as good as the end. You drive around in your car shooter bombs at tons of striders as they lay waste to the buildings around you. It just ♥♥♥♥ing kicks♥♥♥♥♥ The action in this game is just so damn good it makes you wonder how good episode 3 will be.Story: So the story is greatly advanced in this game with the Gman coming around telling you what to do. Eli has abunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥to say about whats happening and then you get to see abunch of the stupid alien blob advisors who come around. Basically the story is continued and its damn good and damn well improved. Also they make tons of references to what happened at Black Mesa and how it relates to this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Basically the story ♥♥♥♥ing rocks and they make it even better..I won't spoil it this time though because Im such a nice guyEpisode 2 ♥♥♥♥ing rocks your face 11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Half-Life games are incrediable. Possibly the best games ever made. No question about. They are still better games then some being made today, If you love well made, fun, adventerous, made bending, creepy, balenced, games then play it. Don't read any other reviews. Just play it. Now, to VALVe. I have one, simple, request. MAKE FRICKEN HALFLIFE 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IS IT THAT HARD TO ASK?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? WE HAVE BEEN WAITING TEN PLUS YEARS. HOW FRICKEN LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A GAME?!?!?! HL3 HADE BETTER BE THE BEST GAME EVER MADE. AND IF I SEE LEFT 4 DEAD 3 COME OUT BEFORE HL3, YOU WILL HAVE OFFECIALY LOST A FAN TO THE HALF-LIFE GAMES. GABE, JUST MAKE THE GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well Episode 2 was a lot more interesting than Episode 1. It definitely felt like there was more content packed in, and it shows in the time played. Likes: You get to drive another vehicle! Once again, driving has brought back the exhilarating feeling missing from Episode 1, as long as you don't attempt that Little Rocket Man achievement like I did. Might have to go back and experience the driving again, free of the little gnome that keeps falling off. Everything else felt familiar and it was easy to get right back into the game after completely Episode 1. Dislikes: Once again the ending didn't feel as dramatic as it could have been, but I can't really pinpoint what felt 'off'. There are definitely a couple of things still unsolved which probably will be in Episode 3 or HL3.Overall: good game and smooth continuation of the Half-Life storyline. Could once again probably have been included in Half-Life 2 along with Episode 1 as it is basically the same game, but splitting it into three parts allowed good pacing. 9.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say, this installment of the episodes of Half-Life really got to me.  It's about 3 times as long as the episode before it and is full of juicy story.  Its hard and gives quite the challenge even to seasoned gamers.  especilly if you go for the achievements.  Overall the only downside is the major cliff hanger at the end, but I'll leave that for you to find out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I still can't withstand the fact that this is supposed to be the end: ""The game the needs a sequel"", it can't end like this, please...Episode Two is another masterpiece from the Half-Life series and hopefully not the end of the series.It provides you excellent gameplay, deep characters, good humor, references to older and other games and has all in all beautiful story telling. The Half-Life series is one of those rare games that emotional engages you to the characters and especially to the protagonist. From the bare beginning in Black Mesa on you feel somewhat connected to Gordon and you just want to know how his story will continue but we will probably never get to know...Metacritic:90 / 100 Metascore9.2 / 10 User Score			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HELL ♥♥♥♥ING YES! Episode 2 comes out and kicks even more♥♥♥♥♥than episode 1 did! It now has more story,♥♥♥♥♥kicking, and better graphics and physics! Valve continues making the best damn FPS ever!Graphics: So most people would think that because its using the Source engine still would like the same. Well hell no it doesn't! The updated the graphics in the game and now it looks even better than it did before! You have higher resolution textures all over the place. Improved models on some of the characters and improved textures on them. Such as the G-man who now looks ♥♥♥♥ing real. A whole new ♥♥♥♥ing particle system that improves the blood a whole punch and not to mention makes almost anything using particles a whole lot better looking. The green laser beam on the alien slaves no longer looks ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but rather smooth and good looking. The fire is no longer just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sprite and is now done with particles and looks a ♥♥♥♥ing billion times better. Not to mention, Fatty McGabe put in WAY improved lighting for the whole entire game and now it has ♥♥♥♥ing soft shadows which look ♥♥♥♥ing great! I can now zoom in on alex's black/asain ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and jack off to some high resolution textures! Also the environments are now in the forest and hilly types areas with huge open outdoor environments which look ♥♥♥♥ing great. The trees look ♥♥♥♥ing amazing as well! The whole damn good looks improved big time and if you disagree then you are a ♥♥♥♥♥moking ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The art direction is excellent as always and makes the game look just awesome. Oh then there is the physics which have improved ♥♥♥♥ing ten fold! Buildings collapse and fall apart in hundreds of pieces and bridges bend and collapse. They basically just ♥♥♥♥ing improved the graphics alot. The physics still aren't good enough for Alex's face to warp when i smash her in the head with my crowbar. So the game looks damn good.Sound: The sound again is ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT. The voice acting is top notch once again the dialog is just as good. Infact I would say the dialog was even better because its more interesting and its actually funny. Eli makes comments about how he wants you to bone his daughter and gordon is so going to do it. Hes gonna get that ♥♥♥♥♥ whether she likes or it not. He will stick his zero point gravy field manipulator inside of her. I've heard Gordon's♥♥♥♥♥♥is the size of a strider leg. Anyways the dialog and voice acting is top notch as always. They also updated the sounds for some of the weapons such as the pistol now has a better reloading sound. Then the music is all new and sounds ♥♥♥♥ing great. It plays right in the middle of while you are dominating some ♥♥♥♥♥es and it makes you want to ♥♥♥♥ing kill a strider then ram it in the G-mans♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay: Holy dog♥♥♥♥♥♥they took an already great game and made it ten times better. So you travel through the forest to get to the main silo place at wherever and the whole way you kick♥♥♥♥♥ You get to partner up with the vortigaunts and slaughter some stupid ant-lion aliens who deserve it. Then you kick zombie as well as solving all sorts of new physics puzzles mixed in with the action. The puzzles are also way more interesting to figure out then previously such as the balancing of the bridge so you can fly the damn car over it. You also get to kick tons of combine♥♥♥♥♥in the various areas you go to. Such as the house scene where you get trapped in and the house is getting shot up and you have to kick tons of ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention, you eventually get a car that is way better than the dunebuggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ This thing ♥♥♥♥ing flies and you can run over tons of people with it. Not to mention there is a new enemy called hunters which shoot these stupid spikes at you and then they explode. Not even they are a match for the car when i ♥♥♥♥ing floor them into a rock. The whole game just has tons of kick♥♥♥♥♥action sequences but none as good as the end. You drive around in your car shooter bombs at tons of striders as they lay waste to the buildings around you. It just ♥♥♥♥ing kicks♥♥♥♥♥ The action in this game is just so damn good it makes you wonder how good episode 3 will be.Story: So the story is greatly advanced in this game with the Gman coming around telling you what to do. Eli has abunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥to say about whats happening and then you get to see abunch of the stupid alien blob advisors who come around. Basically the story is continued and its damn good and damn well improved. Also they make tons of references to what happened at Black Mesa and how it relates to this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Basically the story ♥♥♥♥ing rocks and they make it even better..I won't spoil it this time though because Im such a nice guyEpisode 2 ♥♥♥♥ing rocks your face 11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Episode 2 of the Half-Life franchise following up on the main story, goes in-depth with what happened after the train crashed when the explosion went off, how to save Alyx when she is attacked by a great mechanical hunter, and picking up on all loose nooses as you find your way up to Alyx´s father and the facility in which they have established. After this, the great war that will ensure that the Combine won´t enter the world with a ton of more armies. It definitely is all-round the bases. Again great installment, this one is a LOT more content-filled and challenging in terms of content, and you will be tested in a few new ways previously not known to Half-Life. Definitely a must regardless, especially if you have come this far. Have fun!			",39,3,1,0,1,0,3

												The best game you could ever play. I've played every Half-Life game and I've loved them all. The real thing is that... I'm waiting for Half-Life 3. The thing that makes me want the game come out is that.... Episode 2 ended as a cliff hanger, I think most of you would agree with me or maybe all of you ? Half-Life is the best game ever in HISTORY. Everybody just likes it. Or maybe not.About Half-Life 3Okay... So everybody is waiting for Half-Life 3 right ? Yea, you probably are xD The game would probably be a arctic like style xD I think the reason that Half-Life 3 hasn't been released is because.... They are trying to catch-up with the current technology, they are trying to make the game ground-breakingly awesome. In a interview, Gabe said that he hates to make us wait. The Half-Life 3 Developing team had a team of 100 people and now 10. Anybody is barely working on it... Gabe doesn't want to disappoint us :) He does everything, he can in his power to release HALF-LIFE 3 ! :) So there is Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2... It means 1+2 = 3 ! HALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED			",51,3,1,1,1,0,0

Product received for free
Official Nomination for the “GAME THAT DESERVES A SEQUEL” Steam Award in 2016.Got this gifted by a friend because the german version is censored.It is what it. A straight sequel of Episode 1. This time you will find yourself in a different environment but it still looks and feels like a Half Life game.Protip: Avoid the community Hub of Steam because SPOILERS!The game comes for Linux as well and runs amazing. If you're using Steam OS, this title is a MUST HAVE. But even if you use a different Linux System (I use Mint) you can still have a wonderful Windowsfree gaming experience. Totally worth the price, even when it's not on sale.However… expect to face a big big cliffhanger....because there is no Half Life² Episode 3, even thou it was announced. And there's also STILL no Half Life 3 in sight because the lazy jerks at Valve don't wanna make games anymore. Or they moved all capacities to design new hats for Team Fortress 2.Enjoy Half Life 2 Episode 2 since this will be the last Half Life Game that won't require a Virtual Reality Headset ;)			",94,11,1,6,9,0,0

												Известная игра Half-Life от создателей Valve. Они не перестают удивлять своими играми. И сейчас напишу о Half-Life 2 эпизод 2. Новые как всегда приключения героя игры Гордона Фримена. Игра одним словом - шедевр! Игра заметно улучшилась, графика +. Улучшенный интеллект ботов, это радует. Так же новые враги, очень интересно. Управление все так же радует. Особенно радует кинематографичная физика. Прохождение игры местами трудно и где-то даже легко. Где-то надо подумать, как пройти то или иное место в игре. Игру советую всем, чтобы понять всю ее красоту.			",407,84,17,38,13,2,42

SPOILERS AHEADContinuing the plot of Half-Life 2 and Episode One, Episode Two consists of seven chapters telling the story of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance's journey to a large Lambda Resistance base called White Forest. The Combine's Earth occupation forces have used the destruction of the Citadel to begin opening a massive super portal which, if allowed to reach critical size, would allow the Combine to call in reinforcements from their homeworld and destroy the Resistance. However, as explained by Dr. Kleiner's broadcast in Episode One, it has also caused a communications blackout, leaving the Combine isolated and disorganized in the meantime. In addition, Combine Advisors, some of them still unhatched from their pods, are scattered about the region after evacuating the Citadel. A crucial part of the plot is the Combine's message home, which was copied by Alyx and Gordon before making their escape, that the Combine sacrificed the Citadel to send. It contains data on the Combine portal code, which the Resistance can use to collapse the portal before it forms completely.After Gordon and Alyx climb out of the wreckage of the train they used to escape City 17, they proceed away from the former city on foot. At an old transmission station, the duo temporarily establish communication with Dr. Kleiner and Eli Vance, who are currently at White Forest. After an update of events at the now-destroyed Citadel, as well discovering the importance of the transmission packet copy that Alyx had made, they are cut off as Combine sweep the area, forcing them to move. At an abandoned mine, Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter. A vortigaunt discovers them, and leads them to an underground Resistance shelter. The vortigaunts there have the power to heal Alyx; however, Gordon must first venture into the nearby antlion colony to recover the larval extract necessary for the healing procedure.Gordon retrieves the extract and the vortigaunts begin to heal Alyx. While they are distracted, the G-Man is able to contact Gordon for the first time since the start of Episode One. He hints at Alyx's importance to his own long-term plans, revealing that he saved Alyx's life at Black Mesa despite objections from an unspecified third party. The G-Man then instructs an unconscious Alyx to tell her father to ""prepare for unforeseen consequences.""After Alyx has recovered, she and Gordon proceed to White Forest. They arrive before a convoy of Combine troops, despite being slowed by multiple ambushes, road blocks, and a near-death encounter with an Advisor. There, Alyx and Gordon are reunited with D0g, Dr. Kleiner, and Eli Vance. The player is also formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, another former Black Mesa scientist who is egotistical, verbose, and authoritarian. The team of scientists are preparing a rocket, which they plan to use in conjunction with the Combine portal code and the satellite array launched by Gordon in Half-Life, to close the Combine superportal.After Gordon fends off an initial Combine attack on the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman which she recovered at the Citadel in Episode One. It contains footage and the current coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, as Kleiner explains, one day suddenly vanished into thin air along with part of the surrounding drydock. Although it is not explained what technology the ship contains, Kleiner insists that it should be used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters that it is impossible to control and must be destroyed. Regardless, they agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx then unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, who is physically shaken. After having Alyx leave temporarily, Eli reveals to Gordon that it was the G-Man, whom he refers to as ""our mutual friend,"" who provided Black Mesa with the test sample that caused the ""resonance cascade"" (the Black Mesa incident) in Half-Life, and whispered that same strange warning to him just as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to further discuss this with Gordon after the superportal is closed.While the rocket is being prepared, White Forest comes under attack by a dozen Striders escorted by Hunters. Gordon engages and destroys them using experimental explosive charges created by Magnusson. The rocket is successfully launched and the super portal is closed, isolating Combine forces on Earth from their homeworld. Alyx and Gordon then prepare to leave for the Borealis, at which point Eli again warns Gordon about the ship's ""cargo"". The three of them head into a hangar, intending to board an old helicopter which Alyx has restored. However, a pair of Advisors burst into the hangar and restrain them. Alyx and Gordon watch helplessly as Eli is killed by one of the Advisors, but as the second Advisor prepares to kill Alyx, Dog bursts in through the roof and attacks it, causing both Advisors to flee. The game fades out slowly as Alyx, sobbing, clutches her father's body.			",167,11,7,5,8,1,4

The combine is advancing on White Forrest, a former Missile silo located in the hills. But before you can make your way there, you quest takes a dark turn, when Alyx is struck down and close to death. Episode 2 puts more heart and sole into the characters, and White Forrest itself sets the stage for one of the greatest forrest battles in gaming history. The game ends however on a very sad note, when Advisors attack following the successful lauch of the rocket.10/10			",28,2,0,1,1,0,6

												It's a quite intriguing game. When I was a primary school student, I encountered half-life series for the first time. But they could still bring me different feelings after so many years passed. Episode 2 is a great work. It knows how to attract you, such as giving you a new weapon after a period of time or providing some puzzles for you to solve from time to time. You cannot help sinking yourself into the story and keep on exploring the unknown in it. Well, in ep2, it seems that the story doesn't reach its ending so I am looking forward to the hl3's releasing:)			",40,3,0,0,1,0,2

												Half-Life 2: Episode Two is a first-person shooter video game, the second episode in a series of sequels to the 2004 Half-Life 2. It was developed by Valve Corporation in tandem with Episode One, the first game in the series, and released in 2007 via Valve's Steam content distribution platform. The episode was released both separately and as a part of a bundled package, The Orange Box.Pros : + Second episode of Half Life 2+ More Half Life goodness in a nutshell+ Lots of exciting set pieces+ Tons of backstory+ Source engine looks amazing as usual+ Driving a nice car + Steam achivements+ Crowbar is back again (awww how sweet)+ Emotinal ending (you must play it to see it)Cons : - Sadly is too short :( - Some segments can get boring- A few inconsistent and poorly executed sequences- Still waiting for Half Life 3 (who knows meybe 1 day it will be out)I recommend you buy Orange Box or Half Life series to uncover full journey of Gordon Freeman, Alyx Vance and helpful rebels along challenging puzzles with Steam achievements. If you have the game and did not try it, wake up and smell the ashes because you will not be sorry to take a long journey of Half Life 2 series.			",101,7,0,18,8,0,11

It came out in 2007So we won't get Half Life 3, because Half Life 2 episode 2 is ACTUALLY Half Life 3!ILLUMINATI NACHO FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER CONFIRMED!!!!!!!!(Seriously tho, where's Half Life 3?)

												Главная особенность второго эпизода — большие открытые пространства; лесная местность даёт игроку свободно путешествовать на новом автомобиле, а геймплей становится менее линейным: согласно задумке, с разнообразной тактикой ведения боя каждая битва будет непохожа на предыдущую. Кроме лесных территорий, игрок пройдёт заброшенные шахты, гнездо муравьиных львов и ракетную базу — все эти локации так же будут отличаться своей масштабностью.Во втором эпизоде нет такого сосредоточения на кооперативной игре, как в первом: хотя сюжетно игрок проходит всю игру вместе со своей напарницей Аликс Вэнс, во многих игровых событиях она по тем или иным причинам не принимает участия. Кроме Аликс, игроку предстоит сражаться бок о бок с дружественными вортигонтами.В Episode Two был немного изменён инвентарь игрока: фонарик теперь работает на независимой от HEV-костюма Фримена батарее. Разработчики расширили круг использования гравипушки: помимо применения её вместе с бомбами для страйдеров, было добавлено множество новых объектов, которые можно запускать во врага.Сюжет эпизода начинается там, где заканчивается Episode One. После взрыва Цитадели поезд, на котором уезжали Гордон Фримен и Аликс Вэнс, попадает под взрывную волну и терпит крушение. Им приходится добираться до главной базы Сопротивления — комплекса «Белая Роща» — своими силами. Главная цель — доставить в Белую Рощу данные, добытые в Цитадели, где содержатся секретные планы руководства Альянса, а также код частоты сверхпортала, образовавшегося над разрушенным Сити 17. Этот портал должен вновь прочно связать Землю и вселенную Альянса, что грозит человечеству приходом подкрепления инопланетных захватчиков и повторением Семичасовой войны («Если он наберёт полную силу то повторится Семичасовая война. Только на этот раз нам не продержаться и семи минут…» — Илай Вэнс). Однако, используя код частоты волны портала, у повстанцев есть возможность закрыть его при помощи ракеты со спутником, на котором установлен «зен-резонатор», запустив его из Белой Рощи. Но все усугубляется тем, что разведка Альянса обнаружила базу и туда уже направляется ударная армия. Фримен и Аликс вынуждены поторопиться, чтобы успеть доставить данные и предупредить повстанцев о надвигающейся угрозе.			",48,3,0,1,0,0,0

It's a more than worthy sequel, and looks a bit better than the previous installments. Also, you will learn to hate the new hunters.			",96,21,1,21,6,2,9

												This game is great overall, but it has its fair share of faults. Some great things are the hunters, which are a challenge (and one of the few video game enemies I actually fear), the great environments, and an antlion fight. But its faults are a fight with multiple striders and dozens of hunters at the end, the cliffhanger at the end, and most importantly, the lack of another game to tell more of the story. Valve's avoidance (e.g. silence, dodging questions) on the series seems to indicate that they've backed themselves into a corner and don't care about Half-Life anymore. Either that or they think the number three is a myth. Please Valve, talk to us.			",52,1,0,0,3,0,1

												Where HL2's third day was slow and boring, and Episode One was claustrophobic and close-quarters, Episode Two provides a new experience for the series. The environments are open and beautiful, and the new vehicle, an old 1970 Dodge Charger, along with the new vehicle physics system makes this vehicle leagues abouve the buggy from HL2.Victory Mine, the Radio Station, the White Forest Inn, and of course White Forest Missile Base all provide new environments that give different and new experiences to the series.Arne Magnusson, Uriah, Eli, Kleiner, the Vortiguants, and of course the dynamic duo of Sheckley & Griggs each provide engaging dialogue with everyone, even though Gordon as usual speaks not a word.The ending however, leaves a feel-bad hole, even now almost six years after first playing it. The fact that we don't have HL3 or Episode Three to see the conclusion makes the ending of the game almost surreal, as we have an incomplete story.One last thing, that damn gnome, Rufus, is just plain evil. If you're going for 'Little Rocket Man', be prepared to use your quicksave key frequently.			",247,30,4,21,15,3,25

Half-Life 2: Episode Two is not conclusive, it's best not to even play Half-Life if you don't want to be stuck with a cliff hanger that could possibly never be tied up. It was meant to be a short entry that was little more than appetizer, it is however an acceptable entry that exceeded Episode One because of the semi-open world gameplay that at the time was more interesting and while it remained a linear game, it introduced new assets that kept it fresh. I'm of the opinion that Half-Life likely won't be finished, because of the exaggerated expectations of consumers, buyer beware.I do recommend this entry if you're going to play Half-Life because it will be the closest thing to a conclusion that you may get. The games have aged relatively well, but I can't speak for anyone younger than I am as I'm unsure how the young perceive our classical treasures. I understand that if you did have any interest in Half-Life, that you intended to play this entry regardless, but I can't recommend it at the standard price unless you have money to throw, because of its age, how short it is, and simply because it's not conclusive; there is no satisfaction gained from the ending. It's marked down often and a seventy-five percent reduction is more than adequate if you please to buy it. The Orange Box is also an adequate purchase to consider because it comes with the full Half-Life 2 package.And if you haven't bought Garry's Mod, it would be a good idea to buy it if you're buying older source games for the additional assets that can be used by Garry's Mod. It's an open ended sandbox game that due to extensive modification allows for completely different games using the same assets from your source-based games. Hence it's worthwhile to consider if you're buying these older source games as they allow you more freedom for modding a mod.E-RANKD-RANKC-RANKB-RANKA-RANKS-RANKI cleared this game on April 7th, 2014.

Hence it's worthwhile to consider if you're buying these older source games as they allow you more freedom for modding a mod.E-RANKD-RANKC-RANKB-RANKA-RANKS-RANKI cleared this game on April 7th, 2014.

												This game is pure awesomeness, and I highly recommend it for players who want a game with an interesting cast of characters and an exceptional storyline that is easy to follow and understand, while also having the shoot-them-up experience. It lasted me for a good 3 - 4 weeks with 2 hour sessions a week. Although it's a good game, I (being myself) chose the easy way out of the rather difficult ending 'battle', and used cheats to get to the cliff hanger ending. If you find that the game is to short for your taste, have a look at Half Life 1 or 2, not HLEpisode, as it is rather short as well.			",20,1,0,1,2,0,0

												The last part of the story that we have for now. I don't believe in HL3, I think this is the last HL we will ever have. The game is a bit short but longer than Episode One. There are lots of driving scenes but never gets boring because of the shootouts that happen between places. Very good game, I recommend it if you liked HL2			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite Half-Life 2 game in the series. The difficulty level is higher compared to Half-Life 2 and Episode One. The graphics and voice-acting are slightly better (the minor character rebels now has their own voice instead of using the normal citizen voice). The game really gives you the goosebumps unlike any other half-life 2 games (SPOILER) like the White Forest Inn ambush and the Strider Battle. And that ending really makes you want to know what is going to happen in Half-Life 3, which sadly valve won't haven't announced.................. yet.I have faith that they are working on it though! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Episode 2 introduces many new aspects to the game, such as a new environment. The story takes place outside of City 17, traveling through the surrounding forest and mines. It also introduces a few new enemies: the poison antlions and Hunters, which greatly enhances the game and makes it more challenging . This game induces a much more lifelike feel by focusing more on the relation between Alyx and Gordon, and strengthening her role in the game. As you progress you actually CARE about what happens to her, and you find yourself becoming ATTACHED to the game, which ultimately gives the game true meaning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, but...I can\'t recommend something that leaves you hanging in the middle of a story for 10 years and that still has no end in sight. Valve keeps silent and refuses to tell the players anything about anything related to the sequel.For all we know the whole saga may already be canceled, especially with the recent employee resignations.So...play this game at your own risk knowing it will end in a massive cliffhanger and that you will get no closure for it.Might as well just play Half-Life 2 and pretend it ends there. Don’t play the episodes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My review for Half-Life 2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/220Almost as good if not better in some ways compared to Half-Life 2. Though it also ends on an infamous cliffhangar that won't be resolved (shots fired) and it has an slightly tedious intro involving a cave (tedious when you are replaying it for the 100th time) I would say it's still worth getting. Hell all the Half-Life titles are worth getting and playign but that's besides the point. If you've somehow never played this I'm torn between recommending this as it's great or skipping it so you won't be stuck...waiting for a resolution to the series. In terms of pacing you'll be moving around a lot better (Or at least faster) than in Episode 1 partly because and with one exception there aren't many places for them to lock us up while they dump exposition on us even if it is as always consistantly well written and not terribly uninteresting. The highlight of Episode 2 is it's open environments in the great outdoors which were also present in Half-Life 2 and the game even hinted more a focus on exploring off the beaten path going forward in the series. But there lies the biggest problem. Going forward after playing Episode 2.

												Source technology at its finest. This game's detailed environments, extensive soundtrack and story are just one of the few things that makes this game the most definitive Half Life title. Play this, and it'll make you wish for a Half Life 3.You really do feel like you're trying your hardest to survive with Alyx Vance and using all of your skills and knowledge putting them through the ultimate test, as each danger and obstacle grows bigger and deadlier while the Combine are constantly making way towards you to keep you at bay. Get this game and you will truly experience gaming greatness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
