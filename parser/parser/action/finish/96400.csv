												Not only did the Devs REMOVE controller/gamepad support, but they abandoned any support for this game directly after this final act of stupidity.Keyboards controls need work (hence the need for controller support), no cloud saving, broken 'matchmaking' and poorly paced co-op (unless you play every second with your dedicated co-op partners, because you can only have 1 character). Good game, good potential, not worth the money unless you have a dedicated group of friends, and a modded contrller profile. (on sale also helps)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The PC version has sharper graphics than the Xbox360 version, but they removed both local co-op play, and all gamepad support. Had I realized these two features were missing, I definitely would not have bought this game. But it didn't occur to me to actually research whether they were removing features for the PC version... I learned a lesson there.From the devs on their forums: ""Regarding gamepads - the game plays waaaay better with mouse/keyboard so we elected to not support gamepads.""The lack of local co-op means you can only play multiplayer online, despite the original game being designed around having up to four players sitting around a TV at once. That feature is probably gone due to the PC version's controls. They added a keyboard+mouse control scheme, but completely removed any option to even use a gamepad. The keyboard controls aren't especially bad or really hard to use, but for an arcade-style shooter/platformer, gamepad is what I'm always going to prefer.			",2439,766,93,291,276,30,350

												Even if it's unbalanced, it's still a lot of fun to play either alone or with friends and there's a ton of content here for a downloadable game, enough that most people will likely never actually finish it all (either due to quantity or difficulty). Hunting for loot is addictive and the game itself is filled with humor. Much of the loot is silly in nature and every item has a description with some kind of joke or pop culture reference in it (the series of freeze rays contains modified lyrics to ""Ice, Ice, Baby,"" for example), so there feels like there's always another neat treasure to uncover, even if it's an item you'll never actually use.Shoot Many Robots succeeds in being highly fun. Apart from some minor annoyances in the inventory system and difficulty balance, its challenge, sense of humor and deep customization options make for a great game with long legs and huge potential for future expansion with DLC. Old school shooter fans should take heed. ",527,112,15,50,38,2,73

												I hop in my sweet RV, grab the gear I have and head out on the road to stop the massive invasion of robots before it’s too late. While battling the pesky pieces of scrap I come across many more weapons and gear to help me become more destructive and cause lots of more mayhem. This is my long mission of harder and harder destinations to save humanity and rid the world of worthless scrap metal.Shoot Many Robots is a 2D shooter, with 4player co-op where you try to survive thousands of drive you crazy robots, while leveling up, collecting bolts to buy bigger and better weapons and gear to help you throughout this difficult task. There are three difficulties to make your way through which have an assortment of levels you earn a star rating. There is only a small variety in the stages in the whole game so you will be seeing the same scenery a lot but just under harder conditions. Stage types are get to the end of stage with only flag at end or some with a boss, and survival style where you go through rounds.Graphics and design wise I really liked it. It was filled with humorous gear like a baby stroller that you carried on your back, a gun holster with no pants, or a space helmet. Each one had certain attributes to help or hurt you. Guns ranged between the standard fare of machine guns, flame throwers, pistols, and rocket launchers. You were able to equip a main weapon, secondary, head, backpack, and pants. This gives you lots of variety and can turn out pretty funny.Gameplay was fantastic and very challenging. I made it through all the normal and hard difficulties but had to give up after a few insane levels since those are made for co-op play. There is no story to worry about just one you create. I only had two issues with this game which was the dead online community and no controller support. It takes some getting used to paying with keyboard & mouse.I recommend playing this game as it can be a lot of fun especially if you have some friends to play it with. If you don’t own it yet you can find it pretty cheap quite often too so don’t miss out on this one.Bear Rating 8/10 ",2438,1021,85,323,253,20,376

												So Shoot Many Robots is a game where you play as a drunk hillbilly commiting mass robot genocide with his also drunk, also hillbilly heterosexual life partners. I'd end it there but let's go over some other stuff.PROS:* Large selection of weapons and armor (hats, shirts, and pants) lets you diversify your loadout* Primary weapon ammo is infinite, so that's all the more reason to spam M1 and mow everything down.* Secondary weapons are actually useful, their power only slightly nullified by having limited ammo.* Powerups are pretty useful and come by fairly often so that fights aren't too challenging if you prepared your gear right.* When gear crates drop, they don't disappear, so if you're getting swarmed you can just take them out and then grab it. Just be sure to hit a checkpoint after you pick the crate.* You can put on fishnets and said fishnets are endgame gear that boost your power by like 200 or whatever jesus christCONS:* Besides actively seeking other people out, this game has kinda nobody playing it. This makes my antisocial tendencies burn.* Finding gear in the form of crates, especially lategame, is a chore. Apparently there are specific loot tables for each level, but that doesn't really help.* Insane difficulty has, true to it's name, an insane difficulty ramp up from the previous levels. You better be prepared and bring along some friends for the ride.All in all, good game. Buy it. Right now. Game requires no pants to play.			",42,4,0,7,5,0,2

												I remember playing this game on xbox 360. A nice light hearted run and gun that you can enjoy with your friends while you share a beer or two. So when I found it on steam I immediately bought it, making the foolish assumption that it would support controller. It did not. I tried 3 different softwares to make my controller work with this game. But thanks to the cumbersome control layout on PC, none of them worked very well. The devs have paid no attention to this since the start and as a result I'd call it abandonware. They either have no idea how many sales they missed out on because of this, or they just don't care. Demiurge studios. Remember that name and the next time you're about to purchase a game by them, do consider if you'd instead get more joy out of watching your money swirling down the toilet instead.

												Shoot Many Robots is one of the most self-explanatory game titles I've ever run into.  You do missions and your goal is to shoot robots.  While that sounds rather simplistic, there's a lot of variety in the game to keep you going.  There's a good amount of enemy variety and a mechanic that lets you punch to reflect projectiles.  Robots drop money which you use to buy upgrades, and new upgrade unlocks can be found randomly in levels, from various pieces of clothing to new crazy weapons.  You can end up in some pretty wacky outfits, like a giant sombrero with fishnet stockings and fairy wings.There are a good variety of levels, from standard platforming levels to enclosed survival levels, with some decent variety in both types.  Playing with friends is recommended as you can easily get overwhelmed, especially in the later levels.  While generally well-paced, I find the balance to be skewed on the later levels on insane difficulty.  The problem is, you need the very best gear to complete these levels, yet you can only find those items on the very same levels.  It puts you in a very tough position.Overall, I very much enjoyed this game.  It's great for quick coop fun, just make sure you don't play with anyone with a flaky or laggy internet connection, because one person lagging will cause everyone to in the game's synchronous peer-to-peer networking model.

												The best way to describe this game is Metal Slug with 3D graphics and a loot system similar to Diablo however better in many ways.  Each thing you can equip not only changes the appearance of your character but also has meaningful statistics.  We are not talking about 2% to crits we are actually talking Meaningful upgrades.The graphics really surprised me,  I thought i'd seen great polygon powered 2D graphics but this is easily the best.This was quite a surprise and I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes games with tons of loot with contra/metal slug style gameplay. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This might be too obscure of a reference, but like, this game is to Contra or Metal Slug as Jets'n'Guns Gold is to Gradius or Life Force. Basically, same type of gameplay, but a meta-system of upgrades and leveling which feels unnecessary to the original gameplay it is an homage to, and which allows you to grind your way through the game.Now, I love grinding. I beat 7th Saga. The US version. five times. Once with a single character, alone. So if anyone knows grinding, it's me. But grinding in RPGs can be fun because RPGs are designed around grinding. Side-scrolling platformer-shooters are not. They're designed around memorization -- memorizing enemy patterns and when exactly they'll appear in the stage is supposed to be the equivalent of grinding here. But this game doesn't require much memorization, it just requires that you are tuff enuff to walk your way through everything.Nonetheless, I enjoyed this game. I don't think it's a very good game, but it's an enjoyable game, especially when played with a friend, or played casually. So against my better judgement, against everything I know about how games and gameplay work, I'll give it a thumbs up, just because there's nothing particularly terrible about this game. It's not in the company of the games I give negative reviews to. But it's also not quite at home with the games I give positive reviews to. It's more in Final Fantasy: The After Years territory -- a game to play after you already played all the good games in a genre, and want even more games in that genre and have to start getting into the mediocre ones.

												Shoot Many Robots is a fairly fun arcade shooter that seems to have gone more or less completely ignored, which is sad. I will warn people before they buy it, though, that despite looking like it has free aiming, it's really more like janky 16-way aiming.Also after playing it through to the end of the second difficulty with Umb, I had to revise my opinion because the game's difficulty scaled up and fun scaled down to the point where I can only say bad things about it.

												Shoot Many Robots is a simple arcade platform shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously. it provides some decent entertainment although it's dependency on multi-player and grind will shorten it's lifespan greatly.The concept is quite simple. You have a character with a gun in a 2D world. You can jump and shoot and move forwards and backwards. Once you understand this basic functionality the game starts spawning enemies, lots of enemies. The games experience/money system depends on you maxing out your kill chain and keeping it maxed for as long as possible.In between missions you will get a chance to buy stat improving equipment and new weapons, most of it which has some of the most ridiculous models you can think off. The ballerina skirt in particular comes to mind.That is pretty much all there is to it. There are some slightly more advanced moves such as sliding and slamming into the ground that is unlocked with certain equipment but neither are really necessary unless you are going for high scores.The multi-player dependency I mentioned is where the quality starts to decline, the game is made for 4 player coop but there is no system for playing with anyone outside your friends list and unless you can find someone to play with the game will quickly become stale.Another problem is the fact that you max out both equipment and experience long before you've actually finished the game leaving you little reason to continue playing beyond a need for high scores.All in all Shoot Many Robots is a fun little game and nothing more than that, if you have a couple of friends to play with it can be a great way to coop a little without the risk of a teammate ruining your day, for someone that plans to play it by yourself it is not a game to recommend however.

Great gameplay, terrible story. Very high on the replayability list and coop is absolutely the place to be in a game such as this.Extremely varied and wacky ""upgrades"" make for a fun, refreshing and allround extremely entertaining coop sidescroller.If i recall ight, even the soundtrack was a blast.

												It starts off giving you a good ""metal slug"" feeling, where the game is challenging yet fun and plenty of stuff to blow up, but as you level up it gets increasingly harder to the point it becomes impossible.Drop rates for inventory items is unesplicably and unreasonably low for a simple game like this, letting you stuck in a situation where you can't progress in the campaign because the enemies are just too strong and you are forced to play older missions over and over again hoping for some good item that could help you.I did almost 30 games without ever finding a new item.This totally kills the game, turning a somewhat fun experience into a frustrating repetitive and insanely hard gameplay.2/10 Removing from PC			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So for what reason you choose youre stuck at home, snowed in, got a few days of time to kill and youve beaten your latest AAA game. Lets consider your options!	 go to sleep, always good to get rest never hurts to take a nap, but that wastes time and you could be doing ANYTHING more productive. You could go outside, depending on weather and your idea of what is good, bad could be a great idea, i dont like the cold, myself Buy a cheap sidescroller and kill lots of time and shoot many robots.I chose the last of those three, and i was not dissapointed. The game has plenty of crude humor and lots challange without being one of those ""the enemy cheats  to make it harder games""The game has its pros and cons, like any game, considering the name of the game, it is grindy, lots of robots, lots of shooting and plenty of explosions.The game has a large variety hats, guns, primary and secondary, chest equipment and lots of suspect pants options,(including no pants at all.) there is a good amount of chaos in later levels requiring a keen eye for gaps and a readiness to jump/slide/punch. The leveling system is simple and really doesnt take long to level up.When it comes to the negative, i like to keep it simple and factual. (with more bullets) No controller support,  going for certain types of weapons is difficult since it's always random on two levels if a weapon drops and if its the one you want,  aiming up can feel off center and sometimes the aiming seems to get stuck at certain angles the stages and final bosses are recycled in each area which is slightly dissapointing but they seem to be more for closure purpose than any actual substance.In closing, this game is a fantastic time killer or outlet for frustrations, lots of explosions lots of weapons with which to cause them. If you enjoy side scrollers, or shooter games, certainly worth a look, Here's hoping you enjoy yourself! ",279,13,8,16,26,1,71

												This game is a complex euphamism for societies self destructive cycles. The robots represent the government, corporations and education, and the player stands for the budgets ( varying depending on the amount of players, the colors are important). When the player ""shoots many robots"" they are implying embezzlement in the system (of government, schooling systems, etc.). If there are two players (green and blue) it is the taint of the bloated paycheques of the corrupted police force. Adding a third player (red) with these first two factors shows the unheeded violence the police are payed to carry out for the government under the veil of ""keeping the peace"". The fourth yellow player is chaos. The chaos that the government funds and keeps cycling through our society to make sure we keep drinking their government water and buying their chosen government brands in their controlled, corrupt society.-Has good customization-Fun multiplayer-Very satisfying gameplayWould reccomend.

												An okay shoot'em'up platformer which can be fun in co-op mode.Warning: It has it's downsides! It will be very repetitive after a while. Also a massive grind if you want to unlock everything. You also need perfect gear to be able to beat the game on insane. The story... well, let's say it's non existing. The stlye itself is very primitive as well.The biggest issue I had with the game is how aiming works. Basically you can feel the effect of the game being made for consoles as the aim appears to ""lock"", almost like a D-Pad mode. This makes aiming frustrating and incapacitates sniper and low speed weapons a bit. It's best to have some AoE and faster attackspeed.One note regarding launch options - you must set the following launch option to avoid some ugly facebook integration that causes game crashes: -no_duckduckDo this by1. going into your library,2. right clicking the game in your list,3. select properties,4. click on ""Launch options"" and paste the following in there:-no_duckduck			",768,213,44,98,87,13,116

												Shoot Many Robots wants you to... well... shoot many robots.  It's a straightforward action title where you just have to kill a seemingly endless wave of robots. I do not consider it anything special. Games like these have been done to death.While killing these many, many robots, you're being awarded XP. Having enough XP will level up your character, allowing you to buy new gear and weapons. These new weapons and gear have different stats, and it's fun to combine these items. It's a cool idea and it's not just a visual thing.One thing that frustrated me was that, while playing, the game automatically changes weapons every now and then. No, not when running out of ammo (it does, but that isn't the issue here). Out of nowhere. It's quite annoying.Frustrating things aside; if you're looking for a mindless action title Shoot Many Robots might just be your cup of tea. It has pretty graphics ![Rating: 68/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This game was originally developed for Xbox360/PS3 and was later ported to the PC. Shoot Many Robots is a ""run-and-gun"" shooter like the fairly well known abandonware ""Abuse"". Surprisingly even though it was developed for the console it does not appear to support USB controllers although as a PC gamer I'd prefer the keyboard/mouse on a run-and-gun game. It would still be nice to have the option for a controller.Shoot Many Robots can be experienced both as a single player game as as a coop game online. Sadly along with the lack of USB controller support this game does not support local coop. Dispite these shortcomings the game is fun and reasonably well put together. There are a lot of different weapons and items available to unlock. The game is pretty easy to pick up but pairing items with weapons provides some interest. The gameplay can be a bit repetitive as there are only a handful of settings, enemies and bosses which get recycled throughout the game. Upon writing this review I have put in just under 6 hours of gametime and I have only played single-player. I would recommend this game, but don't expect anything lifechanging. I'd give this game a little higher score if it had USB controller and local multiplayer support.Score: 7/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												A fun little side-scrolling shooter with sufficient mechanics and its own personality. You use WASD to move, mouse to aim, space to jump. You know the drill.The goods:The mechanics feel pretty good for the most part.Lots of ways to customize your character & play style through gear acquisition.The graphics are sufficient for the game's price point and age.The music and sound define the game's attitude very well and contribute to overall immersion.The bads:The enemy variety is a tad lacking and becomes a bit repetitious.The game's formula doesn't really change up to much. It's either walk to the right and shoot everything with one of your two guns or jump around this little area and shoot everything with one of your two guns.There's no longer a player base. This may not be an issue if you already have a group of RL friends who'll be accompanying you.The humor/character/personality of this game is a bit sophomoric. It feels like it's targeted at pre-teen children. ""Look, I'm drinking beer to regain health! How edgy and/or hilarious!""The game is a grind. You have to defeat stages to acquire nuts to spend on gear. You have to gain levels to unlock the ability to buy the gear. Additionally, you will be replaying stages multiple times that are likely to grow stale by the end of the first time you play through them.Overall, I do like the concept of this game and its core gameplay. However, the overall level design and variations on gameplay are really nowhere to be found, and it severely punishes the game's longevity. I think playing with friends would help in that regard, but is there any game that doesn't hold true for? I give it a 65/100. I'm really close to recommending this game; I don't think it'd take much more content to make it loads of fun given it has such a strong gameplay foundation. But as is, I don't think I'd play it again outside of the <6 hours I already spent on it.			",699,177,15,46,76,10,65

												This game is absolutely absurd; but it does absurd very, very well.This game is a sidescroller in which you take control of a beer chugging (for health, no less) scrapyard owner that goes on a revenge fueled rampage to kill robots with a wide assortment of gear (to include a baby carrier, with baby).If you like excessive explosions, kung-fu kicking, beer, and/or robots, then this game is perfect for you.  It's mindless, it's absurd, and it's pointless.  Just don't go into it expecting any surprise twists, depth, or storyline; because with a title like ""Shoot Many Robots"" you have to properly align your expectations.			",95,12,5,25,20,2,21

												The Good is that it's hilarious, frantic, and fun. The bad is some of the frustrating design flaws, such as being dependent on hitting back enemy bullets when the screen is covered in enemies, obstructing your view of the tiny red bullet which does the absolute most damage out of any enemy attack in the game while also making the player depend also on random chance to get weapon drops to even survive in later levels. The odds are you get a useless currency bonus and rarely a useful weapon.Fun, but incredibly flawed and frustrating.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												The great thing about this game is that its alot of fun, the downfall of this game is that its not very active online. This game is a party when playing with friends or other people online. The sad thing is that it doesn't have dedicated servers so if the host is not close to you or has a bad connection it can really lag the game. The rank up system is really fast. The customizing of character and weapon loadout can be interesting. I ounce had a fish that was impaling me and somehow that gave me more damage when shooting my weapons. The combinations people come up with can be fun. The things I wish for this game is that the online was more active and that some of the achievements didn't require you to be playing online with others. But setting all those things aside this is a great game and can be alot of fun. If you like side shooters and have friends to play with then I would recommend this game to you, but if not then this can be another side shooter that has a disappointing online.

												It's fun. I haven't had this much fun in a side scroller since Contra or Metal Slug. It doesn't exactly revamp the genre, but it does have a fun redneck style atmosphere. The game got a few chuckles with some of the missions and item descriptions. Not much else to say. The character customization is decent, the levels are fun but can get a little old, there is a lack of a lobby which is very very annoying and probably the biggest flaw with the game. It gets to be a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ with all the enemeis shooting you at once so it can be a little hard to see, but maybe that's just me. Anyways, it's a welcome new edition to side scrollers, and if you like the genre you'll probably like this. 7.5/10.			",508,104,12,60,23,7,29

												3/5. Waste of my money. 1. Poor optimization. My computer can handle games that are harder to run than this yet I get staggeringly low fps on this. There are no low settings at all. When you do get to put the game on low, you still wonder what the hell is going on. Maybe someone is using your computer to mine bitcoins. 2. No kind of content. The game is revolved around 5 different weapons and the same maps over and over again.3. No replay value. Conclusion: This is a complete waste of 10 dollars. Looks like the devs were looking for a quick buck. It's  quite a shame, really. This game had so much potential.			",64,1,0,5,2,1,2

Play it on a console if you really want to enjoy the game.Mechanically, this game appears sound, but the lack of native gamepad support is a big negative.			",245,31,5,11,4,1,5

												Imagine going down to your local arcade and playing the hell out of your favorite fighter cabinet.  You know the one, the one with the sick♥♥♥♥♥joystick/button setup that we all wanted in our homes but could never get as kids because we were idiots and didn't realize how easy ripping people off and selling drugs was to get money to buy one.  Could have been Mortal Kombat, could have been Killer Instinct, could have been a Street Fighter variation, but you know which god damn cabinet I'm talking about, and you distinctly remember thinking how awesome those four/six/eight buttons were, the ones that made our at-home controllers seem like trainer controllers, and reminded us that there was some big, bad mother♥♥♥♥ around the corner that had that button layout down pat, and knew all of their characters special moves and combos, and knew exactly how to defend against whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you brought to the table with two punk♥♥♥♥♥quarters.Now imagine ripping off your first chump.  We'll say it's your 9th grade English teacher, Mrs. Mullins.  She was always a ♥♥♥♥♥ anyways.  Well, you sold her some dog turd grass mixed with oregano for $20, and know you've got a pocket full of quarters weighing your pants down so hard that you strut a ♥♥♥♥in Sante Fe lean all the way to the arcade, excited beyond belief at the infinite tries you have to learn all the combos, special moves, fatalities, and become one of the cabinet ghost stories, a legend of the arcade.So you walk up to your favorite cabinet, and instead of that incredible joystick/37 button setup, it's one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balls sunk into the countertop for those stupid bowling or golf games that you find in bars and gas stations, and the game expects you to continue as normal with just some half sphere, blandly and blankly gazing into your soul.  This game is exactly like that.  Don't buy it.			",74,24,0,9,2,0,6

												Cheap ugly sub-par 2D run'n'gun shooter that tries really hard to be 2D borderlads. The best part of it was local coop. It was unbalanced dull mess of a game that was saved by it's loot system (crappy but working) and multiplayer for drunk parties.But. This is PC. And devs are complete idiots (that's why Demiurge studios are outsource company that does others laundry, SMR is the only fully-their game). They've cut both local coop and gamepad support because 'it's better that way' (I'm not kidding, that's official statement). Guess what's left: cheap ugly sub-par 2D run'n'gun shooter no one plays and nor should you.Play console version instead if you really want. Because why play crippled and cut version?

												Take a wild guess what you do in this game...Double jump only works half the time which is a massive problem on some fights. The last factory boss on hard mode took me six aggravating tries because double jump only worked some of the time and I kept dying in the fire since double jump is how you get to the platforms. I want to say ♥♥♥♥ this game and not even review it because of that. It is a horrible, unacceptable problem.A pretty fun game for one playthrough on normal and one on hard, however it is not good enough to bother with insane mode. Besides, the only reason hard was harder than normal was because they make you take massive dmg with each hit and make the enemies take more dmg. It requires no extra skill on the players part, just more jumping and more firing and better gear that gives more +dmg bonus. Both normal and hard modes were pretty easy besides the problems I am about to spit like a rapper spitting some dope♥♥♥♥♥rhymes.At the end of normal, the last boss fight almost ruined it for me, and sorta actually does because you don't fight the boss. You just run from him then it's the end of the game. The last boss was horrible: I ran right and got to a box pyramid which it gives you about 3 seconds to ascend it or the boss charges and 1-shots you. After about ten tries I got it but then it still gets worse. You have to ascend more jumping platforming while he is chasing you up and one milimeter of a misstep means death. After about 20 highly aggravating unfun tries I beat it. But it sucked so badly because during the regular game, not including the survival stages, I died only once. It does not surprise me though because I do not think I have ever seen a single indie game in my life get a final boss fight right.The games biggest flaw, besides mind jarringly generic guitar rock music that made me want to rip my ears off and run them over with a monster truck, is that it is probably the biggest cop-out offender of a game I have ever seen. It recycles levels and bosses over and over again and one boss fight even copped out so badly it just made the boss explode when I got to him then the level ended in victory. The last boss fight is easily a contender for the biggest cop-out in video game history. After about 4-5 hours of gameplay and killing what seems like tens of thousands of robots, the boss chases you and you run to the right and up then the boss dies and you beat the game. That's what they give you for a last boss lol.There are three difficulty levels: normal, hard, and insane. I have beaten normal and hard and since hard was the exact same levels as normal, I am going to pass on seeing them again. However although it has been uninstalled and I will never play it again, it was well worth the cheap sale price I paid for the amount of fun I had with it overall. Not including double jump being broken sometimes.Other than all of this ignorance, I had a lot of fun up until the last boss fight. If that part didn't suck so horribly and the game didn't cop-out a lot and recycle everything, and double jump didn't work only half the time, I would give this a 8/10. As it is, 6/10, mainly because of double jump not working right and being such a massive problem.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												5/10The game itself is quite okay, feels a bit like Left 4 Dead and Metal Slug.But it only has like 5 different maps and you get to play through each one of them for at least 15 times. Even the ""special enemy waves"" show up at the same spots.So yeah, it's repetitive as hell.Especially when you want to find all items which are scattered around in special boxes that are dropped by enemies or hidden inside steel boxes.But that's not enough, once you've found an item (weapon or head-, torso- or leg-gear) you also have to buy it with nuts (the game's currency) AND you need to have a certain character level.This game may be fun in multiplayer for 2 or 3 times, but it's really unrewarding and way too dull. If you're really bored and don't mind playing through the same levels again and again, just to get a different text at the end of the campaigns (normal, hard, insane), then give it a shot.But play it with a friend or it will feel like staring at a wall for 5 hours.

												Shoot Many Robots is a side scrolling platform shooter. It succeeds in throwing thousands of robots at you in many levels that are varied with stubborn personalities. You can shoot (oh, really?), punch and slam your enemies. Its mindless fun with a host of items you pick up along the way. Customise your gun, secondary gun, helmet, body armour and pants . . . yes, even your pants! There's heaps of really cool unlocks and each have different stats, theme which alter the gameplay. There's four-player cop-op which is complete chaos and amazingly fun! Just watch out for the lag if your friend has a slow connection. It's a good game, but what stops Shoot Many Robots being a AAA title is the lack of enemy types and stale survival and boss levels which are quite average and repetitive. Don't let this stop you, with 3 difficulty levels, it's addictively fun with friends, don't pass this up when it's on sale!			",727,301,38,83,55,7,149

												This a fantastic game to play with your friends. Hundreds of items offer different playstyles allowing for multiple playthroughs. The game has a rather dull, but funny storyline and instead puts emphasis on the core shooting mechanics similar to that of a typical shoot 'em up and this is what makes the game good; the mechanics. With all that said it is imortant to know that this is a boring singleplayer game and should only be played co-operatively with your friends for many great laughs.tl;dr: Tons of fun to play with friends, boring without friends.

Humor reinforces the gameplay, and the wide variety of guns and upgrades creates new playstyles as you progress and unlock increasingly powerful gear. I've gotten 50+ hours out of this game from one playthrough and it's always fun to jump back into every now and then. The multiplayer system is a little sub-par, I will admit, as the servers are slow and unattended. However, this game made for many hours of enjoyable, mindless shooty fun in singleplayer.

Throughout the game you will have to make choices that will effect who you are and how others think of you.The most thrilling choice i found was when the game asked me ""What would you do if you found a magical robot called snail that could grant you 1 wish that couldnt even have what have the been ever?""The obvious answer to me was to grab the book nearest to me.

												SMR is a 2.5D scrolling shooting game that's very reminiscent of the classic Metal Slug games of old. Except now you can go in co-op mode with three other players too.The range of weapons and equipment available for your character is not only extensive, but very funny to choose from. I can safely say that in 32-years of gaming, I've NEVER equipped a main character with a battleship cannon while wearing an astronaut's helmet and a tutu at the same time!Graphically, it's very pleasing on the eye and the attached video doesn't really do the game the justice it deserves. For its price, buy it - just for the mindless fun the game provides. Definitely 8.5/10 for me.			",325,46,21,42,39,2,85

I do liek the wide array of customization available but find it annoying when I unlock guns or appearal that a 5 levels ahead of me and when I am at a higher level unlocking gear that is 5 level below me. The maps are great to start with but reapeat after a mid point in game the only change is the enemies are more difficult. Over all I do enjoy this game and will continue to play it. I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fast paces shooter games but dont have hours to dedicate to a game.

												Shoot Many Robots is a co-op platform shooter with looting mechanics and plays very much like Contra or the Metal Slug series.In addition, you will be able to customize your character with many pieces of clothing or weapons that can improve your shooting damage, make you jump higher etc. The loot drops are randomized and as such, it encourages you to replay the levels to try to obtain more rare loots.The graphics aren't mind blowing, but they do the job well. Music is a mix of western country style rock. Control is smooth although the jumping style might take some time to be accustomed with.The main problem encountered was the constant network disconnections. Sometimes, it works smoothly, at other times i get disconnected more then 10 times in a co-op game which can be very frustrating. If this game was more stable, i'd have given it a higher score.Overall Rating: 6.0 / 10If you can stand the frequent and erratic network disconnections, this is a decent co-op platform shooter.

												I played this game solo, which was a lot of fun, but I can def tell that it is meant to be a multiplayer game.  The name doesn't lie.  You run through levels shooting a lot of robots.  It doesn't support a controller, and the keyboard controls are a little awkward, but it doesn't ruin the experience - just gives you a learning curve.  Your character levels up and you get to use dead robot parts you collect to buy new weapons.  The weapons were very clever and fun to wield.  The game has a great sense of humor, and the visuals are great.  The levels get reused, as do the bosses, but again, it doesn't ruin the experience.  Overall, a very fun game to pick up on sale.

												John McFlag's homeland of Southern USA is under attack. Legions of machines loyal to the USSR have destroyed his home, his dog, and his car. John has only one option left start up his FV (Freedom Vehicle) and strike back. He is armed his trusty America Rifle, loaded with HF (High Freedom) rounds that will punch through Marx's minions like they're made of nothing more then their precious manifesto. However, if enemies prove to great for even this implement of Liberty, McFlag has another option open. A missle launcher where each warhead has a specially blended mix of Baseballs, Apple Pie, Eagles, and Fireworks to create a charge of freedom so powerful, not even the Man of Steel could stand it.But John has to act quick! Already the robo-workers are dismantling the great American industry to equally distribute it amongst their slave states. For the good of the free market, you must combat Lenin's Legion to restore freedom to the south!			",396,34,3,44,21,0,60

												They took the ideas straight out of SNK's Metal Slug series but it worked pretty well since the bosses and general flow of the game sets it apart in that its not as hard. The levelling system and hunt for new weapons should extend the games lifespan and the co-op action is really fun with friends, its a great game that puts what the big companies like EA are churning out  to shame so get it now!!

												I really enjoy playing this game with friends. It is still enjoyable single player but less enjoyable. I do liek the wide array of customization available but find it annoying when I unlock guns or appearal that a 5 levels ahead of me and when I am at a higher level unlocking gear that is 5 level below me. The maps are great to start with but reapeat after a mid point in game the only change is the enemies are more difficult. Over all I do enjoy this game and will continue to play it. I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fast paces shooter games but dont have hours to dedicate to a game. This game can be played for 10 minutes a day and the player can still achieve something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I had to sum this up in 5 words I would say, ""Metal Slug with rpg elements"".  Luckily I can have more than five words.  If you're unfamiliar, Metal Slug and Shoot Many Robots are surprisingly fun side scrolling shooters.  But in SMR, there's lots of different weapons and armors you can earn from killing robots, you unlock them as you level up and best of all, you progress at steady enough pace that it doesn't start to feel like a grind until you get close to the maximum level, ie level 50.  But there's one big problem; the multiplayer.  The difficulty doesn't scale properly when there's enough people, so ironically single player is easier.  Not only that but the match making system is very poorly designed.  You don't get to choose what game to join and you can only join the fun in between levels, so if the best game you can join has 1 afk person in a level then you don't get to play multiplayer.  But that aside it's good and if you can find it for a few dollar then I say pick it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are hundreds of weapons (guns), secondary weapons (rocket launchers, granade launchers, etc), head pieces, chest pieces, and leg pieces to collect and customize your character.

												I've changed my review a bit for this game, because I have a problem recommending this.I like this game; I really do. But there are two versions of this game - the console version (which as far as I know was released for Xbox 360), and the PC version. The core difference is how they market them.To be clear, I do recommend this game - but specifically the console version; not the PC version.Console's big pull for sales is multiplayer games, especially party games, and how the console version was marketed included local co-op and a pay store for additional weapons. For the PC version, they changed it so that every weapon is now fully unlockable by playing the game (no pay store), but removed two things that work better on console vs PC: the local co-op and the controller support. Instead, they optimized the game for mouse and keyboard.I personally felt more comfortable with the controller, and I'm a little irked that they removed controller support completely. I understand that controllers aren't a dominant accessory for PC gamers, but generally PC games that can be made controller compatiable have either partial or full controller support, either due to the fact that they'll be ported to console now or in the future, or for additional accessibility. To remove it entirely doesn't seem like a smart direction.As a game itself, it has a lot of content. I think of it like if Castle Crashers had less of a story, but more items. The cover art and the title basically cover the story and the journey: redneck doomsday survivors battle out bad robots and to survive, they need to shoot many robots.Almost everything on your character is changeable, allowing you to upgrade almost everything, or change it out for a different play style that better fits your style, or fits the level.You can play the game single-player, but it works better as Co-op. At the time that I originally wrote this review, I wasn't able to find any other players. To get the most out of the PC version, you'll need a friend to buy a copy as well.I highly recommend this game, but as a console experience. If the developers decide to re-implement controller support and/or local co-op, I'd be glad to recommend the PC version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Got to the final boss a couple of times, and then one of our players steam connection dropped, and they couldn't rejoin the level.  Causing us to replay boss levels over and over until everyone managed to kill the boss at least once.

												A lot of people compare this game to Metal Slug. But Metal Slug is fun? I guess co-op is all right if you're with friends and if you enjoy playing the same three levels over and over again. So, if you have friends with OCD and are boring you should get this game for them.			",82,33,0,13,7,1,11

												Not quite the worst $2.49 I've ever spent. Good sound, decent NES-era action, light on the dumb humor. Handcrafted silly inventory a la Deathspank, give or take. Irritating bonus waves, crummy matchmaking, silly music. Recommended mainly because I wish someone would play it with me.			",647,198,12,132,87,3,123

												I've changed my review a bit for this game, because I have a problem recommending this.I like this game; I really do. But there are two versions of this game - the console version (which as far as I know was released for Xbox 360), and the PC version. The core difference is how they market them.To be clear, I do recommend this game - but specifically the console version; not the PC version.Console's big pull for sales is multiplayer games, especially party games, and how the console version was marketed included local co-op and a pay store for additional weapons. For the PC version, they changed it so that every weapon is now fully unlockable by playing the game (no pay store), but removed two things that work better on console vs PC: the local co-op and the controller support. Instead, they optimized the game for mouse and keyboard.I personally felt more comfortable with the controller, and I'm a little irked that they removed controller support completely. I understand that controllers aren't a dominant accessory for PC gamers, but generally PC games that can be made controller compatiable have either partial or full controller support, either due to the fact that they'll be ported to console now or in the future, or for additional accessibility. To remove it entirely doesn't seem like a smart direction.As a game itself, it has a lot of content. I think of it like if Castle Crashers had less of a story, but more items. The cover art and the title basically cover the story and the journey: redneck doomsday survivors battle out bad robots and to survive, they need to shoot many robots.Almost everything on your character is changeable, allowing you to upgrade almost everything, or change it out for a different play style that better fits your style, or fits the level.You can play the game single-player, but it works better as Co-op. At the time that I originally wrote this review, I wasn't able to find any other players. To get the most out of the PC version, you'll need a friend to buy a copy as well.I highly recommend this game, but as a console experience. If the developers decide to re-implement controller support and/or local co-op, I'd be glad to recommend the PC version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really cool 2D shooter where you fight through hordes of robots to get as many nuts, and a high a score, as possible. What makes this really fun is the upgrades you can buy between levels with the nuts you've collected. There is a LOT of choice when it comes to your equipment, and each item is accompanied by a comical description. This is also great fun multiplayer, provided a friend (like me!) also owns the game.

												Excellent game! I played this on the Xbox 360 when it went free with the Xbox Live Gold deal, and really enjoyed it for a long time, then, I forgot all about it and went back to BF3, CoD, Titanfall... But then when my friend came over, we playe tons of FIFA 15, Ghosts, all that stuff, but after some time, we got bored. We looked in My Games, and saw Shoot Many Robots (he had played it a ton before too). So we played it for hours. I got so into it, that i checked if there was a PC version on Steam, and YES! there was! Hooray for me!This is a great game, very entertaining, not hard to play, nor to master (just purchase the right stuff), and it's just so packed full of action and shooting many robots that it's just a wonderful game for the person that doesn't have too much money nor games, but wants a new videogame to keep him/her entertained!Watch out though, it's really addicting!Have a nice day and I hope this review wasn't too long, I hope I've helped you out on your decision of purchasing (DO IT!)

												3D version of Metal Slug, but much easier because this game have lifebar and some RPG elements.All you do in this game is just shoot the junks, get the nuts, buy higher leveled guns,and shoot over and over again.Pretty good 2.5$ game but not for full price.			",298,94,8,59,11,1,24

												This game should be called Punch Many Rockets: Jesus christ edition. This game is suprisingly awesome, fun and hard yet its one of those games you can just jump into and get addicted to. I hope these guys make more games like this. 10/10P.S. REAL AMERICAN HERO			",364,57,1,52,21,4,41

												Pros:Classic side-scroller arcade style play.Tons of weapons and upgrades to find, most of which change player stats and abilities.Comes in a 4 pack to share with 3 friends.Scales very well to player number.Runs great on older hardware, even my old XP media center PC!Mouse/keyboard support is excellent.High probability of laughing so hard you can't see.Cons:I wouldn't call it kid-friendly. (Some adult references and the use of alcohol as medkits.)10/10 would absolutely end robot uprising wearing enormous sombrero, pink backpack and tube socks again!			",88,1,0,2,2,2,6

												I played this game with Nick at PAX East 2011 because we saw that sign hovering above us telling us that our desires had been answered. Finally, a training simulator for the coming robot uprising. I, for one, do not welcome our new robot masters. I may pretend to be on their side for now, but once they start trying to shoot/slice me, I will ♥♥♥♥ their♥♥♥♥♥♥up like no tomorrow. I'd prefer to have a less violent relationship with our hard-working metal friends, like Geordi and Data on Star Trek The Next Generation. How many times did Data try to replace Geordi's brain with tiny robots? At least once. But the point is in spite of Data's uppity♥♥♥♥♥♥ Geordi forgave him and they remained best friends. In space. ♥♥♥♥ man, Geordi is like a ♥♥♥♥ing saint. Data tried to kill him, and Geordi forgave him. Data won a game of poker, and Geordi didn't even once try to shoot that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a machine gun while wearing a tutu and fairy wings.			",100,47,1,14,19,2,19

												SMR is as straightforward, simple, stupid fun as the title implies.  This is a no holds barred ARCADE game through and through and will bring back fond memories of old school experiences like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Metal Slug, and Contra.  You run, you shoot, and then you shoot some more.  Along the way you collect ""money"" to buy new upgrades which are as ridiculous as they are effective and part of the fun is in customizing your character to perform best to differing play styles.  It *DOES* get repetitive however and it's probably best to play only in 20 minute intervals so that you don't get too worn from the sameness of what you're doing, but if you're lucky then you'll have one or more friends playing along which should liven things up considerably!  If you do end up playing this PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO THAT I CAN JOIN THE FUN!FUN, that's really what this game boils down to.  It's not deep, it's not cutting edge, it's just laser locked on being a terrific shoot 'em up.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

												It's like a long horde mode with a RPG like buying system. Later parts get kind of grindy, I still like it because its one of those time spent = great power games. Have not tried multi-player yet.			",335,37,6,48,72,3,69

												A lot of people compare this game to Metal Slug. But Metal Slug is fun? I guess co-op is all right if you're with friends and if you enjoy playing the same three levels over and over again. So, if you have friends with OCD and are boring you should get this game for them.			",82,33,0,13,7,1,11

												Not quite the worst $2.49 I've ever spent. Good sound, decent NES-era action, light on the dumb humor. Handcrafted silly inventory a la Deathspank, give or take. Irritating bonus waves, crummy matchmaking, silly music. Recommended mainly because I wish someone would play it with me.			",647,198,12,132,87,3,123
