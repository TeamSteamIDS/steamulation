												----- PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING THIS! -----This game is no longer functioning and should not be bought. A few years ago I would've recommended this game to everybody, but due to the Steampipe update back in 2013 this game was entirely ruined. Before I go on, let me define the word ""ruined"" as it's used in this context. By ""ruined"" I mean that this game is so properly glitched that you cannot even change your player model anymore! Yeah, that should give you an idea of how much Valve cares for their games. I blame Valve for this, but mostly an incompetent and lazy person whose name starts with an A and ends with a D, that was supposed to fix this using the input from the community on GitHub. So yeah, rather buy the normal HL because not only do you get the singleplayer portion of the game with the multiplayer, the online play is still functioning like it should and there is at least a player base. Oh, and if you are planning to buy Half-Life Source which is the other half of this, then don't. It might not be equally broken, but broken enough to make you mad.Or just get Black Mesa, then you will at least get something that is prettier on the eyes and functioning like it should.

												It's basically Half-Life, but in Free-for-all form. All the weapons from Half-Life are in here.This game is DEAD though. So if you can host a private server and get a couple of your friends to play, then this game is awesome!Great for fans of the original Half-Life. Not so good for people who just wanna play. There are much more people playing the original Half-Life Deathmatch and not the Source ""remake"" version. Just don't expect to find anyone playing on a Public server.			",153,11,6,6,3,2,0

Playing this felt so good and refreshing with no one raging or hacking and there isn't even voice chat to bear risk of driving everyone mad.The 15 or so people that play this game come and go, being happy and silent as the familiar scramble to the nearest weapon becomes a new chalenge of getting those guns off the person who has the most.Classic Deathmatch the way it should be, to be played casually or religiously, 10/10			",82,6,0,11,3,1,5

-Quick Review-Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is an exclusively multiplayer FPS developed by Valve, and released 2006 (God I feel old)Basically Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is where you use all the weapons from the first Half-Life game, and you play against other people. Unlike another game I played over the weekend (09/03/16) there were actually people on this game. But there's not very many people playing this game.


It's no fun setting up a death room with no one to play with - Uploaded for Review

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The story is Gordan Freeman has gone batsh*t crazy and fighting against himself. Apparently once upon a time you could change skins, and there was a community for this game. But just like walking through a ghost town, all you see are the houses where people used to live. There are still PLENTY of servers to join, but no one to play with. It's always kinda sad to see this happen to a game.Gameplay: As far as I can tell, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source uses the same weapons as Half-Life. Just like Half-Life 2: Deathmatch uses pretty much the same weapons and features of Half-Life 2. The only difference is that as of now there are still people playing Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.For those that like handholding and my sarcastic descriptions, here are the weapons you get: The almighty Crowbar, whom I informed everyone that I was a master of crowbar-fu. A pistol, which I had the accuracy of a stormtrooper... was it lag? or am I bad? The world will never know. You've got your revolver, which Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door (yeah, I stretched for that one.), your various assortment of SMG, shotguns, railguns, crossbow, laser tracking rocket of death, grenades, trip mines, alien gun, mining laser, and death-by-blue-vortex.


Mwahaha! Death by blue laser! - Uploaded for Review

Conclusion: I feel like it's weird to see Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is priced at $9.99, while Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is priced at $4.99... I guess it's that extra 5 dollars for the retro-status. *sigh*This game is probably a pass, I could go either way on the recommendation status of this review. Based on what I played the game does what it's supposed too, there were a few people to play against, it wasn't a bad FPS death match game ... back in it's day it was quite the popular game, chances are you'll pick up this game in a half-life bundle, and truthfully you'll have more fun just playing Half-Life offline.But, that's my thoughts on it, thank you for taking the time to read this review!

 Half-Life Deathmatch: Source This deathmatch game is really great, lots of maps and weapons that make my nostalgia go crazy!but the game is dead... I have played some hours with some awesome people, we hit a total of 10 people on one server for two hours!The game is a little broken, in lots of maps some of us couldn't pick up ammo and there is some people that learned how to use the broken part of the game for there advantage (some wild jump kills and stuff)Unfortunately, I only give 5/10.. mostly because the game is dead, but I still recommend this game because its a great game! 5/10  ",150,52,5,18,34,5,26

												This game is fun to play, however if you are going to buy this game, expect people to bunny hop around and shoot mp5 grenades a lot. The servers are sometimes empty, but there's usually a server active with about 5 people populating it. One other thing is that I, personally, experienced high ping and lag, but that was probably because I don't live in the vicinity in which the servers are based.			",39,0,0,1,5,0,0

												I can't really recommend this game due to it's dying community that's just *barely* hanging on to whatever is left of itself. I thought it was bad in 2009, but now...It's just sad. Which is actually depressing to me since this game actually had a lot of history with my childhood. And to add insult to injury, the last updates Valve had slapped together to make the game ""better"", basically turned this game in a steaming pile of crap: I can't even change my player model anymore. I still have fun with the game every once in awhile, but it's just not worth the money now.In short. Save your money and get something better.			",62,4,0,7,8,0,5

												This is Half-Life Deathmatch it defines the words [Gold Source Classic] but NOW it has souce technology. This game is very dated but that does not mean it is good. The only main problem I have for this game is that it is dead and there are usually only 1 server and it lags like hell so I do but I don't recomend it so I give this game a 5/10 score. The reason why is that this game is also full of many things such as you can't change player models. (just use the cl_playermodel command) but I do have to say this just to warn you if you ever want to play this THIS GAME IS LITTERED WITH BUGS. Elavators don't work as well as they used to and most of the guns are buggy like all hell but I would have to go mutual with this on a 5/10 score so Yes I do recomend it JUST USE CAUTION.

PROS:+ fun gameplay+ lots of modsCONS:- not that many active playersComment:Same case as with Team Fortress Classic, I've missed the golden days of this game when there were many players. Nowadays the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I took a look at it. It's a classic Quake-type shooter so there isn't much to criticize. Gameplay is fun but lack of people to actually play with pulls down the experience.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

And that server is broken, and kicks you every 7 minutes for ""being AFK"". The server is also based in EU, so don't expect a ping lower then 150.This game needs to be revived, I miss my favorite game.In it's current state, it's unplayable. Literally.			",57,3,0,3,2,0,0

If there was more people that still played the game,I would love to recommend this! Though I would recommend everyone to not buy this,mainly because it seems as if this game is completely dead for sure. Though if you can,I guess you could play with your friends and still have fun with the game,other than that,this game is dead.			",507,89,24,64,62,6,68

												While this game is the what we all remember it over a decade ago, I am disappointed to say that I cannot recommend this game to anyone but a digital-collector. This game is an exact port/remake of the original Deathmatch. This version does not have as many people playing, (probably because the only way to get this game is to get the Valve Complete Pack), does not have extensive custom map support, and you can't change even change your player model!!!

												Hello Fellow Physicists,Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a great game! I love it and it is a much better version of the original Deathmatch Classic. Although it is an improvement on the original, it still lacks a community, now. It can be awfully difficult to find a server that has anyone on it, but once you do, it is worth every penny! I strongly recommend it over the original version as it corrects some minor bugs and is on a new engine!-Kyle James			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very nice game. Remakes the classic FPS into a fast-paced deathmatch with players on the Internet.One problem though: The SMG grenades are too unbalanced. Instead of using each gun's advantages and disadvantages, players would just spam SMG grenades at opponets (they explode on impact) until the other dies.Overral, this is a nice game, especially when ported to Source.7/10			",31,3,1,2,5,0,0

												After the release of Half-Life 2 and then the Orange Box, Valve had already remade and ported Counter-Strike, Half-Life, and Day of Defeat to the Source engine, and also made the unreleased ""Team Fortress: Source"". These remakes varied in quality, with Counter-Strike getting a full overhaul and Half-Life getting a simple port with barely any changes. It was around this time that Half-Life Deathmatch: Source was released. Like Half-Life: Source, it was a simple port from the GoldSrc engine that introduced very little changes.In 2013, Valve introduced Steampipe, which would simpify downloading their games and not have them take up as much space. However, the update caused numerous bugs and glitches across all of their games, notably Half-Life: Source and -you guessed it- Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. As of writing, Valve has barely fixed any of these glitches.Now, where do I begin?Again, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source suffers from countless bugs and game breaking mechanics. Like Half-LIfe: Source, it shoves so many special effects into assets and maps created in 1998	. The chrome effect that you could see on the revolver in the original Half-Life is slapped onto every weapon and every silver texture in the game. The lighting is okay by itself, but it's ruined by the overpowered bloom. I've seen better bloom in the Cinematic Mod for Half-Life 2! And there is so much more visualwise.The hitboxes feel weird, and it seems that Valve fixed only the player hitbox so the game is somewhat fair. The MP5 grenade is a one hit kill and you'll bet that me and other players spam these like crazy. Just everything feels like it was stuck into the game, no adjustments, no tweaking,  left the way it is. Here is the final nail in the coffin for me: sometimes textures don't even show up on the map, and you'll be standing on an invisible floor.	This isn't Valve quality. This is the quality of a fan that just got into Source modding, and released this under Early Access as Pre-Alpha. But this game isn't the scams you'll find sitting under the Greenlight, this is a game released by Valve onto their own platform. And that's pretty disgraceful.However, at it's core, it's still Half-Life Deathmatch, and it can be fun. So if you own the Orange Box and you're looking for something new, give this a try.Otherwise, do not buy this game.			",50,1,0,1,1,0,0

												Half Life Deathmatch Source is a multiplayer game based on Half Life Source where you fight to win in maps based around the first game. As stated before it's based around the first game, so you will see certain environments and use guns from the first game.Now is this game good ? Not really, it's actually kind of bad. The gameplay of the first Half Life in general was very stiff and in general kind of clunky and while it was sort of tweaked for Counter Strike and Team Fortress, I felt that this was generally untouched. The hit detection for most of the guns is absolutely terrible. A point blank headshot from the shotgun will do little to no damage.The community is also dying as there's not many players online, even more so than other classic multiplayer games made by Valve. Graphically the game looks pretty bad, but for a game for it's age I'll give it a pass.Overall there's not much to say about this game, other that it's not worth your time or your money. It's bland and the community is dying rapidly, so just save your money and buy something else.Pros:+ Fun for a few games...Cons:- ... but loses the fun factor really fast- Hit Detection is horrible- Community is deadFinal Rating:4/10			",904,350,32,94,59,7,85

Valve should have built this into Half-Life: Source like they did with the origional Half-Life, rather than having at as a seperate item which costs money.It's dead. Really dead. REALLY dead.The best you could get out of this game is the maps it provides for Garry's Mod and that's literally it.			",22,1,0,0,1,0,0

Half-Life:  Deathmatch Source Reviewby KTMboyz""...hmm...It's pretty fun.""To start things off, I have never played Deathmatch Classic, so this is a review for what I think of this game and not as a source port.  Half-Life:  Deathmatch Source is self-explanatory.  It's Half-Life - and its deathmatch - and its on source...  lol.  There is a reason I don't recommend it and thats's because, just like all the other Half-Life multiplayer games; they're dead.  Nobody plays them anymore!  Half-Life 2:  Deathmatch has a few more players but not much.  It's a shame, this game is fun as hell!  It's got fast-paced gameplay and intersting source maps that are Half-Life 2-ish.  Don't pick it up on your own, barely anybody plays it...  If you get it in a bundle or something, then play it, it's a blast!9.2/10 ",30,2,0,4,0,0,0

												It's the multiplayer for Half-Life: Source, which I haven't played but I know is just Half-Life again, but with better water and lighting, ragdoll physics, and a whole host of bugs. Since almost nobody plays this version any more, and Half-Life's multiplayer was never really that great in the first place, I see no reason to buy this. However, I got it free when I bought some other Half-Life game (I forget which), so if you came upon it the same way, sure, give it a whirl. It won't cost you anything.			",145,5,0,7,6,2,3

												Ok I'm going to start by saying that this game isn't ""bad"". It just has some problems.Pros:MultiplayerNot dead. -The game isn't dead! There are still servers with people!Cons:Chaotic -Ok. This game is very chaotic for me(even when there is only 2 or 3 players)Too many weapons -Not much of a problem, but a little too muchBuggyNot as good as TFC or Half-life 2 deathmatchOk now for some ratings.Gameplay: 8/10       -Would be better without chaos and the bugsMusic/Sounds: 7/10 -No music that I know of. The sounds are ok though.Community: 9/10 -The community is fine and ISNT DYINGThe overall rating is 8/10.    Now that is NOT BAD. It is very good, but the chaos really bothers me(along with bugs). Another reason i do not recommend this is because there are many better TDM or DM games out there such as Counter-strike, Half-life 2 deathmatch, and TFC/TF2. If you want a half life deathmatch game, then get HL2 deathmatch. It is less chaotic, less glitchy, and more fun. I will continue to play this game, but it still bothers me a little.

												It has some nostalgia to it but there is new games you can play. You move fast, everything has a classic feel and look to it but there ain't many players and it does have all the old flaws. One of thoes flaws is, do you know where the bazooka is? You win! Also, aiming is hard as all hell.			",40,7,0,8,1,0,4

												Navigation: Spherical 2D where the viewpoint of the player is fixed to a vertical axis that is limited in it's vertical range of motion by 180° in each horizontal direction that the player is facing (90° up and down). The players motion is perceived as the distance that the world travels from the playe'rs pov relatively to how far the player itself travels in the world. This type of spherical 2D navigation represents the reference standard for any strategic and/or fast-paced first-/third-person shooters.Presentation: Being an engine-port from the 1998's fps-ambassador, the source-version brought a set of graphical and minor gameplay-enhancements, such as improved lighting, better water-textures and ragdol physics.Other than that it's just a heap of dumb fun.

You should really only have this game if it was part of a pack/bundle. There is 0 reason to buy this on it's own. The community is non-existant so good luck finding players.

												Half-Life Deathmatch Source is pretty much what you would expect, the original Half-Life multi-player in the Source engine. It's still as generic and stale as the original and pales in comparison to the myriad of quality mods available for both Source and Half-Life 1.Not really worth a buy or a play. Hard to say anything else about it.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												It was already stupid that they didn't have a server list on the normal Half life source like they did with the original game, so I knew this had to be bad too. First thing I did was look at the server list. I only saw 3 servers. 2 were dedicated. So this game is Dead. And thanks to Steam-Pipe, The game is broken. Chroming system is damaged so Shiney things look weird. And unlike Half-Life:Source, Half-Life:Source Deathmatch has no option for HD-models so you have to deal with the weird Shiney crowbar. It's just not even worth playing.			",53,2,0,5,2,0,0

												Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a remake of multiplayer part of HL1, the basic premise being that they ported same material off original GoldSrc engine to Source engine. It actually was released later after Single-player Campaign and wasn't so much loved either. It contains same graphical changes as in Half-Life Source, most noticeably water and ragdolls. But this time around it emits HD Models bundle from Blue Shift out.And it's dead. Barely has any players.To be short, it wasn't good idea at all. First, servers of original and remake aren't compitable, so it naturally splitted HL1 deathmatch community, in this case most stayed in original. Second, this Source remake as of right now is bugged. Not bugged enough to be unplayable, but just take look at popular map: Crossfire. The turrets there became unusuable, there is strange flying grate texture over lifts, it has double windows for some reason. Not pretty. So, stick to original Half-Life if you want multiplayer.

												Summary: It may be more compatible with Windows 7/8/8.1 than HL1 normally is, but aside from compatibility and better lighting, there's not much to make this game worth your money.First off, nothing has changed from HL1's multiplayer mode.  The maps may be running on Source, but there's still no props or anything-- it's still all just the map geometry.  More than that, you have to deal with the regular HL1 models without the HD pack, unless you feel the need to go through HL1 with Photoshop and do it yourself via modding (which will most likely not work on some servers).Here's the real reason you want to stay away: 1) the GoldSrc HL1 has more players (source is pretty much empty, HL1 has a few players), and 2) this game is an EXTRA price.  That's right.  It's not like ""oh, they just separated it because it's a big file"" as Red Orchestra 2 and the CoD games do it.  No, you have to BUY the singleplayer for HL:Source (a broken mess) for $10, then HL Deathmatch Source is a standalone for you to slap down more money for.  Why not just buy HL1, with Deathmatch mode included?Aside from what's above, what's advertised in HL Source isn't really that great.  The ragdoll physics are present, yes... however, they're bugged.  VERY bugged.  They lock up as soon as you die and you fall sideways in a stupid pose, whether you're posed to run in place on the ground, you're failing at parkour by getting your arm phased into a guardrail, or you're doing a handstand... sideways.  Other than ragdoll physics, the lighting looks better and the skybox is now 3D rather than a few jpg's of a New Mexico backdrop, but other than that this game has no real improvements.Final verdict: It's a waste of money.  Just buy the old HL1, which will include this mode AND the singleplayer for $10 total.  It will also have HD models and the old death-animations rather than the failed ragdolls you see here.  It also has more players and better servers (both vanilla and modservers as opposed to a few vanilla).It's not worth your cash, just add the original Half-Life (not HL Source) to your cart and move along.EDIT: Take a look at these next gen ragdoll physics!

												Everything about Deatmatch Source is pretty much perfect, the only problem is that unlike other games this one lacks the abillity to get past the title screen. Still though, the title screen is really prety. It really has that classic Half-Life mood and almost makes it feel like as if though this were a game you could play. In fact, the title screen is rather inspiring as it gets you to imagine what it must be like to play the game. The font for the text is also really nice.Jokes aside, I'm really glad I bought this when it was on sale because it's in a ♥♥♥♥awful condition. It crashes after -2 seconds and the most active server I could find had five people on, and I was lucky. I suggest you pirate the 1998 game because it actually let's you play and the community still has numerous 5-10 player servers as well as a 32 filled Crossfire one.			",11,0,0,1,1,0,0

												The graphics are without a doubt truly amazing. No its godlike. The game is very well balanced. Searching for a server just takes less than 3 seconds. A must have! for any FPS player. You will be staggered. ''When I was a little boy I've always dreamed of playing a game that you will never get bored of. I thought that Battlefield 1 , Call of Duty Black Ops 3 , CS:GO , Overwatch or Team Fortress 2 were those games. I was wrong''. This game is a masterpiece. It's the feeling of getting laid for the first time. And then having that feeling everytime I play this game. This game truly is remarkable for its awesome gameplay and fast growing community. You'll not regret buying this game. I think you will have so much fun with this game. That the time will pass sooner than you'll think. This game is based on pure skill. It has never been broken. Because of its amazing programmers. Ill give this game a nein/11			",15,0,0,0,1,0,1

												Truly spectacular! I have had tons of fun in this game, and suggest you do the same. With custom content, the limits are endless. You will probably spend a lot of time on source engine maps, not GLDSRC, Which is good, but it kind of takes a bit from the anesthetic. Overall though, jolly good fun.What sucks though is most of the players... Aren't very good, for most half life fans hate the Half Life Source stuff. So I am left killing newbies, 20 frags to 9....

												WARNING: This game is broken! I suggest you wait for the next update (in about 10 or so years).There are a few gameplay-breaking bugs in the game as well as minor annoyances that make you regret buying this game as it is now. I'll list just some of them so you can judge for yourself.Gameplay-breaking:- Double-spawning entities that cause various physical systems to break down and to stop functioning including doors, fans, conveyor belts, etc. This is extremely obnoxious.- Turrets do not work in both crossfire and stalkyard.- Hitboxes are misaligned with the playermodel.- The nuke can be spammed in crossfire, resulting in multiple instant deaths until it stops.- Acid pool trap does not do any damage in Snarkpit.- Bad interpretation of client actions by the server, resulting in delayed crossbow fire, gluon beam redirect, tau laser, etc. (this can be altered somewhat at a large cost of server resources).- Team deathmatch does not function entirely correctly.- Coop is broken (yes there is a coop command).Annoyances:- Extremely bright lights due to HDR rendering and the use of mostly quadratic lighting and huge glow sprites.- Strange looking gloss on weapons.- Weapons feel ""clunky"" compared to the original game.- Changing playermodels in the menu does not work (can be changed via console though).So that's that. If you're still edging towards buying this game, you're not making the biggest mistake of your life since the remaining community is awesome and sometimes hilarious.P.S. The Tau Cannon is glorious!

I'll list just some of them so you can judge for yourself.Gameplay-breaking:- Double-spawning entities that cause various physical systems to break down and to stop functioning including doors, fans, conveyor belts, etc. This is extremely obnoxious.- Turrets do not work in both crossfire and stalkyard.- Hitboxes are misaligned with the playermodel.- The nuke can be spammed in crossfire, resulting in multiple instant deaths until it stops.- Acid pool trap does not do any damage in Snarkpit.- Bad interpretation of client actions by the server, resulting in delayed crossbow fire, gluon beam redirect, tau laser, etc. (this can be altered somewhat at a large cost of server resources).- Team deathmatch does not function entirely correctly.- Coop is broken (yes there is a coop command).Annoyances:- Extremely bright lights due to HDR rendering and the use of mostly quadratic lighting and huge glow sprites.- Strange looking gloss on weapons.- Weapons feel ""clunky"" compared to the original game.- Changing playermodels in the menu does not work (can be changed via console though).So that's that. If you're still edging towards buying this game, you're not making the biggest mistake of your life since the remaining community is awesome and sometimes hilarious.P.S. The Tau Cannon is glorious!

												In all simplicity it is just like the original Half-Life multiplayer just with the source engine instead. It feels almost like quake with the long jump module and it is moderately entertaining.			",12,0,0,2,1,0,0

												Half Life Deathmatch, but in the source engine. So basically, you walk slower, and there's better physics and water effects. Good for G-Mod users, and a pretty good deathmatch game if you havn't played the original Half Life Deathmatch.			",51,12,0,3,3,1,1

												HL Deathmatch is the kind of game that you pick up and play for half an hour.  It gets repetitive any longer after that, but while you're playing you'll have a great time.  Just make sure you play this game with your friends, since there's very few servers online.  It's a ton of fun endlessly long jumping into crazy shotgun trickshots or raging about who got the energy beam weapon, or just running around whacking each other with crowbars.			",66,11,0,3,2,0,3

												A fun, simple deathmatch mode using areas, weapons, and characters from Half Life 1. This is Source so many things look and run better. Weapons are scattered throughout the map and you can carry as many as you like until you die, in which case you'll respawn instantly ready for more. Games are hectic  and weapons run out of ammo fairly quickly which encourages moving around as opposed to camping in one spot.			",211,52,3,18,14,3,25

												This game is one of the most hardcore and competative games out there, CS GO has nothing on this titan of skill and overall bohemith. Words are horrible at describing the magnitude and ambition of this one of a kind competative fps experience.			",27,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Good Stand-alone multiplayer for Half Life 1.  Nice Action and good flow.  All the original maps are there and the models.  Very fast though not very graphical. Apply the HD Pack for HL1 Source and you've got an even better game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cons:- Crashes easily, but doesn't make it unplayable.- Hitreg might seem like it's trash.- VERY low server count.Pros:- Addicting.- Lots of players (I don't really see the same person all too often).- A lot of generic video game skill goes into this.- Rewarding.You get this game from purchasing Half-Life 1 or Half-Life: Source, much like HL2:DM with Half-Life 2.
