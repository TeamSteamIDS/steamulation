												DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME. Seriously, look how many hours I've played: Over a thousand. People make fun of MMO players because they spend so much time working for imaginary goals, but at least they're hanging out with friends and collaborating. I've just been sitting here alone in my underwear in the dark. FOR 1000 HOURS.I used to be like you. I had friends and family, hobbies and interests. I used to cook for myself and clean my apartment once in a while. I used to have house plants for god's sake! I thought becoming king would take a week or two of gaming sessions at most. I WAS WRONG. Please, if there's anything you value in life, don't buy this game.			",209,49,1,29,7,1,12

												Yngol/JacobZupers guide/review of Mount and Blade: WarbandThe game Mount and Blade: Warband is the purest sandbox game that i have ever played, you can litterally do anything you feel like doing in the small land of Calradia. You can be a pirate raiding caravans from the six big factions (Sarranid Sultanate, Kingdom of Vaegir, Kingdom of Swadia, Kingdom of Rhodoks, Kingdom of Nords and Khergit Khanate.) or you can join up with one of the factions or make your own one or just play as a mercenary! Many people that look into the game for the first 5+ hours think that this is a simple game, but it is indeed pretty complicated which i will come to later in these 5 facts about why and how i have played 1400+ hours of this game, enjoy :)1) *SINGLEPLAYER* The singleplayer is awesome, you will spend a minimum of 100+ hours on it, and once you get the hang of it you just wan't to play it 2-3 times again because you haven't even tried a bit of the possibilities, but once you have tried the most it will get kinda booring but the next facts will fix that problem.2) *MODIFICATIONS* There are a BUNCH of modifications for the game and they are so simple to enjoy. So when you are tired of the vanilla game go to this website -->      http://store.steampowered.com and download some of the many multiplayer and singleplayers mods for the game.3) *MULTIPLAYER* If you aren't happy with the singleplayer game, you can always move to the multiplayer. Note that M&B has a very intense fighting system that requires you to play a bunch before you can actually feel like a good player. But once you get the hang of it, it is so much fun just to hack and slash through your enemies.4) *INDEPTH MULTIPLAYER FIGHTING SYSTEM* The fighting system of M&B is very complicated, for some players it is just a slash/block game, but it's really much more than that, there are loads of tricks to defeat the more experienced players. 5) *EVENTS* The Mount and Blade community is still really active and therefore there are events for most of the of the mods. If you wan't an mod simply full of events i would reccomend you buy the ""Napoleonic Wars"" DLC and join up with a regiment and play a couple of linebattles with your regiment on TeamSpeak, there are loads of regiments and some in different languages. There are pure Spanish, German, Danish etc. speaking regiments. This is simply some of the biggest reasons to as why i still play Mount and Blade: Warband this day. I hope you enjoyed my review, and i really hope that this makes you buy this wonderful game and play the living soul out of it.! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a game that defines the whole concept of what a perfectly shaped sandbox/RPG medieval game should be like, mixed with loads of action and epic adventures.Start either as a peasant or a noble man with a fully selective character customization and background history at your own choice, participate in tournaments, travel and discover the vast variety of what Caldaria has to offer you. Warband will be an unforgettable realistic experience that will mark in you the true hardships and living ways of the medieval age.What makes this game so great after all??It isn't just a 1st person game where you can travel around doing quests, Mount and Blade: Warband goes way beyond that by offering players a battle system where you can command your army while simultaneously giving your men orders during the heat of battles.In this game, both your character individual life and his relationships among all other NPC's are equally important to how well you can manage your army expenses and food variety in order to achieve success either alone, or within a faction.A never ending adventure! If you are not looking for trouble, trouble will come to you as time passes by and factions envolve with each other by declaring full-scaled wars against each other conquering castles and other key locations that will drastically change the game economically and militarily.Be either a good samaritan with your army of justice and fight off bandits and free entire villages from rebel control, a evil masterless soldier with a thirst for blood and wealth in the middle of the Caldarian disgrace, or simply a trader travelling around buying cheap and selling expensive, Warband will give you a fair challenge with very balanced rewards and consequences in whatever way of life you decided to take.The game difficulty is well balanced, and instead of making things harder just by simply increasing the units stats that you are facing against, the AI gets a lot more rational and fast even during the campaign map as well with the in-game combat, they will almost act as real human players!Remember that I have mentioning about your character individual role in the game? Get a good relationship with lords by doing quests or freeing close family members from enemy heavily guarded dungeons, and who knows if you can freely marry their daughters unless you convince them with your persuasion skills to run away with you!The medieval atmosphere and music has never been so good as it is now; If you enjoyed the previous Mount & Blade game, you will fall in love with this one.Mount & Blade: Warband will be the game that you will be happy to be hooked into to, a fair balanced game between adventure and RPG with a vast variety of content and diversity in all of its aspects.Some negative aspects.Bugs, Glitches and some graphic reading failuresDespite being unusual, you will encounter some glitches that will make some of the game items to disappear, or to find everything in a black screen when you return to the world map. There are also some in-game bugs that makes everything blur and unable to see around, although, I found out this can be fixed if you simple minimize the game and open it again!Some crashes might happen too, but those are rare to encounter.ConclusionI would rate this game with a 79 out of 100, or 4,0 out of 5,0, a never ending sandbox game that will make players fall in love as they experience the life and atmosphere of what a true medieval age game has to give!

												After 465 hours in game i finally had time to write this review -- It's a great game if you care more about gameplay than graphics.When M&B series was originally released in 2007, it was a time when video games starts to become more casual. And by 2010 when M&B Warband was released, there are basically two types of games left: either it's originally designed for casual gaming for consoles, or it tries so hard on graphics to woo players that it basically rehash the gameplay. Very few developers had tried to innovate how RPG should be created and played.And here comes Mount & Blade Warband, designed on a already out-of-date DirectX API, with few lightings to impress the crowd. I had ignored this game for 4 years before finally getting it. And I never regretted since:  ----------  This is the game that shows how sandbox games should be designed!!! ------------Unlike the standard standbox games which were always using some rehashed mechanics: tower captures, endless spawned enmeis for no reason, no sense of progression. Mount and Blade series standed out as being the ONLY GAME since 2010 that had acceptable graphics, deep sense of RPG immersion, and deep progression on all areas. Leveling a character should be designed not only just to increase some integer numbers (strength, agility, charimsa, goodness, evilness, and gold), but it should also take into account of the player's actions. Not in the sense bioware had tried (let's just change some dialogs if goodness > evilness).My actions in the game matters so greatly: loot a villege, steal some cattles, keep ransoms for myself. When I decided to start a kingdom, I found out no one wanted to join my army, every peasent charges obscene amount of gold for a simple sword, and my kingdom lasted less than half a week. It wasn't much latter I found out how being nice to people can be so rewarding in this game: befriendly lords of good characters, marry a nice lady and solidfy alliance, join a faction and help out in wars in return for new land grants, help villages and towns and it propspers to allow me to sell more at a higher price, maintain good relations with village elders so I have a steady supply of new eager recruits, work on leadership skills to unify units under my command. Once the king starts to get power hungry start a rebellion, recruit the good and friendly and allied lords to my cause, manage garrisons and taxations, lead a military campaign to crush the tyrant, and then have than play the diplomatic and military game to conquer the whole ancient europe. I can do them all!Not only actions matter greatly, the gameplay on how you perform the actions are so difficult and rewarding. The battles are absolutely unforgiving at higher settings. The only tools I have to work with are my own hands and eyes. Want to shoot the approaching band of armies? Click the mouse and aim -- except there is absolutely no aiming assistance, both the enemies and my elite units are mounted. And I only get one shot before having to spend 3 seconds to reload. Melee kills while mounted also took some time to master: I have to wait until they are precise at the position where if I extend my polearm now, at the end of my thrust it reaches precisely on the enemy! Medieval tactics are a much harder lessons to learn: when to shieldwall, when to use ranks, when to hold and when to charge, whether to attack or to defend. And when things start to go well, where to lay siege next? When to start and when to end a military campaign so I can host feasts to improve morale and relations? These are all hard questions we have to continue to contemplate in between individual battles.And there is no other game in the world that has this great amount of depth, the amazing combat gameplay, and the rich RPG experience than this. If you only have resource to play one RPG game, and you like medieval themes, then get this!Also I hope the M&B2 is progressing well. I can't wait to buy it!			",69,8,0,13,26,0,22

												Okay, I just actually read my own review and noticed it's quite a lengthy piece of work. If you are actually considering buying this game, I'd recommend actually reading this (and other!) review(s) that are of decent length because this game is not easily captured in just a few words.Mount & Blade: Warband is one of those slightly niche games out there that captures the heart of gamers looking for a medieval world where you play as just another soldier able to pave his legend or die forgotten. There is no storyline, no heroic destiny - you are not Dovahkiin, the fate of the world surprisingly does not rely on your actions, and no, you don't get a magical sword that will vanquish all enemies. Now some people might find this to be a deterrent, but for a game as entertaining as Mount & Blade: Warband, I only saw endless replay value. Having put thousands of hours into both the original Mount & Blade as well as Warband (both of which I originally did not buy on Steam) I can assure you that if this game fits the genre of your preference, you can play it endlessly.Now what sort of genre IS M&B Warband? You have a lot of choices, you can be a solo mercenary (which is very very hard), lead a group of mercenaries for a noble/king, swear fealty to a king of a faction, or attempt to become the king of your own faction. Remember, M&B Warband is a sandbox game in which you can choose what you want to become. Whatever story you feel like making, embrace it and become. But, for the most part, it is a first-person medieval combat-based campaign of a character trying to make his or her way in the world. Yes, there are some tactics involved, you can create your own little trade caravan and take over the market, you can go around helping all the peasants in the world, and if you have a masochistic streak, you can attempt to work your way into the politics of the game (which like politics, is frustrating). Yet, in the end, it all comes down to fighting your way through life.Let me jump right into my favorite part: the combat. M&B has a very unique combat system (there are a few glitches here or there, but nothing game-breaking) involving first-person medieval combat on a battlefield that quite possibly may be strewn with horses, people, corpses, quite a few arrows and crossbow bolts (mostly flying at you). You have a variety of weapons to choose, from a heavy siege crossbow to a throwing axe to a mere wooden staff to a glaive to a two-handed sword to... you get the point. Add all of this to being mounted on horses (which have differing physical attributes) for mounted combat and you have the chaos that constitutes a true battlefield.There are also sieges in this game, which allow you to actively use the terrain to your advantage... or disadvantage. It is very hard to siege a castle on the hardest difficulties (because I mean, when they are sitting on walls raining arrows on you...) but also very rewarding as you can then claim the castle and its revenue for your own. My biggest issue with sieges is that for most cities/castles, you are given a single ladder/siege tower with which to conduct your siege (infrequently you get 2, of which your/their troops only use 1). No matter on which side, this makes for siege defense quite practical when actually participating as every man on the wall is worth a hundred below it. (The combat simulator, which is activated when you don't feel like participating in the battle yourself, generally is very different from actual combat and tends to make defenders weaker than they actually are. At the same time, your troops will also not be getting orders from you and thus will be strategically weaker as well.)The hardest part about the combat system for myself and I'd believe most others was the ranged combat - especially mounted ranged combat. Everything short of wind and air resistance is factored in, from flight time to the drop from gravity to the sway of your horse to the angle of release to the point of impact on the enemy. It is challenging, rewarding, and all together epic. I'd like to say more about the combat, but if I let my thoughts roam wild on this game we may be forced to deal with a book instead of a review. So let me leave you with an image: Picture yourself holding a shortbow, moving at a slow gallop on your horse, faced with fifty knights charging you with lances couched.Moving on to the AI in this game: The enemy AI is pretty good (if you play on harder difficulties) and their characters are very strong - as strong as if not stronger than you. You also have the ability to deal with merchants, caravans, kings, nobles, ladies, and the odd ""adventurer/hero"" who may be willing to join you. Unlike the original M&B, Warband also offers you the option of recruiting vassals from other factions into your faction if you choose to start one. This has made attempting to create a kingdom drastically easier since you no longer need to defend your territory alone from the might of five other kingdoms and their thousands upon thousands of troops. The game also factors in your relationship to the NPCs, which can get very messy very quickly (this is something you should definitely experience for yourself, as words don't really do it justice).There are also a vast variety of mods for this game (though the vanilla version in and of itself is endlessly playable) that create various scenarios/settings in addition to the vanilla version. Furthermore, Warband brings online multiplayer which (though I personally did not partake in much of) enhances the experience even more.Warband is unique. It is niche. It is epic. It is the perfect game for a gamer who wants to live his/her own story instead of a repetitive tale created by someone else.I hope this review helps with your decision making. If you have any questions/concerns or would simply like more information, feel free to leave a comment or contact me.			",21,0,0,10,2,0,2

												I have over 700 hours on this game, 30 within the last week. You can probably see where this review is going. GAMEPLAY: It is possibly the second best part of the game, the gameplay. It can make or break the game, and it has definitely made this game. The game is easy to play but extremely difficult to master, even people poor at the game's mechanics can have fun (as did I in my early days). The simplest I can put the game is, as a Medieval Combat Simulator, but it is so much more than that. With options to become a King (or Queen) and partake in the politics, alternatively become a vassal under one of the existing Lords. You can become a trader, vying to create a trade-empire or a brigand who preys on the poor farmers and villages. The gameplay is, simply put, possibly the best out of any game out there. There is so much you can do, and even more.... The game is created to be easily modded, there are dozens of era-changing mods out there, let alone even more minor or current-era-altering mods. Most of them are relatively stable, even if they are made on old versions of the game. There is simply put, no end to the game. GRAPHICS: Not a high-point, but they are not bad when set on the highest options. I myself don't play on the highest options, as all the dust and shadows (and the trees, ugh the trees...) can make me lag terribly in large battles. Especially against horse-archer nomads who gather up a lot of dust. If you're not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ this shouldn't bother you. COMMUNITY: Surprised that gameplay wasn't the best? It's not, the community is the best part of the game. Well, it is the best and the worst part of the game. Just hang out with some mates and have a good time, maybe even join a group of like-minded players, or make your own. If you want a serious group, for competitions and such, those exist too. But they are usually in-group competitions. Like the time I won DOTA 2, and I didn't know it was free... -.- Won't deny the tournament with friends and the absolute chaos of randomness that followed afterwards was worth it. EXPANSION: I also own Napoleonic Wars, the expansion for Mount & Blade: Warband. I too, also have had many hours on this and definitely recommend it. It is multiplayer only, but there is so much to do even there. There are also several amazing mods requiring this expansion. 11/10 would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So there I am, leading my troops into battle. 150 of my own vs. 172 of theirs, an honourable fight, indeed. Me and my horsemen charge forward, our swords ready to strike at the hearts of our enemies, my archers, their arrows ready to kill the enemy as soon they even see them.I see my enemies on the horizon, their commanders charging at us, a swarm of so many arrows, they block the sunlight.A bloody fight begins, honourable men and women dying left and right, but eventually, it's just me and the Jarl.Quickly, I run up to him, thrusting my blade into his chest and blocking his swing. He falls down, defeated.But my troops aren't cheering, the fight isn't over. Why?I hear something flying towards me, but it's too late.""George has been knocked unconcious by Farmer.""10/10 would lose massive battle because of a farmer again.			",249,31,1,25,17,2,11

												This is by far the best game I have ever played in my entire life, and I have played far too many games. This game has probably the best combat system out there and by far the best mods of any game ever. There is unlimited replayability a low skill requirement to begin but a high one to master and a generally very good community. Highly reccomend 11/10			",69,4,1,12,11,0,26

Excuse me? You wanted to know what Warband is like? Alright then, since you asked so nicely...I'll start from the beginning...00 Hours: You have just purchased M&B Warband. You launch the game, and begin a new campaign.                 You get to decide the background story of your character - you're impressed.05 Hours: You have a small army of loyal troops, and have cleansed the land of many a bandit.                 You are already impressed with the sweet looking armor and weapons of your troops.10 Hours: You have your own castle, a large army, and are well on the way to marrying a noble.                 You have an army; the biggest and the best - clad in platemail and virtually unbeatable.15 Hours: The time has come. You've mastered combat, and have decided to play Multiplayer.                 You connect to a server... and behold, two naked men are jumping and swinging their great swords.10/10 Realistic Nude Combat Simulator			",51,2,2,5,7,0,9

												I was a steppe child. I was born in the plains, in a family of nomads. Travelling across the world. My father was the leader of our tribe. Everybody respected him. When i grew up, i roamed all around the area, riding my stallion. Not every child could control that beast. I followed our people's path to survive. Poaching games my general activity during my youth.Then everything changed...I remember that black day, as clear as it can be...They attacked my father, fifteen of them, against one. My father left none of them alive actually. He killed all of them by himself. When i finally reached him, he was  about to give his last breath. He only said one word; ""Sanjar"".I knew that vary moment what i had to do. I had to avenge my father. I had to kill Sanjar Khan, burn his villages, destroy his castles, root out his cities...Then i started riding my horse, never looked back again.After years of pain and suffering, i can finally look back. I can look back to see The Empire of Calradia is in peace. I can look back to see everyone is safe, under my rule. No more killers, rapers, looters roam araound the realm. Those days are over. It is peace now. You can finally rest in peace, father.			",42,4,2,6,8,0,12

												With almost 500 hours in this game and probably another 500 hours more that will come in the second one, I feel like I can finally review it.M&B: Warband is unique in so many ways, you truly just start with few gold and some weapons that's it. From there you have to build your way to take over the world. Which is not as easy as it sounds.There isn't much of a story in this game. Everything said above is pretty much it, it lets you create and do what you want in the game world. All you care about is take over the world kill everyone else. How you choose to do so is up to you.There are small ""quests"" within the game that will give you exp to level yourself up as well as your army with skills that will benefit either you, your army or your entire kingdom.This game is not something you buy for amazing graphics or amazing sound, it is a game you buy for its depth and for the fun of leading grand armies to major battles and sieges. I can honestly say after my 460 hours I haven't won the game. Not even once, always made a mistake or didn't capture enough castles or even worse did get too many. It is a game that has a deep connection with the middle and dark ages.Marry, kill, capture your way to conquer the world.Mount & Blade will live for a long long time and there are amazing mods all the time that get added to make the game even better. The two important things you should add to get an amazing experience - Floris Mod Pack - http://www.moddb.com/mods/floris-mod-packWarband battle size -http://www.nexusmods.com/mbwarband/mods/1761/These two mods make it possible to have battles up to 600 units on both sides and it looks amazing. Seeing your proud army just clash and kill 100´s of other units is fun. They also provide further more depth to the politics and basic gameplay of the game.All in all M&B: Warband is one of those games that proves that a game doesn't have to be all about graphics/sounds or any flashy flashy stuff, to make a truly unique and amazing experience that will keep you trapped for years.So if you are looking for a game that will take your soul for 100s of hours grab this game for sure. It is one of my favorites and is really one of those games that is 100% what YOU decide and make of it.			",3006,1169,124,357,452,35,532

Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices- Quests often become tedious and repetitive- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below parLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												""Is this game fun?""PROS: -Amazing singleplayer (you could play for years and you would not have seen every possibility)-Gameplay is perfect, the mechanics are quite easy to learn, not as easy as chivalry; but that allows people to actually fight instead of constantly blocking. This game can be played alone or with friends and still be fun either way-This isnt really a feature or anything, but it has a skyrim-ish battle feel to the game. Without the magic and the dragons and what not (Unless you play around with the mods). -Even if you lack experience, you can join a server, play team games or deathmatch and not feel like you are being mocked for your lack of  ""Skillz"" (thank you LOL and COD)  The community is quite open and while we may not be extremely chatty, no one will insult you or call you a noob. (And if they do, than they will most likely feel the taste of the banhammer)-The countless mods make this game endless; Want to invade britain in the dark ages? Go ahead Feel the need to join the dark side or help the jedi's? Be my guestWonder what would have happened if you had been in the romain empire?And the list of mods go on and on...CONS:-There will always be one naked guy with a two handed broadsword or axe (and it'll be faster than your short sword .........*grumble grumble*)-You will never, ever be the best player in a game of 50+ (unless dedicate a lot of hours of multiplayer into this game)-You will lose what ""life"" you hadConclusion:Yes this game is fun, 100% worth the tryCheck you have the computer for the game, BEFORE you buy it, but if you do, this is probably a game for you.Ps; All aboard the Bannerlord Hype train!!!

I may no longer have any of these things, but check it: ♥♥♥♥ a job, I'm the king.  Who needs friends when you have muhfuggin vassals? And girlfriend?  Let's just say I've got like 20 of those now from all different countries because dark ages ♥♥♥♥♥es love them some poems, which is a skill I've invested a LOT of denars in.  My old apartment is nowhere near as cool as my castle.  Yes you heard me.  MY CASTLE.  Plus, I get to take what I want because I've built an army that cannot be stopped. Except for when it's dinner time because my mom likes to use the computer to watch hulu while we eat.

												This is quite the game, possibly being one of the best games ever made.Its so good that i am unsure of how to write this review.Well then, lets start with the base game.Mount and Blade: Warband is many things. In this game you can start an army, recruiting peasants from villages and training them into one hell of an army, an army that will conquer the world. There are 6 nations in the base game, each with different units and weapons. They are (from top to bottom) the Nords, an infantry based nation specializing in axes and throwing weapons with mediocre archers and no cavalry. Their top tier infantry is the strongest in the game. They are historically based on the NorseThe Vaegirs, a somewhat well rounded nation with fantastic archers, their infantry uses mainly two handed weapons. Their top tier archers are the finest non crossbow units in the game, though they arent suited for long engagments due to how fast they use their ammo. They are historically based on the Slavs.The Swadians, again, a well rounded nation, this time specializing in cavalry, they use traditional medieval western european weapons like crossbows and two handed swords. They have the best cavalry in the game and are a bit of a community favorite. They are historically based on Germans.The Khergits, a VERY cavalry heavy nation, almost all of their units are cavalry, they use shortbows, sabres and hafted blades (similar to the japanese naginata). They arent particularly good as far as cav goes, they are the only nation with horse archers which makes them excellent for kiting, though as far as facing a professional army, they arent going to do well. Would recommend for getting early game cavalry. They are historically based on the Mongols.The Rhodoks, a very defensive nation with fantastic crossbows, they use cleavers, spears, crossbows, warhammers and picks (I particularly like the Glaives). They have the best crossbows in the game but lack cavalry and have somewhat bad infantry. Would recommend mixing crossbows with Nord infantry, they make a mean seige army. They are historically based on the Venetians and the French.And lastly, the Sarranids, Jack of all trades but master of none, they use scimitars, shortbows, maces and axes. All around quite balanced. They are historically based on the Arabs.I wont go into the mechanics, there are quite a few guides about them, and also plenty of lets plays.And now we get to the big thing. Mods.There are tons of enhancment and total conversion mods for this game, even a few multiplayer ones.Want to play in feudal Japan? There is a mod for that, its called Gekokujo.Feel like some crusades? Quite a few mods for that, Sands of Faith for instance.Like yourself some light fantasy? Perisno and Prophecy of Pendor have your back.Dark age Britain? Brytenwalda.Fantasy Warhammer? Warsword Conquest.Multiplayer RP with a somewhat cancerous community? Persistent World.Plus many many more.			",99,14,2,21,28,0,37

												Sweat pours from my brow as i close in for the last kill of the round, i sense the eyes of dead players spectating watching my every movement. I swing left, then block right to cancel throwing him off guard, i repeat this swing then cancel action about 10 times before commiting to the hit. My sword connects with his dirty russian rags, his hands clutched at the vodka bottle he was using to fight me i lean in close to hear his last words, as he lay there in the snow dying he types out in all chat:' noob, spin 2 win not even good lol', the round ends and the chat fills with abuse.I sit back in my chair and pluck a loose pringle from my neckbeard, i mutter to myself ' free weekend players' before typing bg no re. 7/3 gr8 game 4 me, highly rektommend Carpal tunnel and loss of all social skill worthwhile.

												This is the purest RPG sandbox game. By that I mean, you cannot have a more ""sandbox"" experience in an RPG - there is no story and no real goals; it is entirely player driven. You can join any faction, you can build up your army, you can create a new faction and expand, taking over the others. You can do everything an NPC can do and vice versa. I keep coming back to this game every once in a while and get dragged into it. You essentially rise from a single peasant to a warlord who conquered the whole world, without having your hand held at any time.Other than the RPG/sandbox mechanics, the game as an amazing combat system which supports enormous medieval battles involving hundreds of characters. The music is really good but after tens of hours it can get repetitive. The graphics are pretty dated but if you can get over it, it's most certainly worth it.			",488,123,20,69,61,7,80

												Mount & Blade: Warband is pretty cool, I guess.You play as you, or whatever, because you make your own character. After deciding your backstory, appearance, and stats, you are sent off to the land of Calradia, a place split into several kingdoms who all want to punch one another in the face. Each nation works differently from the other. Like how the Kingdom of Swadia usually fights wars so they can get more butter for their King so he can throw feasts that I assume serve nothing but butter. Maybe he's a fried butter fan, I don't know.  Because of this, each of the nations excels and suffers in the war department. Swadia, who are masters of getting guys on horses and smashing them into people, but don't ask them to hit anything with a crossbow. Vaegirs, smelly mountain men who like to hit things with arrows, but go down against calvary in an almost loony toons like way. Nords, Not-Vikings who prefer to chase down horsemen on foot and swing axes at them. Rhodok, No, you come to them! Khergit, Not-Mongol Huns that would rather drive-by you. 187 represent ride or die mother ♥♥♥♥er. And who could forget the Sarranids. I'm not sure what they do, actually. I don't even think I spelled their name right. They do have camels, though.When your character gains enough influence, they can join one of these nations and fight as a lord or mercenary. Gaining more prestige and having all the castles and towns you conquer get handed over to lords who didn't do anything while your fat king eats more butter. The game itself plays rather interestingly. You have two modes, the overworld and actual battles.In the overworld you do most of your management stuff. You take quests, recruit new units for your army, travel from place to place, start a trade empire, light bags of poo on fire and leave it on people's front door, etc. The game is surprisingly open in what you can do as a character.You CAN join a nation, sure. Or you could build a trade empire across all of Calradia and do a little bit of war profiteering. Or you could become a bandit king and pillage across the lands, taking advantage of war stricken people. Or you can even say screw it and build an empire yourself, a difficult but rewarding option as you take Calradia for yourself. But how do you go about doing this when you actually have to fight? In Mountain Blade, you don't control an army RTS style, you control a commander who controls an army. You play from a third or first person perspective and have to do some fighting yourself. Or you can sit back and let your elite archers do all the work, what do I  care? I'm not your dad, I don't have to tell you how to play.You have three options in a fight. An attack which direction is based on where your mouse is pointing or what directional key your holding. A block that is either a directional based parry or just all around with the use of a shield. And a kick to break enemy guards and kick them off ladders like the stinky invaders they are.You can also use projectile weapons such as throwing rocks, javelins, bows, crossbows, etc. This works like a TPS or FPS game where you have to aim manually and hopefully hit them in the head. You can hit them in other places sure, but whats the fun in that? It would be a rather simple system if every battle wasn't a complete cluster ♥♥♥♥. You bring your armies into battle with you and battles can get rather chaotic, especially if you modded the game and increased the maximum units in battle at once. This leads to a hectic and brutal experience that a lot of games fail to capture. You're in the thick of it, another soldier on the battlefield. Screams of battle, arrows flying overhead, corpses piling up, you and others get covered in blood. You actually feel like you're part of a battle instead of just this overwhelming force like in Dynasty Warriors or similar games. Oh yeah, the mods, oh man the mods. Mountie's Blade has an amazingly active modding community. You know those guys that go ""When are (insert developers here) going to make a (Insert war here) game?"", well the Mount and Blade modders don't ask that, they just make them themselves.So far the mods I've played between both Warband and the original include: Roman Empire, The Greek-Persian War, American Frontier in 1886, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Warhammer, Sengoku Jidai Japan, Medieval England, Medieval Europe, homebrew fantasy settings, and even Napoleanic Wars. Just to name a few.I have a lot of respect for the modding community for these games. The amount of extra content they produce means you have hundreds of more hours between those and the base game. Sure some of them suck, but the good ones usually outnumber the bad in massive volumes. But should you play Mounts the Blade: Battleguys? Yeah.Well okay, uh. I've actually been following the development of Mount and Blade since the original was still in it's early alpha state and only Swadia and Vaegirs existed. It's an interesting little game turned power house with the help of some passionate devs and dedicated modders.  Warbands is basically the definitive edition of the game, but you've already bought and played it since it's been out for years and I just kind of wanted to review it. But if you somehow haven't played this game, then you probably should. Calradia is a strangely fascinating world and each playthrough can be completely different. Not to mention all the work the modders do. Mentos and Bleach: Fightclub gets 9 unruly men with swords out of a possible 6. Cherophobia is the fear of fun.

												This is my favourite game on Steam. I keep coming back to it because it's just so endlessly playable and fun. Still haven't united the land of Calradia, even after hundreds of hours of playtime.Some of my favourite moments from the game:>A perfect headshot with my crosbow from a hundred yards out. Earned me a ton of experience! :)>Charging at full gallop into the enemy ranks on my armoured horse and cutting my way through.>Storming a castle; that rush as you climb a ladder with arrows sinking into your shield, knowing that when you get to the top, the defenders are waiting with spears and axes.>The opposite: defending my newly won castle against the endless Khergit hordes! Just keep swinging that sword until there's no more!>Capturing a king, then ransoming him for a huge sum.>That visceral thrill as you cut down a fleeing foe from behind.>Winning a jousting match.And that's just the base game. It gets scarily awesome when you start dabbling in the mods, many of which can be downloaded very easily from the workshop on this very site. These add hours and hours of free content, everything from feudal Japan and the Napoleonic Wars, to Game of Thrones and Star Wars.My favourite game. Cannot wait for the sequel!

												Buy it! No but seriously, the community for this game, from the modders who have made such amazing things and GOT mods and LOTR mods to massively improved Native mods to the pioneers of the Mount and Musket: Battalion mod, is fantastic. It has kept this game alive far beyond what could be expected of it. There's also the Multiplayer community, with it's clans, regiments and modders too, such as the Full Invasion mod team or the North and South modders, is so big and enjoyable. There are people to meet and places to go and fantastical kingdoms to fight and die for, or betray and burn. Gaming groups and friends to make and drills to learn and hard fought victories to rejoyce in. I cannot reccomend this game enough to anyone who has the spare cash to spend on it, especially if it's on sale.			",62,1,0,10,8,0,28

												One of the greatest Multiplayer experiences I have ever had. The singleplayer isn't that bad either! I've just been too hooked with M&B MP that I have given M&B SP zero time. I hear nothing but great things from my singleplaying friends though. If you buy this game, I recommend getting the Napoleonic Wars expansion. It's multiplayer only, but that is where I have had the most fun. There are several different game modes. The first is called Siege. In where a defending team must protect their castle from Enemy advancement until the timer has run out, however, keep your head well hidden from them Snipers. As defending team lives are limited to just five. Or less, depending on the time you joined the map. The attackers however, they have unlimited lives but in order to get to you, they must breach a hole in your wall with cannons and then storm the breach; which normally results in your bayonet stuck in their chests as you sing Rule Britannia; or mention the Kaiser if you're playing as Prussia/Austria.The next gamemode in M&B MP is Battle. In Battle, both teams have just one life. And there is no respawning until the round is complete, so if you charge ahead early on and get mowed down by 6 Cavalry who have joined together and created a small posse, then you're going to be waiting 5-6 minutes for the round to end probably. That can be frustrating so I recommend teaming up with your teammates, rather than go lone wolf assasin style. The game also features TDM and DM gamemodes, I don't need to explain these. As they feature heavily in pretty much every game with a gun or sword and has multiplayer.Overall, I recommend M&B to anybody if you're a fan of the era it's set in, and are war crazy. Or if you like the RPG and open world elements of the singleplayer. The game also has a VERY strong modding community. And you should try out some of the awesome mods. This was a fantastic experience.			",670,210,44,118,128,7,176

												Once upon a time in 2011, a good friend of mine was totally crazy over some not-AAA medieval game and showed it to me. I thought to myself ""Oh god: this is ugly as hell. And it looks boring as hell. Well, good for you, but I won´t touch that one.""Turns out 3 other friends got the game aswell, so we started off playing a bit as a team of four. I thought that this would be a game which you played once or twice with some buddies, then leave it in your library to rot.Boy, was I wrong.It may say 1000h here, but I´ve mostly been playing mods which didn´t need steam to start up. I estimate around 4000h+ in total spent on this game. Be it 20 mins in the morning before I went to work or after a party in a hangover: it has always been a blast and I absolutely recommend it to anyone out there who´s at least a little bit into medieval games.

												We have a tremendous problem with radical Khergits, a tremendous problem. We're being stupid and letting them in past our borders, our borders don't exist. You don't have a country without borders, people, believe me. The Rhodoks, Nords and Vaegirs are taking our jobs, they're beating us at the border and frankly I am so sick of it. The Khergits and the Sarranids, they're lopping off heads while we're feasting on butter, they're laughing at us. They think we are so stupid, it's incredible. Our allies have been ripping us off big league, when I'm King I will renegotiate our trade deals and put Swadia first. I will build the wall and people can come into the country and out of the country, but they're gonna be doing it legally. We're gonna make Swadia great and safe again.Butter! Butter! Butter!

												Seems like it has been 3 years since I reviewed this game... Now I have got 2000+ hours in the game (and counting) And I can truly say I have played this game to pieces, not only have I became a melee ""god"" I have also acomplished many things within the community... Things include:-Lead a succesful 90 man regiment-Finish 4th in a regimental based tournament-Taught English to many of my friends I have met along my journeys-Participated in many melee tournaments and finished high-upIf you are looking for a game; to play singleplayer, this is your game.If you are looking for a game; to play multiplayer, then you must consider a lot of things. Playing the multiplayer to join in public servers is a waste of time unless you are trying to get good at melee. Joining a clan is certainly the best option you could take, although I would reccommend the Napoleonic Wars DLC for that. The reason why I would ensure this is because you meet lots of people and take part in lots of community hosted events.Ultimately, there is a lot to achieve in this game if you are willing to give it a go and the time that it deserves and needs.10/10, seriously best game going around right now.

Just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it please you can get it for £2 easily and you will not regret it? why the ♥♥♥♥ haven't you bought it already both multiplayer and singleplayer...EDIT : Also if you are looking for a competative multiplayer scene this is one of the most competative skill based games on the market! it still is very competative years after release. It takes hours and hours to get good but is really rewarding and does NOT hold the hands of new players!!! It is basically the best game of all time!EDIT : My youtube channel can show you how awesome the game is and how its the best game ever https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClJPamXx16bZ5rdUy6oBejw/videos ",83,2,0,9,10,0,8

												Of all the Games i play during my life, Mount and Blade: Warband is a really Amesome game that I would Seriously Recommend.I play 100+ hours on this game when i got the Non-Steam Verison but i change computers and i lost the discs to reinstall it. So i decide to Buy it on Steam. Anyway Back to the Review. (Wait i'm Being very Serious in this Review? Wow...)What this Game is about you ask? Well its little hard to explain it so i will try my Best. Its a Medievel Sim with RPG elements and set in a Fictional World know as Calradia (I can't Proannouce the name either). What really sets it apart from all other games, is that it so fun to Lead your Own Army. ( Which i will Explain that later)Now i know what your Asking ''Are the Graphics any Good Bro?'' Well in a way no. i know what your Saying Next ''EWWWW the Graphics SUCK! NO BUY!'' Well if you love to Judge a game by graphics then by all means do, Sure it not the Best but hey, the Graphics are better then What you get in Infestation: Survivor Stories right?Now what about the Gameplay you ask? Well i can tell you that its Really Fun! You Start your Jounery by Filling out your Skills. basicly it would look like this http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband-Patch_1.jpgAnd then your off to Createing your character. Which look like this http://elder-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/mb_warband-2010-03-29-19-32-47-72.jpgAnd Then your Done! Now let talk about what this game is about. There are Six Factions in this Game: Swadia, Rhodok, Vaegirs, Khergit Khanate, Nords, and the Sarranid Sultanate (Note: You don't join one of the factions when you start the game, you only join them when you are a Merc or a Vassal which i will Explain later) . Now it will be basicly hard to explain these factions so i will let this Page Explain it for you http://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Warband/Factions . Now there is alot to talk about so try to Stay with me. You Start out in some Area of your choice *The Faction Areas* The map is pretty Big, here this pic to give you a Idea what it look like http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110214224212/mountandblade/images/a/a6/WarbandWorldMap.pngWhen you Start out you will be Fighting Bandits, Doing Quests from Towns, and doing small tasks from the Lords (Vassals). The Game goverment system is based on Feudalism, It basicly means that the King shall give you Fiefs (Land) in Exchange for Service (Basicly fighting for your King). Now in order to become a Lord (Vassal) to a faction, You must Do tasks for the lords, bulid up some rep, etc. When you become a Vassal the king of a Faction will give you the poorest village in the faction's territory (Because he a♥♥♥♥♥♥. When you get a Fief (Villages, castles, citys,) you will get Taxes from that Fief and you can bulid improvements in that Village, Castle, or city (But they will Cost you alot and they take a long time to finish and also you will get a castle or city in late Game). Now let talk about your Personal Army. You will raise a army for yourself ( Note: YOU WILL NOT MAKE A HUGE ARMY THE SIZE OF 1000! KEEP DREAMING) You can raise a Army by Hireing men from villages, Saveing Prisoners, or just hire mercs( They will Cost you!) However you will have to take care of your army. You must keep there morale high, Buy Food for your army, Get them Heal up if some of your men are wounded, Pay their Wages, etc. Now in order to make some money you would have to1. loot and Sell2. Taxes3. Get pay from a questNow let talk about how being a lord is like. Basicly you serve your Faction to fight aganist other factions that your faction is at war at, Get a alot of fiefs to earn more money, Get the other lords to be your friends, or if get  lucky: Get to be Elect for Marshall. Basicly a Marshall is someone who can summon the lords to fight for him like capture a very strong castle, Citys, etc. This is what it would look like http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120224215032/mountandblade/images/b/be/Following_Marshall.jpg (Note: the Marshall in that pic is not a Human Player)Oh! I forgot to explain the RPG elments in this game. You can buy armor, Weapons, and a Horse for yourself to protect yourselves when you fight in a battle. Basicly this is what your inventory would look like http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband_10.jpg (Note: The person in this Pic have just start a New Game)Now let talk about Combat! the way you swing your Sword, axe, etc depends on where you swing your mouse. For example if you move your mouse to the right, the Weapon will Swing right, and so on. The battles in this game really depends on 3 Things1. How many Soliders2. How strong is your Army3. The most Important one!: Tactics and strategyThis is just a example of what your Company(Army) Page would look like http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/435317-mount-blade-warband-windows-screenshot-on-the-right-is-my.jpg (Note: The person in this Pic had capture a Castle and is now takeing Prisoners)Now what about what the Battles? Well the battles are the fun Part! This is what a battle would look like {LINK REMOVED}http://pulpgaming.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/mount-blade-warband-pc-096.jpg Or this http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/taleworlds.jpg(Note: the Land, or environment you would be Playing on depends on where are you fighting at. For example if you are fighting on a Snowy place, then you be Fighting on a Snowy battlefield and etc) BUT BE WARN! you must be careful or elas you would end up like this Poor Soul http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110626205906/mountandblade/images/a/a7/Mb_warband_2011-06-26_22-50-06-18.jpgYeah.........Anyway what about castle and citys? are there Sieges? The answer: Yes! When you siege a castle you would have to bulid Siege weapons (Siege tower or ladders) but they will take time to bulid. So you got to be careful if the other lord are coming to save the castle or City. You can also Defend a castle of your own or a city or castle own by a other lord. And yes you will be able to fight in these siege battles. Like this http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband-Tutorial-3-Siege-Warfare-Trailer_3.jpgOr this http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Mount-and-Blade-Warband-Tutorial-3-Siege-Warfare-Trailer_2.jpgor this http://i737.photobucket.com/albums/xx14/allaboutpics/mb_warband2012-03-2003-44-21-20.jpgOh and you can create your own faction! BUT that would be in late game becuase it going to be diffcult. But there ALOT to talk about haveing a kingdom, so i will give you this link to give you more details about makeing your own Kingdom http://mountandblade.wikia.com/wiki/Founding_a_new_kingdomOh and btw this game have a Great mod support! If you are looking to get some mods, MODDB is a good site. Here a link http://www.moddb.com/games/mount-blade-warband/modsIf you don't know how to install mods. Here a video to help you out

												After, over 500 hours of the game. I can safely, with all definite possibilities, say that this is indeed a great game.Whether you're a Lord, a commoner, a hunter, a mercenary, a lady rising to aristocratsy, a trader, a slaver, a crossbowman, a leader, a tactician. No matter who you want to be. This game can make you that person.From fighting atop horses, to fighting on foot, to fighting in sieges, and land-battles. With swords, maces, axes, spears, javelins, bows, crossbows, hammers, picks, pikes, bills, throwing knives, quarterstaffs, even your bare fists - This game will let you do whatever you want  to in a Feudal-Based world.Set in a feudal-Medieval landscape, the same to it's predecessor - Mount And Blade, named Calradia - There will be much to do with much time to do it in. The continent is torn arift, with six rival faction-states all vying for power. Each with it's only courts, castles, cities and vassals (Of whom have quite the amount of family members, be they father, son, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle, aunty) -- You're character is free to roam, choosing entirely as to what your role will be in this epic-society.Be who YOU want to be. Act how YOU want to act. Duels, pillaging, fighting, peace - These, and more, will be your weapons in the feudal life that is Warband. Marry for love, or for power. Become a king, queen, emporer, empress of your own kingdom, empire, rebellion - Help rival lordlings cure their hatreds, or help worsen them.Now, that I've done the whole ""THIS IS A GREAT GAME. BUY NOW."" salesman-thing. Onto the actual points about the game, and whether I truly believe the game is worth it's £15 (Because, let's be honest. £14.99 is just £15). Yes. It is. Through my long-time with the game, it's safe to say that I've not even scratched the very surface of the game's entire potential. Being a mostly-singleplayer person, though multiplayer is highly recommended - What with the thousands (Yes. Thousands.) of servers for several of the community mods up, I would be certain to tell you - You will not even be able to contemplate just how many new characters I've made.But ofcourse, there's the buggy side. In the hundreds of hours I've spent, of my life, on the game - I can say that it's nigh bug-free, and there are only a few that would be of any irritation. Such as the poor use of lances by NPCs, but then again - That's not a bug, that's just the AI right? However, keep in mind that this game is a total sandbox, and the four, maybe five, bugs that exist are (By extreme!) outweighed by the perfection, that is Warband.Is the game worth it? No. It's worth more, mate.			",29,0,0,13,4,0,11

												LESS REVIEWING, MORE PLAYING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~But seriously though, this game is great. In my opinion the combat is really engaging and actually requires skill. The single player is a fun open world experience where you can do whatever you want and the modding community only makes this game better.One of my only gripes is that the mulitplayer community isn't all that big, there are maybe 1 or 2 slightly full servers but the rest are completely dead. Another thing to note is that the graphics are a bit dated, but that really isn't an issue for me personally10/10 would drink from skulls again			",62,5,0,10,4,0,4

 Mount & Blade: Warband  Warband is an extended version of the first game. In this game there is no story. In that production we take on the character created by us shaping its history. And we as adventurers we enter Calradia. The world immersed in a war between Khergits, Nords, Rhodoks, Sarranids, Swadians and Vaegirs. And we will be able to join one of them, swear an oath to a pretender and help him regain the throne or be a king / queen and conquer the land of Calradia. This production from the beginning is very boring because of the repeatable quests. However, after some time, once our character will be quite strong, we will create an army. The game has a reputation system if you attack someone they will not be liked by them, but it is also such a thing as honor points for taking parts in tournaments or for the release of the fallen lords simultaneously improving relations with the kingdom and with the Lord. When we have a good relationship and your own castle can marry a daughter / son Lord and as a result, we can arrange a feasts. The game offers a lot for that price. Great combat system, a lot of possibilities for character development, making the army, conquering castles and capitals and their ability to to improve and many other things that I could write about endlessly. Personally, I had a lot of fun while playing at this production. he game has its flaws, poor graphics and animations but has something that attracted me for many hours. If you are not afraid of ugly graphics is definitely worth a try. As for me, I look forward to Bannerlord :)  ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

This game is like a girl with a beard, but the best personality.Let's be honest guys, if this game was a girl, she would have a beard, a unibrow, a crooked nose and uneven teeth. But, if you kiss her with your eyes closed, it will be one of the best experiences ever, especially if she treats you like a king too. What? I can't be the only one that did this!After that much totally unneeded information, let's talk about Warband. It's the standalone expansion of 2008 game Mount and Blade. It follows the same principles, you are in Calradia and you are free to do whatever you want, but there are several new twists like new nations and an expanded map.While the game is not gonna score that high due to certain drawbacks, it has certain elements that make it enjoyable and addicting. If you are into RPGs, you will definitely spend more than 100 hours to it. Let's elaborate.When it comes to graphics and soundtrack, the game looks like it was released 10 years ago. Models have low polygon counts and structures have low resolution. Battlefields look a lot better (although repetitive), but they are nothing impressive like Skyrim's landscapes. Even Pokemon GO on a 3MP camera looks better. As for the music, it's so shallow that sometimes it might feel completely out of synch with the game's theme. It has a couple nice moments like swords glowing, but that requires an extremely strong pc that not anyone has or can afford.Despite its presentation failure, the gameplay is top-notch stuff. Each and every one of its aspects is complex to a degree, and all together form a very complicated and interesting gameplay. For example, other weapons thrust, others swing, others deal unbalanced damage, others shatter shields easier, or a combination of them all. The direction you block or try to strike an enemy matters, as you can deal huge damage to an enemy that blocks attacks from his e.g. right if you strike from the left or his head. Also, the part of the weapon you attack with matters since, let's say, an axe will deal more damage if you strike an enemy with its blade rather its hilt, etc. That's something you don't really see in most games, many developers tend to overlook this small, immersive detail. That basically means you have a steep learning curve to deal with, and you need to master it in order to play properly and have fun.Story-wise, you have absolute freedom. After a brief tutorial, you are thrown in a world where 6 factions duke it out for supremacy. You can join them, fight for the highest bidder as a mercenary, make your name as an arena fighter, become a merchant, ambush caravans as a bandit, become a king of your own faction and many more. Nothing constraints you, it's only you versus the world. On the downside, quests don't add any significant amount of depth and are repetitive, and the new romance quests, despite having interesting political consequences, are all about visiting ladies and finding the best poems to sing to woo them. Unless you take the quick way and abduct them. Easy peasy.And of course, you got the online feature. Truth is, I had tremendous fun with it. There are several modes like deathmatch, siege (my favourite) etc where you have to work with your teammates to achieve your goals. It's something really addicting knowing that you are shooting arrows to tens of enemies on the foot of your castle with other players and then you rush to the breach to defend it. It's so good a feeling, you will not get enough of it. Killing gives you gold to buy better equipment counterstrike-style, and it's guaranteed you will become more resilient to arrows and slashes. On the downside, there are some mysterious unbalanced issues, like some slashes not actually hitting the enemy players, some latency that will ruin how you feel your character hitting or being hit and certain maps have exploitable spots where an archer for example, can slaughter entire hordes of players while being safe for quite a while.For a small game by a small company, M&B:W has survived a lot more time than flashier, big name studio games with bigger budget. It's the best example that sometimes, the spirit of a small game can beat money. It's worth buying and i recommend it hands-down.Just remember to see your family and go out a bit after you start it, guys. And shower. It's very addicting.RATING:Gameplay: 9/10Presentation: 5/10Story: 7/10Unique Factor: Multiplayer: 8.5/10OVERALL: 7.3/10 ",121,15,0,28,18,0,21

												First I was some nobody raiding villages, then I was a tournament champion....From there I became a Vassal of King Harlaus the Fat. He gave me a starving village, which I nursed back to heatlh. From there, he gave me more villages and a few castles...I was his best friend...Then I betrayed him. I seceded from his Kingdom, created my own kingdom, and managed to♥♥♥♥♥♥off every other kingdom on the map. We bravely held out, and casted the false king of the Vaegirs into exile. King Harlaus is now my sworn enemy, when he was my friendThis is the type of experience only this game can give you, buy it now.10/10.EDIT: By the way, I seceded my territories from his Kingdom by going to one of his constant feasts and telling him that I'm leaving his Kingdom with my territories right in front of his friends. It was great.Context: I forgot to mention that Harlaus rules over the Kingdom of Swadia, not The Kingdom of the Vaegirs (Though I still wiped the Veagirs out), sorry about that for anyone new to this game.

												2k hours +1k hours unrecorded.I was wondering if i should write this review and i said to myself: Why not? You played 3k hours on this freaking game so you should know something about it.So... Singleplayer:At the start, you can choose ""your past"", like if you are Veteran warrior or just blacksmith´s apprentice... etc.You can choose your start in one of 6 factions (It won´t have any influence on your gameplay.)When you start, you have big world to explore. Only one negative thing, it´s not noob friendly.Multiplayer:Awesome multiplayer! Really! There are no hackers etc.Again there are 6 factions but it´s choosed by admin of server or players poll which 2 factions will fight. In Every Faction, you can choose from 3 classes. 1 ranged, 1 melee or 1 horseman.Every faction got it´s own equipment for every class.There are battle mods like Battle, TDM, DM, Duels, Siege....----------------------------------------------------------------------Game itself can offer modules which you can download on taleworlds forums.10/10 :) ",74,0,0,4,5,0,11

												Terrible Game... Not worth more than 5 hours of gameplay.In all seriousness, this game is one of my favourites. Certainly, it is the game I have spent the most hours playing. Before I explain everything that is right about this game, I will say that the graphics are a little dated. You will not be playing this game for it's graphics.Now that we have established the long list of problems;-This game features a unique blend of genres, featuring third person combat, real time strategy, and open-world sandbox.-Play as a trader, a tournament champion, a robber, a messenger, or when these things become boring: a vassal, a... KING.-Recruit peasents; level them through their respective faction-based troop trees. This process features complete equipment changes, allowing for visible progression. -Excellent mod support. In my experience, the number of working Warband mods are near to the number of Skyrim ones. Finally, you can trust in players like myself who have spend hundreds (or thousands) of hours playing this game. It is very replayable.11/10 Would destroy the king of Swadia's army of 250 men with my own 32.			",40,3,0,17,6,0,11

												Cons- needs mods to polish/ include features that should be there.- the AI Lords cheat on the main map (not in the battles)-Sieges are fun for a while but become tedious fast-AI soldiers can't use spears effectively. Players can, but AI can't figure it out. -Game slows down once you become a powerful lord in the game. Becomes tedious at times.-Game feels like it needs more features even though it is full of cool and interesting features.Pros-The combat is extremely difficult and extremely fun. There's a reason many new games copy the M&B combat style.-The game is as difficult as you want it to be. It's a very custimizable game. You can change the difficulty of pretty much everything in this game.-While it sucks that mods have to make the game as good as possible, the mods in this game are amazing.-Taleworlds, the creators of this game, love the community. They want to give players what they want.-Commanding soldiers in battles feels really, really good.  -The economics in this game are surprisingly deep. So deep that I can't really easily describe it.-The multiplayer is really good, a lot of fun. Summary: While Warband has many flaws, mods get rid of those flaws for the most part. All in all, this game is one of my  favorite games of all time. If you love medieval strategy, kingdom management, politics, and combat then there's no game out there right now that does what Warband does. There's a reason this game made in 2010 is still extremely popular. Can't wait for Bannerlord to come out. Mods that I recommendFloris: Its Warband as it should be. It includes a lot of amazing new features, items, and improves combat. Prophesy of Pendor: The most popular fantasy mod. It's pretty good, but doesn't include as many features as Floris.Of course, theres also a WARHAMMER mod, a Lord of the Rings mod, Chinese/Japanese mods, a historical Europe/Middle East mod, and multiple Game of Thrones mods.

												I start off in the sand kingdom.  I recruit some peasants to my cause.  We feed on bands of other peasants.  Some of my peasants die.  But that's okay because peasants of the world multiply.From the ashes of my dead, warriors are born.  I have an army.  I recruit special characters.  They slaughter with glee.  I have herps on my knee.I go to a castle.  I talk to a king.  I ask to be his vassal; wreak havoc I will for thee!  He laughs in my face.  I haven't won a battle!  Scolded, I flee.  I will make the sand kingdom some tea.I go to Vaegirs (lol vag).  I recruit an aging hippie tool.  He fights with a butter knife.  He tells me he looks forward to helping people in need.  Dude, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is over there.  He just ate a hair.A Vaeg lord tells me to kill all the sand peasants.  We kill them all.  Aging Hippie loses morale.  He tells me no more violence, or he will leave.  I tell him it won't happen again.  My fingers are crossed.I kill farmers, I sell slaves.  Aging Hippie tells me he will leave.  He doesn't leave.  My other recruits are like death machines.I'm commanded to storm a castle.  We kill every single sand person.  Keep in mind that most of my army is sand people.  I feel the need to remind you of this.  Some of them came from this castle.  They killed their own families.I am named lord.  Aging Hippie says he is done with me.  He still doesn't leave.  There's a glimmer in his eye.I'm level 30.  My army is unstoppable.  I go to take another castle.  I run into a bigger army.  Never saw them coming.  I don't want to sacrifice anybody.  So we fight.  In my vanity, I forgot to put on a helmet.  Crap.  I get knocked off my horse.  Level 30 and I still get killed in one hit (srlsy).  We are defeated.I get dragged around the map for like 10 minutes.  My castle is taken.  My body is dumped in the desert.  I fear all is lost.  I open the menu.  I am left with only one member of my army.  It's the Aging Hippie.  He tells me he is going to leave me.  He smiles.I understand what he wants.  I think I've known all along.  I see the glimmer in his eye.			",35,7,0,2,1,0,8

												See my full review with pics and videos at http://misstoxia.com/review-mount-blade-warband/Mount & Blade: Warband is an unique medieval fighting game presented primarily in third person. Warband has impressively combined major RTS elements with immersive third person fighting gameplay, allowing the player to not only command their own army, but fight alongside it as well.Single player features a real time ‘click-to-move’ overworld where you traverse the lands with your warband party, fighting enemy parties, visiting castles and villages for trading or recruitment and waging war on the enemy faction’s settlements. The actual fighting is done in a similar style to the Total War games, only you get to participate in the battle yourself. Once you engaged in a fight, you play as your personal character in the field of battle alongside your entire warband to fight the enemy, at this point you can give specific commands to your soldiers as you charge in  on a somewhat-valiant steed and roll some heads for yourself.Single player Warband is basically a large sandbox RPG. You don’t have any real objective or direction when you start the game, but you will generally work your way into becoming a mercenary for one of the 5 factions and help them destroy the enemy and take their castles in the name of your King. Eventually you will work your way up the ranks, swearing an oath to the King and making friends and enemies with the other vassals in your kingdom.This is when you can start to influence the actions of the kingdom. You can work together with other lords to accuse others of treason or marry into one of the many nobles of the realm which provides different benefits to male and female player characters.Sick of capturing castles for your King only to have them bestowed upon another vassal? Well you can start your own faction! Provided you are strong enough and you can support a war effort on your own, you are free to capture castles in your own name and take over Calradia for yourself! With a little convincing, those Lords you spent all that time sucking up to might even decide to renounce their oath to their King and join you…Multiplayer Warband has a rather competitive community, most servers run Battle mode which is round based combat, once you die you spectate until one team wins. Since there are 4 directions to block and attack when fighting with melee weapons, the game is quite hard to master, becoming a pro in multiplayer takes a lot of practice. You can’t just hack and slash and hope for the best, you need to pay attention to what your opponent/s are doing and act accordingly.There is also huge potential for modding, there are already loads of popular total conversion mods for Warband including 13th Century Europe mods, Musket era mods, Cowboy era mods and some fantasy style mods.Controls and player movement are very clunky, but they work exactly like they should. The game provides skill-based multiplayer and a fun single player that will give you hours upon hours of play before you get bored (I’ve played 700~ hours of Warband and have yet to ‘finish’ a single player game as my own faction). Moreover, there aren’t many games like this out there. Sure there are medieval RPGs and RTSs, but none that combine both into a fun little package that offers such freedom, not to mention the modding potential.The game universe goes far deeper than the average player might consider. The Kings and Lords and Ladies of the realm all have a relationship with one another and an attitude towards war which determines who they will pledge their allegiance too, who they will quarrel with and how they will act. Even the minor act of raiding and burning a village can have huge impacts in the game in many ways, the village will hate you (obviously), the Lord reigning over it will dislike you, the city it belongs to will suffer in terms of economy and produce less income, this could cause even more backlash to the player who may one day own these fiefs their selves. With all these variables things can become a little buggy at times, but it mostly works.There is a very intricate system at play here and the developers have really tried to capture the political and economical systems that went on in medieval Europe on a grand scale.While the graphics are a small upgrade from the original Mount & Blade, they still aren’t exactly up to scratch with the high standards of 2010 (the game's release year).The sounds of battle (weapons, war cries and death) are moderately satisfying, but there are barely any voices in the game. However there is a nice soundtrack to both the battles and while traversing across the land.There are many people out there who would find a game like this totally boring, with no given objective to complete it can be easy to get bored... Then there are people like me who come across a game like this and see the potential for adventure in a huge medieval sandbox where you can command an army, fight with your army and ultimately coordinate a war on a large scale. And for others it’s all about the multiplayer.Whether you are a fan of competitive medieval combat games, or a fan of medieval RPGs and large battles, this is definitely one to try.

Mount And Blade: WarbandA ReviewMount and Blade: Warband is actually the second game in the series with Mount and Blade without the prefix having the honor of being the first one. Originally developed by 2 people it is now a full fledge  game developement studio. Essentially Mount and Blade: Warband is a 3rd/1st person rpg, scalable infantry/squad/empire management game that allows you to largely  play as whatever you want to be which, if I want to give an example includes things like burning down many villages as a brigand, becoming a mercenary for hire, becoming a trader, or even start your own kingdom to compete with the big fishes in the pond. Alright onto the review I suppose. Optimization & ControlsControls are excellent and everything can be remapped according to your wishes and whims. Well almost everything since the map controls are locked. Don't even try to play it with a controller. It has way too much buttons for the poor thing and I would laugh at you if you even try.This is an ancient game and it was released back in 2010 so it might surprise you to hear that it has an extensive option menu that is too numerous for me to list down but rest assure that even the weakest of ultrabook could reliably run this game at 60 fps.GraphicsIs♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm sorry but there is no other way to say this other than the fact that the graphic is completely, fully a pile of terrible, muddy, and stiff textured with animations having few variations and NPC lacking any either with lords and villagers rotating to see you if you engage them in conversation. The overworld map lacks detail and well, lets just say that graphics is not something this game has.But the weapons are oh so very shiny and reflective if you turn it all the way up. Woo. Also it does not matter much for this game since the core gameplay is what carries it forward.MusicAmbient musics is just there to fill the void of silence rather than to enhance the mood with no form of dynamic music system in place at all. But the battle music sometimes fit and sometimes doesn't. Meanwhile sound effects sounds like someone took a duffel bag and swing it repeatedly in front of the mic with no metallic noises at all except when steel clashes against shields. Hardly any variation when people are screaming bloody murder shuffling up towards you trying to cut you up with the results being 20 people all yelling the same noises over and over again like ""wheaaaaaaaaaaa!"" It's funny.GameplayLets start from the botton. You have your player character, a bunch of stats that you determined by choosing the option at start which you can add on when you level up, your mount, your blade and weapon, and an overworld map to explore. In the overworld map you can move around and find warband of lords and bandits moving around and affecting the world without your help. In this mode you can just go around and find a city or town or engage a warband I don't know just approach something to do anything. You can also access inventory, party, journal and etc etc in this mode.In town, villages and castle you can choose to go into 3rd person mode and explore [although there's nothing really to find except the Guild Master who is not marked in the menu and is essential for your later career so go at least once to find him. He's in every town] or just browse for stuff to do using the option menu. Buy, sell, trade, enter tournament, go to see the annoying lords up to you really.Now for the fun part. When you first enter a battle you will probably consist of less than 10-20 people and you will most likely die attacking, blocking in the thick of it with sieges carrying a wonderful 90% mortality rate [awful ladder] but later on you can command hundreds of men doing sieges and assaulting other lords.And that is the gist of warband. You start from the lowliest of scrubs and work your way up the ladder recruiting companions, training troops and starting your own kingdom or become a vassal to an existing one. Or play whatever way you want I don't care. All in all incredibly in depth and you should probably give it a try at least once.Conclusion and Mods I made a mod list which you can view which greatly enhances the base game with many stuff to do and improvement. At the very least use the first mod because it changes the battle size amount. In conclusion warband is an extremely fun to play with infantry and empire sim but only if it clicks with you. It did for me and while it might sound bias I'm going to go ahead and give it an excellent rating simply because I haven't seen another game like it. Is it worth your money? Yes it probably is.Mod list - http://pastebin.com/SW60XeUJScoring Methology:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: S-Rank Wait no it is slightly buggy and the dialogues are terrible so B-RankCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!No drama, Just Reviews ",369,114,11,51,52,1,74

												I have played approximately 75h of this game (spread out over PC and PS4) so I believe I'm able to provide at least some honest feedback. To preface it, yes, I indeed recommend buying this game. But it certainly isn't for everyone. If you expect a low-fi For Honor (or Dynasty Warriors) with huge, dynamic action battle scenarios, you'll probably be somewhat disappointed. While battles with potentially hundreds of units (and you somewhere in the middle) are in fact an important part of M&B:W, they have to be tackled in context, as it were.Because building a large force in this game isn't a matter of clicking ""Hire 150 dragoons"". You have to visit villages, recruit peasants, train them over the course of dozens of encounters, feed them, pay them, promote them and keep them     happy. Recruited 500 peasants in a matter of mere weeks? Well, you'll probably find yourself without provisions and the financial means to keep them sustained.Mount & Blade: Warband is a slow affair. You (usually) start out as a tiny speck of dirt on the tapestry that is politics and nobility. You'll have to fight in dozens of tournaments, deliver letters, hunt down criminals and travel all across the continent to deliver goods to even be considered worthy of pledging yourself to a lord. And even then you'll have to work hard to be finally granted your first fief, which is usually some starved backwater hovel no other lord could be bothered with managing. If you make it past this stage, you might just enter the stage of the game where stuff gets somewhat like Game of Thrones - because now you might actually be someone. You'll be courting women, befriending lords (potentially betraying them), aligning yourself with one of the kingdoms (potentially betraying them) and go on military campaigns with your fellow armies. And this is the stage where M&B becomes truly epic and all the (sometimes literal) chores will pay off. There's nothing like leading your cavalry squadron around an enemy army's flank to take them in a pincer attack, all the while your archers darken the skies with a hail of arrows and screaming hordes of axemen roll across the plains.

												Potential for endless fun, warband can be extremely unforgiving for the inexperienced. The game holds your hand for only the very beginning and full freedom to pillage or protect empires is available at a very early stage, something that is appreciated when starting new campaigns after having learned the game but can be tricky in the very beginning. With the potential to build massive armies and conquer Castles and Cities alike, I feel like even those that are not too familiar with videogames can be fascinated by it's possibilities, historical accuracy and mechanics.Overall it's an great game that stood the test of time and can provide hours of fun providing you look past the old graphics and somewhat clunky mechanics by today's standards.

												Really one of the best sandbox games I've ever played. Every once in a while I stop playing it because I'm too busy, but I always keep coming back to try and conquer all the land!Combat is fun, the mechanics are fresh and actions have consequences, you can invent your own little stories and have your companions accompany you in your adventures. Some of your companions will get along, some of them won't, everything ends up feeling alive.This is one of the few games that I just keep playing over and over out of pure enjoyement.

												Warband is a unique type of rpg: it has no story at all. The sandbox nature of Warband allows you to freely juggle between all of its gameplay aspects at will. You can: trade as a merchant, serve as a vassal in 1 of the 6 medieval kingdoms (and change your allegiance as you desire), fight at tournaments for glory and gold, court noble ladies in secret, in hope of gaining influence in high society, guard caravans and work for guilds, own productive enterprises, become a lord of villages, castles and even cities, dedicate your life to protecting poor and defenseless, serve as a cynical mercenary, killing without question or hesitation, be a cunning and power hungry  manipulator, starting civil wars and pulling the strings from the shadows, become a renowned marshal, known for his military prowess and tactical genius, rob villages and caravans as lawless brigand, become a confidant to powerful lords and kings, or, if you re truly worthy, ascend as an emperor of the known world yourself. The best part is that you can be all those things AT THE SAME TIME. Role playing in warband is more of a metaphysical concept that in most RPGs, meaning that you don't just play a role in a given situation or a plot, but rather create the situation for role playing yourself.  I struggle to remember a lot of games with this level of role playing  freedom and immersion. The combat is something else entirely. Deceptively simple,  frighteningly realistic: it takes skill and practice to win a fight against superior number of foes. 3-4 is manageable, 7-10 is a suicide. The  customization is as deep as the ocean: one handed arms, two handed, pole arms, shields, bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, battle horses, the list goes on and on...Rpg system is robust and flexible: horse archery, tracking, knowledge of medicine or siege weaponry, trading or tactics...There is no story in warband. No predetermined path. Except the one that you create for yourself. You are the master of your own fate. And what a glorious fate that is!			",120,77,2,49,17,0,22

Posted: May 20, 2016
												     Mount and Blade: Warband and all of the its expansions and mods has brought me some of the most enjoying moments I have ever had in a videogame. From the brutal medieval battles of class Warband to the 19th century warfare that is Napoleonic Wars, the game never failed to keep me coming back to the battlegrounds for more. This is mostly due to its easy to learn, but hard to master combat system, and its various game modes, factions, classes, and maps. There are six different factions: Swadia, Nords, Sarranid Sultanate, Khergit Khanate, Rhodoks, and Vaegirs. Each faction specializes in their own respective areas. Swadia have very strong heavy cavalry, Nords specialize in having the strongest infantry with the best shields and massive two handed axes that cut through enemy shields and armor like butter. The Sarranid Sultanate is a nice blend of both cavalry and light archers, the Khergit Khanate are the only faction to be affective with horse archers which can be a nightmare to fight if they aren’t approached properly. Rhodoks are renowned for their sharp spearmen and crossbows and the Vaegirs are master archers with pinpoint accuracy even at the greatest distances. The three different classes offer many tactical options and deciding what you yourself want to specialize in along with the rest of your party can be quite thought provoking at times.     Single player is a pure joy to play through and being that it is an open world RPG sandbox that you can play around in, you will find that there is a ton of replay value here. Whether it’s the level up system that can be quite overwhelming at first, the pros and cons of the different factions, or the people you meet along the way and the relationships that you form with them, you will always find a reason to hit that “Start a new game” button and play again, but in a completely different way.     Multiplayer is also quite in depth and a very dedicated community has formed around it. You will be able to find both casual and competitive players who still play regularly. Multiplayer consists of eight different game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Battle, Capture the Flag, Fight and Destroy, Conquest, Siege, and Duel.     -Deathmatch has you thrown into immediate chaotic action against other players in an all out brawl where it’s every man and woman for themselves. Actions happen very quickly, damage is high and health is quite low so at any moment anyone could die regardless of how skilled they are. It is a great game mode if you don’t have a lot of time to play, but just want to get in some quick instant action against players of varying skill levels.     -Team Deathmatch is very similar to Deathmatch in that you are thrown right into the thick of the action with no objective, but to kill the enemy at all costs. The difference here is that you have a team to work with and so does the enemy. Coordination is key here unless you are lucky enough to have a few players on your team that are experienced and can cleave through the enemy players.     -Battle is similar to Team Deathmatch except for the fact that in battle you only get one life per round which adds great tension to each round individually. At first having one life per round can be quite frustrating especially when you’re one of the first people to die before any of the main fighting begins, but overtime you will more than likely grow to like this one life based game mode as it makes you play more carefully and tactfully than you would in Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch.     -Capture the Flag is quite standard, it’s the same as any other Capture the Flag really. You and the enemy team each have your own flags and your goal is to retrieve their flag and bring it back to your base without letting them get yours. Short, sweet and to the point.     -Fight and Destroy has two teams put against each other, one faction will be tasked with defending valuable objectives while the other team attacks those objectives in an attempt to destroy them.     -Conquest is a real test of a team’s ability to work as a unit. In this game mode each team has to capture and hold key points on the map for a set amount of time while they fight it out with a limited number of lives.     -Siege is the ultimate test of a team’s tactical capabilities on the battlefield. This is easily the most difficult game mode when there are 60+ players on a siege server. One team plays as the defenders who attempt to hold a keep of massive proportions, while the other team plays as the attackers who raid the castle to try and capture it within a set period of time. It is easily the most brutal, bloody, nonsensical and downright gritty game mode that Mount and Blade Warband has to offer. Players of all skill levels participate in sieges and even if one team has veterans it will not guarantee them victory, because there is greater strength in numbers and coordination than one elite player going solo and killing as many people as he can. This game mode comes down to pure team work and pushing enemy fortifications in the right way as the attackers and defending those fortifications as the defenders. Often times classes play a major role in this game mode as every class has its own role to fulfill. For defense inept archers can generally mean instant spelled defeat if their infantry are not solid and. For offense having poor infantry who don’t do coordinated pushes as a group will also end up losing more than half the time. As attackers Siege has the many factors and rules that come into play with how you need to approach the enemy fortress to win and if you don’t follow said parameters then you’re going to die. . . A lot. Overall though it is still my 2nd favorite game mode and I have spent a great deal of time playing it with friends and flying solo from time to time.     -Duel is in my opinion the most personal and most in depth game mode that Mount and Blade Warband has to offer and I quite frankly find it to be the best. In duel you fight another player in a one on one fight with any weapon of your choice and any class of your choice, but typically it’s infantry with a one-handed weapon, two-handed weapon or a polearm with no shield. Whether you are dueling for honor, fun, or just to win, duel has something to offer for every player in the game. It is also the best game mode for learning about how melee combat works. At the time of this review the majority of my playtime in the game has been on duel and it still has yet to disappoint me to the point where I don’t want to play it. At a high level of play duel is the most fast paced and reaction based part of the game. The margin for error is minimal and one mistake often leads to death especially when using the two-handed Great Sword, which is the preferred weapon of choice in duel. Dueling is a progression through the game’s melee combat. You will first run around like an idiot as you try to figure out how somebody who is experienced at the game keeps killing you in a few seconds without you getting a chance to even swing, but overtime you will begin to understand exactly how the game’s mechanics work. First you will learn to recognize visual cues from your opponent and then you will learn to block. Once through that stage you will learn to feint and how to attack properly without leaving yourself completely open. Then you will learn about footwork, different feinting methods, chambering and several other aspects of the game’s melee combat and if you’re lucky you will find a mentor to help you learn it all.     At its core the game is brutal and unforgiving at the worst of times and at the best of times it can be the most rewarding game on the planet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount and Blade: Warband is a tremendous medieval sandbox game.The graphics are dated, there is no storyline, the kingdom management is obnoxious and I bounced off it several times before finally pushing through.The combat is the most fun I've had in any melee-centric game, and after playing Warband I've not been able to return to games like Skyrim. In particular, the mounted combat (especially with a lance or polearm) is insanely fun. Warband nails the importance of momentum, and nothing in gaming can feel better than landing a couched lance on an enemy at full speed, instantly dismounting (if you aimed poorly) or killing them.The tactical aspect is fun but not fleshed out. There were very few times when I ever had to change my standard battle plans. Find a slope, put your archers at the top and a thin line of infantry halfway up, then let your archers wreak havoc on the enemy while your infantry slows them down and prevents them from getting in range of the archers. If your army composition is different, then obviously you'll have to have a different tactic. In Vanilla Warband there are no open field battles you can't win with an adequate amount of Swadian knights immediately charging and demolishing anything that stand in their wake.Sieges are fun but limited. Vanilla only has a couple of different types of maps, and they're almost always identical in terms of how the battles work. The ladders (or siege towers) create an extraordinarily narrow chokepoint at the entrance to the walls, meaning that if you are moderately decent at the combat, you can realistically hold off an army 4-5 times your size by standing at the top of the ladder and bopping the enemy heads one by one while your archers (preferably Rhodok crossbowmen) make pincushions out of the men climbing the ladder. Alternatively, you can just jump down the ladder and start hacking and slashing the backs of the men climbing the ladder, surrounded by the entire enemy army but basically unstoppable. Sieging castles requires a little more strategy, but not by much.But the real reason why I've played so many hours of Warband is the modding scene. Warband mods are tremendous, Prophesy of Pendor is a light fantasy setting with significantly larger enemy armies, better balancing between unit types, and  much stronger units in general. I've had battles against armies of over 7k enemies, they lasted hours but were extraordinarily rewarding. I highly recommend it. If you're interested in something closer to histical accuracy, Anno Domini 1257 offers a painstaking recreation of 13th century Europe. Brytenwalda offers a harsh (thoroughly researched) vision of Dark Ages Britain, The Last Days sets you in the Lord of the Rings' universe, and Gekokoju gives you Sengoku era Japan. If you want more of an enhanced Vanilla experience, Floris and Silverstag both offer tremendous reworks of balance, kingdom management, diplomacy, and more. And if you're a fan of D&D, Phantasy Calradia overhauls the Vanilla world to include your standard D&D races, weapons, and offers a tremendous spellcasting system as well. Each of the mods I mentioned could easily be played for hundreds of hours a piece before seeing all they have to offer, and I've just barely scratched the surface of the modding scene. While Warband won't be dropping any jaws with its graphics and many of the mid-late game management systems are opaque, the combat an incredibly amount of fun and Warband offers a modder's playground that will have you hooked for years. Despite my general distaste for third person and melee combat, I would not hesitate to rank Warband as one of my favourite games of all time. I'd recommend it even if you refuse to mod, but when you install mods it becomes a truly amazing experience.			",140,26,2,47,19,1,30

												A masterpiece that's a little rough around the edges. If you can overcome the slightly frustrating learning curve and master the controls, Warband offers a unique, rich, and enduring experience matched by very few titles. Thanks to the great efforts of the modding community, the game is constantly reinventing itself in exciting ways. One of the best titles on Steam. Period.			",113,21,1,21,19,2,12

												I've been all over the Steam store and I've been playing PC games since the 80's, with a particular interest in the medieval eras. You won't find a game that allows you more freedom in a sandbox medieval setting than this. This can be one of the best games you'll ever play, if you are adventurous and enjoy making up your own scenarios and backstories. If a guided experience is more your vibe, this won't be your cup of tea because it has no main quest line or any real defined goals outside of being your character.Gameplay is fantastic and the combat is intuitive, with a variety of modifiers should any aspect be too easy or too hard for personal taste. The menus are a little lacking and can be confusing to navigate, but a few hours of play and it comes together. The variety of weapons is great, and having taken the time to read up on how to command troops in battle I feel that while it isn't immediately accessible it isn't terribly obtuse, either.As if the core game for the price wasn't enough, the mod scene is amazing. Try North South and fight in the American Civil War. Prefer playing in a low fantasy Europe setting? Sure, there are mods for that. Vikings? Bryntwalda. Or maybe you prefer Lord of the Rings as a setting? Yup. That and Game of Thrones both have mods that allow you to truly inhabit these worlds as anyone from a peasant to the highest of Kings. And there are many, many more.The only thing I see dethroning this as medieval sim king anytime soon is Mount & Blade: Bannerlord.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

NOTE:This will include my review of the first Mount & Blade game and the stand-alone expansion Warband as they are basically the same game with added features.INTRODUCTION:Mount & Blade is the type of game you probably won't see being advertised on TV or on popular internet websites. It's one of those titles who's popularity is mainly spread by word of mouth and by player recommendations based on the game's merits.Released back in 2008, developed by TaleWorlds Game and published by Paradox Interactive (known usually for grand strategy games), Mount & Blade is a very unique title who combines the freedom of Sandbox RPGs, the action of First and Third-Person combat, with the micromanagement of Strategy and Simulation games.PROS:+ Innovative Combat Mechanic: -First-Person / Third-Person Medieval Combat action. This was the first game to introduce me on proper directional attack combat. Mouse directionality will dictate how effective your strikes will be and mastering it will require a lot of practice, especially during mounted combat.+ YOUR OWN ADVENTURE: -The player is free to make his own adventure. The world is as OPEN as it can get. From a lowly nameless adventurer, fight to be a great Lord, a great General, Mercenary, Bandit, Merchant, Soldier, King or any combination thereof...+ Your own ARMY (or Warband): -This game provides the closest experience on the thrill of commanding an army in a game. Train your peasants to be the most elite of soldiers until every Lord in the realm seeks your services.+ Companion System: -You can hire peasants and train them to deadly warriors, but you also encounter additional 'companions' during your self made adventure. At first I thought these were just beefed up AI soldiers with special names but was pleasantly surprised that each character had their own personalities and their own traits. They fight against each other over petty arguments and tend to either approve or disapprove of your decisions as the leader. + Very Active and Dedicated Modding Community: The modding community, along with support from the developers, vastly improves the game's overall quality, not just in graphics, but also in other aspects such as sounds, music, game mechanic, world design or even a whole new theme (LOTR, Game of Thrones, etc.). Installing a mod for this game is highly recommended.CONS:- Art Design (Graphics, Sounds, etc.): -Lets be honest...looking at the screenshots will say this is not the most graphically advanced game out there. Animation, lighting, sound, music and character models are acceptable at best. (Mods improves this a lot.)- Needs a bit more NPC: -Aside from enemies, the friendly or neutral NPCs that you encounter are not as extensive as I would have hoped. The Cities seem rather small with very minimal activity from the citizens which makes some of the towns and castles a bit 'empty'. Would be nice to have more populated towns where you can get more side quest and requests for help.- No Advance battle-planning: -The game randomly chooses which troops you are deployed with. This is without the benefit of pre-deployment formations. Although the player can quickly rally his troops in a solid battle formation before the enemy closes in, the inclusion of a pre-battle strategy or deployment would have helped a lot.- Siege Battle is weak: -Most of the castles or towns will only have one pre-determined breach on the wall or a ladder that was already set up for you. I would personally like it if I were able to deploy siege weapons on my own and deploy them where I want them instead of being forced down a bottleneck.- Diplomacy and Political Intrigue is a bit shallow: -Aside from the squabble of the Lords and Ladies in the courts, there's not much going on around the political aspect of the game.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but for a niche market. The word 'Innovation' has been constantly used lately that it almost lost its meaning, but here we have Mount & Blade, a game which truly tried, and succeeded, in making a new, fun, immersive and enjoyable experience. MUST BUY for STRATEGY GAMERS who also happen to like RPG games.If you're the type of gamer who claims to value gameplay over graphics, then here is a game that will test that assertion.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a first sequel to original medieval action RPG video game Mount & Blade. Warband was developed by TaleWorlds and was published by Paradox Interactive. This highly anticipated indie video game won numerous rewards and also was nominated “Best Indie Game of the Year“.While most RPGs with medieval time setting involving magical events, supernatural entities, Warband strikes you with realistic combat without any fireball spells.  Mount & Blade: Warband is a mix of action RPG and turn-based strategy games. You travel on world map as in turn-based strategy game and fight or explore villages and cities in third-person or first-person perspective. In Mount & Blade: Warband your goal is simple: rule all of the Calradia. You start as a simple mercenary but later you can become faithful vassal or even the king. While there is no actual story other than rule Calradia, you can do various quest to earn gold and improve relations with other lords or cities. Quest differs from simply delivering goods to capturing enemy lords.There are total 24 different skills which you can improve by leveling up. You get experience points from battles or doing quest. Those skills affect how you perform in actual battles, travelling in world map, trading, maintaining your army. Graphics are not top quality but in won't prevent you from enjoying the game. In fighting mode you can command your troops with simple tasks such as follow, stand ground, charge and to choose what type of weapon to use. Every field battle usually turns into over 100 troop mosh-pit and picking the retreating enemy troops one by one. City and castle sieges or defenses can be more enjoyable as you can explore city or castle. After capturing or being awarded a fief you can improve it with new building which gives you various bonuses, for example, you can start a production to earn more additional gold. Also Mount & Blade: Warband can be enhanced by various mods from simple textures to total conversions.The main difference from the original Mount & Blade is the multiplayer. Default number of players is up to 64. Modded servers can hold more than 200! Game modes include well-known Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Assault (similar to conquest mode seen in Battlefield series) and also Siege (where you need to capture or defend a castle), Battle (last standing man wins) and Duel (one to one combat).To sum up, I would recommend Mount & Blade: Warband to anyone who always imagined what it would feel to actually be in a medieval battle not just command your troops from above. Multiplayer mode with various maps both official and fan made can keep you logged in for a long amount of time and total conversion content will enrich your singleplayer experience.

												Wonderful - all be it a bit square - sandbox game. Start your own warband in a medival world and emerge as a glorious leader, lord, king, bandit, trader...you name it.Choose your destiny amongst 6 unique factions each of them with their own mentality and troops, or assemble a mighty army from all realms, be a trader or mercenary to a faction or become vassal to a King or even become a King yourself - choices are nigh infinite. You can replay this game an infinite amount of times with different settings and it will remain interesting, and on top of that you can modify certain aspects of the game or go for one of the many mods out there ranging from all kinds epoches and additions (i must admit that M&B 1 fares a little better what regards the amount and quality of mods released).There are some downers:You will experience clipping and other graphic absurdities every now and then, it is not perfect.The AI is a bit dumb-witted at times, in terms of field movements and tactical behaviour - the latter does not really exist actually, it is just troops spawning running towards one another and starting to beat each other up, it is up to you to be better than them.There is a saying that ""a lot of good work is lost over the lack of a little more"", this is found to be true here as the grid for many diplomatic and military game options is actually present - it is just not used well by the vanilla game and left for modders to patch up.The modders in turn often work on their own vision of how the game should be but then lacking the manpower to achieve their conveyed goals.Good examples for this might be the ""Sword of Damocles""-Series which is wonderful yet stricken with bugs on M&B 1, and in a seemingly eternal unfinished-we-are-working-on-it-but-play-this-in-the-meantime process on M&B:Warband.Taleworld wanted to encourage modding for this game, but failed to provide an easily accessible scripting interface for modders to work with. This results in a game that is never 100% satisfying in vanilla, and a bunch of mods that aim to provide that satisfaction but fail half-way due to lack of manpower.Nevertheless i must say i enjoy this game tremendously glad i bought it (M&B Package) as it offers a completly different feel of gaming compared to most more action-oriented games these days. No big explosions or noisy shooting and blurred vision and other mess, just a nice game with nice and sometimes funny NPCs and an eye for the neat things in life as well as a semi-realistic view on what life and war in medival ages might have been like.8/10			",41,2,0,16,5,0,10

												This game is my favorite game, before using Steam I pirated it, I have no shame about this, and it's one of the games that made me go legit and buy every game instead of pirating them, just for supporting the developers.I don't think I can add in this review anything that isn't covered in any other review. I just love this game, its world, and its characters, the mods also overhauls the game and makes it even better (Floris is the best in my honest opinion).Strategy, combat, logistics, trading, a jack of all trades, and a master of them all. I love it.			",265,42,11,41,38,1,25

												Without even thinking about it, Warband is the best value for money game I have ever purchased.  Having clocked around 300 hours or so now, and having managed, finally, to rule all of calradia on normal difficulty, I'm taking a break. I may play a little more before the release bannerlord which if warband is anything to go by should be incredible. If it isn't I will be immensely disappointed.A few things:Sieges do not work especially well owing to the limitations of the AI. In order to stop your troops getting glitched out behind staircases or running facefirst into castle walls whilst being shot to death by archers, you do need to utilise the commands, which are far too basic to suit complex situations in which you find yourself. Avoid frustration by expecting them to be a bit crap from the offset. Your soldiers are prone to doing stupid chit and sometimes they're going to do it, which make some battles turn into monty python skits.Don't give your followers lands and titles early in the game, if at all.  If they defect from your faction, you cannot get them back unless you wind up conquering all of Calradia.Moreoever if you defeat them in a battle, you cannot even incarcerate them in a dungeon. This is a big problem as their party skills are extremely helpful and beneficial to your overall gameplay. Swadian knights are on balance the best troops for field battles  followed by sarranid mamlukes. However, slaver chiefs are vastly superiror to both if you're trying to capture enemies for recruitment purposes. These are the leveled version of manhunters.For sieges: You want Nord huscarls, and rhodok sharpshooters ( failing this, swadian sharpshooters or vaegir marksman).Tip: Do NOT loot and plunder villages, as low and hostile standings with villages will mean you are unable to recruit from them. It's very easy to tank your standing with a village, and much harder to win it back--doing this involves boring, annoying quests ( like herding cattle, which is a royal PITA.DO NOT USE THE AUTOSAVE OPTION! This is known to cause a 'no string error' that effectively ruins your entire saved progress as it resets all your skill points back to zero without giving you the option to re-spend them. It basically wipes your character back to the starting level. I lost about 40 hours this way during my initial playthrough. Always, always manually save.The reputation system which works well for the most part does become virtually impossible to balance as you accrue more lords to fight for you over time, apportion territories and try to to balance interpersonal disputes. Again, this is an old game, and the sophistication of AI relfects Its vintage. It's a problem, but a forgivable one, all said and done. Hit detection in this game is perfect, and you're not. Expect to find yourself saying 'how the ♥♥♥♥ did that possibly ♥♥♥♥ing miss' quite a lot at first. I recoomend turning the battle speed up to highest as, for whatever reason, the game just seems to prefer it this way mechanically. It's just better.Make sure you turn the number of troops per battle up to maximum also; failure to do this will, when facing a large enemy army, result in you spawning on the field with 10 troops and the enemy with over a hundred, and you will get roflstomped. The game will always fill to max capacity with AI troops, not yours.For all its imperfections, bugs and general datedness Warband really is an immensely satisfying and enjoyable game that is well worth purchasing--especially given that you can pick it up for about the price of a happy meal most of the time. Nothing to lose here.Score:8/10			",29,8,0,4,6,1,2

												Mount and Blade: Warband is one of the most addictive on the Steam cilent you can get, Yeah it maybe rough around the edges (aka the graphics) but at it's core contains so much charm. The game is based on a medieval contient in which you're thrown in to do, well, whatever you want really. Become a king of the land, a loyal vassel, a peaceful merchent, a traditor, and more. It's truly open-ended with you choosing the story that you want for it. The game also contains one of the best combat systems with sword fighting in awhile. It's simple with it's up, down, left, right fighting system but laborious to master. Timing your attacks and blocks in the exact right order as you predict your enemey movements is not as easy as you think. Now, onto my favourite part of the game, the modding. The modding is extremely talented and large. With anything you could think of. Romans, check. Samurai, check. The First World War, also check. Greco-Persian Wars, check and so much more. Also, the mulitplayer is damn fun with a large varity of gamemodes that will have you hacking and slashing other players for hours on end as well as a pretty freindly playerbase. Now, time for the cons that I came across while playing this game. The first, you may notice, is the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics. Another thing is a lack of a proper tutorial and due to how wide and expansive this game can be, it is kind of requried so players would know what to do a bit more. And lastly, the quests, dear god aren't they basic. It's literally ""go kill that guy"", ""save this town from bandits"", etc. It's truly something that annoys the hell out of me. And other than that, I can't think of no real issues (well besides the mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI but that can be fixed with the Brainy Bots mod)PROS-Amazing Combat System-Great Modding Community-Open-Ended-Addictive-Great Mutiplayer-Replayabilty-Will Steal Your LifeCONS-Graphics-No real tutorial-Repetitve and boring quests-Annoying and stupid AIOverall score for this game is a 9.5/10. One of the better games I have played but it's still flawed and can use improvement that will hopefully be in Bannerlord.P.S From what I heard, you should probably not get the game on Linux or IOS, there seems to be constant crashing on those two versions for some reason.

												The lords had assembeled at Praven. They had just finished a campaign and were at one of Harlaus's many bountiful feasts. They had little to worry about, seeing as the Sarranids were waging successful warfare against the Rhodoks and Khergits to the south and west. The Swadians had gained more lands under the newest campaign, in which Count Delinard and Harlaus divided up forces and lead groups of nobles about the Vaegir countryside, and took the area from Reyvadin to Khudan. The rest of the already weakened and disorganised Vaegirs were easy pickings for the newfound ally of Swadia, the Nords. The Lords still had one pressing issue: Who would own Ayyike, the village to the south of Khudan? It was hard to tell, as it laid between Dramug Castle and the City of Reyvadin. Harlaus himself had taken Reyvadin, Delinard, the Marshall, Dramug Castle. It was hard to decide, so Harlaus decided to hold a vote instead of the seeminly unusually heated debates about the fiefdom of the village. There were 20 Swadian Lords. They all voted. It was a 50-50 tie. 10 Delinard, 10 Harlaus. Lady Sonadel, Daughter of Grainwad and Wife of Lord Prescan, the new Swadian Lord after Haringoth died of old age, read them all off. The room in Praven fell silent. Not a noise could be heard in the royal hall. Some of the lords and ladies felt anguish, knowing that more needless arguments were to come over this. Harlaus knew what would happen, and decided to put an end to it. But there was one pressing issue - Harlaus, wise as he was on the inside, was a total ♥♥♥♥wad socially. Harlaus pondered at thoughts then and there, before deciding on one. Harlaus, in front of all Swadian Nobility, walked over to the table where the votes were counted in two boxes. He gathered all the Delinard-leaning votes, and placed them into a neat pile on the table. He stepped onto a stool, and then the table from that. Harlaus undid his belt, and dropped his pants and undergarments, before unleasing a torrent of Swadian Royal♥♥♥♥♥♥on the votes. The room fell silent. Harlaus, whilst still urinating on the votes, stared down Lady Sonadel, then Count Delinard in the eye. Tears began streaming from Lady Sonadel's delicate eyes, landing from her cheeks onto her fur coat. ""After consulting with the peers of the realm, King Harlaus has decided to confer Ayyike on King Harlaus."" Harlaus stepped down from the table, still naked from the waist below, and picked up the votes with his bare hands, Harlaus walked over to a nearby lantern, urine dripping from his hands, and dropped the votes in. A quick ""Hsss!"" was emitted from the urine turning to steam and the votes burning, and Harlaus wiped his hands on Delinard's beard. Harlaus put everything back on, and promptly returned to feasting with his Lords.10/10 would retake Praven again.			",171,18,2,17,24,0,27

												What in Ragnar’s name did you just ♥♥♥♥ing say about me, you little Swadian? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Sargoth Axe Throwing Academy. I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Swadian land and I have over 300 confirmed rapes. I am trained in pillaging and I am the top axe thrower in the king’s shieldwall. You are nothing to me but just another peasant. I will murder you with savagery the likes of which has never been seen before on Calradia, mark my ♥♥♥♥ing runes.

												Mount & Blade: Warband is an incredibly addicting and absorbing medieval game.There's no set path or goal except for that which you make yourself, allowing one to advance through the game perpetually hunting and killing bandits as the head of a ruthless body of sellswords, or to start your own nation and proceed to announce war on everyone because you see it fit. The combat is exciting to partake in, notably when you get to larger battles with more units on the ground. In my opinion it's worth the full price.ps if you go into a tournament and get a jousting stage, keep calm and realize that this might take a long time			",215,36,1,22,26,3,25

												Pros:+ Amazing gameplay/combat, no matter how you play.+ Be whoever you want, craft your own story with very few limits.+ Quite expansive, with insane replayability.+ Epic value for the price.+ Help another empire grow, or start your own and conquer everyone else! *Muahaha!*Cons:- Graphically, does not look very good at (most) times.- Starting out can be a little tough.- Can be really difficult/unforgiving at times.- Is so addicting, you'll forget what the sun looks like.Honestly, it's great. It may not look the best at times, but it more than makes up for it in the combat and large scale battles.Overall, I would highly recommend this game.			",89,11,0,20,3,0,3

												M&B: Warband is a great game. I remember playing the first M&B and falling in love. I was invested in my army more than I ever was in any other army in any other game. When I talk about this game, I always mention that one time when one of my elite bodyguards beautifully saved my life during a siege, but then when I turned to him to say thank you, an arrow pierced his head ... it was dramatic and I loved it!

												i could write a review of this game, but so many other people have written exactly what i would say. so, i'll just leave a recipe for a breakfast omelette:you will need:3 eggsa tablespoon of milk4 bacon stripscheese1 potato1/4 red onionsalt, pepper, garlic powder, cayanne pepper(a dash of each)cooking oilStart off by dicing your potato and onion into little bits, then dropping that into a medium skillet with some oil. cook over a med-high flame, stirring frequently so that the potatos don't burn. salt lightly. takes about 15 minutes to cook. when done, the outside should be alittle crunchy, the inside moist. onions will blacken, thats fine. remove from heat and set aside to dry in some paper towels or coffee filters. Next, start the bacon, just plop that in a skillet and cook it for 3 minutes, flip, cook for 2 more minutes then add to your potatos.While the potatoes are cooking, you can start to prepare your eggs. just crack all 3 into a cup, add the milk and seasonings you want. mix it up so its a uniform yellow. get a medium skillet warmed up. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! the fire MUST NOT be too high or YOU WILL BURN THE OMELETTE! it needs to be a low flame. heat up the skillet, grease it with cooking SPRAY or butter, then drop in the egg mixture. if you didn't stir it enough you will see an egg yolk in your pan. If you do, just make scrambled eggs. If you did it right, the eggs should cook slowly. As they start to become solid on the bottom of the pan(but still runny enough to move around the pan, it will be 2 layers), add a layer of cheese over HALF of the omelette(not too much, you will add more later and the grease from the cheese will RUIN the flip). add the bacon and potatos over the cheese, then add more cheese. Once the eggs are almost completly solid, take a spatulla and start to lift up the edges around the side that is empty, this will be the side you FLIP onto the other. once you can move most of the empty side, you will put the spatulla under the middle of the empty side and GENTLY slide it all the way to the middle of the omelette. then you will lift slowly and try to create a half circle by folding one half over the other. turn off the heat and transfer it to a plate.If done right, you just made an amazing breakfast THAT WILL GET YOU LAID! Dont ever underestimate a home cooked meal. it will get you in bed with someone 99 out of 100 times. Use this power responsibly.			",23,1,0,3,0,0,2

												I believe I have enough hours on this game to write a decent review.First of all Mount & Blade: Warband is definitely not the prettiest game out there, but don't let that stop you from buying it.The singleplayer: In warband's singleplayer the main goal is to take over Calradia, you can achieve this any way you like because you are basically free to do whatever you want. You could join one of the factions (The Nords, Swadians, Rhodoks, Khergits and the Sarranids) and help them conquer Calradia. You could also create your own faction and capture every city there is by waging wars againts the other factions. You build up your army by recruiting soldiers from villages, after some battles you will have the option to upgrade them. Every faction has certain troops that are superior compared to the other factions for example The Nords have huscarls, and they are without doubt the best infantry in the game. The combat, I've read alot of mixed opinions about the combat system. Some say it's way too difficult while others say it's just a matter of blocking and slashing. In my opinion it just has a very steep learning curve, which is hard to master. There are 4 attack/block directions and plenty of weapons to chose from. (there are throwing weapons, bows, crossbows, lances etc.)Another feature is the fact that you can earn reputation through completing quests for certain lords, this can come in handy late game when you have to convince lords to do certain thing for you.  There are many more factors like right to rule, renown etc.The singleplayer also offers the options to marry, siege, recruit companions and gear them up, tournaments and much more.In my opinion what makes the singleplayer so amazing is the fact that you can control your army while also fighting yourself, it's a mix of Total War with Chivalry basically. Also the many mods keep it interesting to play.The multiplayer: When you first play the multiplayer you will get absolutely destroyed, this is because the game is old and most of the players have already played it for a long while.The multiplayer offers: Different gamemodes Custom maps Bots A maximum of 250 players on 1 server A gold system, every kill earns you gold to upgrade your gearThe community is amazing, if you have the Napoleonic Wars DLC there are regiments you could join. These regiments have trainings and events that are a ton of fun.Negatives: There are some bugs/glitches like the singleplayer map that starts to glitch out all of the sudden. The graphics aren't exactly good. A very short tutorialConclusion:I would give it a solid 9/10, old but gold!			",198,48,6,13,21,4,16

												Review for Viking Conquest (Warband DLC):I began my journey as the impoverished son of a Norse noble. Travelling from Norwegian village to village, I bought and sold enough trade goods to secure passage to Edinburgh and recruited a small Warband of Viking peasants.Working as a Mercenary for the Norse run puppet-state of Northymbre, I cleared the lands of Bandits and helped to defeat the Scottish clan of the Alt Clut.Selling all my loot, recruiting more Vikings and training them for 3 months gave me the money to buy 3 Karvi ships from various ports.Ending my contract with Northymbre, I became an armed sea-bound trader, buying wool from Scotland, wine from Frisia and furs, iron, timber and tar from Norway.Having saved enough gold to have a mighty Busse Longboat built in Bebbanburgh, I sailed for Ireland, again to take up the life of a mercenary with the Laithlind Norse.The Irish Clans proved worthy foes, Dublin was under almost constant seige. Konungr Gudrod Ragnarson proved a terrible warleader and a selfish King. So I hatched a plan.Building my relations with the Laithlind Lords and spreading vicious rumours in the taverns took two years, as well as sending my companions away to spread the word of my prowess.The Irish Clan of Mide had captured Gudrod and my Mercenary Contract had expired, the time was right. Sailing from the Orkney Isles to the Isle of Man, I turned the Lords of Laithlind to my cause and founded the Kingdom of Lochlann.Gudrod escaped his prison and returned to Dublin, just in time to see it fall to my new forces. He was defeated outside the gates and his last Lord also fell to my cause.Taking Dublin for my own, surrounded by my old Irish enemies and leading a battle-weary army, I sailed for where I began, Norway.

												Mount and Blade: Warband made my man meat throb with anticipation and upon playing for the first few minutes. I found that my feet were drenched in pools of silky man seed, permitting a cricket to sail away in a paper boat playing ""Four Seasons"" by Vivaldi. Finding this unreal and beyond any comprehension of what is known to be the mechanics of the world, I awoke to see that I was just rhythmically pumping my beefy organ to the thrusts of my character's jousting lance. I won the tournament. Buy this game.			",206,29,1,48,30,1,54

												This is my favourite game of all time!It was the first game i got and Steam, and still it is the game i play the most 90% of the time.  I have only played over a 1000 hours yet i know people who have hit over 5000.  The native/vanilla version of this game is really great.  You are in a medieval world where the possibilities are endless, you may serve a kingdom or become king yourself.  Starting with you and a few dollar you can build a huge army and form an empire.  You charge into battle with your men, its like watching a movie wher to huge armies just clash into each other and cut each other to pieces, but as this game is a sandbox it is DLC and mods that make Mount & Blade: Warband a true adventureThis game is amazing, great for those people who love roleplay, a good combat system and a great modding community.  This is especially made with the DLC Napoleonic Wars, which includes awesome historically accurate uniforms and weapons and have great events called ""Line Battles"", in which player join clans/regiments and recreate what a battle may have looked like in the early 1800s with huge lines of infantry with drummers and fifers beatting with flags flying and officers commanding, while in the distance artillery batteries will be mowing down infantry and cavalry carving up the kills.The modding is amazing, especially with the Persistent World mod and ones similar to that, with some of the greatest roleplaying i have experienced!  There are also mods which will change the native medieval world into say Westeros for example or Medieval Europe,  or even America during the civil war.  The possibilities are endless with this game and i believe it deserves more recognition.Overall i'd say this is an amazing game with great possibilities, and i'm just waiting for the next Mount & Blade installment, Bannerlord. You will notice Warband has dated graphics, but to be honest when you get into the gameit doesnt bother yoy what so ever.Get this game u won't regret it!10/10			",15,0,0,4,0,0,9

You can choose whatever kind of class you want to become and conquer Calradia.Specialy thanks to a lot of modules, its even more fun to play the SP.Also the Multiplayer mode is awesome. Native (vanila) is specialy very good for newbies. For more challenge, there have been made plenty of modules like Persistent World and Mercenaries.			",25,1,0,3,8,0,18

												In the couple days that I have owned this game, here is what I've determined.On a ten point scale:Gameplay: 10Graphics: 8Reliability: 9Replay value: 10Multiplayer: 10Length: 10Overall: 10I don't even choose to factor in the graphics or how reliable the game is, because in the whole picture, it really doesn't matter. The gameplay is fun, there's action literally everywhere you go. The battles are intense, and not too long but not too short. It is difficult for your first time. You might get frustrated and quit. Yet, there's this unknown lure bringing you right back to get destroyed once again. In addition to this, the game has great mods. Tons of them, too. A lot of them actually make the gameplay better.The graphics are slightly outdated, but the game is still playable. This isn't even an issue, as I think they might've done it on purpose to increase the amount of people who can play it. Whatever the case may be, the graphics really don't matter enough here for people to turn away from the game.Reliability loses a point because multiple people have reported crashing when you alt-tab. Switching out of the game and back in safely is important to quite a few people, so I think this is something that should be addressed by the developers. Besides that, I haven't actually crashed or encountered any bugs at all yet, so again, I didn't factor this one in either.The game has an excellent replay value. There is about a million different ways to play the game. I'm not kidding, either. It would be too much for me to explain here. See for yourself! There are also, as mentioned above, many mods to pick and choose from, increasing this value even more.Multiplayer. I haven't actually played it yet, but I have quite a few friends who play this that have reported that it is amazing. I can only assume it receives a 10 as well.For the length of the game, it can really go for as short as you'd like, to as long as you want. Start out a serf, fight a couple battles, then retire? Go ahead. Want to play a 1,000 hour marathon of the game where you slowly conquer the entire land? Probably possible, maybe with the help of mods. I don't know if the game would even still be stable beyond that point, or perhaps there would be nothing left to conquer, but really I shouldn't be expecting more than this. But yeah, if you fancy an actual medieval simulator, or perhaps a really fun game, get this one. It is worth it.			",54,6,2,5,24,1,27

You don't like the Middle Age... no problem, you can buy DLC's and switch to the time of Vikings or even to the Napoleonic Wars.

												Stay with me on this one. This is a tale of victory, of betrayal, of revenge, and of consequence.I was but a simple lord with a simple goal. To make the Kingdom of the Nords the most powerful kingdom Caldaria had ever seen. I fought alongside my king and fellow lords as equals on the battlefields, and many a heroic battle was fought and won. I asked for very little, but my own slew of personal conquests saw fit to reward me with personal lands. I accepted these fiefs with grace, and invested all of my time, money, and effort into making sure my villages prospered and were safe from enemy attacks.And that's when it all went bad.It was a day, much like any other day. I was scouting around my castle for enemy lords who would dare assault me. That's when my weekly budget came in. I gave it a quick glance, and almost tossed it aside when I noticed some error; a village was missing. For a moment, I was confused. Had my messenger tower failed, and my village been raided without my knowledge? No, that cannot be, the village would still be listed. Bewildered, I investigated the cause of this discrepancy on the world map, and noticed that the castle to which my village belonged to was no longer allied to the Nords, but the Rhodoks. How could this be? We were not at war with them at the time, so how did this happen? As I investigated further, I found the cause of my problems.Jarl Gearth. Or, as he is now known, 'Count' Gearth.This weaselly dastard has always rubbed me the wrong way, and now all my suspicions had paid off in a most unfortunate manner. He had defected from the Kingdom of the Nords and allied himself with the Rhodoks. With him, he took all the castles he had owned, and with the castles went their adjoining villages. As such, Tadsamesh now belonged to the Rhodoks, and along with it, all my effort. It seemed to me, as a lord who was bound by honor, that there was only one course of action.Long story short, I murdered Gearth's army and he's currently sitting in my dungeon. 10/10, gonna go take his castle now too, screw whatever peace treaty we had.

												The original is a spectacular game with which one can play for hours upon hours upon hours upon hours without boredom setting in.My personal favourite is the expansion, Napoleonic Wars. Charging at your opponents, whether it be with music or weaponry, whilst in the background plays the greatest classical music the world has to offer, is as hilarious as it is ineffably enjoyable. Never shall I tire of dramatic battles suddenly coming to a halt, merely because someone felt that playing a flute was a better idea.No matter the complications one must deal with in real life, this game will undoubtedly always place a smile upon your face.

												As you can tell by my hours, I have decent knowledge of what this game is like. For better or for worse, lets start with this 'Good' game.The single player for the main game, being the Native module you will get upon buying the game, is very unique in its own way. It's your 'Build an army and go destroy some castles' type of game where you recruit men from villages, earn money from different factions and eventually grow your army into a very powerful force that will make the AI run away. Literally. Earning money is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game but it pays off when you buy your new armour, weapons and earn skill points to level up your character from being a weak nobody to a power house axe throwing, taking 1000 arrows to the face character.  Now for this single player, you need to understand that you CANT care about the world. Why? Because the world don give no ♥♥♥♥♥ fo' you. You can get your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked, your armies destroyed, castles taken, everything that you have can be taken away and murdered before your very eyes! Combat is driven between three classes but are not limited to Archer, Footman and Cavalry. You can mix it up I dont care, just as long as you know what your limits are then you're fine.Within the single player, you will meet 6 different factions with different classes and environments. Its your choice on which one you can side and help take over the entire country or state...I'm not exactly sure if Calradia is a country or a state or if its even part of something else. Eh don't look at me that way, I didn't play the game for thousands of hours. Heh. ._. Its either that or be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone you meet ever and kill everyone you meet ever for the gold. Raid villages, caravans, castles, cities you name it, if its there you can take it. I won't spoil the single player or did I? Eh, maybe I did.Multiplayer is a dream. (Pfft) I won't sugar coat it, you will find so many morons in this game including the DLC, but sure every game has it's idiots in their communities but here, its a little bit special. First off if you're not completely new to the game at this point, meaning you can block and not die after the first hit, then you're going to be okay. MP is definetely still around in terms of the mods that you can get, which are very plentiful. I highly recommend getting at least a couple of these mods to fill your time.There's probably a lot more I'm missing, like how the community is. BUT you'll find that out if you buy the game right? Buy the game if you like the medieval genre, fighting random people and taking over land that noone asked you or told you to take. Buy this game if you want to be 'enriched' into the online part of the game where clans and events run wild.Will I play with you? Lol no, I'm done with this game you can have it. Here take it. Come back to me in 2-3 years and tell me you like this game. If you do, well great. If you find out what I was *Hinting* at then good for you. :P10/10 best gameReal score 7/10.'It was okay' ~ Rival			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a medieval sandbox game. There is a single player mode which you can create a character to be you or anyone else. Multiplayer mode allow you to meet other people to compete , help one another and more. With mod , it makes the game more enjoyable for everyone .My Thoughts :I give it a 9.5/10 as I put 300 plus hours into playing. I really recommend this to those who like medieval games.

												I have done 100+ videos of this game and played it since it released almost 5 years ago even before it was on Steam.  The gameplay is such that it forces the player to use his skills for chopping, sniping or bashing his way to victory.  Starting from nothing and making your new life in pursuit of your kingdom is amazing.  IF you need any help I have ton's of videos about this game on my channel, check my profile page for links.

												Recommended: Mount & Blade: Warband is a game evocative of the old classic Darklands, that suffers from quite a few rough edges but is a compelling and captivating medieval combat and life simulator.  It has a compelling brand of open-world RPG, character story development, sandbox simulation, and strategy aspect that is unlike anything in the market since that classic Darklands, and nothing else since has really come close.  If the idea of play a captain - or king or queen! - of your own medieval empire appeals to you, or even just living amongst it, you owe it to yourself to give Mount & Blade: Warband a look.Read the full review here: https://www.highlandarrow.com/reviews/165-mount-blade-warband.html ",529,137,9,122,58,3,89

												-Entered a tournament for the first time because why not-Doing well, my character wasn't very good and I was still new to the combat but still could win a one on one pretty easily against the AI-My ranged attacks were terribly innacurate at the time, had to get right next to anyone to hit anything (especially on horseback)-Manage to trap a guy against the wall, others join in attacking me or him-Soon half the tournament participants packed into one corner shooting each other and swinging wildly with swords-Chaos ensues-Manage to survive and be the last man standing-Tournament not over yet, final round-Me vs some random guy-Both on horseback with lances-I had never used a lance before-IhavenoideawhatI'mdoing-AI doesn't really know how to use it either, doesn't realize it does 0-1 damage from point blank range-Chasing each other around the arena trying to hit each other, even if we do line up for a jousting situation it either gets blocked by a shield, misses, or gets messed up and does little or no damage-Cue Benny Hill theme-~10 minutes of chasing each other around until I finally figure out how to use it-Kill him in two hits after that10/10 would chase a dude around in circles for 10 minutes againSeriously though, it's a great game. Don't be turned off by the older graphics, it's a ridiculous amount of fun, and there's so many different ways to play between the DLC, mods, and the base game itself.			",55,2,0,2,8,0,8

												This game…..This game is truly one of a kind in overall presentation and style.  Yes there are some games like Mount and Blade but nothing comes quite close to Mount and Blade (or MB for short), or at least none that I know of.  It is too bad I got into this game seemingly towards the end of its popularity lifespan in the multiplayer stage as Bannerlord is soon to be released and I have a notion this game will be not forgotten, but much less frequented once it does.   Let me first say that Mount and Blade does multiplayer VERY well…very well…  Taleworlds got the formula down for simulated ‘sword and shield’ combat on a quasi-ARMA/Total War series style map very well (some of you may or may not agree with that analogy).  The mechanics in this game are second to none in terms of uniqueness and originality.  But be warned…The learning curve for multiplayer is very steep, but very fun and rewarding once you get ‘kind of’ good ( some of you may know what I mean by getting at least ‘kind of’ good in multiplayer).  And in addition, the multiplayer may be highly addictive once you get into it, it is that good!The singleplayer gameplay is very nice too, think of the Total War series meets FPS/RPG with a 3rd person perspective ARMA medieval style twist, although kind of generic in terms of overall execution and ‘diplomacy’, but don’t let that deter you this is quite an experience the first, second, and maybe even third or fourth (or even more) time(s) around.  The overall style of this game is something to be remembered for a long time if not forever.And lastly, the character face editor ooh boy, the character editor is something of a beautiful novelty.  Some of the custom faces you’ll see in multiplayer are downright hilarious!  The custom face poser is possibly the worst/best thing I’ve ever seen done this way!  NO GAME has done face poser quite like MB….no game! Below is my list of pro/cons:Pros:-Multiplayer is like no other and the custom faces and characters add a lot of individuality to it.-face poser (hilarious mechanic…you should see other players faces in multiplayer laughing is half the enjoyment in some aspects!).-Single player is also like no other in terms of overall execution and style.-difficult and unique, but very fun and rewarding realistic style ‘sword and shield’ melee combat as well as archery and various thrown weapons you would expect from the medieval period this game seems to be roughly based around in terms of time and technology.-many, many different character builds, weapons, and a good mix of factions to choose from ( factions seem to represent the middle ages in  Western Europe, Eastern Europe/Russia, Asia, Middle East, and ‘Scandinavia’ pretty well, albeit in a generic fashion).-Endless options for character customization and playstyle builds.-The campaign is very much at ‘your own pace’ it’s basically a big sandbox with various things to accomplish and do…all at your own pace and choosing, do whatever you want, however you want adding to the games originality.Cons:-The diplomacy in the singleplayer game can seem very across the board generic at times.-There are some fairly minor bugs in both MP and SP where you will get ‘code errors’ (like option to host a feast at your castle once you become married to one of the vassals’ relatives).-The swing mechanic and combat whilst very good and very intuitive can be very hard and confusing to learn at first to some.-Some of the SP factions seem to be overpowering at times (Nords, Swadia), although this is arguable.My rating breakdown:-.05 minor bugs that can be annoying to some-.05 sometimes seemingly unbalanced factions and generic diplomacy with somewhat scant options in terms of directivesMy final rating is 9/10 (1.00 = 10 = 9/10) I highly recommend this game to you if you like sword and shield style melee combat and, if you like the middle-ages time frame, pick up this novelty!

												I bought a CD-version of this game when I was vacationing in the Philippines, and it helped me absolutely destroy any jetlag - I played it for probably 10 hours straight (until 9am), then went on with my day with circadian rhythms now synchronized. I fell in love with this game so hard. The M&B series easily fits into my list of most favorite games ever.If you like open-world RPGs, army/inventory/unit/territory management, tiny-to-massive scale battles, and mod potential, then you will absolutely love this game. The aesthetics are very good - nothing too crazy or graphic-intensive. There is a lot of detail in the different weapons, armor pieces, and unit types. At the end of the battle, you will most likely be covered in blood if you like to jump into the thick of things with a melee weapon. The music and sounds are amazing - there is nothing quite like hearing arrows soaring over and past you. The controls are easy to familiarize yourself with, however, for a real challenge, I suggest you switch blocking and attacking to manual. If you do this, you will block and attack in the direction you move your mouse (this is essential for the game to calculate proper hit windows). It is totally possible to die from repeatedly blocking incorrectly, and this adds to the intensity of every battle, be it a 10-man battle or a 300 full-scale massacre. You can also select how many units are allowed to appear on the field at a time. The game gives very good feedback on the difficult % depending on the options you select, so you can better tailor your play experience to suit your tastes. The beginning missions provide a nice and helpful tutorial. The learning curve is moderate to difficult - once you have a large enough army, you can take over castles and/or towns. Once this happens, you must then consider territory management, keeping a garrison to defend your lands while you are away. The character customization is pretty expansive, and there are a multiude of skills for you to select from. You can specialize in bow & arrow, polearms, sword & shield, horseback riding, commerce, etc. To help strengthen the areas you are lacking in, you may hire bodyguards - their applicable skills will be added to a ""party pool,"" which can boost the effectiveness of your army considerably.The open-world gameplay is spectacular! You can side with the different factions vying for conrol of the land. If that doesn't suit you, you can even help different individuals with claims to the throne (each faction has one such person). Doing this will result in the claimant becoming the new faction leader (if you manage to succeed). If you are feeling particularly suicidal, you can even try to leave your own mark on the land by taking over a territory for yourself, however, this is extremely difficult if you do not have allies to call on.As you play, you gain reputation, and this will cause faction leaders to seek you out for recruitment as a lord (allowing you to be granted territories if you join them). You may build different sttructures (ex: granary, watchtower, prison) that provide different bonuses, but these usually take an extremely long time to complete. Reputation, among other things, also contributes to the maximum party/army size you are allowed to field. The battles are vicious, especially if you can handle increasing the difficulty to the higher end. Fighting an intense 6 vs. 12 battle (in the enemy's favor) can feel so rewarding when you loot the bodies after - the amount of loot recovered is influenced by your ""loot"" skill, so many items can be lost if you do not invest in this (or if you do not have a bodyguard with the skill). Skills like firt aid and wound treatment will boost your army's recovery outside of battle and minimize the amount of your units killed (instead having them knocked unconscious). When you are besieging a castle/town, the enemy can sally forth, forcing you to meet them outside the walls. The very first time you try to take over a territory will be memorable - you will be racing up ladders while arrows hail down upon you. Since garrisons are fairly large, you may find yourself fighting long battles that last several minutes (if not an hour+). The different unit types and equipment allow you to experiment with different army configurations and loadouts. Issuing commands in batttle takes some getting used to, but once you become familiar with it, you will be able to better dominate the field of battle.When fighting on horseback and/or against other mounted units, you can kill the horses to remove their advantage (works well if you are a mounted archer).You can try to court noblewomen in order to be accepted into a powerful family. Participating in tournaments allows you to earn reputation and favor with them (and the rest of the realm). On the world map, you can see all units within your field of view. You can attack any army, caravan, etc you see - if two parties are in battle, you can usually join and select a side to help (useful for farming experience).One of M&W: Warband's best features is the super extensive and powerful mod support. The community provides just about everything - I suggest you check out the Clask of Kings mod, as well as the Floris mod back (adds A LOT of features and graphical updates). There are even mods that add Warhammer 40,000 themes/units, other fantasy overhauls, and many more.The entire M&B series is phenomenal, and I strongly suggest you check it out if the open-world war theme interests you.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",250,87,0,51,38,2,49

												In the past I have wasted my hard earned money frequently. However, this isn't the case for this game, every nickle I spent was spent wisely on this game, The only thing I've wasted is my time, which is worth a lot more than any paycheck. The singleplayer is good and there are many modders who spend a lot of time on modding so people like me can take advantage of their magnificent creations. A few campaign mods I like(there's many more amazing ones though) are Prophesy of Pendor, Blood and Steel, Floris etc. etc.Then there´s the multiplayer, a big difference between this and the campaign is you actually need to block and don't take an infinite number of hits before being""knocked unconscious"". Most multiplayer players  know what they are doing but if you want to annoy these no-lifers effectively, aside from teamkilling and delaying, which take no skill, you will have to take the time to learn this arcane art called ""melee"", (archery is♥♥♥♥♥♥xd). BUT THEN YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SPEND TIME TO LEARN THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥AND THE CAMPING ARCHERS AND THE BACKSTABBING INFANTRY AND THE SNEAKY ♥♥♥♥ING CAVALRY STILL KILL YOU.There are some cool multiplayer native mods as well such as Mercenaries(no life=cash) and Persistent World(no life=cash+ RDM).Now we arrived at Napoleonic Wars, this game's only worthy DLC. In the beginning this DLC's melee is probably even harder even though there are only 2 block and attack directions most of the time. A good server for beginners is the Groupfighting_Server, after that Killbox and when you're really getting the hang of joining servers and selecting a nation, perhaps even Jailbreak. That said, this mod can be fun but its community can be spooky, so watch out. A really nice mod for this DLC is North and South. Also L'aigle seems to be a good SP mod. Yeah and there are regiments so watch out for those, most of them are Nigerian scammers trying to get you in their army. So even though my opinion might seem vague, I would recommend all of you to buy this game with Napoleonic wars or something but don't get Viking Conquest, it seems♥♥♥♥♥♥xd. Overall this is the best game I have every played, together with Neverwinter Nights and The Battle for Middle Earth.-Melsyo(KIT FISTO)			",29,2,0,2,2,0,1

												This is an excellent game, while granted the graphics aren't great, the gameplay makes up for that, I've spent many hours playing this, and I still hope to spend many more, the multiplayer enhances it a lot more, as do the mods.This was the review I made a year ago, and now after a year of playing it for almost every day, I think it's safe to say that this is one of the biggest drains on my life in terms of time, I have owned this game for 1.5 years, and I have earnt a total of 3100 hours over multiple accounts, meaning about 22% of the past year and a half I have been playing this game. Worst thing about that is that this was me genuinly playing this game, not leaving it running... I have no life essentually, all because of this game XD But it's still worth the sacrifice imo...

												I highly recommend this game, all of my hours played have been in a span of two weeks, and I LOVED every second! They say that time flies when you're having fun, and I couldn't agree more. The game takes place in Calradia, and there's a ton of factions that you can join. (Swadia ftw!) The objective is to conquer Calradia by taking castles from the enemy. You can either aid a faction in conquering Calradia, help a claimant conquer Calradia, or you can make your own faction and conquer Calradia! On your path to the throne, you'll have to build your own army from the scratch by recruiting peasants, and upgrading them as you progress.The graphics aren't the best, nor the worst, but you really learn to play with it. Controls could be better, but once you learn the mechanics, winning becomes a cakewalk.I hope this review helped you! - Dux			",53,4,3,7,1,0,5

												During the summer, I became addicted to warband.  All through august I warbanded almost constantly, stopping only to eat and sleep.  Even when I went on a Holiday, I managed to warband for ten hours a day.  This lead to hard and harder things like Floris ing and before I knew it I was Prophecy of Pendoring, I would even do it in front of my family.  It horrible, but I got over my addiction and now I limit my self to an hour a day at most.Don't be like me, don't warband.But I will recommend this game to those of us with stronger wills.

You can take different routes, such as when a loyal knight, or when the king, or help others Zionist, can also be a gangster, everywhere to rob a caravan and farmers, also can become a businessman to run business, or mercenaries, or is the lone ranger, a high degree of freedom.

												This game is the perfect way to cure clogged noses. I've tried many ""solutions"" such as working out, making the heat higher or lower, walking around for an hour, but nothing seemed to cure it completely, just partly. Then I found this magnificent cure! I played for ten minutes, and I could breath out of BOTH nostrils! BOTH NOSTRILS, SON! Sometimes I wake up at like 2:00am and I'm really tired, but I can't get to sleep because of a clogged nose. I then start up good ol' Mount & Blade: Warband, and BAM!

Posted: April 16, 2016
												Although this is now an aging game of medieval warfare, it still constitutes one of the best examples of the genre, until the release of Warband 2.Namely, open world gritty style medieval combat on horsebeack.If you want ""Lord of the Rings"", stop reading the review now (although ""The Last Days"" mod is a dedication, but many prefer classical medieval combat).This is not ""Might and Magic"", its rundamentary sword combat.The multitude of different major total coversions and mods keeps this game from getting stale, particularly different eras of history such as the early middle ages, feudal Japan, and age of firearms.Who plays the original Native version of this game from 2010 and rates the game from the original release? There has a bit of advancement since the ""Dark Ages"".""Explore the world of M&B Mods"".I am partial to several in particular, namely:Anno Domini 1257 AD, Floris Expanded Mod Pack 2.54, Brytenwalda, The Hundred Years War, and Gekokujo.  Viking Conquest DLC is actually very good now, since most of the bugs and problems have now been fixed, and the environments are quite historically atmospheric.  The new features like hunting, added a lot to the game, along with the brutish level of injuries.Overall gameplay play mechanics are rock solid.Fighting is inituitive and natural.Horseback riding just feels right.Very addictive in the ""just one more battle"" kind of way.You may start off as a ""lowly peasant"" but will eventually rise to glory as a ""knight and lord"" with a lot of work.The number of hours I have played offline, does not contstiute online hours.HUNDREDS since its original release, maybe well over a 2000?  Very rare for me as I do not play many games anymore as an ""old fart"" in my 40s.There are even a few really good multiplayer persistent world versions (""Persistent World"" comes to mind), but that was not the games original focus.Lack of voice chat without using Skype or TeamSpeak makes is less entertaining.The only real downside is the threadbare repeated quests.This game is a ""choose your own adventure"" style make up your story with a creative mind.The other downside in the lack of optimization of the game engine.Battles of over 500 soldiers can cause serious FPS issues, especially on sieges.More than 500 causes frame rates start to just become absurd, especially with large amounts of mounted calvary.More than 1000 (at one time) and the game can actually crash even if you have some type of ""gaming super computer"", as I stated the limitation is the game engine, not necessary your system.Fortunately, an external program called ""Battle Sizer"" can make the adjustments you want.I generally run battles around 500, as less than 250 soldiers makes LARGE siege and land battles take between 30 minutes and 2 hours with reinforcements and makes formations nearly impossible to control.Recommendation?Download Anno Domini 1257 AD, Version 1.13 Angry Peasant Edition. (ModDB has the last version that was updated to my knowledge from Dec 2015, it is not on STEAM Workshop).Just do it, you will understand the scope of the undertaking.It is just massive in terms of scope, decades will pass before you are able to establish a proper faction to contend with many of the largest countries such as England, France, Holy Roman Empire, Crusader States, and the Golden Horde.  Smaller countries generally never stand a chance and get eliminated and aborbed early in the campaign.It actually has significant historical accuracy for the time period both with people, places, castles, cities and equipment.  London is an excellent overall representation of the actual city during the period.  ""Take a walk around the town"", and be prepared to go, ""Holy #!$@, I did not know M&B Warband could do that?"" There is no magic, elfs, hobbits, dragons, or plate armor here sorry...An incredible amount of depth in areas like the Crusades, Lance Recruitment System, diplomatic relations and alliance management, challenging tournament singular and team battles, army enlistment versus independent action, sea battles, and expanding your manor and fiefs with actual physical improvements you can see and use, they are not just ""eye candy"".  All in first or third person views including recruiting from your own fiefs and build up your armies from the historical nationalities.  Nations will fall and get eliminated permanently from gameplay.  Lords will defect to your cause if you have high levels of reknown and honor.  Maintaining your armies, feedng, and paying salaries without proper planning leads to disasters and revolts.  Basically, it is like playing Medieval Total War ""inside the world"".Your individual combat actions can actually turn the tide of a battle, or even a war, but you are NOT a ""one man army"".  You will be easily knocked out a battle if you act like a #@!$tard.Some mods result in broken equipment, permanent death or crippling injuries.This is not ""Call of Duty"", you do not recover your health with ""health packs"", and you cannot hide behind a wall and regenerate.  You have what you have, damage is determined by your equipment and skill or complete lack of intelligence, until you rest over time with wound treatment and surgery skills.Choose your individual actions and battles wisely or you will have more than you can handle and will ""fall and never get up again"".Choose your alliances carefully as well, as the more factions you have as enemies the more difficult you will be able to maintain your kingdom and crown.Just think of it as an earlier version of Chivalry or War of the Roses without the full mutiplayer and many less fruitcake player jack wagons.Let me me know when you score your first perfect headshot with a mongol bow at 100 meters on horseback at full gallop, it is an art and takes practice and high levels of skill.  You don't need a guide.  You will master it with time and go ""HUZZAH!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite possibly the best power fantasy RPG ever made.You start off as the leader of a small band of warriors, consisting of both companions with their own backstory / stats, as well as more disposable troops of various types. At the beginning, you are mostly limited to skirmishing with small packs of bandits for minor loot and gear to better equip your nascent warband, but as your renown and reputation grows, you are able to recruit larger numbers of warriors and pledge yourself as a vassal to a noble lord. With this newfound status comes responsibilities, and you will from time to time be asked to contribute a war party to a campaign against one of the other factions in the game.Proving yourself to be a loyal subject and a capable warrior / leader will bring you to the attention of the leader of your chosen faction, and with it, opportunities to become a lord yourself, with lands granted to you that will provide you with a source of income to maintain your army with. The overall design of the game lends itself to a very Games of Thrones-esian feel, and at some point, you may feel powerful enough to contest for the throne of your faction, have you own vassals, or even try to unite all of Calradia under your banner.As far as game mechanics go, this game is solidly an RPG (unlike Medieval Total War, which this game has some similarities to), with both an inventory and stats system for your main character and companions. Combat-oriented stats for each weapon type are raised both by leveling up, as well as through usage in combat.Main knocks against the game are somewhat janky animations and poorly executed autoterrain generation system.

												First off to start this review I'd like to say that this game is a must have on steam, It's been on numerous sales and has one of the best and most weird communities. I have gladly dumped over 500 hours in this game and about 200 in the other games, I had another account on steam but I lost it's password, therefore I happily repurchased the Mount&Blade Collection.To summarize this game in a few words this game would be : Death, Medieval Times, humongous battles ranging from 2 to 200 men, if you use mods it can reach to 500 men battles, Different Culture Castles, Sieges, Best Combat System and Amusing Horse Deaths.Alright, now that I've sed all that You can probably picture what Epicness awaits you after you purchase this masterpiece!As you start the game you get the Generic RPG choise, a man or a woman, but chose wisely because the Mount&Blade world takes place in a sexist environment, If you choose to be a female character, if you decide to become a vassal of a king you will not be awarded the Fief you would receive if you were a man, and the Lords treat you like a fragile being when you meet them before Battle and can sometimes insult you! But you can get them back with a Mighty Blow to the♥♥♥♥♥♥:DYou Start alone on your journey with your goals and reasons, and as you go along the way you recruit men, who will follow you to the depths of hell if you so decide to visit that nice place ;D. You can ally yourself to a king and destroy all of his opponents or Make a faction of your own and Blow them all to hell like I did once.You can take part in feasts, tournaments, votations, marriages, Duels for a lady's honour among other things, My favourite Hobby is to Run down peasants with my knights. As your men gain experience you get to level them up to more powerful medieval forces, From A peasant with a stick to an Epic Knight, there are several factions with lots of different units each faction has they're weaknesses and strengths. You get to Destroy and burn villages to the ground and capture castles and Cities if you are mighty enough.But the best part by far is the Multiplayer, I have met loads of fun people and... The conversations we had XDEvery time you go on a multiplayer server you'll get to experience the chat, I'll give you examples of the best ones I've seen:Talking about Indian♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and how they are all dirty, The meaning of life is indian♥♥♥♥♥♥ The Prostitution set ups, Putin being the One true ruler of the world among other fun topics.. ;)You can play with up to 200 people in multiplayer, The fun is infinite! The endless volley's of arrows flying down on you and your men is something you will always remember ;DThere is an expansion called "" Napoleonic Wars"" It is worth getting, adds a whole lot more to the game, and it's like a boat simulator XD but with guns, Boarding ships and Hilarious fights.If you had the patience to read all that, I salute you and I will personally Give you weed from my personal stash and some medals.Get it Now!!!

												Mount and Blade Warband is one of the best strategic-action games you can find. It's like medieval time, where you have Swords and Shields, ... You basically improve your party/army's size, and try to ''rule the world'' , tehnically, rule everything of villages, castles and kingdoms That you see on the map. You have an abillity of making multiple + Games. Which I mean, if you start a new game, and save it. You will have it saved. So you can start another one, and the previous one will be saved. Which is awesome, i think. This part of Mount And Blade is the best one, atleast my opinion, and this one is the most up-rated part, of M&B.If you yet didn't try this, you are missing out alot, or you are doing it wrong ;) :DRate: 11/10			",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												Truly a masterpiece in the world of PC gaming.  Mount and Blade: Warband is an interesting combination of strategy and boots on the ground combat in its single-player campaign.  Its depth in multiplayer combat is unparalleled by any other game to date.  When first viewing this game, you may ask why a game that isn't very old has Morrowind-esque graphics, but once you see past how atrociously ugly the vanilla game is, you can start really enjoying it.  The game itself is more of a template for modding than a game, as the module system allows for the easy installation and playing of many mods, which you can seamlessly switch between.  If you can't get over the graphics than wait for Bannerlord, the next installment of the Mount and Blade series that everyone is currently creaming themselves over, but don't expect it to come out any time soon.

												Mount & Blade: Warband is the sequel to the original Mount & Blade from 2008.Mount &Blade: Warband –and the Mount & Blade series in general I guess- is a medieval RPG game, and where it compared with other games within the same genre lacks the magic dragons and mystic happenings, it manages to set up the mood for a realistic atmosphere with a lot of action and intensities.You start of the game by choosing your players backstory, all the choices you make will have an effect on your skills, and you can then later on train and level up all of these by simply using the specific weapon in combat. You then start roaming around the world of Calradia, you will own nothing but the clothes on you, and your weapons, you can then slowly start raising an army and aspire to become a sworn vassal of a king, or even take castles for yourself and claim for the right of Calradia yourself!Another great feature added to this sequel, is the multiplayer mode, you can now play online in with fellow players in several different game modes, including Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch and many others. Apart from multiplayer, the game also includes a custom battle mode allowing you to fight any fight you want, against any enemy you want, on any map you want.Apart from the base game being great in itself, this game is easily modable. So if you buy it and you start to think of it as too uniform, there’s many great mods out there. A few I can recommend is the “Clash of Kings” mod, (which gives the game a GoT twist) and L’aige (for multiplayer mode) and finally the graphic enhancer if you simply find it unbearable.When creating a game, developers often have to focus on certain elements and prioritize some stuff over others, and when playing this game it seems clear that the graphics has not been their center of attention, this however does not in any way, make the game unplayable.A problem I have found with this game though, is  the client crashing, this mostly happens if you have too many saves, the game has difficulties loading the save files I’m guessing and crashes, but as long as you stick to only a few, you should be good.To sum up, I greatly enjoy playing this game –as you can probably tell from the hours I’ve played it- even after beating it, I still roam around the world from time to time. I would recommend this game to anybody who’s into the medieval RPG type of game. So overall it’s a gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/10.			",285,49,6,42,37,2,68

												The Ultimate Sandbox Medieval Combat Sim.  What the hell does that even mean you ask?  Do you dream of fielding a diverse army on a battlefield?  Do you want to charge into combat on a noble steed with your cohorts in tow?  Does firing arrows into foreheads on horseback while galloping just out of reach of an enemies lance appeal to you?  Are you eager to storm up siege engines while under a hail of arrows?   Would you revel in the glorious slaughter that is the Medieval melee meat grinder?  This is just the tip of the iceberg my friend.Raise an harden army out of common towns folk.  Wage war. Start a Rebellion.  Sack Towns.  Siege castles.  Conquer territory.  Trade Goods.  Start an Enterprise.  Marry a Princess.  Become King! (or Queen!)  All is possible and more if you desire it.			",244,55,3,42,17,1,67

												Mount and Blade Warband is a true classic of a game.It is an RPG game where you choose what your character looks like, their name, and their background. Once you do that, you choose from six nations in the fanciful land of Calradia to spawn at. You are but a poor peasant at the start, but you will eventually become rich by completing side-quests given to you by NPCs and by defeating enemies and taking their crap. You will hire fresh recruits from villages, which can be upgraded into more powerful units as they get more experience, You can hire hero characters and already-powerful mercenaries from taverns in major cities. You can conquer or pillage other towns, and can actually fight battle alongside your troops. Once you have your own little army, the possibilities are endless. Will you become the servant of powerful lords and kings? Will you join the manhunters and fight the many groups of bandits in Calradia? Will you become a murderer and a thief? Will you pledge alleigance to one of the six nations in Calradia, and become a lord of villages, castles and cities in times of peace, and be a general in times of war? Or will you forge your own destiny, and became the all-powerful ruler of your very own nation?????    Choose wisely.			",8,6,0,10,7,0,12

												It's the best medieval simulator out there which icludes direct intervention (well, because the best medieval simulator without affixes is Crusader Kings II). Don't trust ads for Chivalry, War of the Roses and such. It may appear rough and glitchy, because it's old (probably older than some of the readers of the review). Players are easily engaged by it, but it bores them pretty damn fast (if we're talking singleplayer). But then again, there are tons of mods.As a multiplayer part, it's fun, but not fantastic. And has the same fast-boredom issue.Don't expect an epic story (but there are mods containing it, like Prophecy of Pendor), or a deep party management, or something like Shadow-of-Mordor-social-system, or an empire management. It lacks all stated above, because this is pretty much a progenitor.And you, my dear reader, should respect your elders.			",176,37,0,45,16,1,33

												I started has a poor son of a nobleman, soon after that I became a vassal for King Harlaus. Quickly rising through the ranks to become his marshall, I then started a war with the neighboring kingdom until all that remained of Rhodok kingdom was one measly castle and a village. Then I spent a good time talking to other Counts of King Harlaus, gaining favor among half of them. I then renounced my oath to the King for he was a weak king, at this point my army took over the last castle of the Rhodoks, wiping out their pathetic kingdom. I then convinced half of the Counts sworn to King Harlaus to join my new Empire, The Empire of the Stag. After a sort but bloody war, King Harlaus and the kingdom of the swaedes or whatever their name was, was just a memory, the first chapter in my biography if you will. Now I will conquer the rest of this land, with a combination of words and swords. LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE! LONG LIVE AUGUSTUS MARCUS ANTONIUS STARK! I give this game a Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish out of 10.			",289,31,7,41,23,0,43

												Based of a series of historical accounts, Mount and Blade Warband is set in the land of Calradia in North America, because apparently in the 1100s when Native Americans were running around with clubs and sticks, its still possible for you to raise a Mongol Horde and conquer the Westernish Europeans. Logic.Anyway, being entirely accurate in every way you play as Nelson Mandela in his quest to become the world's best basketball player without being reduced to a quivering load of flesh by a million Rhodok Crossbowman, or a million million Khergit Horse Archers, or just the occasionly Swadian Knight the AI bothers to recruit.As well as that you can play in the DLC as a soldier during Napoleon's reign over France and his rather vague attempts to conquer to world and which led to the Germans claiming all the credit for the Battle of Waterloo. In this DLC you sweat out hours and hours of your free time as you try to perfect your melee skills and almost try to improve your shooting, engage in epic line battles over the course of an hour with somebody that keeps telling you to ""aim higher"" until eventually you fall over due to lack of balance. In the end of course, you can become one of tryhards that you spent so long hating.Overall, its a good game, so you should buy it. :D			",130,12,0,27,22,1,52

												Mount and Blade Warband.... Where to start? The multiplayer is a massive bundle of fun with tons of weapons and armours making the game quite entertaining. The singleplayer is a unique singleplayer that has a relation system aswell as an overhead map for easier access, each faction with there own individual troop tree and random traits that the lords or ladies may have. The singleplayer is almost unprediactable with battles turning upside with the death of a handful of troops or being indicted for treason. The mods that have been released for this game give it an edge that makes you keep coming back for more. 10/10 My favourite game :)			",69,3,0,1,4,0,11

												This game sucks... Sucks at being the best game there ever was.Mount & Blade: Warband is the pinnacle of how games really should be, a game with a great single player, a great multiplayer, and even better DLC's. This game is truely, dare I say. The BEST game you could ever buy from the Steam store.Mount & Blade: Warband, in the beginning, was in a 'Native' stage (Which is still awesome) where you go out on your own and go from a lowlife with no purpose or destiny to a freaking KING with hundred-man armies. Your job in the game is to progress and become the most powerful person in the game. And it's quite addicting once you get into it.Mount & Blade: Warband also had multiplayer, which basically in it's name, allows you and other people to group up on a server and do whatever (besides campaign which I think would have been fantastic), which in my case, I thought it was the absolutely best thing about the game. You can get on a server and make friends while stabbing them in the face with your two-handed sword! Or. You can group up and perform a Siege, which basically one side defends the flag from the enemy team and one side tries to take control of it. Amazing.Lastly in Mount & Blade: Warband, is the DLC's. I will say this with all my heart... I, have NEVER, had such an experience in one game, with the Napoleon Wars DLC. It not only brings in a WHOLE new set of gameplay with, muskets, new sets of forms by ranks, cannons, and much... MUCH more. It's only a Multiplayer kind of DLC (it has custom single-player battles but that sucks.) where you can get on and meet seriously awesome people and join different groups. I got this game my first day and went on Napoleon Wars, and I was almost instantly invited into a regiment (group) when I joined a server. And they had tournaments, 1v1's, HUGE line battles, and the big boy TNWL. I HIGHLY suggest if you're gonna get this game, get Napoleon Wars, it is a opportunity to new and exciting things you CANNOT miss out on.BTW, shoutout to my fav regiment 32e, if you get the game and Napoleon Wars, join them, if you want to join, add me to your friends and I'll hook you up. It's amazing, I swear.OVERALL... Mount & Blade: Warband is rated OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE for a reason. It is a game that doesn't cost much, unless you're young or don't have a job... But it's absolutely something you CANNOT, I REPEAT, CANNOT... Miss out on.I rate this game a 1000000000000/1			",102,7,1,10,6,1,5

												This game brings you to the medieval world since 1257, where you start as a regular traveler of that times. You can choose what was your past and that affects your atributes, if you are good leader, fighter, trader, pathfinder, hunter, etc., but you can change and improve your skills in every way as you are getting more experienced (leveling up). Your target is simple, become the emperor of whole realm and rule all the towns, villages and castles in it. The way to it is really hard, you must fight and lead, rob peasant / villages or earn money or collect taxes and offer various food to soldiers to hold your army strong and keep morale high. You have to get known through the realm and get praise of the lords to becoming one of them and then taking the throne. There is also the option to declare your own faction, but to do that is really not a piece of cake. The game is very complex, seems like a strategy, but all battles you are fighting you can fight yourself. Take your bow, sword, spear, crossbow or axe and battle on the fields, siege the castles and conquer them or disguise yourself and fight the defenders from the inside. Quests in the game are changing and have some short backstories, not long and deep, but various kinds (like deliver messsage, kill someone, plunder a village and so on) and the only their purpose is to improve relations with the lords, which can get you what you want.There are some things I would critizise. Firstly is the one most disturbing in the singleplayer campain and that is the speed of the game, seems to me too slow, like getting new recruits for example. Other thing is I feel like half of the gameplay I am searching for lords whom I need to find (because of quests or other duties) seems endless, all that running around the map to find them and the last thing is untransparency of many details in game. There are some mods which can change these aspect, but its not in the original settings. I think this game when you get into it can be fun for hundreds of hours nevertheless my personal rating is influenced by many aspects and I think 7.5 is suitable. This is review only for the basic game. 7.5 /10Short illustration

												Mount and Blade: Warband is for me and for sure for many other people the best game yet.""Why?"" do you ask? I'll explainMount and Blade has the best Combatsystem,you need concentration.It is Skill based and is very much fun.Multiplayer Community is just great(except some intelligent people with silly names).The sandbox in that game mades it never really end,just the Story of one of your characters may end.And if it ever gets boring to conquer Calradia alone,go on Multiplayer,there are enough gamemodes and other players.Modding Community is huge,I think I saw a Survival Mod aswell (to be clear,I am not sure)Great mods for SIngleplayer,but Multiplayer aswell.Sure there are a few things you could not like,for example the graphics,but be honest : bad graphics or bad gameplay?I totally recommend this game,if I should evaluate it,it was 9/10 because nothing is perfect...Not even YOU who read that here			",32,1,0,3,9,0,11

												Fricken good game""It's Carling, but it's not quite Warband"" - Carling advert and ITV coverage of World Cup sponsor69/10 would almost harvesting season before ascending to the throne of calradia, block chambering, groupfighting, getting banned from 15th Humans Vs. Bots for complimenting the admins shiny sword, kill the admin in an across the map headshot at the start of a 200v200 lb resulting in a coincidential reset before live despite already being live, blowing up the Death Star, defending rorkes drift, fighting in the First World War, capturing the Red Keep, watching naked people armed with sticks kill fully armoured knights with great swords get banned for RDM, stopping the Nord Invasion, invading England as the English, teamkilling Malakith during the 77y siege, fighting at Thermoplaye, destroying the one ring, going to Hogwarts, blowing up the Arch de Triumph (and the rest of Paris with it) and playing the bagpipe whilst the rest of my team is getting slaughtered; again.Though don't expect much playing time, as you can see from my hours played I didn't spend too long on Warband.*Edit*----------------------------------------------------Felt as though that review was a bit unhelpful so here we go:Now most of you may be wondering why the heck I have wasted OVER 1000 HOURS ON THIS GAME! Well, the answer is simple. It is Mount & Blade: Warband. Aka, 1 never ending singleplayer sandbox rpg game, 1 200+ player server 700 servers medieval online game, 1 200+ player realistic skillful Napoleonic Wars dlc, and over 27,882 total mod conversions. Yeah, it is like 27,885 games in one.The singleplayer game is a sandbox free-roaming medieval RPG that allows you to travel around the world of Calradia, and literally do anything you can dream of. There is no official end to the game so it is limitless. Become a merchant and travel the map selling goods, start up your own chains of businesses in the major cities, fight as a mercenary for your local lord, or become a bandit and harrass peasants. Fight as a soldier in one of the 6 kingdoms fighting for total domination, become a lord in one of these factions and raise your own army, as well as gain your own castle/village/town fiefdoms. Create your own faction and become the sole ruler of Calradia, the choice is yours.Online is is a basic medieval game with many modes such as siege, team deathmatch, battle (1 life), etc, with up to 200+ player servers. It was the birthplace for War of the Roses. It is far better than War of the Roses online however with the combat system being so easy to learn yet so hard to master.The Napoleonic Wars dlc derived from a mod called Mount and Musket, it was made a standalone expansion dlc in 2012 and is a sole-online 200-250 player server multiplayer game set in the final years of the Napoleonic Wars. You can fight as one of the main coalition forces at the time (Great Britain, Prussia, Austria, or Russia) or France itself. There are many game modes such as huge sieges with controllable artillery and destructible environments, Battle with over 200 people on a large map playing life size napoleonic battles, and when you are dead, you are dead. Commander battle where each player controls a squad of bots. And many many more modes. The dlc has musicians which play music orchestrated by real bands for the game and which give buffs to nearby teammates. There are huge amounts of teamwork necesarry with such a variety of balanced classes, and the combat system ensures that skill is the master of the battlefield. If you get bored of just playing on public servers then there are hundreds of clans or ""regiments"" that have formed and who organise and do events that are like the 200 player battles but where everyone is listening to officer orders and fight as lines, creating a warming community.

			Base Game: Mount & Blade: Warband DLC: Napoleonic Wars Game Type: Napoleonic Wars Siege Both available from Steam or direct from Taleworlds NOTE: ALL CHARACTERS ARE PLAYERS - THERE ARE NO BOTS!		

There are also ofc the mods, all of which I would stuggle to tell you about in this review. The main mod I would recommend however is Persistent World. It is a roleplay type mod where you join a server with a large free roaming custom map, with multiple castles and towns, and you and all of the other players roleplay as medieval citizens. You can work in the mines and earn some coin with the balanced economic system, you can become a Master Smith and forge new weapons or armour, or if you feel like fighting you can join one of the many factions in each server and fight in wars for your lord. Maybe even become the lord of a faction yourself? The choice is yours.http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,160403.0.htmlI would highly highly rate Mount & Blade Warband as it is such a complex yet simple game with more content than any other game I have ever played including Skyrim.Thanks for reading, buy this game!

												It's an awesome game. Even if the multiplayer dies down, the countless mods of this game can still make u busy for hours until you realize you reached 1,000 hours on this game.These are my experience in Warband and it's mods:- Made a mercenary army,- Founded my Kingdom,- Steamrolled every faction in Calradia,- Went on warband multiplayer and get slain by naked 2 handers,- Fought for a Daimyo,- Betrayed my Daimyo, and created my own Clan,- United Japan and became Shogun,- Went on a Crusade,- Died in the Crusade. lol- Played as an Orc and razed Minas Tirith to the ground,- Played as a Gondorian and led Gondor's armies into Mordor,- Still playing a Clash of Kings mod (Game of Thrones mod)- and many more, many, many more.What else can I say? It's a great game.11/10 - Would play another thousand hours in this game again!But playing Napoleonic Wars makes the bulk of my hours in this game. It's the Era that made me play this game for countless sleepless nights. There's really no other game that has early 19th century 1st/3rd Person Shooter with a simple yet hard to master melee. Unlike most FPS games these days that focuses on rapid firepower, in napoleonic wars you only have 1 shot, and it takes almost 15 sec to reload for another shot. You'll really have to play tactically or join up in a line of soldiers, like the armies of that time. But if you really wanna feel what its like to be a soldier in this Era, Join a regiment.So my rating for Mount and Blade: Napoleonic Wars would be:10/10 - Would fight for Napoleon's Grande Armée again!

												Great game! Enough said. But because this is a review i spose i have to talk about the game a bit.There is an endless world of things  to do everything from traid to training your troops building an empire or just being a bandit. You can fight for one of five factions all have there perks and downsides, or you can make your own kingdom and become king  of the land with your own faction but be carfull not to make enimies early if you choose to do so unless you fell you are strong enough to take on all the other factions on your own. In my opinion it s best to become freinds with the other factions before you make your own kingdom as to avoid early violence. If you never played the game or seen it played there are ""special"" people that you can have join your party to fight with youlater on you can make them cammanders in your army by making them vassals you will need to give them lands and a title in your kingdom, but be carfull if they do not like you they may turn on you so fight with them for a time and be freindly. Vassals from other kingdoms may want to join you as well  , you may want to get to know some of the lower or less prestigious members of the other factions as they will be the most likely to defect to your kindom and if they like you more well then they are less likely to leave you as well. When you are a lower level taking castles will be a pain in the butt, but if you have good troops and good tactical skill you can easily take them. Cities are the most dificult to take but are the best as they offer the most land for your kindom. When you take a place over remember that you will need to leave troops there to defend it from the other factions. For castles i only leave about 10-20 guys at first if i have no vassal for it and for cities i leave 40+ depending on who owns the land around me and who i am at war with at the time. To become king of all of Calradia you will need right to rule to get this you can send the ""Special"" people from your party to pread the word that you will be a great king or by sending vassals to let the other kings know you will be taking over for this to for you need a high renown and honor, to get renown you have to fight in battles with odds not in your favor or against other vassals for one of the five factions, to get honor you must be an honorable gent. When you defeat vassals for other kingdoms you will be given a choice you can take them as your prizoner or you can let them go, taking them prizoner will get you a pay day but it will paint a target on your back for the other vassals to try and rescue there fellow, but it can be very profitable if you can hold onto him. If you let him go you will get honor and he will like you a bit more. If you were to capture the leader of the country you are at war with and let him go you will get more honor and he may even call a truece between your countries, and he will accept you as king later on.If you just want to be a bandit well that is not as honorable and if you have ""special"" people in your party most of them dont like to fight villagers and caravans for various reassons, you will also lose honor and the faction or factons that you are raiding will not like it so remember the golden rule in my book the goods you steal need to be sold so dont attack all the factions leave 2 or 3 to sell to.Well that is my review it turned into more of a ""how to"" than a review but thats ok. I love this game and plan to log more hours in time. I hope this helps new and old players to becoming king of Calradria.Ps. if you want to get in good with a faction marry the kings daughter or son depending on Male/Female.Thanks for reading.

												Warband is the stand alone sequel to Mount & Blade.  It has all the features of the first game plus some additional new features.Graphics: 4Below average, even for the age of the game.  Characters, objects and buildings all have low poly counts and low resolution textures.Sound: 5Below average sound, the standard screams, grunts and kills. But impact noises, sword clashes, etc.  Make no sense and don't sound right at all.  But aren't so bad that they distract from the game either.  They are simply there.Music: 8Above average, the music does a good job of setting the mood of the game.  You may actually feel hyped before a battle.Gameplay: 9Excellent gameplay, sword motions feel smooth and fluid.  Easilly controllable as you gallop on your horse mowing down enemies.  It does however take lots of practice.  Don't expect to hop on your horse and be the medival rambo immediately.Impressions: The game drops you in the world and lets you get started.  It gives you no direction at all and it's up to you to figure out what to do.  Such is the nature of a sandbox game.  The poor graphics do break some immersion until you get used to them, sort of like playing an old PS1 game.  The graphics these days are garbage, but if done correctly they can still immerse you.The game starts off very difficult and slowly gets easier as you get better and your character gets stronger.  The reverse difficulty curve can be problematic but also exciting as you feel yourself getting stronger and better at the game.Value: 10As this is a sandbox game, you will get many hundreds of hours trying every angle of the game.  And your money supports the developers, telling them you want more of these games, more of this niche genre, less AAA garbage.Summary:If you can ignore the poor graphics, this is a very good game, ready to let you do whatever you want			",111,25,12,38,14,1,21

												Warband is a prime example of function over form. It has a straightforward and unattractive interface, mediocre-at-best graphics, awkward animations, and fumbling dialogue. But you'll reach a point about an hour in where you stop even noticing the rough-around-the-edges presentation and get sucked into the mesmerizing flow of trading, battling, looting, and questing.This game is without a doubt a masterpiece of balance and fluidity in game design, if a bit of a failure in visual design. While seemingly imperfect, it comes together to make one of the greatest games of all time.			",350,87,6,43,24,5,77

												This seriously is the only game I play, its such great f*cking game that I recommend to all my friends or anyone that wants a game that they could play for a verrrrrry long time. Make your own story, build an army and join the fight as one of the factions or just thug life and attack everyone. Pillage towns or protect your towns, attack caravans or have your own caravan, heard cows (dont heard cows) you name it. Dont look over this game because the graphics, it shines in the gameplay. There are some great mods for this game which for me added a sh*t load more things to do. Fight in the medieval era (native), the napoleanic wars (dlc), or in fuedal japan (mod). Havnt stopped playing this or ever thought about stopping from playing this game. Well if you ever get this game I hope you have as much fun as I did destroying everyone who dared cross my path! >: )			",79,6,0,6,6,0,8

												Probably one of the most addicting games of it's genre. The combat system is amazing and unique. The skill base system makes it a very rewarding game. The singleplayer features countless hours of gameplay which cease to bore you. You control the game with multiple choice actions and such. The multiplayer is unique in it's own way as it features numerous gamemodes which you can play with your friends. You can join a server on the official server list or you can host a private server for just your friends. There are no fixed goals to this game. You can set them for yourself. Stay as a mercenary or become a king. You can work this game at your own pace. Once you get bored of the game, try out the countless mods and DLC. If you open yourself up to the learning curve, you will find a game unlike any other.			",40,3,0,6,9,0,5

												Mount and Blade: Warband hmmm........Well I guess I'll start; Mount and Blade: Warband is a 3rd / 1st person RPG, that allows you to play pretty much as whatever you want, whether you want to be a tyrannical warlord or a paragon of good its all up to how you want to play the game.Starting the game you choose your character, you can be either a man or a woman you then decide on starting stats that will be determined by choosing various options which can be added to when you level up. There are two modes to this game an overworld in which you navigate the map and the 3rd / 1st person mode in which you fight, walk around towns, castles and villages; In the overworld map you can move around and find traveling bands of lords and bandits moving around doing there own thing. The main part of MB Warband is to start out with nothing and raise yourself to greatness this can be achieved by recruiting companions, training troops and starting your own kingdom or perhaps become a vassal of an existing one.My usual way to play is to join the Kingdom of Nords wait till I have a lot of gold, troops and maybe a castle or two before renouncing my pledge and going on my way to establish my own empire. The graphics have been said by many to be lacking but given the age of the game and the size of the team that made it, as well as the exceptionally awesome game you can't really hold the graphics against it.The sounds and music are hit or miss I would have to say, though they do try their best to add to the atmosphere and does its job to complement the game and immerse the player in the world of Mount and Blade: Warband. Although I have mainly played singleplayer, the multiplayer of Mount and Blade: Warband is where this game truly stands out, I have spent almost a 3rd of my total time on this game playing multiplayer whether playing serious battles fighting for the glory of my team, or stuffing around with a group of people who just want to have some fun there is generally something for everyone.Overall I will say Mount and Blade: Warband is a fantastic little game that you can easily loose hours and hours of time playing. Expanding your empire or helping a King to expand theres honestly this is a game that needs to be experienced and is one that should be in the library of all gamers. (Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)			",154,77,2,35,24,2,31

Although I have mainly played singleplayer, the multiplayer of Mount and Blade: Warband is where this game truly stands out, I have spent almost a 3rd of my total time on this game playing multiplayer whether playing serious battles fighting for the glory of my team, or stuffing around with a group of people who just want to have some fun there is generally something for everyone.Overall I will say Mount and Blade: Warband is a fantastic little game that you can easily loose hours and hours of time playing. Expanding your empire or helping a King to expand theres honestly this is a game that needs to be experienced and is one that should be in the library of all gamers. (Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)			",154,77,2,35,24,2,31

												Probably one of the most addicting games of it's genre. The combat system is amazing and unique. The skill base system makes it a very rewarding game. The singleplayer features countless hours of gameplay which cease to bore you. You control the game with multiple choice actions and such. The multiplayer is unique in it's own way as it features numerous gamemodes which you can play with your friends. You can join a server on the official server list or you can host a private server for just your friends. There are no fixed goals to this game. You can set them for yourself. Stay as a mercenary or become a king. You can work this game at your own pace. Once you get bored of the game, try out the countless mods and DLC. If you open yourself up to the learning curve, you will find a game unlike any other.			",40,3,0,6,9,0,5

												Definitely the best open world role playing game you'll find, if you like relaxed games with huge modding potential. You can play with cheats for quick, action-filled games, or without for a more serious experience. My favourite mods: Blood and Steel, Floris expanded modpack, The eagle and the radiant cross, Native Expanded, Prophesy of pendor, Sword of Damocles, Shogun mod, And of course Battle time. Battle time is a mod that allows you to host all singleplayer battles as a multiplayer game, allowing other players to join as either any of your heroes or your soldiers. This mod only works with Warband 1.153, Which can be obtained from the Taleworlds website. Use the CD key you get from Steam, and voilá!Now, if you like story-based games, i recently discovered a little known mod. Its made by chinese modders, which guarantees its amazing quality (but also its awful translation work). It has everything from cutscenes, in-battle dialogue to special abilities such as sprinting, Energy strikes and more! You can whistle for your horse, configure your own spoken lines in battle, use special tactics and even change how your party travels at the world map! Its especially nostalgic for those who are familiar with anything between Dynasty Warriors to Final Fantasy. Seriously, if you ever get Warband, you -NEED- the ""Light & Darkness"" mod. Trust me, you wont regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the BEST game ever made. The graphics might not be the best, but you don't buy this game because of the graphics. The gameplay and community is the best I've ever experienced, especially when you're in a regiment.The game does not have the best graphics, but have that cartoon feel over it. You find yourself playing as one single soldier in massive 100v100 battles. There's also a lot of different mods for this game eg. Game of thrones, North & south, anno domini and so on.I highly recommend this game and would recommend that you buy the DLC called ""Napoleonic Wars""			",67,2,2,5,30,1,15

												I've had this game for awhile now, forgot to make a review, The game is great, challenging and full of adventure. Mods make it worth your time, and the battles when scaled higher are amazing. (Viking Conquest does this for you already up to 750)Just a few pointers, Battle size can be changed in your documents/warband/rgl.txt file, under battle size, should be at 1.0000 changing the single digit nearly doubles the actual size, very performance heavy. ex. 2.0000 will be 270 units instead of 150. Or 2.5000 will be 240 or so.Turning AA and particle systems off, makes the Fps go up alot even on a super computer.Now for Load Textures on Demand. If you have a modern day computer this should ALWAYS be off. Makes the game run way smoother on a medium to high end computers. Basically when it's off it loads everything before the battle so there's not as much lag. > (somewhat Longer loading periods between battles)Now to do this on Modules that are from workshop/moddb/nexus etc. (Don't go to nexus). Moddb is prefered, You have to go into the individual Module.ini and add the following lines under the mod name. Without doing this you will recieve a crash as most modules don't have the following lines.reduce_texture_loader_memory_usage = 1use_texture_degration_cache = 0use_scene_unloading = 1If you have a newer GTX card you can use DSR in your Nvidia game lib to run the game at 4k upscale. Makes it look a little neater.Hope this helps people, great game. Bannerlord will be even greater I'm sure. 9.8/10			",154,10,0,27,5,0,10

												Mount & Blade: Warband is the second installment in the Mount & Blade franchise.-You may find a simple review below the main review with the pros and cons of the game. Warband added many new features from the original, and one of the largest was multiplayer. Multiplayer is in my opinion Warband's strongest attribute. The PvP combat is excellent, the maps are well made, and the experience overall is superb. Battles are large and epic, ranging from perhaps 10 people on each side to over 100. The vast array of weapons to use assures a new experience every time you play - everything from One Handed Swords, One Handed Axes, Spears, Bows, Crossbows, Javelins, and huge War Cleavers. Each faction (six in all) has a unique loadout, which adds a unique flavour aswell. Sieges are also quite ferocious and time consuming, some taking almost an hour or more. Combat involves a four-directional combat system, and a simple but practical approach to projectile drop. The community for this game is amazing, although players in Asia and North America may find slight problems finding populated servers due to the majority of players being centered in the EU. The Singleplayer is fun, but very repetitive. Your objective is to have the entire map controlled by one faction or your own. You can do a variety of quests for lords, kings, and villages - but are all repetitive. The character levelling is good, with a good array of choices to make your character how you like. A variety of different mods that are available for this game adds to the replay value of both the Multiplayer and Singleplayer aspects. Pros+Intuitive Combat+Great Mounted Combat+Sounds and Soundtrack are superb+Singleplayer has wonderful RPG elements+Many mods and additions to add hours of fun to the gameCons-Aging Graphics-Hit Detection can be a bit sloppy-Does not have DirectX 11 support (DirectX 7 & 9 only)-Smaller community than most games-Singleplayer has many repetitive aspects and quests (which can sometimes be snuffed with mods)Overall Rating: 8.5/10 (Good game, has a few flaws)			",74,7,0,4,24,0,21

Some of the best Warband mods include Star Wars: Conquest, Floris Evolved, Native Expanded, Nova Aetas, Perisno, and Diplomacy.Mount & Blade: Warband is an outstanding game. I've conquered Calradia more than once, put a pretender on the throne a couple of times, and joined every faction at least once. This game just doesn't get old. Plus there's some pretty insane mods like Floris Evolved, Native Enhanced, and Diplomacy to extend the game and keep you from getting bored. There's also the fact this is a Sandbox RPG meaning you play the game how you want to play it. I'm very excited to see what Bannerlord expands on and hope it keeps most of the same features. Anyways here's my breakdown of Warband:Pros+ Can be run on a potato+ Includes 80 Steam Achievements and 10 Steam Trading Cards+ Everything elseCons- Takes time to build an army and gain reputation in the kingdoms- Graphics are a bit distasteful, but acceptable- Mods made for older Modules are usually not compatible with the latest version of WarbandMy Rating: 10/10 (Recommended) ",89,5,0,7,3,0,5

												It's basically an enjoyable game where you can lead armies and have your own fun playing and fighting in wars of politics and violence. A typical game that anyone in their young teens from 90s-2010s thinking ""Damn imagine a game where you fight in wars"", this is basically the best game of that in my honest opinion. This is a great game to replay over and over and over, its great for people who like focusing on one game. It is also great for making many friends in the community and saves money of wasting on typical terrible games that many triple As fail to do nowadays.			",196,19,3,31,11,2,31

												Where do I begin to describe a gem such as Mount and Blade: Warband.As you might imagine, I am in love with this game, it's the game I always turn to when I'm bored and the game I can never get enough of. (Even if I happen to still be aweful at it). In Singleplayer you start of as a lonely wanderer, with a personal background that you customise as you enter the game, but I wouldn't bother to much with that, story isn't barely present in the game, it's basically an all out war between 6 factions who all want to rule the land with you in the middle. After a few moments you'll attract your first followers, most likely villagers from some village that urges to join you in your journey, and that's where the game takes off. Wether you swear yourself to one of the lords of the realm or decide to start your own faction by throwing caution to the wind and attack without any other lords to back you up, Mount and Blade will swallow your time.The first time I actually sat down to play the campaign, I stayed up for 3 days straight, with only brief pauses from the game, they were meant as more permanent pauses, but the urge to do just a few more actions kept creeping up on me. To make it even worse, I listened to The Sultans of Swing - Dire Straits for almost the entire time, as it felt incredibly fitting for mounted warfare as I swung my sabres.And if singleplayer sandbox combat isn't your thing the game comes with a fantastic multiplayer scene, where there almost always is atleast one server with plenty of people playing the various multiplayer modes. The amount of players have taken its toll a bit recently, but there's still enough players around to get a few good games out. There's, as I said, many different modes, but the one I prefer most is Siege, which puts you in the role of either an attacker or defender of a castle (I know, who would've thought?) and it's really enjoyable.All in all, this game is a fantastic time sink, especially if you're as easily impressed by swords and bows as I am. Allthough the graphics may be a bit on the bad side if you're some sort of graphical mastermind, but in that case you're missing out.Tl;dr : You ride horses and hit people with swords in an open world, I like it a lot, so much so I wrote way to many words to describe it.

												The definitive version of one of my all time favorite games. A brilliant role-playing strategy game, wherein you get to make your mark on the world and fight to build your name and empire, if you so desire. Trader or warlord, rebel or dissident, there are countless possibilities to explore and a vast continent filled with bellicose kingdoms to conquer. The combat is phenomenal, with an intuitive and complex fighting system and easy to learn troop commands. Despite its sub par looks, it is still very much worth playing.			",693,221,38,103,88,7,116

												Note: to see this reveiw with text formating and in-game pictures, go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/07/gamemount-and-blade-warband.htmlMount and Blade Warband is a game made by Turkish game studioTaleWorlds Entertainment, it is a large-scale battle RPG.The game plays more like a Total War game where you get to fight on the feild. you explore the world using a over head map. then you click on cities/towns/etc and it loads into them. to make it clear there is no real ""open world"" in the game. you don't not walk to the next city with you and your army rendered, you are simply represented by a man on a horse that walks across the map. when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense, seeing as you can get up to 250 or more troops, it would be a pain to walk all the way with that many people with a system just like skyrim.So the meat of the game is the battles, you get to watch your army attack the other, and you yourself can engage the enemy on the field of battle. with a handy add-on the Warband Battle Size changer  you can go up to 700 men per battle. however, the M&B game engine will be highly unstable if you use any number higher than 300.  Combat in Warband is gritty and fun. you can use all kinds of weapons. they have Swords,pikes,bows, and more. all have different abilities and such. hitting an enemy with a powerful Pike attack, can kill or knock them out instantly. and that brings us to another thing in M&B, the ability to capture people. with some weapons you will knock out people instead of killing them. after the battle you can take them with you as prisoners. Nobles and kings can not be sold, but anyone else can. you can even make them join your army as soldiers. however that will hurt your army's morale.Morale in Warband plays a big part. lots of things can hurt your troops morale. things like fighting with a companion (a special person you can find in taverns that have backstorys, will speak to you about things.)raiding defenseless farmers. not having any food. not paying them. or using captured prisoners as soldiers in your army. if morale gets too low, some of your troops will start to leave during the night and you can even lose you entire army this way. In Warband its hard to go alone in the deadly world of  Calradia, as such you will most likely find yourself working for a lord or noble. at first they will give you annoying repetitive quest, but soon you will start rise in the ranks. the Lord/Noble will call you for a grand attack on one of His enemies and you must join him. during this war if you take a castle in a siege your lord/noble may give it you as your own. once you are well known can even marry the daughters of other Lords/Nobles, and get larger amounts of land. of course you can just try to take over Calradia on your own, but then everyone will hate you and try to kill you. but running your own nation and forcing people to respect you is one of the more funnest things to do in Warband.The big downside of this game is the visuals. yes i know, graphics aren't everything, but Warband looks barley better than PS2 graphics. however, with all of the crazy fun battles you'll be playing it will be easy to over look the games graphics.if you like fun combat and huge battles then Warband is the game for you. just don't expect it to play like Skyrim or Oblivion.

												Mount and Blade: Warband is an amazing Medieval themed RPG that gives you the ability to build up your own kingdom and explore a very interesting and rather large world. It also combines top-down strategy exploration with 3rd person RTS gameplay with one of the best combat systems I've ever seen in an RPG. You can roam around the world of Calradia with your party/army, fight against looters and deserters in open fields and other environments, and even siege/defend castles and cities. It is almost completely build your own adventure (with the exception of the starting mission) so there is no story to follow whatsoever other than the one you create for yourself. This also comes with a fairly decent multiplayer, some cool DLC and heaps of awesome total conversion mods that you can find on Moddb, Nexusmods or Steam Workshop. The only downside I would say would be that it is a bit dated in graphics, but it's made up for the amazing attention to detail in this game			",23,2,0,5,4,0,1

												What happens when you play Mount & Blade: Warband? I'll tell you. First, you develop an external membrane that serves to insulate you from the outer world. When this process is complete, the sun pulls closer to the earth, the seas dry, crops fail, and everybody dies. Except you, you in your room, playing Mount & Blade like your very existence depends upon it. Calls go unaswered, e-mails unread, cheques bounce; loved ones move into separate rooms before moving on entirely. But not you, in your room; trading with the people beside the sea, plundering the balls of isolated villages. You have ceased to exist, remaining only as an enclosed photo in the locket of that old woman in the popular motion picture Titanic©.			",173,111,3,17,13,3,23

												Mount & Blade: Warband is the epic medieval adventure game you always wanted that does not follow a story line like Skyrim but is an open sandbox where you are free to do anything. While the Native singleplayer is not the greatest thing in the world you can (If you're like me) find yourself clocking in hour after hour playing it. The game was developed to be easily modded to fix that issue, and the community does not hold back, you can get mods from American Civil War to Zulu Wars. Single player is one thing, but more importantly we have multiplayer, Mount & Blade can boast 24/7 active servers that can hold up to 200 players. You can play Native multiplayer, Napoleonic wars multiplayer, or get a mod for multiplayer like the mod I listed above ""Zulu Wars""One thing to keep in mind is Warband was actually a low budget game, it is quite apparent hence the graphics are not the most amazing thing in the world, and the animations are a mere decent, but that is more like the cover of a book in this game. What it has to offer inside is amazing and shows overly much potential. Tale World's next game in the Mount & Blade series ""Bannerlord"" is going to be a high budget game since they got alot of money from Warband. So support this game and it's devs and you can see an even greater game. Warband and the entire series is definitely a 10/10 and worth every penny.			",46,5,2,7,32,0,26

												Open-world medieval sim Mount & Blade was, I think even the hardcore aficionados will admit, not a very easy game to like. It was ugly. It was unwieldy. The user interface looked about as nice as a crab with a lecherous wink and it probably took at least three or four hours before anyone mastered the art of hitting things from horseback. In that way, standalone expansion Mount & Blade: Warband is no different. One other undeniable truth about the original Mount & Blade though was that, once you had spent the time to learn how it worked, the sense of reward you got from actually surviving it made most other games go pale in ashamed comparison. Actually getting the timing and aim right so that you could shoot a charging rider off his stallion with a single arrow offered a sense of giddiness that’s hard to top.And in that way too, Mount & Blade: Warband is no different. Therein lays one of Warband’s biggest flaws though; that it might not offer long-time fans a different enough experience from the original and that, while there are plenty of improvements, many of them haven’t been pulled off with the level of polish you might have hoped for. It’s better, but not as good as it could and should be, in other words. The actual aesthetic is an excellent example of this as, for all Warband’s talk of improved visuals, the game still appears incredibly basic by almost any standard. It’s not so much in the look per se, as the textures are now more or less up to par, but more in the way it moves. The models are still rudimentary at best; animations slower than a slug trying to climb out of a greasy bin bag.And yet, as seems to be a recurring theme for Warband, there are exceptions to the rule. HDR has been added in for example and, while in most games that’s not exactly something to get excited about unless you have an unusual fetish for simulated momentary blindness, Warband manages to make it an actual part of the gameplay. Castle sieges, which make up one of Warband’s new multiplayer modes, can be won or lost by the placement of archers on the parapet because wily warriors will stand with the sun directly behind them. All assaulting forces will see is a volley of arrows spewing out of the sky; they’ll be unable to draw mark on defenders.			",222,41,5,20,22,2,36

												This game is a prime example of what RPG games should be. There is a lot of character customization, a deep story that you make all on your own, and it doesn't have to end. And when it does end, it's after a few hundred hours of gameplay. If that isn't enough for you, it has dozens of mod that make the game even more unique and fun to play. A mod I recommend highly is the Gekokujo mod, which allows you to play the game from the perspective of a samurai in feudal Japan. This game is truly wonderful, and I recommend it to anyone that has a deep love for RPG games, or just games they can pour a lot of time into. There are a few bugs here and there, and the graphics are definitely dated, but the game is still a wonderful experience that shouldn't be missed.			",244,30,2,20,23,1,17

												Buy it, end of story. And if anyone tells you otherwise, YOU PUNCH DEM IN DA THROAT. Because they are dirt liars! Or they just have really bad taste and they should never touch an rpg game ever again.But really though for $20's you get so much content from such a little game. Which interestingly contradicts the word small since it technically has content worth over hundred-  Nevermind, but the point is, it's worth that twenty dollars or whatever currency and amount is required.But I also suggest buying the ""Napoleonic Wars"" DLC and downloading a mod called ""Gekokujo"" for even more content to get the most entertaiment out of it.But as a word of advise, try not to go overboard like the others such as I, >_> I don't even have a job yet and I still feel like i'm wasting my time with this game.

												note* Its going to be hard to explain all of my feelings for this game as it is one of the best games to ever exist on this earthThe PriceI got this on sale but I tell you that this game is worth every penny full pricePremiseMount and Blade Warband is a sandbox RPG thta takes place in the medival eras of as fantasy land called Calradia. You create a character that can have many backrounds for RPing. When you start a bandit attacks you and the only little bit of story is started to help guide you. I won't say anything on that because this game is best experienced not knowing the setup/ mechanics.CombatThis games combat is extremely skill based. Each slash with the sword is directional for attacking and blocking. Bows and Arrows are not easy to use and horseback slaying is  satisfying If you have been looking for a game with ealistic medival combat then by god you have found the game for you.FactionsI am not going to say much becuase each faction is cool and feels like a working breathing organism and only after playing 100 hours I have only scratched their surface. By the time you have picked one you will become fiercly loyal to their cause/conquests. You will argue over with your friends who is the best as each has its own pros cons.DiplomacyDiplomacy can be conducted by anyone and usually requires knowledge of each npc's likes and needs. This is how you rise through the ranks in factions but in my opinion can only consist of doing a bunch of varied fetch quests. There are mods like Diplomacy that you can find on the workshop that greatly enhance the experince. All these come toghether and make it feel like your character is just another part in a breathing dynamic world. That is why this game succeds and some rpgs dont because by god its addicting.ModsThey are god, really good. I suggest try the ones on Workshop and then venture off into Moddbs hardcore/ original mods.SummaryBuy it, stop reading, buy it. It has first person shooting is has thridperson it has everything.  Now go venture off into Calradia.			",113,9,1,11,11,0,24

Mount and Blade has been my best friend since I was 8 year's old, it has provided me with the best quality gameplay I could ever wish for and you'd be damned to say this wasn't the second best game in the world, (second to Call of Duty ofc). Mount and Blade is for both the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and ""♥♥♥♥♥quot; kinda' guy's and provides the best booty this side of Tamriel! I haven't witnessed this much swag crammed into a game since Club Penguin and the player's take pride in sweating over a fun filled game!

												Mount and Blade: Warband is a sandbox RPG with a medieval setting, featuring a deep system of combat for melee weapons, archery, horse combat, and massive battles. Players can do anything from herding cattle and raiding villages, all the way up to becoming the Emperor of Calradia by one's own bloody hands. Somewhere in between, you will likely do a lot of it. There are many things to do in this game. One can go in search of tasks to help out the peasantry, lords and kings in the various factions of the war-torn lands of Calradia. There are tournaments to fight in, wars to take advantage of. It even has a large bandit problem, and someone's gotta get rid of them. If you don't want to do any of that, you can take advantage of the local economies. The game has a functional economy, and by exploiting trade routes and purchasing businesses, you can gain massive profits.One can become a lord, put a pretender on a faction's throne, and even do mercenary work. But the higher your ambitions rest, the more you will need support. Bump elbows with Calradia's rich noble class and this will become significantly easier. That's right, there are feasts in this game. Be careful when you enter the courts, for the nobility are scheming and trying to profit as much as possible. Calradia is hardly a land that espouses the values of Chivalry. Despite Chivalry being something of a thing. There is an in-game honor system. It's not a cut black-and-white morality system. Generally, if you make people suffer, you lose honor. If you help people and act benevolently, you gain it. But does the game ever tempt you to dishonor yourself. War is highly profitable, and peasants are defenseless. Moreover, they have very valuable things to take. And it destroys your opponent's economy when you raid, which will help your war efforts. There's a macabre decision making process as to when to be a shining knight.The game's combat system as mentioned before has a lot of depth to it. It can take a little time to get a hold of. Especially when you factor in massed battles, mounted combat, and fortress assaults. All of which require different tactics. You can order your soldiers around, tell them where and when to attack. It adds yet another level of this game to be able to fight alongside your own men. The melee combat system is particularly in-depth. It has a basic ""Simon Says"" system, where you can attack left, right, overhead, or to thrust. And you can both block and parry those individual attacks. Correct timing, and watching your opponent's movements are required to survive the battlefield. The weapons also have functioning speed and reach. A sword is quicker than a longaxe, but doesn't reach as far. So the person with the longaxe will try and keep his opponent away, while the sword user will want to close. You also can't use a big weapon in a shoulder-to-shoulder formation. You won't have the room. There is also the ability to do ranged combat. Throwing weapons, crossbows and archery mainly. In some mods, guns are available, but that will be discussed later. Each of the first three are different. Thrown weapons let you keep your shield up, but don't fly very far, and usually don't have much ammunition. But they can make a huge difference. Being able to throw spears or axes at your opponent before closing on them will give you a considerable advantage. Crossbows fire slowly, only require strength to equip, and are highly accurate. They also break through armor with ease. Bows have a draw system. The longer you hold your arrow, the more inaccurate you are, as you struggle to hold your bow taut. So you pick out your target, lead and arc your shot, and fire. It takes considerable mastery, but a bow can be especially deadly.Mounts are in this game as well, and they add even more to the game. You can engage in combat from horseback with nearly any melee weapon, lances, and even thrown weapons, bows and some crossbows. Horse archery is a tough skill to master, but is highly effective, as one should suppose. Melee combat on the mounts features the same system and strengths that the foot combat has. Charging down enemies with a lance and an axe can be highly satisfying. You can make passing attacks, or choose to charge your opponent. When you're fighting other cavalry, the option to go for the horse is present. It's not only an option, it's highly recommended. Armor also changes how you fight in this game. It will slow you down, but it will also protect you. If you plan on getting stuck in a fight, I reccomend lots of it. The setting itself is fairly bog-standard medieval setting fare. You have various kingdoms based from our real world peoples, all having different strengths and different tactics. It's somewhat anachronistic, with Not-Mongols fighting Not-Vikings and Not-Italians fighting Not-Russians. But this is explained in the backstory. Which brings us to one of the flaws in this game. The  setting and characters are not especially well developed. This is to leave the game's story open, as so many playthroughs will be different. After the game's start point, the AI factions react to each other and the player appropriately. Meaning that the game's story is precisely what you make it. But the lords and other important characters come off more as tour guides than as real people. The amount of open-endedness also gives you the feeling of being thrown into a pool and being told to swim.  But when you float, and start to swim, you get the feeling that you're creating the story. The ink is the blood, the quill a dagger and all of Calradia is the parchment. Each playthrough will be different. I have had one particular kingdom dominate the game in one playthrough, only to be crushed in the next. And that is part of the attractiveness of this series of games.The game boasts a skill and levelling system as well, typical for an RPG. You level stats, and choose what skills and weapon proficiencies to level. There are no classes, and no need for them. Skills run the gamut of things like first aid, pathfinding, leadership, and combat skills like power strike. You can find companions, who can take care of these skills for you. Companions are additional characters that you can fight alongside, level up and equip as you desire. Which brings me to the recruitment system. One can go from town to town, recruiting soldiers for their cause. Whatever that may be. Soldiers will also level up, when given battle experience and training.One of the game's largest strengths is the mod support. Modding the game is easy, often times one just has to integrate files to the appropriate folder, or simply install a mod and run it from the launcher. Mods run the gamut of small tweaks, such as Freelancer, Diplomacy and Pre-battle orders and deployment. Which allow the player to fight in someone else's army as a soldier, increase the amount of options for diplomatic actions, and to arrange your soldiers before a battle, taking some of the tedium away from command. Also available are gameplay overhauls like Floris, which keep the main setting, but offer so many tweaks that the game is nearly different. There are also completely new campaigns, in new settings. You can find many different ones. Europe in the medieval ages, dark age britain, completely original settings, and even Westeros are available. Respectively, they're named 1257AD, Brytenwalda, Prophesy of Pendor and Clash of Kings. There are many more mods available that I will not list, since it would take too long to list it all. But the game is not without flaws, for all the praise I just showered on it. The game's graphics are extremely poor. As mentioned before, the story leaves much to be desired, same with characters. The game's animations are also quite cumbersome and static. The combat can also feel slow, until you get ahold of it. I would reccomend it. There's a free demo offered here on Steam, if you're not sure you'll enjoy it.			",96,10,9,17,5,1,14

Posted: December 7, 2014
												After playing Chivarly I figured there wasn't another medieval sword game I wanted to play. I tried Mount & Blade and do not regret purchasing it.The reason why I support this game is it tried to take a different approach to gaming. From the user interface (UI) to the actual game play. I'll start with the story in which the game asks you questions in what type of adventurer you are (merchant's son, nobles son, peasants son etc...). From that it gives you a set of attribute points and allows you to add a few extras before you begin the game. I'd like to add that the creator(s) of this game added a great feature which makes exploring the world as well as the towns/castles a lot easier. Pressing select (or some keyboard button I'm not familiar with yet) while in a city/town/village allows for quick options to pop up (which means quick travel). You need to go to the tavern? Boom use your controller to choose it. Need to hit up the noble's hall? Boom hit select and use your joystick to select it. Wanna leave town? No problem. Because of this - the game by itself is notable. The game starts with you on a horse on a overhead map you can zoom in or out on. From this screen (which is paused unless you decide to move your character), you can view notes of mission logs, party stats, inventory and so on. This by itself adds an extra dimension to the game.There is a lot to do in the game and factions you can side with. You can pledge allegiance to a faction (by approaching the king) and you can start asking for titles of land/castles or become the marshal and lead the king's armies. You can go at it by yourself but it's quite difficult as a faction can start swarming you. The player goes around asking nobles if there is any tasks you can do for them. Sometimes they ask you to pillage villages of other factions to start a war or a fight. Some tell you to go collect their rent. Along the way you may run into interesting characters (doctors, mercenaries, vagabonds) that would be interested in joining your battle party. Individual soldiers can be upgraded and given roles (such as cavalry, archers, footmen etc...). Those vagabonds also can be upgraded to your needs, such as if you want someone to be a good engineer you can focus on that and then have another person focus on training your units. To recruit soldiers you need to go around to villages and attempt to recruit from there. As the game progresses so do what the factions do - meaning villages can be looted by other factions or just renegades. Renegades can also chase you around if you are not careful. You beat them you can win some cool things, lose though and you might become a prisoner for them. Fighting in this game is somewhat comparable to chivalry. You need to be facing in the right direction in order to block or get a hit. Like chiv though, it will take practice to figure out how to properly attack and defend. There is no shortage of variety when it comes to armor, horses, crossbows, longbows, swords, pikes, spears etc... There are tournaments that you are eligible to enter at certain times if not you may enter the arena and go spar (and make some money depending how you guys you knock out). After a battle you can also (depending on your prisoner capacity level) hold prisoners. You can ransom them off in taverns and it is a good way of making money. I will have to give this game an ....RATING : 8.1/10 Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B Overall  B...as I havn't found anything quite like it yet or near it's game play.UPDATE after 45+ hours : I like the game... definitely worth the buy. After you do quite a bit you'll find yourself trying another game. After you've done it all though you start wondering what else to do. It is a sandbox game keep in mind. If you have a lot of time on your hands you'll love this game.FOR FUTURE M&B games : after spending quite a bit of time in-game, would be nice to fight for some kind of purpose. How do you create or give a purpose? Create an online multiplayer world where players fight one another's kingdom. Make it their own kingdom, or perhaps pre-make the kingdoms and allow players to decide the fate of the multiplayer clans.			",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												*Mount and Blade: Warband is a open world game where you can play as the badass you have always wanted to be.   Essentially this game defines what a makes an amazing melee combat system, if you thought skyrim was good, then just wait until you experience this. It can be like Total War at times except you're controlling one person who is commanding an army that YOU have put together. What it lacks it graphics it makes up for in content.- Distinct and unparalleled combat system- Wide array of customisation- Great variety of mods that just adds more enjoyment- Got killed by 5,000 angry villagers after I burned down their village*I Recommend this game to fans of Chivalry or the Elder Scrolls series.*8.6/10			",142,15,6,18,9,1,7

												Mount & Blade: Warband (along with its predecessor, Mount & Blade) is a game so unique it is difficult to fit it snugly into one category. It's an action RPG, it's grand strategy, it's a simulation, it's open world. This game is a whole bunch of things that melt so perfectly together, and it is unlike any other game I've ever played. For anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in medieval warfare, this is the game you never knew you wanted.You start out by answering some simple questions about the life your character has lived thus far, and critiquing the way your heroine (or hero) looks. You are thrown into the large continent of Calradia which is split into six unique factions that are constantly at war with each other. The world map is familiar to those of us who enjoy grand strategy games; you can view the land and the castles/towns/villages/hideouts etc. that exist on it at any one time, while your character and her horse moves along it like a pawn on a gameboard. The colors of the names tell you which faction currently owns and controls each piece of land. What you begin to do from here is ultimately up to you. You can try doing favors for lords and kings to win their favor and ultimately work for them, whilst building up a small army of ragtag soldiers that you recruit and hire from various places, or you can be bold and try almost immediately to begin taking over land yourself (which I wouldn't recommend for the first dozen or so hours into the game).Battles in this game are nothing short of amazing. Both warring sides start out on opposite ends of the map (I've never seen the same battlefield twice, by the way, so I believe they are randomized based on the terrain type you are currently traversing). You can issue commands to your army, and this is fun to mess around with. For example, you can tell your archers to stand their ground and your cavalry to charge the enemy, while giving a different order to infantry. It's all up to you. By default, all units will charge, and for the most part, this is sufficient. You will then meet your enemy in the battlefield, where cavalry can run over infantry, archers can shoot riders off of horses, and you can kill horses while their riders are still living, making them fall face first into the ground before swarming them. Basically, if you've ever seen two opposing sides charge in a movie and have felt that intensity and awe, you can actually play as one of those people involved in Mount & Blade, and each and every time it's amazing. This game is fantastic for nerds like me who love anything medieval; not only are there full out battles like this, but you eventually (and your army) get strong enough to take over castles, towns, etc., and you get to be one of the units that is a part of this, each and every single time.The goal regardless seems to be to take over the entire map of land, whether through an existing faction or through your own, which you may create once you have a strong enough army to begin taking over land by force. Lords will double cross you, downright insult you, and even beg their respective kings for the rights to a castle you may have taken over yourself, and depending on the circumstance, you may or may not be jipped out of a piece of land you worked hard for. You can then, however, decide to accept that or give a one fingered salute to your king before renouncing your allegiance and going your own way. It is entirely up to you.I would highly, highly recommend you play as a woman character, even if you are not a woman in real life. The game is fantastic at reflecting the negative attitudes toward women at the time, and those mentalities can highly influence you during the game. For example, I created a woman character and named her after myself, much like I did for the first Mount and Blade. I set about leveling up my character and recruiting soldiers, and picked up a mercenary contract for a faction. After taking over three castles single-handedly for the faction's king, I spoke to the king, introduced myself, and asked to be promoted to being his vassal. He told me outright that he didn't care what I had accomplished. Because I was a woman, I could not be his vassal, and I couldn't own land. I asked him what would happen if I took an enemy castle by force, and he replied that he would ""think about"" letting me keep it. This sexist attitude (although very realistic for the time) got me so fired up that I promptly cancelled my contract with the king and began taking over his land by force. After about 40 hours of in-game time, he was exiled from the land, his faction was extinct, and all of his land belonged to a new faction appropriately named ""Rosie's Kingdom of Awesome."" About 40 hours after that, I was Queen of Calradia. But it all started because of my motivation to overthrow an arrogant and sexist king as the woman he insulted, and no other game has done such a great job of inspiring me to create my own grudges and follow through on them until I conquered all. This game is one of the most perfectly put together pieces of work I've ever played. I've seen people question the graphics, but I think the game is simplisticly beautiful (also, I grew up in the 90s--graphics don't matter to me). The game runs perfectly on my older non-gaming laptop, so that's also a plus for those of you looking for a large scale warfare game that can play on a toaster. There are some glitches, although nothing game-breaking (people spawned on the outside of a castle wall in 2/500 or so sieges I played, and I once had to sit out one siege because I fell through a crack in a floor of a castle tower and floated perpetually until my soldiers won the battle without me and I could exit). The character animations are a bit stiff, but I actually like them that way; it brings humor to the game for me, and if any future Mount & Blade doesn't have the stiff animations, I'll miss them.Mount & Blade: Warband took 90 hours of my life away in the past week, and very few games can pull me in so relentlessly. This game is one of my personal favorites, along with Mount & Blade (I haven't tried With Fire & Sword yet, but it's only a matter of time). A solid 10/10 from me. Buy this game. Buy it now, and let it consume you. :)			",461,269,16,130,96,2,166

Can someone please come around to my house and give me electirc shock therapy everytime I try to start up the game. There are some minor issues but all of these have been fixed by the amazing modding community. I love them! I must love them even more than my wife beuase when she asked me to choose either the game or her I tried to barter with her by selecting one of 3 options I wrote on a piece of paper I held below her. My kids have abbandonded me and now are in servitude to another kingdom and even my dog has expressed that it is unhappy been a part of the cureent company in the form of messes left on the rug.

												My Nord warband and I were defending our keep. The gates had been busted by the cowardly foreign pups. As I defended our flag, a puny man on horseback charged me. My hand flicked out like an adder's tounge, hurling an axe into his skull. He slumped in his saddle, as his beast ran past.I barely notice the other mounted weakling and the red tip of his lance. Odin protects his honored warriors and I manage to dodge the lethal blow. He circles back. Without speaking, a silent challenge is issued. He charges confidently, but I sidestep and my axe rips a red gash into his mount. He is flung from his beast as it crumples and tumbles forward under its now dead weight. Dazed and clumsy, he rises only to fall again as the axe kisses his collar bone. He will not dine with the gods tonight. More of his fellows are on me now. I will die this day taking many with me.

												This game made me fail 3 classes but I gained an entire kingdom.This game made me lose my girlfriend but I destroyed an army of sea raiders that outnumbered me twice.This game made me vote for Trump but I influenced a Lord to exchange his city for my villageThis game made me destroy ISIS singlehandedly This game. This game is awesome.In all seriousness, Mount and Blade: Warband is a game with outdated graphics where you can control a single character and slowly gain power into the world. You recruit soldiers, starting off with mere peasants and work your way up. Soon you can join another faction leader as a mercenary, swear oathes to him, and take control of a village. Soon you will marry, soon you can own a city, and one day a kingdom. Eventually, you may even control the world.An absolutely fantastic game that is hard not to enjoy, easily a classic. Highly recommended to players who love RTS, RPG, medieval themes, and realistic combat. On top of this all, if you get bored of vanilla, there are hundreds upon hundreds of mods, some of which are total conversion mods meaning entire new campaigns in different settings. There is easily 100 or so hours of gameplay in vanilla, and another several hundred with mods. (really recommend TLD mod, it's a LOTR total conversion)Game can be slow and can make you ragey at times, and the graphics aren't particularly jaw-dropping, but when you're doing well and commanding an army of 100 men strong and siege castles and raid villages, it's simply fantastic fun. All in all, a rating of 9/10 and an eagerness for the soon to come sequel.			",81,15,1,19,24,0,30

												It looks like a low budget Playstation 2 game, the game engine is janky as hell, the combat is kind of awkward and the shooting is pretty much luck based at distance but this is still one of the most fun times you can have in a multiplayer game on Steam. The 100+ player battles are something else. I don't really care for the single player but the multiplayer is a lot of fun.The Napoleonic Wars DLC is reason enough to pick this game up, it's unintentionally hilarious (i think) and there's nothing else quite like it out there.I love this game.

												Oh boy, where do I begin with this game.The Singleplayer is very fun. It's a 2 part RPG adventure - in the first main part your'e traveling around the world map with your band of warriors (which you recruit from villeges) in an almost free style maner - you can pillage villages, battle bandits and faction's armies, visit cities and buy from them, attack castles or cities and even participate in good ol medievel tournamnets. It's a unique RPG experience which I personally really like, however it can be frustrating if you have no idea what your'e doing. You start as a level 1 hero, and level up through killing enemies and completing objectives and quiests. Each time you level up you get to raise your stats (Agillity, Int, strength, charisma, all affect your adeventure in various ways), your skill points which also give many benefits and your weapon proficiencies. You can co-operate with factions and eventually join them and become a lord with lands. Your relationship with each factions affects the others, and if you end up in war with one of them their armies will make sure to chase you around the world map and battle you.The second aspect of the game is the battle mode - here you are in a 3rd or 1st person perspective, fighting your enemies along side your trusty warband in classic medievel combat. You command your troops to hold positions, follow you or charge. The goal is to slay all of the enemy units. Sounds easy, until you find out that you ARE NOT a super unit, and die just as fast as all the other ones. With good strategy and powerful warriors at your side you can win battles and gain glory and loot. The weapons and armour you loot or buy at cities, that you wear on yourself, is what you use in battle, and there is a wide range of weapons to use - pikes, crossbows, swords, cleavers, two and one handed axes, spears, lances, bows and many many more. You can also ride on horses along side your cavalry and slay the enemy with a hit and run strategy!By winning battles, looting villages and caravans and selling stuff you get money (called denars) which you use to buy weapons, horses, armour and food (which is useful to boost your party morale) and pay for your parties wages. A good way to earn money is to take prisoner enemy warriors or lords and then ransom them. I once sold a KING of an faction for 15k!Now we get to the most frustrating part of the game - Multiplayer and battle mechanics.It's fun. REALLY fun. But annoying. The multiplayer mod itself is very entertaining. You can participate in many game modes like DM, TDM, CTF, Battle (1 live a round, last man standing) and My favorite - Siegie, where you have to capture the defending team's flag as the attacker. There are many maps to play, and it's a fresh experience.  There can be up to 200 people in one server, which leads to massive and epic battles. You spawn each time with a set weapons and armour, which you can upgrade or replace with money you gain through killing and getting objectives. Each player has a minimum set of money they always have acces to when they respawn which they cannot lose (It's not uncommon to see fully naked peoeple running around with huge battle axes). This, however leads to the problems of capitalism - the rich, who have a lot of money buy the best gear and get only more money from kills and the poor are stuck with bad gear and stay poor because they barely get any kills (You LOSE MONEY WHEN YOU DIE!). In addition, The game suffers from various bugs, glitches, lags and inbalances, which make the otherwise flawless combat a source of anger. 2 Handed weapons are wildly over powered compared to one handed weapons + shields becuase of their much faster swing times and higher damage (+ Many break shields very quickly). Bows and crossbows are insanely effective with low money matches, where everyone has less armour but almost useless when used against very armed people. The hit detection can be broken at time, mostly for the worse - I've had many times when my arrows went right through and my axes did no damage at all. Blocking with weapons (not shields), although hard to master and is very rewarding, simply doesn't work at times. The horses are insanly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and always either stop dead on when you budge into something, leaving you easy prey for infantry with 2 handed weapons, or go compeltly the other direction and end up slaming into an obstacle - again, having you killed by archers and 2 handed axes. The game also has some hilarious glitches like the ""Sky Faces"".Overall, I think it's a very good game and I highly recommend you try it out. You will rage, but the best way to have fun is get better! (Or use 2 handed weapons, which ever works).			",43,1,0,9,1,1,2

												Very Addicting game, the controls take a second to get used to, and horseback combat is really hard until you get a good length weopon, but seeing as this game has so much depth its all worth it.I started off as a random bandit, carving a path of dispair through town after town hitting caravans. But as death rained upon me from the armies of those factions who I had royally screwed, I knew this was no way to live.40 days and nights I spent as a prisoner riding with a noble lord. Until the moment came and I saw my escape. Leaving the camp I swore to myself my ways had changed and immediatly sought an audiance with the Sultan of the Sarrinid Sultanate whom had not seen my waves of destruction on his towns.I beseeched Sultan Hakim, for a place in his court, to be a lord I asked. But he denied me saying I had yet to prove myself. So I set out on task after task after task, pleasing all the lords and ladies of the land of the Sarrinid People.Finally the time came and I too became a lord. Eager to impress I took my army of horseman and begin to pillage our enemies, destroying economies and lives the like. Soon I moved to castles, now taking swathes of land and claiming them for our Sultan, and of course I got a nice cut.But, then came the day when I captured a lovely castle from the kingdom of Vaegirs. I requested it be made mine and stocked it proudly with soldiers. Sultan Hakim on the other hand had a new shining lord who didn't have any land yet, so he decided it better to reward this, Whelp, before anything had even been accomplished. Thats when i ripped That castle and all the others i had taken away from the Sultan and started the Dark Empire. For you see i have now come full circle, laying waste to all, but now, now i have the power to do so, and Lords from all nations flock at my door step, Sultan Hakim, you can bow before me now, or suffer the full wrath of the Dark Empire, all its Lords, and I, the Dark Emperor!10/10 would ruin the world again			",116,29,9,16,80,2,31

												If you are going to purchase any Mount and Blade game, this is the one to pick up - this is the original, with more added, along with Achievements, and works the best as a standalone game.Mount and Blade is a sandbox game where you are a mercenary trying to make your way in a medieval world. This starts by recruiting a small number of followers who level up with you until you're a warlord with an army of over 100 members ruling over towns and tearing through the countryside. The combat mechanics are excellent, but the overworld options are sadly a little limited over time. Still, VERY easy to sink over 100 hours into this game. Highly, highly recommended.

												     Everything in life is about death and taxes. Mount and Blade is no exception, though it does manage to make it fun. Years before I bought this game, it was recommended I get it as soon as possible. I did look at it sure, but from the store page it looks like an old RPG that didn't age well and isn't relevant any more. I see now how wrong I was.     Sure I don't have a lot of hours into, but it's been a real blast to play and I've seen people with thousands of hours into it, so I don't see it getting any older any time soon. I bought it during the 2014 Summer Sale, I can't quite remember why. One of my friends was with me and we spent a good majority of our night laughing at how bad the enemy AI was, or the outdated graphics, or the war cries after winning a battle. There was something about riding into battle on a horse singlehandedly against 100 enemy horsemen just to be dragged around for days as a prisoner that was just funny. The entire game seemed like a big joke or parody towards the ""European RPG"" genre. I put it down not expecting to play it again until my friend bought it himself.     I restarted and decided to actually do the first quest and not go on suicide missions the entire time. What I was met with was a surprisingly open ended RPG that was fun to invest time into. I can't really explain it while writing it down, so I won't even try. I'll put it in a some kind of faux chart because everyone loves charts.THE GOOD Open-ended gameplay: You can be a merchant or warrior, you can aspire to be a powerful king or feared bandit.Unique difficulty settings: You can start off as a declining noble or a penny-less thief or anything in between. Obviously one will be harder than the others. Amazing modding scene.The fighting system is easy to learn and hard to master. The world is always changing, and should feel alive.THE BAD Pretty bad graphics The AI is ""quirky"" and might get annoying fastThe game can be really hard, and rage inducing ( at least for me)The war cries.

												Not only am I a fan of medieval themes in games, I'm also a fan of strategizing and thinky games. And Mount and Blade: Warband fits right in, from it's management of one's army, to the strategic combat out on the battlefield. It also features RPG elements like a customizable personal character with his or her stats and skills, the skill system is very elaborate and involved with all the different skills with their own unique purposes, encouraging the player to think carefully about what they want to put their points into when they level up. My favorite part about this game being the combat, of course, striking down enemies is ever so satisfying, and it's also most gratifying to loot an enemy after sending your men to mow them down. The factor of appeasement being added onto when it is executed after using a plan or good tactic that works, and learning what strategies are effective. My only major complaint is how frustrating Mount & Blade games can be at times. Like when, in spite of your path finding skill being well leveled and having a good horse, your party travels so slow that even on-foot partys of outlaws can outspeed you, which is just absolutely stupid. Regardless, this game still holds up in it's appeal to me.9/10 - Impressive.			",44,1,0,4,5,0,2

												Many people complains that the graphichs are suck in this game, but I for one, what everyone like to say; it's not the graphic that counts!Bought jus two weeks ago, and now I've hit 100+ Hours. The game's intetntion to be realistic, and sometimes it really hits that! I'm talking about the sword fight. It's the most realistic, fun, and challenging part of the game, and whenever I play some other game, I miss this fight system, because it literally ROCKS!!!You can attack in 4 direction, based on the mouse movement (or keyboard, even you can set it to automatic like defense, but trust me, you don't want that, that's the biggest challenge in the game), and if you riding a horse, when you hit the enemy with your weapon the speed of impact counts. (It's a multiplier, you can get 300% more damage if you on a horse with full speed, and both the enemy and you are running towards each other.The bow simulation is also perfect, it's one of the most close to the bow/crossbow simulation in the game world, just like sword dueling. I've been practicing with bows in real life, so I can say, Warband is SO CLOSE to the term of realistic. It's also a cookie that you can shoot with the bow from horseback in a different, awesome simulation system like none of the game developers implemented in their own game.It's an RPG game, so that adds to the FUN. But if you buy it, (and I hope you do, because its developers are not the richest out there, so they need YOUR support to make their game better) expect some bugs, and WTF moments, like when you realize how hard is to get money at HIGH level, or attacking a bandit camp. The bandit lairs above level 40 is literally impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. I wish the developers would fix that.And in online mode, Warband is like Counter Strike. (the equipment system I mean) You kill, you get money. You get killed, you lose your stuff. There are still more to be said about this game, but I'll let the others to do that! ;)8/10 Game, I APPROVE.			",65,9,3,10,11,2,6

												I LOVE this game. i got it because of the free weekend deal, and was promptly hooked on it. It is definitly a game for the serious player, and will cause some frustration when you get attacked by a huge force that crushes your best army, but the fun comes in rebuilding to wealth and Power. It also fetures great depth in balancing relationships to ensure you remain on top of the faction, and can be tricky to start. I fully recomend to anyone looking at it for the sale, and more. Easily a 10/10 for me.			",8,1,0,1,11,0,17

Being a badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I decided to make a powerful womynfolk character and try to smash the Calriadic patriarchy. Unfortunately this involved my character getting captured and gangraped by over 9000 sea-raiders but eventually I developed the skills required to be able to fight off groups of up to 3 people at once. Once you get your first Swadian Knight the game becomes easymode, set cavalry tactics to follow and then charge when in range of the enemy and your knights will then capture so many enemies that you wont have time to♥♥♥♥♥♥them all yourself. Theres also the whole issue of people hating on you for being a womyn but who cares, you can challenge them to fights and beat them up and laugh at them as their friends talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are for losing to an empowered otherkin like yourself. 7/10 Would spend 12 days sieging a castle with 300 men only to be murdered by 20 archers with.

												The laziest cat in America swaps places with the richest feline in England in director Tim Hill's lasagna-laden sequel to the 2004 theatrical hit Garfield. Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) is on his way to London to propose to his veterinarian girlfriend, Liz Wilson (Jennifer Love Hewitt), and his unflappable cat, Garfield, is determined to be there when Jon pops the big question. Of course, Garfield wouldn't go anywhere without his old pal Odie, and soon after arriving in the land of Big Ben, the clueless tomcat inadvertently changes places with royal look-a-like Prince. It seems that Prince's owner, Lady Eleanor, has recently passed away, leaving the care of her sprawling estate Castle Carlyle in the capable paws of her devoted kitty companion. The trouble is, Prince has decided it's due time for a vacation, and with Garfield in charge there's no telling what kind of trouble will befall Castle Carlyle. Despite having a devoted butler named Smithee (Ian Abercrombie) to cater to his every whim and a whole host of fun-loving critters with whom to pass the lazy days spent lounging in the sun, this crowned head begins to feel the sting of deceit as the envious Lord Dargis (Billy Connolly) hatches a dastardly plan to do away with the whiskered heir and claim Castle Carlyle all to himself. Meanwhile, as Garfield attempts to hold his ground against his greedy would-be nemesis, the fun-loving Prince is living it up with Jon and Odie by taking a trip to some of London's most popular pubs. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi			",95,4,1,13,4,0,6

												Calradia, a land of war split into several factions in which you become a part of. You may do whatever you would assume you could do in a Medieval Fantasy world and more. You can become a vassal, siege castles, raid villages, build an army, attack others, etc.. but the main premise: Conquer Calradia as your own sole kingdom. This is a daunting task and will take you many 100s, maybe thousands of hours of work to finish entirely. You must conquer every single castle, town, and village of all the other factions under your own name, uniting Calradia once and for all, so eternal peace is restored. This can technically be considered beating the game, even though there is not an official end screen. However, this is an extremely difficult thing to do, and if you do want to do this, it takes a lot of patience, skill, and ambition. It is truly an amazing feat. However, there is one minor thing that makes the game a bit less polished, and that is the graphics. To be quite honest, the graphics really are not very good. They are decent, it doesn't look like a NES game, but they aren't great. The thing is though, every Warband player can easily ignore this fact because the gameplay is so amazing.To show you even more good things about this game...It's value. This game is only 20 dollars and is constantly on sale for extremely cheap- only about 5 dollars. This game is so worth the price because of the sheer amount of modifications you can apply to the game and the insanely huge amount of activities you can do. 1000s of hours can be spent in this game and you will still have fun with it. It is just one of the best games ever created. No other game is like Warband, no other game can rival Warband, and no game will ever be able to take the place of Warband. This game is incredibly amazing and words cannot describe how good it is.			",107,7,0,16,6,0,16

												There is just something about this game that has managed to physically fuse me with my computer for over 800 hours, and I wish I could thank this thing to it's face. However that would be a meaningless gesture as I would be thanking thousands of lines of code. Be it the single player ""campaign"" (endless sandbox really) in which you are free to craft your own destiny in a war torn land, or the multiplayer where both the silliest and serious parts of medieval warfare are attempting to gouge your intestines out; I guarantee you will not have a social life outside of this magnifeicent game.

												This game is so much fun. It's one of those RPGs where you are put into a world then you just explore and stake your claim in the world. There isn't a main questline or actual things you have to do. You can become a vassal and spend the rest of your days serving a king, or you can build up an army and capture your own castle. There are plenty of things to do in the game. You can attack farmers and caravans, sell slaves, compete in tornaments, or help out the villagers. You have to have enough money and food to keep your party and as long as you have that they will fight for you. You can recruit villagers and train them up to be powerful warriors or you can hire mercenaries to fight for you.  Only gripe with the game is some of the quests are repetetive and some are almost impossible. The ones where you have to hunt down bandits on the road is hard because it is almost imposible to find them without a high tracking skill.  9/10-Like Skyrim with Mounts and Blades			",64,5,0,8,16,0,21

												Although Mount & Blade: Warband takes place in a fantasy setting, it is worthy of being called the best medieval warfare simulator on the market. Warband is an entire genre of its own, merging a sandbox RPG world with feudal politics and a complex simulation of combat. Miles ahead of its competitors, Warband's single-player mode offers a near infinite amount of replayability, and its online mode further emphasizes the brilliance of its combat system.Easily a 10/10, Warband is further supplemented by a host of breathtaking mods which can be found at the Taleworlds forums and Mod DB. My personal favourites are: 1. 1257 AD: an incredible historic overhaul which brings Warband into medieval Europe, as well as introduces a host of other improvements2. The Deluge: a historical overhaul that brings Warband into 17th century Eastern Europe, inspired by Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel.3. A Clash of Kings: Fantastic overhaul that brings Warband into the world of Game of Thrones.4. Iron Europe: a multiplayer overhaul that brings players right into the First World War!

												Great game, I'm completely hooked to this game and let me tell you why you should buy this:-There is no storyline but lots of freedom, so the player can create his own story. May it be a band of mercenaries or being a big part of an existing kingdom and attacking all these motherfuppers who dare to claim the throne.-Good mod support. It's fairly easy to mod your game yourself with a bit of reading, and there are many existing mods that add so much to the game.-Serious multiplayer. It's comparable to Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, but with a more mature fanbase and more serious people. Also, regiments.-Developers of this game are having a nice amount of contact with players through the forums and the beta tests.-A great amount of different troops, approaches and tactics. There is something for everyone, charging in with heavy cavalry or laying back with a pack of archers and crossbowmen. In battle, you can give orders to either Everyone, Infantry, Archery, Cavalry or a user-set group of units, giving you the maximum amount of control during battles and using your troops as efficiently as possible.Once you start a new game, you might want to build up a force as soon as possible because the bandits will ♥♥♥♥ you up if you don't have a big enough force of men.

Of death and destruction. Villages burned in the distance, people dragged from their homes, women♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children murdered. I saw what men were really capable of on those darkest of days where there was no law or order. Just us and them out in the grassy knoll where no one is safe, and anyone can die at any moment.I made a choice that day, as many of us do, to do what I felt was right.and it haunts me to this day.

												This game is basic in appearance and quite complex in practice. I wish there was a neutral button because that is what I would pick for this game. If you have a lot of time to invest and wish to play a game that give a little bit of depth and customization, this will be a fun experience for you. If you get bored easily and crave to be able to manage things at a greater level and depth then this game is likely not a good choice.I am going to give it a thumbs up because I did enjoy it but I do not feel like investing hundreds of hours to beat it.

												A complex game with many different facets and choices. There is no storyline as one would normally think of it, but the game has such a detailed and fleshed out world that you will very easily end up creating your own epic tale. You can be a trader, a governor, a warlord, a loyal knight in service to a king, a mercenary captain, a slaver, a bounty hunter, a bandit, a vigilante, pretty much anything you want to be. You can conquer towns, seige castles, raid villages, ambush caravans, rescue noblemen from prison to gain favor with them and their families, compete in tournaments to gain wealth and renown, help a claimant take their rightful (or not!) place on the throne, there really is so much to do.This game can be as easy or as hard as you like it, having the option to reduce damage done to yourself and allies if the game is too difficult for you or if you want it to feel like a movie (victorious hero defying the odds and all that). You may also adjust the size of battles to make them feel as epic or as personal as you'd like (Although the game does play better with larger battles, in my opinion)There are also a multitude of mods for this game, ranging from simple tweaks, to complete expansions, to total conversions. Alternate maps, historical maps, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, I think there's even a Star Wars mod being developed.At over 400 hours at the time of this review, this game is one of my all-time favorites, and Taleworlds have certainly earned a loyal supporter for life.

												A while back, I was on Gaikai.com playing a short demo of Assassins Creed: Revelations when I saw a demo for a game called Mount and Blade: Warband. Intrigued, I booted up the demo and started playing. I must have played the demo hundreds of times. It was some of the best fun I had ever had with a game. It may be listed as an RTS, but it is so much more than that. I can think of no other game that drops you right in the middle of the action, forcing you to charge in at the front lines rather than float above the clouds and click soldiers around a tiled map. Is it perfect? Certainly not. But no game is perfect. And any sort of problems you may run into can be solved by waiting. They usually clear up very soon. The quests, the characters, the world, and the gameplay in general all have a certain wonder about them, making it a must-play for all fans of medieval and strategy alike.Final Score: 10/10 - A wonderful game that can suck you in and cause you to lose countless hours. Truly a must-play game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so much fun. It's one of those RPGs where you are put into a world then you just explore and stake your claim in the world. There isn't a main questline or actual things you have to do. You can become a vassal and spend the rest of your days serving a king, or you can build up an army and capture your own castle. There are plenty of things to do in the game. You can attack farmers and caravans, sell slaves, compete in tornaments, or help out the villagers. You have to have enough money and food to keep your party and as long as you have that they will fight for you. You can recruit villagers and train them up to be powerful warriors or you can hire mercenaries to fight for you.  Only gripe with the game is some of the quests are repetetive and some are almost impossible. The ones where you have to hunt down bandits on the road is hard because it is almost imposible to find them without a high tracking skill.  9/10-Like Skyrim with Mounts and Blades			",64,5,0,8,16,0,21

												What exactly is Mount & Blade? Partly it is a medieval fighting simulator, partly role playing game and partly a strategy game. All of this is present in this huge chunk of buggy code wrapped in mediocre graphics. But that is little too harsh, because this game has something to overcome all of this. Flawless gameplay.You start by creating your character in not too deep creator. There is couple of background choices which will determine your stats. Stats are the RPG part of the game, you get all the basics like strenght, agility and intelligence, followed by skills that determine your abiliy to hold shields, ride a horse or get better prices from traders. At the very last there are the weapon stats, those are here to tell you how well you will fare with different kind of weapons. You can choose between bows, crossbows, short or long swords, spears and polearms.After you are done spending your points, you get a piece of the fighting simulator. You get thrown into an one on one fight without any sort of tutorial, this game is expansion after all, so you should already know everything right? Well, in case you did not play the original... Generally you use left mouse button for attacking and right mouse button for defending. That's pretty common right? But that is obviously not everything. By moving the mouse to either of four directions (right, left, up, down) prior to the swing you determine the manner of the attack. To add more fun to this, you can do the same while defending, so basically you have to check your opponent's movement and react fast enough to block. However if you are not up to the challenge you can use automatic blocking, in this case you will only need to time the block and the direction will be automatically chosen by computer. So that's it, quite simple is it not? Other weapons are similar with small differences mostly in possible manners of attacking. Ranged weapons are even more challenging. There is no aim indicator and arrows, bolts or javelins respect the laws of gravity, so it will take a while to get used to it.Well, that was quite elaborate description of fighting system, I hope I did not bore you. This leaves us with strategy part of the game. So yeah, after you finish your first fight you get your first quest (yep, another sign of rpg) and end up on a huge map, not too unlike Total War world maps, but way uglier, and move your character around. Everything is in real time, but since the time stops everytime your character stops, in principle the game is more similar to turnbased games. So there you are on a huge map, large groups of enemies moving around you. You may try to challenge one of the groups yourself and find out, that you are no hero, just another warrior who gets butchered when facing more than 2 or 3 enemies at once. At this point you get to one of the villages and recruit yourself a bunch of peasants. Soon enough you will find that peasants are more like meat shields and die a lot, but with a piece of luck and good commander (you) they can make it as far as to knighthood. This all sounds more like tactics than strategy right (wink)? Well, to be honest I am not sure how it works in vanilla (unmodded) game, since after original Mount & Blade, in Warband I started with mods right away.Yes, mods are the greatest thing that could have happened to this game. The basics are great but the game itself needed helluva lot of polishing to become a legend. There are tons of mods ready to be tried and some of them are really robust. I myself am using Floris mod pack (to be find on nexusmods.com) which combines many different mods improving graphics and gameplay alike. And the strategy part I was talking about is part of this mod, since in here, before the fight starts you get to strain your mind by choosing how will your units behave during the battle. You had probably already guessed that I think that Mount & Blade: Warband is a good game, well you are right, but with mods, it becomes a GREAT game.			",496,155,21,94,52,3,90

												This game is amazing, the single player campaign on it is pretty good, when I did the story mode I was a noob so I was forever captured which was rather annoying. I did manage to progress though and now I have conquered all of Calradia and have started a new game as a woman.The multiplayer for Native is also very good as well, you get more money for killing people so evidently, those who are skilled will have the best armour and weaponry, this does lead to some unfair fights but it does provide a good challenge for those who wish to improve. Apart from that I can't think of anything wrong with Native mode. Then there is that mountain of mods.I have played a few of mods, Iron Europe, Nord invasion, AZW Reloaded, Blood in the West and Napoleonic Wars. The Napoleonic Wars mod is awesome. The multiplayer on it is the best and the community is great too. It is on this mod where you tend to get most of the regiments and all that, they do massive events which can have a max of 200 people in so of course, lag is inevitable. It's in these regiments were the majority of people rack up their gaming hours and who's to blame, they are genuinely fun things to partake in.I have not played much of the Iron Europe mod but that is mainly because not many go on it. If more played it then I would definately spend more time on it too. However, the way how people tend to fight on it is mostly through shooting, and if you get too close then people have the tendency to retreat and gun you down or throw a grenade at you. There is definately some good potential for this mod though.The Nord Invasion mod is basically you and a maximum of 15 other people against waves of Nords. In order to progress you must make an account on the Nord Invasion website, through this you buy the equipment that you want and even level up. It is rather addicting and the last wave is quite the challenge. The way to win in this mod is through teamwork and also having good equipment. It is not hard to get good equipment as a lot can be picked up in the map for you to use, as well as this, you don't even need to kill Nords to acquire xp, you get it simply for near those who get kills.The AZW Reloaded mod, which is a Zulu Wars mod, for me needs a fair bit of patching because, for me it I had great big grey bars coming from the bots which obscured half the screen, however, the mod I believe has plenty of potential once it's fixed. The mod allows you to play as either the Zulus or the British and the maps will be historically based, such as Rorkes Drift etc. In terms of activity there are not many players and even less server.The Blood in the West mod is Lord of the Rings based. IT's focused primarily on the single play and the map is of Middle Earth. At the moment it only has the major factions, such as Rohan, Mordor, Gondor, Elves and Dwarves. I think though that over time more will be added. I have been unable to play it much due to the fact that it keeps crashing but from what I have been able to play, it does look really good. The background music is all from the LOTR soundtracks and it even has the main characters and beasts, such as the Fell Beast and the Troll. I have not tried the multiplayer so I shall not talk about that but I would highly recommend this mod provided that you can play it.10/10			",25,0,0,1,9,0,6

												There is an infinite amount of content within this game.I don't just say that because of the almost-standalone DLC's which completely restart your experience, not even because of the vast amounts of mods this community has created, each of which offers a whole new kind of game. No, Mount and Blade: Warband offers a rich, medieval world full of possibilities for you to explore. The graphics are simplistic, and the AI can be unbelievably stupid; yet, there's a sense of realism to it that even games with the best graphics seem unable to imitate. The only downside is the amount of time you will lose to this game and all its variations.Enjoyable, addictive, and above all rewarding; Warband is a game you will not regret buying.

												Although Mount & Blade: Warband takes place in a fantasy setting, it is worthy of being called the best medieval warfare simulator on the market. Warband is an entire genre of its own, merging a sandbox RPG world with feudal politics and a complex simulation of combat. Miles ahead of its competitors, Warband's single-player mode offers a near infinite amount of replayability, and its online mode further emphasizes the brilliance of its combat system.Easily a 10/10, Warband is further supplemented by a host of breathtaking mods which can be found at the Taleworlds forums and Mod DB. My personal favourites are: 1. 1257 AD: an incredible historic overhaul which brings Warband into medieval Europe, as well as introduces a host of other improvements2. The Deluge: a historical overhaul that brings Warband into 17th century Eastern Europe, inspired by Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel.3. A Clash of Kings: Fantastic overhaul that brings Warband into the world of Game of Thrones.4. Iron Europe: a multiplayer overhaul that brings players right into the First World War!

												Mount and Blade Warband is the standalone expansion to Mount and Blade, or the sequel, I guess that's really just a matter of perspective. Warband is basically the same game as Mount & Blade with a lot of new features, fixes and content added, most of which was taken straight out of the various mods available for the original. The only original thing Warband adds, and perhaps the most important thing, is the multi-player.One of the first and most sweeping additions is an enhanced skirmish mode as well as a full fledged multi-player. In you were pretty much limited to some preset skirmish maps which have now been replaced with a number of maps, modes and the ability to customize both your army, your enemies and your own character which makes for a much more enjoyable experience.Another new addition that gives you something to do outside is the addition of multi-player. Although Mount & Blade was never designed for with multi-player in mind it is something the fans have been asking for since the beginning and much to everyone's surprise, it works wonderfully. The multi-player is reminiscent of a regular big battle in the main game with the notable difference that every enemy and ally is controlled by a real human, something that ups the difficulty dramatically and opens up a number of different tactics to use.The single-player additions are all very nice but they also all things that were already available through the many mods available and as such they are not really that big of an improvement except for those players that don't use mods. There is a big graphical overhaul that helps shake off a little of a beta product feel the original game had, the animations and texture quality is still pretty low though. You also get a new faction based on Islamic medieval which is pretty nice but unfortunately it doesn't really fill in any of the unit niches that the other factions do. Politics have been greatly improved by including the ability to create your own faction which was only available through mods before.All in all Warband is a great improvement over the original Mount & Blade although I wouldn't exactly go as far as to call it a true sequel, it's a stand-alone expansion. And although all the improvements make for a much stronger base game almost all of these improvements were already available through mods with the exception of the multi-player which makes the game feel somewhat lacking for someone that has played the mods. That being said, the multi-player is an awesome addition and loads of fun and in particular if you get the Napoleonic DLC you will find some of the most strategic hack and slash gameplay anywhere.

												Ahhh adventure... what is better then living the good life of a nobody and raise to power. Of course you may have to cut a few heads on the way... escape looter, raiders,  forest bandit seek refuge in one of the regional kingdom, raise a army and destroy everyone else kingdoms. Not to speak of driving cattle horde. Marry a noble girl without his father consent. In clear your typical middle ages life.Mount & blade Warband offer all that and more.Also if you are competitive note that the game containt a multiplayer mode that is probably the most challenging PvP game out there, forget about the CoD and WoW of this world. To be good at this, you literaly need to stay in shape and train yourself at sword fighting to survive huge battle.This game is certainly one of my favorit indy game out there and my videos did help a lot sharing the interest for it to the world. =P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are 2 parts to this game: singleplay and muliplayer. They're both completely different. Singleplayer is more a worldmap strategy RPG. Once you get into battle it's a 3rd-person midieval battle simulator. There are many mods for singleplayer to fit it to a theme or playstyle of your liking. It is a very diverse and interesting game, with almost countless hours of gameplay.Muliplayer is also amazing. The combat is perfect. Simply swing or block -up left down right-. There are more advanced features to sword combat that make this more of a skill-based game. Ontop of that there are archers and cavalry. The game is balanced and broken in all the right ways.

												Great Great game played hours and hours out of this plus with the Napoleonic Wars DLC and some mods here and there is amazing i have had it for a long time (around 2 years) and i have only taken one break from it!  The only bad thing about this is that bots arn't the easiest to work with unless you're the marshal or the king trying to siege or fight a group of enemies.  Tips don't be with one kingdom too long or else they will be hard to defeat if you start you're own kingdom and make sure to go through with quests and missions it helps with your reputation a lot!  Also at the beginning stay active in making money from attacking bandits to fulfilling quests and such.  If you ever get bored of it or just want more I highly recommend the Napoleonic Wars add on DLC thing and join a regiment (kind of like a realism unit). Anywho Good Luck with it and hope yall have found this review helpful and ENJOY!!!			",64,2,0,3,5,0,5

												Incredibly deep indie game with a great blend of simulation, strategy and RPG elements. You can spend hours and hours in this game and you'll still have stuff to do. If anything can be criticized it would be the lack of a main storyline to follow seeing as you're mostly free to do whatever you want. There's quests and other things that will require your attention once you commit to them, though.The game also has an incredibly active modding community and was recently updated with steam workshop support.

												With more than 850 hours played, I can without hesitation state; This is the game I have played, with the most replay Value.You start the game as a nobody. You got pretty much nothing and no-one to help you, and are tossed into a merciless world of  feudal supression and war. Where ever you go, things are out to get you, be it Bandits, Lords or even your own men and companions!The thing I love the most about this game, is the way you can customize your character and recruit heroes that you train and equip with powerfull armor and what ever weapon you desire! They can serve as usefull warriors or highly intelligent advisers, that can make you travel faster, build cheaper or heal your soldiers! These heroes are meet in taverns, when their luck has turned for the worse, and most of them are willing to join you for nothing or peanuts! Remember tho, not all of these heroes like each other, and they will leave you, if you do things that break their personal code, like raiding vilages or loseing to many battles or taking high losses. Fear not, you can find them in the taverns again, and if you can not locate them, ask a traveller in the tavern!Further more about the vast things you can do in this game, is the modding. By the gods the modding. There are millions (nearly) of mods out there, and you are given the tools to mod yourself, if that is what you prefer!The game has a fairly steep lerning curve, but it also posses very forgiving difficulty settings, that can help you out in the beginning, since you can change the difficulity at ANY given time, in the options menu. There you can change the AI, your damage taken comparred to the enemy and even your own soldiers damage taken. Also minor things such as lance control, blocking and battle size.At last, i will say that the games sound, graffics and overall performance has aged very well for a game this age.Every gamer should play this game at some point.Best regards: Malmman!

												There are 2 parts to this game: singleplay and muliplayer. They're both completely different. Singleplayer is more a worldmap strategy RPG. Once you get into battle it's a 3rd-person midieval battle simulator. There are many mods for singleplayer to fit it to a theme or playstyle of your liking. It is a very diverse and interesting game, with almost countless hours of gameplay.Muliplayer is also amazing. The combat is perfect. Simply swing or block -up left down right-. There are more advanced features to sword combat that make this more of a skill-based game. Ontop of that there are archers and cavalry. The game is balanced and broken in all the right ways. It is total caos in the battlefield, bringing many a good laugh along with it. There are also many multiplayer mods that make for an interesting expereince.Overalll, this is one of the best games I have EVER played.

												A complex game with many different facets and choices. There is no storyline as one would normally think of it, but the game has such a detailed and fleshed out world that you will very easily end up creating your own epic tale. You can be a trader, a governor, a warlord, a loyal knight in service to a king, a mercenary captain, a slaver, a bounty hunter, a bandit, a vigilante, pretty much anything you want to be. You can conquer towns, seige castles, raid villages, ambush caravans, rescue noblemen from prison to gain favor with them and their families, compete in tournaments to gain wealth and renown, help a claimant take their rightful (or not!) place on the throne, there really is so much to do.This game can be as easy or as hard as you like it, having the option to reduce damage done to yourself and allies if the game is too difficult for you or if you want it to feel like a movie (victorious hero defying the odds and all that). You may also adjust the size of battles to make them feel as epic or as personal as you'd like (Although the game does play better with larger battles, in my opinion)There are also a multitude of mods for this game, ranging from simple tweaks, to complete expansions, to total conversions. Alternate maps, historical maps, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, I think there's even a Star Wars mod being developed.At over 400 hours at the time of this review, this game is one of my all-time favorites, and Taleworlds have certainly earned a loyal supporter for life. TL;DR This is one of the best games I've ever played, and certainly the best open-world RPG type game I've ever experienced. ",113,10,1,18,38,0,71

												Im going to tell you the story of Marc McStark of the Clash Of Kings mod. Marc McStark was a man who dreamed of domination and gaining the iron throne. His first act of domination was to take the Three Sisters , he took his army of around 300 men and took all three islands without struggle destroying the three sisters in the process. But this would come at a cost.... as the Vale declared war on his Kingdom that was named the Golden Islands ♥♥♥♥♥♥name i know). So King Marc decided to act with no violence and he convinced many of the lords of the Vale to join The Golden Islands (tottally no cheats used) taking all of their fiefs with them. All that remained was The Eyrie so he took that with all his vassals and placed Lord Nestor Royce in his prison in Sisterton. But all this time King Marc had no wife so he had to find one. By this time Kings landing was taking by The Reach and somehow Killed most of the Lannister family like Joffrey and Cersei (this actually happened) and Tywinn Lannister named himself King of the westerlands.King Marc decided to take Kings Landing and make one of his vassels marshall so he could rest and make a massive garrison at Kings Landing. King Marc took Kings Landing and was pronounced ruler of the realm but he still had to have a queen. The war with The Reach had just ended so he knew this was the time he travelled to Sisterton to marry his girl and then♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan. THE WESTERLANDS DECLARED WAR ON US AND THIS PRETTY MUCHED STOPPED THE WEDDING AS THE FATHER OF THE BRIDE WAS THE MARSHAL AND HE WAS LEADING A CAMPAIGN FFS GAME.All in all good game 10/10Would bang			",98,6,1,10,8,2,9

												Highly authentic medieval combat.  The most unique gaming experience I've had in a long time.  In 8 hours of this Action Adventure game I've trained in weapons, archery and horseback, fought in tournaments, searched for volunteers for my mercenary band, fought bandits and deserters, tracked down criminals, ran errands for lords, delivered ransoms, ransomed/sold prisoners into slavery, traded goods between villages, trained villagers to fend for themselves, delivered aid to said villagers, drove cattle, wrangled cattle, lost in battle and was captured several times.I'm still a lowly mercenary and have yet to even become a vessel, let alone fight in a war or earn a fief and who knows what else.This is NOT some text based RPG.  I can't put it down and highly recommend this game to anyone who loves this era.			",245,58,7,37,28,3,45

												This game is a masterpiece in many ways. First of all, the game has such a special feeling in it that many other games fail to provide. You really feel like a glorious warrior that is running down at the battlefield, charging towards the enemy.In this game, you can lead your own army. Not in the Total War style, but be down there on the ground fighting as a general. If you die, your unit loses. Simple as that.Even though this game is old, it still has the amazing feel to it, and it has a very big replayability chance. Eventually, if you get bored of the native Mount & Blade: Warband, I recommend you to go check out Napoleonic Wars, which I have written a seperate review on.Go on now, young warrior, grab this game and proceed on to the battlefields!

												I can honestly say in the last 10 years of playing literally hundreds of games, that this is the best one.I've dumped over 80 hours in the last 2 weeks into it and I dont feel myself getting bored. Infact, I feel like i'm just scraping the surface. As I play through a campaign of M&B Viking Conquest (I cannot recommend enough), I'm both totally immersed in this play-through, but also insanely excited thinking about what I'm going to do the next time. A lot of games shove really obvious ""This decision will change your play-through."" scenarios at you but still railroad you through the rest of the game. In M&B Viking Conquest, the choices truly feel like they carry so much weight. They truly feel like you have complete control of your destiny.I've always struggled to become immersed in Dragon Age, or other adventure or RPG games. The worlds are often shallow and predictable. I remain fully immersed in this game, my play-through, my companions, my armies. Long story short, I give this games a 9.5/10. The only deduction I can even think of is it has crashed twice in 80 hours. (But I save often.)Infinite replayability. Great gameplay. Great story. Cannot recommend enough. Not only worth the money, but knowing what I know now, would definitely be willing to pay triple-A title money for it.And spring for Viking Conquest Reforged. Pretty much mandatory in my opinion.I havent felt this addicted to a game since World of Warcraft. Except its not to grind. It's to levy armies, construct forts, spread lies about nobles, going on trade expeditions so I can afford to keep my armies, contracting ship-wrights to make me custom ships, spread Christianity to pagans,  --- But most of all, doing all this with the ultimate goal of revenge on a Jarl from a far away place. Infact, there are other Jarls and Nobles who have crossed me as well. I wont forget that and I will see revenge for those transgressions as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily one of the best games ever made in terms of concept and playability, especially for the price. Make your own adventurer, start a small warband or a large one from the troops you prefer, work as a sellsword, be a merchant, fight in tournaments, help desperate peasants, take a castle, be a noble, build an empire; or don't. If you ever get tired of those things the game only has like ten million mods to choose from. So....y'know, the replay value is not infinite but it's still pretty close.			",49,16,0,7,11,0,19

												This is my favourite game of all time, as soon as I saw it in 2010, I knew I had to have it. So my social life went down the drain, and if you ask me to go outside, be ready for a response like this: ""Outside? I've never heard of that server"". But seriously, this has the best melee mechanics I've ever seen in any game, a good hitbox and damage system, and a great variety of weapons and armour. The singlelpayer campaign is sandbox, which makes the game a hundred times better. You can create your own kingdom, become a lawless bandit, marry somebody because you love them, or for political intrigue. Or when you're fed up with diplomacy, try hacking your way to victory in many battles which end in bloodbaths and hundreds if not thousands (Yes, thousands) of men dying in the same in-game day. And yes, there is LOADS more in this game, but I just don't have the time to write it all in :)And then the multiplayer, there are many modes such as Battle, Siege, deathmatch and more (Which are boring tho). And when you're bored with the native gameplay, (Which is keeping me going for thousands of hours), try the Napoleonic Wars DLC, which unfortunately doesn't contain any singleplayer, but the multilpayer is a must have for M&B fans and will add so much to your game. Or, even better for singleplayer people, mods!! I have personally stacked up around 400 hours atleast on the Clash of Kings mod (Game of Thrones) for this game, and it's just so good. Overall, this is the best game of all time for me, and I just can't wait for Bannerlord to release this year!!			",46,3,0,9,14,0,24

												I'd like to call myself a connoisseur on Medieval role-playing games, though there's so many more out there that I've never played, and most likely never will. This would have been one of those games I'd have had a look at in the Steam store and then never considered again, but a fanboy-friend of mine convinced me otherwise, and boy, am I grateful for that.I usually have a strong dislike for all games that do not feature semi-photo-realism graphics. In fact, I was absolutely abhorred by the lack of a strong character-creation component. I loved Skyrim's and Dragon Age: Origin's character-creation. Hell, I even preferred some MMORPG's character graphics over this game's. I had to force myslef to stop whining and actually try the game. And when I did, I found that the true gem that this game is, doesn't rely on graphics or beautification and landscapes to get you addicted, but rather on the absolutely amazing gameplay.The game's combat system trumps that of any other game I've ever played, and the game offers you a wide variety of options to reach any end. Also, it recreates a much more realistic, much less sophisticated view on actual medieval feudal society. It also boasts a great warband combat system, as the name suggests. The options and formations take a while to grasp, but in the end, it's a system better than in any other game, as far as I know.			",106,9,1,18,3,0,11

												This game is just purely amazing. Unlike other games which have fancy graphics, indepth story lines and up to date performance, this game has an amazing community, a great combat system (which actually requires learning) and a good modding community.Along with Napoleonic Wars, the first DLC, this game makes great multiplayer playtime (and single player is good aswell), and will hopefully be proud of the next installment into the series, Bannerlord. I am one of the nearly master race players now (with nearly 1500 hours in 15 months) and I have to say, there is no other gaming experience like this. It's a must have (as long as you join a clan/regiment ;D)Notes:  - get teamspeak3  - remove girlfriend  - remove other social life  - put in earplugs to defend against american squeekers  - get something to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of when you rage quit  - use greatswords  - practice practice practice practice  - join the 2nd on mount and blade and play with 180 fellow 2nd members  - never have a life again<3 xoxp.s.  look out for betty the bomber <3			",56,2,0,8,11,0,18

												Truly an amazing find. Despite being an older game with outdated graphics, the gameplay is unparalleled and very, very entertaining. The main selling point however, is the opportunities the game gives you to create your own deep and intricate story. I've only run into one or two glitches in the game, and neither were crippling. I would definitely recommend getting this. However, this isn't to say that the game is perfect. Far from it. Here's a list of things it could improve on:1: Less prerequisites for marriage. Unless you're Stud McHotmuffin and you succeed your eloping proposal on the first try, there's like, 20 things you gotta do to marry someone. You need their father's approval, which means doing over ten fetch quests for him (or many more if you've previously fought him in battle, which would first require a hefty bribe to get him to even listen to you). Then, you need to pay him gold for some reason (remember kids, women aren't people in medieval games). THEN, have the father remain in the game for the whole process. Why's this an issue? Well, paying him then sets up a waiting period of like, 13-30 turns. If he gets exiled from the continent in that time (which he almost always does, since you need to be a high level to successfully romance anyone, and by that point, only a few factions remain), your marriage is broken forever. You can't ""leave"" the relationship, either. So you're f*cked. This happened to me.Now, I'll explain the whole exilation thing in my second point.2: No exilations. See, generals cannot be ""killed"". They get knocked out instead. This is stupid in and within itself, but here's how the game handles this predicament. EVENTUALLY, a general will anger their king, and they'll be relieved from duty. This makes them join another faction. Once they've been exiled from all factions, they get exiled from the continent. AKA they get deleted from the game.Why can't we have, like, a small chance of killing them, rather than this crazy bullsauce? It's arbitrarily complicated.3: Better fighting mechanics. True, the large-scale battles are the best I've ever seen. That does not mean the game has good combat mechanics. They're just so stiff and awful. It's one of those ""jerk the camera to the right to swing right"" kinda deals. Attacks that are just clicks with no mouse-swinging are far weaker than other attacks, and most of the time (guaranteed for polearms) they will do 0 damage.  Also, blocking is OP in this f*cking game. It just sweeps anything you can throw at them.4: More things to do. There are taverns, but you can't drink at them. The most you can do is buy everyone else a round, which gives you a +1 in that city. There are a few instrument weapons in the game's code, so why can't we play instruments? Being a bard is one of the backstory choices, after all.5: Cheaper costs. It's nearly impossible to get far in this game without loads of gold, and the grinding required to get said gold takes too long (and is too difficult. You can't grind for gold because you don't have that shiny new sword that costs 60 billion Zimbabwean dollars)6: The ability to give a standard uniform to each unit type that we control, assuming they're part of our own faction.7: The ability to improve armour and weapons. You see, there are a variety of ""tiers"" a piece of equipment can be, but it's all randomized. There's no way of improving a ""rusty teutonic helm"", it's just a low-quality helm forever. However, I like the idea that horses lose tiers by getting killed in battle. That's a thing.			",163,9,0,14,8,3,35

												Mount & Blade: Warband is the sequel to Mount & Blade, a medieval-styled RPG where you create your own specific character, customize it's backstory the way you like, and play in an open world however you choose. There is no real story to the game other than the story you decide to create, which makes this a different type of RPG than we've come to expect. I have not had the chance to play the original; However, the graphics for Warband look a bit dated and the slightly wider than normal field of view seemed to give me a little bit of a headache. The open world aspect of the game makes up for the visual limitations, though the tutorial I thought was a little awkward. Mount & Blade: Warband also has a multiplayer mode and comes with the ability to be modded. There are a couple of Downloadable content packs, Napoleonic Wars which is for multiplayer, and Viking Conquest which is for single player. There is also a newly released edition of the game called the Reforged Edition, which is supposed to be an improvement to the game, though I have not had the chance to look into this further. In all, I think Mount & Blade: Warband was fun for an RPG, but I would have liked some kind of story. It has some drawbacks visually, but makes up for it with versatility and player customization. If you like Open world RPG's and want to create your own story, this is a game you should try out.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I cannot recommend this game highly enough. One of the most exhilirating and satisfying gaming experiences you will ever have. A glorious combination of deep combat mechanics, kingdom management, and sandbox roleplay, there's really no other game like it in existence.Since its release many games have tried to capture the format to varying degrees. I have enjoyed watching this game develop from a sleeper hit to a bona fide ""must-play"" title over the years.The combat is brutal and intense. There is no hand-holding, and even though you can change the difficulty it is still realistic because no matter how well-armored your character might be, you can still be brought down by a well-placed spear thrust or arrow. The closest thing to experiencing medieval combat outside of the Society for Creative Anachronism.The mods Floris Mod Pak, A Clash of Kings, and 1257 AD push the envelope and expand the gameplay in exciting new ways. Buy it during the next steam sale, you will not be disappointed.Many people play this strictly for the  multiplayer, which is worth it by itself. A legion of modders have worked to improve the ultra-realistic combat settings and given players even more places and soldier-types to rend, maim, and kill.			",456,134,8,101,62,5,144

												I must say one of the most complexicating games I have ever played. The game can throw you down into the dirt and it can simultaneously beckon you to ride onto it again. Some aspects of it include the fact that the singleplayer mode is only grea when you apply cheats as when you intially start, it is all interesting and great. You get some basic essentials and enough money to get a handful of peasants. Then you finish the starter game and you realise you are able to take on some bandits and robbers and other riff raff. Then you become richer and realise you can acquire more troops upgrade them to be quite decent and added to your skills such as surgery which help to reduce losses of troops you can have a hefty crew. Add to the fact that you can also decently outfit yourself to take on a few robbers too. But then the wall appears - You are so strong, taking on robbers all the time is just a waste and the only real way to progress is to start provoking some silly Lords. But then doing that can actively put yourself at war with a whole faction which is just great when you have about 50 soldiers and each lord can potential have about 200 or so soldiers and that is just one Lord!!!! This is when you either pack it in and leave, commit yourself to slowly and painstakingly gaining more ground on the faction by resorting to one of few options, following an allegiance. It will work but the politics and minute details in joining a faction is so complicated that it has made myself come to the conclusion of just pressing alt + F4, turning off my computer and just joining some Gym or group to get the same enjoyment. I mean seriously who would spend their time trying to persuade and get on good terms with certain lords and then spend hours and hours leeching power from the faction, marrying the General's daughter so that he can do whatever you want, just to get a measly foot hold on some castles and villages to make your own faction. You would definetly do this otherwise you would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by ten lords having 200 - 300 soldiers in approximately three to four days of being able to capture a castle. Yeah capturing a castle is a diffcultly and a half. Try getting some soldiers that don't even know which end of a sword is pointy up against one hundred archers and crossbows that will just waste the lot of them before they run up that single ladder, I mean seriously ONE LADDER to attack. Why didn't the developers think of having multiple ladders? It's just so much easier to defend and seriously if you were the one defending that castle you would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by 100 archers anyway, and then get wiped by 50 heavy soldiers if you were just lucky enough to stay alive. Also without any extra mods if you fall in combat the match automatically ends. It can be really upsetting when you are about even - even with the enemy and you just casually take a javalin to the face and you're like... Crap I just lost the match now I have to either run away or load to a previous save and re match. Seriously if anyone is willing to spend some time reading my crap they can learn a whole lot more of what a typical experienced warbander like myself puts up with, enjoys and dedicates their time to. There is also the fact that you need to really practice practice practice practice before you can even THINK about blocking with just a weapon. It's just too fastpaced to do it as a noob. Everyone has to always use shields, but over time you get used to dying every time and you practice and practice and you get it like second nature. By then I ask myself again, why do I dedicate all this time, it's like a skill I have to learn! Neverthless I am not finished moping about the game yet. Once you get over the fact of trying to get one castle you really have to learn how to protect that castle. You need to be some kind of wizard, which I suppose you can be once you level up quite nicely with some faction which you have dedicated so much time leveling up with to rake in hundreds of fresh recruits, taking them to a training place, spending hours to make them from recruit to seasoned knight or foot guard or expert archer or crossbowman, then to go right back to the castle, drop them off so that when some stuckup bigoted lord decides to park his horse right up your castle, you can have a chance to keep the castle you so miraclously and painstakingly won. Politics and domination aside, the actual fighting of Mount and blade can be quite great and boring. Never have I ever felt so much fun trying to master blocking an up hit when I always go sideways block. Quite frustrating at first but then I just laugh it off. It is also a bit annoying when playing singleplayer matches with other lords when you really need a horse to actually survive the match. You can risk getting your head severed by some big burly knight that ravishes you like last night's dinner if you are on foot. If you use your head you can go behind  some of your troops, pick up a bow or crossbow or a pike and fend them off a bit. The mods really make the difference to the game. Having mods such as Diplomacy really make the game interesting, as you can actually have some Automated micromanagement of your Kingdom. It's really great for singleplayer! I never had so much enjoyment sending my Recruitment officer out to get 100 fresh recruits from any faction you want and they come back in about a week and then spend each day recruiting some recruits up to some seasoned warriors, and plus without you doing anything. It's great really to do that. It's also great if you prefer the poltical side of things, such as buying out kings or using other kinds of diplomacy to pave your way. I also found that once you become a king of some scrapple of a kingdom you own, It is highly difficult to get recognised as a king if you attempt to become one early on in the game. You really need to depend on royals and other npc follower characters which can spread some word about deeds you will do so you can gain more right to rule. If you don't have enough right to rule Kings will just laugh at your face if you send them a messenger asking for peace when they are busting your back side with 300 soldiers that are pillaging your poor poor villages. It is quite demoralising when you ask the King for peace and he just casually says, "" You want peace? Then trip on your sword."" Oh thanks king you just really made my day haven't you? You just promoted healthy living and state of mind for myself. I have a million things to do as King and you are not helping! Essentially, the game becomes your life. You spend most your free days just playing, becoming one with Mount and Blade. Eventually you just get sucked into this Warband Complex and you become that random charcter you been playing all this time. Now, after a brief overview of the Singleplayer side of things, Mutliplayer is really really great if you have a very good patience. Sometimes it just might be that guy everyone calls the ""Xbow"" who just sits on that corner of the map and has a chip on his shoulder and decides to let out steam by shooting you in the head all the time. Why he always picks on one target I do not know. Or the fact that all the major clans in the game are dead is also another matter to note. Despite that if you are Australian there is always a server up with under 100 ping to play on which the map is primarily set on the ""Arena"". It's a really small map but that is so great imagine spending five minutes trying to find some guy that ends up killing you with a two handed weapon anyway. This leads me to come onto weapons. They can be unbalanced sometimes, most of the times. Maybe it's the fact that a two handed sword can be nearly as quick swinging as a one hander sword but that's another problem. There is another problem that really annoys me is the lack of experience a whole lot of players have. The players that usually have experience are people in clans. Others just spam you with bows or two handers.			",25,5,0,2,1,0,3

												This game is awesome. If you haven't seen the combat, it is one of, if not the best combat system that I have ever experienced. The large scale fights with the RPG and sandbox mechanics are a great combination, and they were able to nail it perfectly, creating in my opinion, one of the greatest RPG that I have every played. The modding community also increases the amount of time that you can spend on the game. This game no doubt gets a 10/10			",99,6,0,12,11,1,4

Posted: February 5, 2014
												I must say one of the most complexicating games I have ever played. The game can throw you down into the dirt and it can simultaneously beckon you to ride onto it again. Some aspects of it include the fact that the singleplayer mode is only grea when you apply cheats as when you intially start, it is all interesting and great. You get some basic essentials and enough money to get a handful of peasants. Then you finish the starter game and you realise you are able to take on some bandits and robbers and other riff raff. Then you become richer and realise you can acquire more troops upgrade them to be quite decent and added to your skills such as surgery which help to reduce losses of troops you can have a hefty crew. Add to the fact that you can also decently outfit yourself to take on a few robbers too. But then the wall appears - You are so strong, taking on robbers all the time is just a waste and the only real way to progress is to start provoking some silly Lords. But then doing that can actively put yourself at war with a whole faction which is just great when you have about 50 soldiers and each lord can potential have about 200 or so soldiers and that is just one Lord!!!! This is when you either pack it in and leave, commit yourself to slowly and painstakingly gaining more ground on the faction by resorting to one of few options, following an allegiance. It will work but the politics and minute details in joining a faction is so complicated that it has made myself come to the conclusion of just pressing alt + F4, turning off my computer and just joining some Gym or group to get the same enjoyment. I mean seriously who would spend their time trying to persuade and get on good terms with certain lords and then spend hours and hours leeching power from the faction, marrying the General's daughter so that he can do whatever you want, just to get a measly foot hold on some castles and villages to make your own faction. You would definetly do this otherwise you would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by ten lords having 200 - 300 soldiers in approximately three to four days of being able to capture a castle. Yeah capturing a castle is a diffcultly and a half. Try getting some soldiers that don't even know which end of a sword is pointy up against one hundred archers and crossbows that will just waste the lot of them before they run up that single ladder, I mean seriously ONE LADDER to attack. Why didn't the developers think of having multiple ladders? It's just so much easier to defend and seriously if you were the one defending that castle you would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by 100 archers anyway, and then get wiped by 50 heavy soldiers if you were just lucky enough to stay alive. Also without any extra mods if you fall in combat the match automatically ends. It can be really upsetting when you are about even - even with the enemy and you just casually take a javalin to the face and you're like... Crap I just lost the match now I have to either run away or load to a previous save and re match. Seriously if anyone is willing to spend some time reading my crap they can learn a whole lot more of what a typical experienced warbander like myself puts up with, enjoys and dedicates their time to. There is also the fact that you need to really practice practice practice practice before you can even THINK about blocking with just a weapon. It's just too fastpaced to do it as a noob. Everyone has to always use shields, but over time you get used to dying every time and you practice and practice and you get it like second nature. By then I ask myself again, why do I dedicate all this time, it's like a skill I have to learn! Neverthless I am not finished moping about the game yet. Once you get over the fact of trying to get one castle you really have to learn how to protect that castle. You need to be some kind of wizard, which I suppose you can be once you level up quite nicely with some faction which you have dedicated so much time leveling up with to rake in hundreds of fresh recruits, taking them to a training place, spending hours to make them from recruit to seasoned knight or foot guard or expert archer or crossbowman, then to go right back to the castle, drop them off so that when some stuckup bigoted lord decides to park his horse right up your castle, you can have a chance to keep the castle you so miraclously and painstakingly won. Politics and domination aside, the actual fighting of Mount and blade can be quite great and boring. Never have I ever felt so much fun trying to master blocking an up hit when I always go sideways block. Quite frustrating at first but then I just laugh it off. It is also a bit annoying when playing singleplayer matches with other lords when you really need a horse to actually survive the match. You can risk getting your head severed by some big burly knight that ravishes you like last night's dinner if you are on foot. If you use your head you can go behind  some of your troops, pick up a bow or crossbow or a pike and fend them off a bit. The mods really make the difference to the game. Having mods such as Diplomacy really make the game interesting, as you can actually have some Automated micromanagement of your Kingdom. It's really great for singleplayer! I never had so much enjoyment sending my Recruitment officer out to get 100 fresh recruits from any faction you want and they come back in about a week and then spend each day recruiting some recruits up to some seasoned warriors, and plus without you doing anything. It's great really to do that. It's also great if you prefer the poltical side of things, such as buying out kings or using other kinds of diplomacy to pave your way. I also found that once you become a king of some scrapple of a kingdom you own, It is highly difficult to get recognised as a king if you attempt to become one early on in the game. You really need to depend on royals and other npc follower characters which can spread some word about deeds you will do so you can gain more right to rule. If you don't have enough right to rule Kings will just laugh at your face if you send them a messenger asking for peace when they are busting your back side with 300 soldiers that are pillaging your poor poor villages. It is quite demoralising when you ask the King for peace and he just casually says, "" You want peace? Then trip on your sword."" Oh thanks king you just really made my day haven't you? You just promoted healthy living and state of mind for myself. I have a million things to do as King and you are not helping! Essentially, the game becomes your life. You spend most your free days just playing, becoming one with Mount and Blade. Eventually you just get sucked into this Warband Complex and you become that random charcter you been playing all this time. Now, after a brief overview of the Singleplayer side of things, Mutliplayer is really really great if you have a very good patience. Sometimes it just might be that guy everyone calls the ""Xbow"" who just sits on that corner of the map and has a chip on his shoulder and decides to let out steam by shooting you in the head all the time. Why he always picks on one target I do not know. Or the fact that all the major clans in the game are dead is also another matter to note. Despite that if you are Australian there is always a server up with under 100 ping to play on which the map is primarily set on the ""Arena"". It's a really small map but that is so great imagine spending five minutes trying to find some guy that ends up killing you with a two handed weapon anyway. This leads me to come onto weapons. They can be unbalanced sometimes, most of the times. Maybe it's the fact that a two handed sword can be nearly as quick swinging as a one hander sword but that's another problem. There is another problem that really annoys me is the lack of experience a whole lot of players have. The players that usually have experience are people in clans. Others just spam you with bows or two handers.			",25,5,0,2,1,0,3

												Well, what Can I say? Not much really, This game really is impressive. After playing on it for hundreds of hours I can truly say this is a Go-To game, I'm not doing anything, Mount and Blade, easy as that. While it has its bugs and in some areas shows clear signs of underdevelopement (<not even a word) it truly is something of an innovation so to speak, Napoleonic Wars for instance is my main reason for this, I mean who has seen any other FPS set in the Napoleonic Wars era? While the graphics could be considered lacking the gameplay is the reason this game is what it is. Shooting, Melee, Artillery, Musicians. Whatever you want from a Napoleonic era war game, It's there. And now I've realised how much I've talked about this game, when I said there isn't much to talk about. In summary. GREAT GAME, If you can ignore the sometimes to frequent bugs and lag which may lead you to die rather abrubtly. Also, If you play musician and expect mercy, It ain't gonna happen, If you surrender and you expect mercy, it definitely isn't gonna happen.Melee can be an absolute B**ch sometimes, don't expect to be any good at first.BIG TIP: DO NOT JOIN THE 15TH ROF, I got banned for having a life. And getting a job.In fact I will probably be labelled a 'troll' or 'bush pirate' for pointing out a major issue with this game: THE 15TH REGIMENT OF FOOT NEEDS TO BE PATCHED!			",33,1,0,6,5,0,5

												A charming, rustic, free roaming rpg that combines elements of strategy, politics and 3rd person rpg combat. It's a sandbox game where you will have to grind quite bit, but it doesn't really have a clear goal and every type of activity is permitted. On its own the game isn't that great, since it somewhat restricts your freedom of actions, but make sure to install couple of mods (famous floris for example) and it will bloom.Also, there's a fairly popular multiplayer in place, but I'm not sure how good it is. Overall, I would recommend this game if you like to roam around fighting random battles, carving a piece of world for yourself by capturing cities/fortresses and you're willing to sink a hundred or so hours doing it.

												The best combat/fighting system of any game I have seen so far. Aside from being able to swing and block from whichever general direction you want, you can also feint, riposte, kick your opponent and knock them down. Fight from foot, or by horse with swords, bows, javelins, crossbows, maces, spears, glaives, cleavers, etc etc.Unfortunately single player feels a bit incomplete and lacking in some elements. Multiplayer on the other hand is where this game truly excels.Overall, this is a great game which will provides hundreds of hours of fun. There is also a large modding community which provides custom content (eg: Firearms, new armour, weapons, etc) to this game both in single and multiplayer.I have never played any better game than this one.

												I could say that I recommend this game but only for the "" single-player ""Multiplayer looks like this :#1 - Deathmatch = ½Why? It's just a regular deathmatch, you choose weapons and armor, earn by killing others etc. and your job is to...kill enemy nothing else.#2 - Fighting = ¼It's pretty bugged because you can spam with your attack animation making you unable to notice from which side actually enemy will attack. Looks like your enemy tries to strike you from right? You're wrong, he attacks you from above. That's the problem in fighting.Singleplayer :#1 - Story = ¿I can't actually tell if this game has a story, you're just in "" Calradia "" and there are few nations that will try to take lands from each other. You have three options - 1.Join nation and fight for your king   2.Make your own faction and try to capture each castle ( it's the hardest option ) 3.Meet claimants and help them recover their position then fight for them ( for some time they will stay in your party and be your soldier ). You can change it at anytime, you can be vassal one day and next day you'll make your own faction or you can help a claimant recover his throne then join a faction and fights against him.#2 - Battles = ½It's just a regular battle but if you're cavalry...AI is really stupid, even when you choose the hardest options they are still imbeciles. They maybe have the power to knock you out with one hit when on horse but, it's easy to outsmart them. If you're using cavalry you're mostly impossible to lose a fight ( of course if you use mods to watch fights after being KOed ) since cavalry is OP you don't have to focus on archers or infantry but the problem with AI difficulty comes when you're trying to siege castle. They start to think, use shields and attack you in right time, also they will try to move back or charge at you etc.If you're playing on easy then you just go with your sword like with a knife into a butter.#3 - Castles = ¾They look nice from inside when you're visiting towns but... It's really annoying when you're walking around streets for 2-3 mins searching for guild master ( yes there are mods which help with this but still you're supposed to meet them atleast once ) Sometimes when you visit castle and you want to talk with for example a fellow vassal then you have go through all the castle then go upstairs ( Nords )#4 - Trading = ½It's pretty nice that you can sell your stuff on marketplace but they have only limitted amount of denars ( currency )But there are bugs like :-You have armor with 52 body protection and 12 leg protection - It's worth like 5.000 denars to buy but 800 to sell?also buying armor with 54 body protection and 14 leg protection in the same marketplace is worth sometimes even like 80.000 denars so the hell is that?#5 - Units = ⅞About units, it's possible to notice difference in a normal soldier and veteran soldier, veteran has more damage, he moves back, uses block more often etc. while normal soldier is stupid and he just charges at you blocking your attacks like one per ten hits. They all look great and i really love how each faction has their own type of soldiers, for example. Rhodoks = Crossbowmans   Nords = Infantry   Swadia = Heavy cavalry.I recommend but I don't, use stuff i wrote as help to decide if you want to buy this game.			",152,15,0,13,9,3,39

												I found this game to be very much fun, although I do wish that there was more strategy i just feel like im swinging my sword into a hoard of buffoons, don't get me wrong its difficult and fun but I wish that you could set up your defence and offencive troops accordingly to your liking, but I recommend this game to people who are looking for a nicely made RPG and enjoy it for hours on end.

Once you get into this game, you will spend hundreds, even thousands of hours on it, especially with the large number of mods available, including:*Crusades*Musket warfare*Zombies*Game of Thrones  *Lord of The Rings*All sorts of original High Fantasy modsI can not recommend it enough.

												Bulid your army! Level up your character! Get yourself good wepons and armor! I love this game so much. Both stratergy aswell as fighting skills is requierd. Not only you get to fight other enemys. You get to command a army that you built up by choosen troops! with loads of commands. And you need money to your army and yourself. How will you make it? However you want! Raid villages. Fight bandits. Do quests. Sell yourself as a mercenary to a faction. Join a faction as a vassal and get a fief! (village,town,castle that you own and get taxex from) You can choose wich faction you want! (And/Or make your own faction! become king or queen take over lands conquer all of calradia!) but its hard to become a vassal. You will need much renown. Get it by fighting enemys. the bigger enemy army and the smaller your army is the more renown you get! (if you defeat them) Theres so much to think about. If you make the wrong choises it might f*ck you up later on. for example raiding someones village and then he gets p*ssed off and attacks you with a huge army. Defeats you and your army is dead or taken prisoners and you loose some of your stuff and money. You need food aswell to not starve your army. Then you need money and you need to buy it at towns or villages. if your troops morale is to low they might desert you (leave your army) so you need to keep your morale up by raiding villages, having good food, defeating enemys, dont just stand still and do nothing ofr a week. And make sure you can pay them every week. Or play the multiplayer! huge sieges on castles or battles with real players. Even though its a pretty old game it's still alot of players online. Up to 200 Player servers thats not always full but sometimes. but atleast 150 players. and it has thousands of mods, and hundreds of great mods, everything from graphics mods, mods that adds a few things, to huge mods that changes the map all the towns and castles and villages the troops and the factions. there are a mod inspired by game of thrones. the a clash of kings mod. and a mod inspired by warhammer. warsword conquest. the american revolution, and TONS of more exellent mods. aswell as it has an dlc. Napoleonic wars. fight with other players in lines. be a commander giving commands to other real players. besiege castles. fire cannons. be a builder and build bridges over water to make your troops able to get into the fight faster. or build sandbags to protect them from bullets. I would give this game 10/10! WARNING: if you really get into this game. It can be really addicting and you wont touch your other games for a while :3 now why are you reading this review still? go buy it alredy.			",122,6,0,15,14,3,16

												Mount & Blade Warband is a significant improval over the original game, it uses the motion capture technology, which makes all the character's movements a lot much smoother and life-like.  But the game really shines when it comes to gameplay. This medieval RPG, mixes Total War scale battles with action, it's a sandbox game, which means you can play litterly to no end. But the amount of detail put into this game is very impressive and makes it for a very good atmosphere. In general, it's a great game if you like the medieval era, the clash of swords and the strings of bows and especially a good challenge, for the combat system offers challenge equal to none in the video game industry. There is a free demo on Steam that you can try, to get a feel for the game.  It is indeed a unique product.			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

												So you've played every popular multiplayer FPS under the sun and are looking to ditch the guns in favor of something a bit more personal.   Well, this is the game for you.  Pick up your favorite melee weapon and get up close to your enemy so you can see that look on his face just before you stab him in it.  A good analogy for how multiplayer works in this game is Counterstrike without the guns.  You start each round with a set amount of cash and some free equipment and then pick and choose between your nation's weapons/armor of choice and then take to the field and try not to get yourself killed while hopefully taking a few of the enemy out along the way.  In addition to excellent infantry related combat, archery, cavalry and horse-archery are all represented as well if being a ground pounder isn't your thing. Also, although the multiplayer is a real blast, the game also features a great sandbox-style (think Sid Meier's Pirates) singleplayer game where you start off as a lowly peasant and work your way up to leading huge armies and ruling your own kingdom. There is no linear storyline or hand-holding you here, the game is what you make of it. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play a general from the Total War series from a first or third person perspective, this game will somewhat give you that experience. If you have a high-end gaming rig, you can set the battle size up to like 500+ units on screen at once (with a small third-party tool). The game's graphics aren't on the cutting edge of current technology, but they allow for huge battles.  Where the game really shines is in its combat.  It's one of the few games I've ever seen where you control your attack/block directions.  Watching 2 pro's go at it is akin to watching a well coreographed movie fight.I cannot recommend this game enough. You just don't see GOOD medieval combat anywhere really. This isn't some button hammering console combat game. Check out the demo!			",152,20,7,28,23,5,26

 Introduction I have been playing Mount and Blades: Warband for quite awhile now. And as I played I gained to love the Single Player with or without mods and Love the Multiplayer whether I am playing alone, with friends or with a regiment making new friends on the DLC Napoleonic Wars. But here I am going to be talking about Mount and Blades: Warband the best medieval simulator until the next Mount and Blade game which is Bannerlord. And this review will hopefully make you spend some worthwhile and unregretable cash on this simple yet advanced game that is Mount and Blades: Warband. The Game You first have a couple of options that determine your class, gender, skills, your family linege, your upbringing and your early adult/teenage life before setting out on a grand adventure. This game puts you smack bang in the middle of an ever changing world full of conquest, betrayals, trade, conflict and so much more that you have to descover yourself :). Will you be a merchant where your goal is to make as much coin and possible. Will you become a bandit pillaging the lands of Nobles. Will you become a man of Honor and fight for a just cause or will you do anything to get to the throne if that means cheating your way :3 (I recommend using mods as the choices are endless with many improvements). And many more options, the choice is yours. Graphics The graphics on the game are quite outdated and I give credit for the Devs for putting so much detail anyway regardless. This game was not made by a triple A title however the graphics are not too bad on High settings and with GFX enhancement mods. Nontheless the graphics don't make the game, as it has not really effected me much I love the game  with low settings as I played this on my Craptop but thats my opinion because I know people only care about the graphics...and if you ask me they are filthy casuals xD. But for real don't judge a game by it's graphics or the cover. Pros   Combat system  Medieval immersion  Unpredictable gameplay High replayable Open world Highly customisable Mods Visual mods Active cummunity Native/DLC Quite a challange ""Fair, This is Calradia boy"" -Merchant Difficulty CAN be reduced or increased Multiplayer is active and very fun LOW SPECS WANTED, yes if you have Low specs on your PC this game can most likely handle it Cons  Combat System is easy to learn but hard the master  Multiplayer is very hard for new players  The game is HARD in Single Player and is very unforgiving (I like this personally but I am use to it, when I first started playing I hated how unforgiving it was) Graphics without Visual Enhancement Mods AI can be quite dumb (Depends on your settings) And the last CON is the fact that you have not bought :3. In Conclusion  In conclusion this game is a blast with or without mods. But in my opinion you HAVE to get mods after you have played native or before...after all it's your choice. But with MODS you can do so much more that makes the game a 1000 times better with Politics, combat and much more. However I am not hating on NATIVE (without mods) because I started this game without mods and I still loved it, and you should too. If you are into medieval simulation and want to hack down a few bandits with your longsword GO RIGHT AHEAD. This game is by far one of the best games I have played EVER. It is everything you NEED for an amazing medieval game. Mount and Blades: Warband in simply ENDLESS of what you can do. The strategic options are very advanced and will punish if you make a wrong move. My final verdict for the game is a 9/10 for it is the BEST MEDIEVAL GAME OUT THERE TO THIS DATE.Drops mic....

												I've played hundreds of games, and can safely say that this is the only one that never gets old. Vanilla itself is a decent if rough around the edges product. However, Warband's countless mods and amazing community are what truly makes it shine. Not to mention one of the best melee combat systems out there. Take it from someone who's sunk almost 2000 hours into this thing D: If you never get any other game, get Warband.			",174,42,0,39,49,1,79

												with this game you can feel how would be to be a ruthless nordic conqueror with his shield and axe ready  to open skulls  of you foes or maybe the next Genghis Khan leading a massive army of mounted warrirors with the khergit or pherhaps  like a teutonic inspired   lord  with his big armor and big horse ready to stomp any on your path with the swadia or you may prefer to feel like the great saladin leading your  army of mamelukes ready to conquer all with the sarranid or you prefer the rustic and heavily armed foot troops of the rhodoks master of the crossbows with their large board shields and spears or maybe the peculiar russian like kingdom of the vaegirs to lead knights with bigs bardiches and heavy armor and with the best foot archers to back you up.it dosent stop there you can also mix the nations as you desire having the best of every nation or your personal preference or you can be a renegade a make your own nation with your own rules  and taking down other nations to finally be king of  all calardria or maybe you like more to lead a  mercenary band  taking what ever you want and doing jobs when ever you want without rules you are free to make mayhem and getting pay for that .also you have  military management with troops type  plus a in deep leading in battle field mechanic with commands and you leading your army into the fray plus rpg elements to develop your character just the way you want like a warrior with hand and shield or two handed or master of the bow or crossbow or even a more tactican leader doing the best formations in real time battle and morethe game is too big to fit into a tiny review since you can also have companions with full customization that will grow  as you do and you can make then the way you want also the diplomatic options and business for the lovers of sandbox and medieval times this game is a must have offers a lot of play time and a fun multiplayer with a  massive community support with mods addons and tutorials the quantity of mods is massive  you pretty much bought many games in one like if you dont like medieval theme   or you got bored you can have a mod that makes everything western style (my favorite ) with guns and awesome music or a game of thrones mod or even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  naruto mod  the quantity and quality of the mods that are still coming out is just stunningthis game is a amazing sandbox  with many options for every type of person  with rpg elements with a deep system of leading troops in battle with commands  it has a amazing multiplayer and a pretty active community with awesome mods i totally recommend it for the sandbox lovers  and im totally gonna buy the sequel			",258,54,8,38,27,4,29

												This game is most amazing game ever. It is a hell of a lot of fun with some mates, making some really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up characters. (top tip:If you see a guy with out a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up face he is probably new)The combat systems can be a bit of a TlT sometimes. Like  arrows not going under sheilds and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥great swords fainting all over the place but all in all its a pretty decent system. The campaign is great but takes alot of time and effort. You will probably be selling your bootay at the arena for 50 gold a day, but once your past that stage your on your way to becomeing king.The Multiplayer is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun, but takes some getting used to...be prepared to have abuse yelled at you for no good reason and have throwing axes and javlines impaled into your face.You might get kicked a fair few times as well...just suck it up and dont be a ♥♥♥♥♥ about it. It happens to everyone. Dont expect to be the best going into multiplayer aswell. That title goes to Cobb. Oh god i can still see his souless eyes as he massecres an entire team by himself. Any how it is a great game that deserves a play and if you see the Brothers be sure to say hi! Dont worry if you get a spear through your belly or an arrow through the head though. Thats perfectly normal. Im sure they will invite you in for a hangi as am appologie. But i have one last word of warning aswell....If you see Eddard Stark....♥♥♥♥ING RUN!Now go out and buy mount and blade :D			",61,17,1,10,6,0,7

												Where should I begin... This is NOT a good game. This is a gem. A gem that will soon be known all across the world once Bannerlord releases. This game is perfection for a person looking to play an action and adventure packed RPG in singleplayer. You got bored? Play one of the thousands of mods. Got bored of singleplayer? Fight the brilliant people in multiplayer in a siege with hundreds or a duel 1 on 1. The only reason why I will not give this game a 10 is because of the fact that the graphics are underwhelming to complete the picture of 'perfect medieval RPG'. Therefore I give this a 9.5/10 and when Bannerlord releases and gives me everything I ever desired I will give it a 10/10. Good community, great gameplay and brilliant mods.-Loke Reviews			",45,2,0,8,14,0,8

												I say this often, this game is the Stealer of Souls and my Life. I basically have sunk over a hundred hours into it, and I still can get back into it. About 60 of those hours was focused on the Native, but a single mod called Anno Domini really makes it so much better. It became a game that was all around Europe, and for it's time it is an amazing game. I have to stress FOR IT'S TIME however. It has multiple glitches and does not look nearly as well as most games that are similar, but if you are a gamer that can overlook that you will love the game. It can get boring at first, it takes time to get into the game, but give it a bit of a chance, and with a bit of imagination you can really enjoy the game to a wonderful point. You literally go from a common mercenary to a King/Queen. And I must say, being a Queen is rather awesome. Just the feel of people thinking you are in the wrong spot, conquoring the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them and then becoming well respected is quite good. Ladies, if you want to beat up men, play this. But I have to give it a 9/10, only point missing is that it hasn't come with a sequal, which I hear they are making, and I pray that it will be just as good, if not better :D.			",81,8,0,18,13,1,23

												For summer vacation, the Waits family has decided to vacation in the town of Nilbog, a remote farming community, where they will swap houses with one of the local residents and spend the summer living off of the land. Young Joshua Waits (Michael Stephenson) is contacted by the ghost of his dead grandfather, Seth (Robert Ormsby), who warns him about monsters known as goblins — malicious vegetarians who turn people into human/plant hybrids in order to eat them.Meanwhile, Joshua's sister, Holly (Connie McFarland), receives a visit from her boyfriend Elliot (Jason Wright), with whom she has been having relationship problems: Holly is concerned that Elliot spends too much time with his friends. Elliot assures Holly of his love for her, and tells her that he will prove it by accompanying her family to Nilbog.The next morning, Elliot fails to show up at the Waits house; parents Michael (George Hardy) and Diane (Margo Prey) grow impatient waiting for him to arrive, and the family departs for Nilbog. En route they meet up with Elliot, who has decided to bring along his friends Brent (David McConnell), Arnold (Darren Ewing) and Drew (Jason Steadman) in an RV. The family also runs across a hitchhiker whom Grandpa Seth uses as a medium to channel himself, warning Joshua that the town of Nilbog is the Kingdom of Goblins and that his family has been lured there to be made into food.Arriving in Nilbog, the Waits family discovers that the residents have left a large, all-vegetable meal for them. Grandpa Seth appears again, freezing time and warning Joshua that the food is actually a potion that will turn them into vegetable people. When time resumes, Joshua jumps on the table and urinates on all of the food.Meanwhile, Arnold takes a walk in the woods outside of Nilbog and runs into a woman, Cindy, being pursued by goblins. They seek shelter in a chapel that turns out to be the residence of Creedence Leonore Gielgud (Deborah Reed), who feeds them a goblin potion—the woman disintegrates into a mass of green ectoplasm, while Arnold becomes a plant/human hybrid. Creedence reveals herself to be the druid queen of the goblins, whose ""Stonehenge Magic Stone"" is the source of all the goblins' power; a horrified Arnold watches as goblins consume the ectoplasm, realizing that he will be next. Although Drew ultimately finds him and attempts to free him, he is killed by Creedence.That night, Holly is unintentionally contacted by Seth via a mirror and she and Joshua swap rooms. On Seth's instructions, Joshua destroys all of the food in the house, which only results in Michael taking him on a trip to the town general store the next morning. They find the store closed, with all the town's inhabitants attending a ""sermon"" about the evils of eating meat held by the town's demonic preacher. Joshua sneaks away to the church where the goblins have congregated. The goblins capture Joshua and attempt to feed him ice cream spiked with goblin potion, but Michael arrives, prompting the goblins to let Joshua go. A suspicious Joshua and Michael return home, only for the family to be met by seemingly the entire town of Nilbog, who want to throw them a party. Joshua runs upstairs to try to contact Grandpa Seth through the mirror, only to be confronted by Creedence in goblin form. Grandpa Seth suddenly appears out of thin air and chops off Creedence's hand with an axe, prompting her to retreat.Grandpa Seth and Joshua go back downstairs to prevent the family from eating any food. The town preacher (Mike Hamill) attempts to stop them by trying to banish Seth to Hell, but Seth causes a magic lightning bolts to ignite a molotov cocktail, killing the preacher. When the preacher dies, he transforms into his true, goblin form; Seth's presence and the sight of the dead goblin finally convince the family that they are in danger. Seth disappears, and the family barricade themselves inside the house.Meanwhile, Creedence transforms herself into a beautiful young woman and appears at Elliot's RV in an exotic negligee, where she seduces Brent using an ear of corn. As they begin to have sex, the corn spontaneously explodes into a flood of popcorn. Brent is quickly swallowed up and left immobilized but alive; with the family's last hope of rescue neutralized, Creedence heads back to her chapel.Back at the house, Joshua, Elliot, Holly, Michael and Diane hold a séance to communicate with Seth. Seth appears and tells them that in 10 minutes he will be permanently cut off from the mortal world. Although goblins invade the house and kidnap Joshua, Seth is able to pass him a backpack, which Seth informs him has a weapon that will save him from mortal danger; he is further able to tell Joshua that if he can touch the Stonehenge Magic Stone, it will drain the goblins of their power.In Creedence's chapel, Joshua opens the backpack and discovers a bologna sandwich. He eats it, ""tainting"" his blood with meat and preventing the goblins from consuming him. The Waitses and Elliot then arrive and, together, they all touch the Stonehenge Magic Stone, destroying Creedence and all of her goblins.The next day, the Waits family heads back home; Diane eats food in their refrigerator, not realizing that it was placed there by the family with whom they exchanged houses. She is transformed into a human/plant hybrid and eaten by the remaining goblin family; the film ends with a screaming Joshua being offered a piece of his mother's corpse to eat.

I AM THE BRINGER OF YOUR DEATH"" or ""I WILL DRINK YOUR BLOOD"" or ""ARHHHHHHHHAHHHHHHHHHRRRAHHHH"" after killing several playes at a time. i also remember the shouts of other players ""GO TO BED YOU HAVE SCHOOL IN THE MORNING"" or ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME ITS 3AM, SHUT UP OR I AM SHUTTING YOUR ELECTRICITY""..... not sure why they would say that but it happened, i promise you.thank you for all of the fun times and i hope bannerlord incites my lust for blood and glory once again!!!!

												This was my first entry into the Mount & Blade series, instantly becoming a favourite of mine. This is a fairly low-budget, open world RPG in which you create a relatively simple player background, leaving much to be created in your own imagination. While some may see this as a limitation, it's also a huge advantage for people who want to create their own identity within the game and focus on role-playing. You also choose one of the regions to start in, all of which have their strengths and limitations, for instance Vaegir are great at ranged combat, but not so skilled with two-handed weapons. Although this doesn't effect your character's abilities, simply the types of enemies and available weaponry. Part of what makes this game so great is the fact that you could literally role-play anything you wanted; an honourable knight, a brutal raider, or anything inbetween. You slowly build up your band of warriors and complete quests. You start earning the real money when you join your first military campaign by swearing an oath to a king. You can lead on to amassing an empire of property and riches, conquering the world map and even become a king yourself (with enough time of course)The combat system is by far the highlight of the game, with excellent sword-play both on and off horseback. It doesn't over-complicate things while keeping you fully invested in the battles. While archery is fun, I find it to be nothing too special, and if the enemies go heavy on shields, it's really hard to hit anything.The two DLCs seem to be hit-or-miss however, Napoleonic Wars is only multiplayer, so unless you get really into that it's not worth it. Viking Conquest looks like it could be great, but it's filled with unsolved bugs. [EDIT: Viking Conquest Reforged seems to have resolved many issues, but still, buyers beware.]There is also an array of excellent workshop items and mods that completley transform the games setting, graphics and even overhaul the entire combat system with the game allowing you to switch between mods the the original game wth a simple drop down menu, giving immense amounts of replayability. I highly recommend picking up the core game as soon as possible.			",181,27,15,20,6,1,26

												i would rate this a solid 10/10, this game is basicly multiple games in one.  in M&B: warband singleplayer, you can create your own character. sad to say the character creation system isnt all it could be, but still well done for a game like this. you start of as a traveler where u can choose your spawn point and your perks, lets call them perks. you start your game with a pretty well done beginning mission. its realy the only mission you have , the rest is more quest based. once your finished with, well the sky is the limit, you can choose the path or either a robbing outlaw fighting for his own or become a vassel and fight for the honour of your king against other kingdom for the control of Caladria.now for singleplayer as for multiplayer there is a unlimited amount of mods which makes the game 10x better, ive owned the game for about 3 years and have about 2000 hours on it, and i still enjoy the game.i would highly recommend this game, its a amazing game with endless options.

												Warband such a beautiful game, I get off to it every night. It has been a wonderful substitution for sunlight and socialising over the past few decades. Sometimes my allies ask me to go down the tavern and meet up for royal tournaments and feasts, but I say 'Nay good squire, warband hath callen me'. Recently, my waifu (m'lady) joins me for a session of warband and chill. Warband is like lubricant and viagra for me. I like editing my character into really sexy swadian man. As you can see by my hours, I am qualified to give this review. Where do I see myself in 5 years? Ruler of the Swadian Kingdom and Khergit Khanate and with 5000 hours under m'belt.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 First sorry for my english. Sotto la recensione in italiano. Next chapter of the series Mount & Blade, which was developed by a Turkish couple, improved in various aspects and published by TaleWorlds Entertainment.It's an open-world role-playing game fantasy-medieval leaving freedom to player.The game branches out on several levels: character creation, the game world and the combat that is the focus of the game.It presents a good multiplayer segment, especially with the dlc Napoleonic Wars.Pros affordable pricelow hardware requirementslinux OS and steamgreat mod support and workshopsvarious languages supportedcards and achievementlightweight downloadmultiyplayer great and populatedboundless longevityno big bugs presentreplayablecontrols easy to learnfun and enjoyable fightingdlc Napoleonic Warsdemo is presentCons graphics and sound are datedViking Conquest Reforged Edition dlc not so goodno steam cloudwith no mod lose appealgaunt tutorialquest's are repetitivewoody animationslearning curvepoor aisieges to improvehistory is absentcustom battle is not very usefulNotes  the conversion for Mac has various problemseasily activated cheatsthere is a DRM free version on other platformsWaiting Bannerlord this is a recommended game, but first is recommend trying the demo.It does not recommend the purchase of With Fire and Sword and Mount & Blade.Unfortunately lacks a multiplayer campaign and would have been better treat more the management part to give the game a more comprehensive long-term.Unique game of its kind, is always fun despite the five years since the release. Multiplayer is very complex and there are groups that organize events,there are various mod and approaches (such as mod persistent world).Mount & Blade Warband is part of an unexplored niche and the game deserves its success despite low-cost budget. Is original and winner of several awards.With dozens of mod longevity is assured, modders are supporting it and you will find interesting projects (do not stop find only at the steam workshop).The graphics and tutorials are primitive but it's a forgivable flaw.graphic 6sound 7longevity 9gameplay 8Rating 8/10 vote with mod 8.5 / 10Napoleonic Wars Rating: 7.5 recommended for multiplayer, it lacks single campaign.Rating Viking Conquest Reforged Edition: 6.5 derived from a mod in my opinion the purchase is not essential, before buy is recommend to try the original mod.The multiplayer is disappointing; reforged correct most of the bugs and added new features.Purchase price recommended under $ 4 base game, under $ 2  per Napoleonic Wars and under 6 $ Viking Conquest Reforged Edition.Mod recommended for basic game:""A Clash of Kings (Game of Thrones)"": (a must for fans of Game of Thrones).""Warsword Conquest"" (great for Warhammer fans).""Perisno"": (total conversion fantasy very accurate).""16th Century"" (mod historical set in the 16th century).""A New Dawn"" (excellent mod, expands the base game with hundreds of new objects and functions).""Full Invasion 2"": (multiplayer mod funny for everyone).""The Last Days of the Third Age"": (mod that brings the world of Lord of the Rings).""Gekokujo"" (mod that pulls the player in the old Japanese Sengoku period).Mod recommended for Napoleonic Wars: ""North and South: First Manassas"" (Excellent mod that adds new battle tactics and new units).FANTARMA COMMUNITY

 ITALIAN: Seguito di Mount & Blade che fu sviluppato da una coppia turca, migliorato in vari aspetti e pubblicato dalla TaleWorlds.Si tratta di un gioco di ruolo a mondo aperto fantasy-medievale che lascia libertà al gicatore. Il gioco si dirama su più livelli: la creazione del personaggio, il mondo di gioco e il combattimento che è il fulcro del gioco.E' presente un buon comparto multiplayer, soprattutto con il dlc Napoleonic Wars.Pro	  prezzo abbordabile requisiti hardware bassi linux e steam OS supporto mod ottimo e workshop varie lingue supportate carte e achievement  download leggero multiyplayer ottimo e popolato longevità sterminata bug poco presenti rigiocabile controlli di facile apprendimento combattimento divertente dlc Napoleonic Wars presente demoContro	  grafica e sonoro datati Viking Conquest Reforged Edition dlc non all'altezza  no steam cloud senza mod perde appeal tutorial scarno quest ripetitive animazioni legnose curva di apprendimento ai scarsa assedi da migliorare storia assente custom battle non molto utiliNote 	 la conversione per Mac ha vari problemitrucchi facilmente attivabiliè presente una versione drm free su altre piattaformeAspettando Bannerlord questo è un gioco raccomandato, ma prima consiglio di provare la demo.Non è consigliato l'acquisto di With Fire and Sword e Mount & Blade.Purtroppo manca una campagna multiplayer e sarebbe stato meglio curare di più la parte gestionale per dare al gioco un respiro maggiore a lungo termine.Gioco unico nel suo genere , rimane sempre divertente nonostante i 5 anni dal rilascio. Il multiplayerè molto articolato e sono presenti gruppi che organizzano eventi, varie mod e modalità di approccio (come le mod persistent world).Mount & Blade Warband si inserisce in una nicchia inesplorata e il gioco merita il suo successo nonostante sia low-cost. E' originale e vincitore di alcuni premi.Con decine di mod la longevità è assicurata, i modder lo stanno supportando e sono presenti progetti interessanti (non fermatevi solo al workshop steam).La grafica e il tutorial sono primitivi ma è un difetto perdonabile.Infine l'italiano non è supportato ufficialmente, ma è presente una traduzione amatoriale.Grafica 6Sonoro 7Longevità 9Giocabilità 8Voto 8/10 voto con mod 8,5/10Voto Napoleonic Wars: 7,5 consigliato per il multiplayer, manca campagna single.Voto Viking Conquest Reforged Edition: 6.5 derivato da una mod a mio parere l'acquisto non è indispensabile , prima consiglio di provare la mod originale, e di informarsi.

												Mount and Blade: Warband is the game that the original Mount and Blade wanted to be when it was released.  More polished, more complete, and in all ways improved, this is the best swording-mans simulator on the market.  The modding community is fantastic, offering new maps, troop trees, fief management options, etc.  The only remaining glaring weakness is companion management - in the game, your companions will not automatically equip themselves with improved gear (though many mods add this as a feature) and it is next to impossible to know, without switching through multiple screens, whether a particular weapon or piece of armor in a shop is an improvment over what your companions are currently using.I have sunk more hours into the Mount and Blade series in the past couple of years than into every other non-MMO game combined.  If you haven't bough and played it, yet, you are truly missing out on one of the singular gaming experiences of today.			",311,98,6,107,44,4,102

												My favorite game of all-time, but get some mods (Brytenwalda via ModDB) or Viking Conquest brah(if it's good); you don't have to add much to vanilla Warband to have a good time. Careful though, you may become a Nord yourself...or were you one already....?In all seriousness, the modding community is the best there is in gaming. Ex: Brytenwalda, Vikingr, Full Invasion, Prophecy of Pendor, Mount and Gladius, Silverstag, Perisno, etc, etc, etc.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How do I describe how good Mount and Blade: Warband is? It's difficult to say because it's not the native version of the game itself that is so amazing. Yeah it's fun, and definitely worth the price tag as it is. 60 or so hours worth of fun I would say, but I am rapidly approaching and will definitely surpass the 600 hour mark soon. Why? Because it is like a canvas, the native game introduces gameplay mechanics that have a lot of potential for variety once it's in the hands of the modding community. I'm no modder myself so I can't speak to how hard or easy it is to mod the game, but the general idea of commanding an army on a battlefield in a third or first person perspective lends itself well to a lot of different ways to engage in battle. I had 40-60 hrs in native, another 200 in the viking conquest expansion ($14.95 atm I think) which is a lot of fun and worth the price tag, and the rest in the many various mods of the game. There are mods for just about any sort of warfare from Roman times up to the Civil War. There are mods for fantasy settings and even a LoTR mod. There is so much to offer a person inclined to like this sort of game. It can be a bit difficult when first learning the game, so don't let that get you down, just look stuff up and keep at it and you'll be engaging in large (in viking conquest at least with troop on field limits of 750 as opposed to the 150 of native) battles. You have to recruit, pay, train, upgrade your units, manage companions, your own character, villages, towns, castles, and even a kingdom later on if you manage to establish yourself. It's a bit to learn and sometimes it is hard early on to get a foothold, but the game is worth the time getting to know it. The actual combat seems stange at first, but becomes rather intuitive once you get a handle on it, and having tested all the weapon types, they're all useful in one situation or another, but I tend to learn towards swords and pole-arms as being mounted is important for a commander and those weapons lend well to such combat. Archery is fun, too, but that takes a lot of practice to be viable.I rate gameplay 10/10, look to other reviews for other factors like graphics because as long as I know what I'm looking at, graphics quality doesn't mean so much to me.

												Mount and blade has something for everybody.  Single player is pretty fun.  Starting from just another nameless peseant,  you can rise to be a powerful Lord or the ruler of your own nation.  The game doesn't force anything on you as you can travel where you want in this sandbox game.  The multiplayer is pretty good.  Plenty of people in one game that makes it actually feel like a warzone.  Also if you tire of the vanilla version there are plenty of mods to choose from, which helps to liven up the game.  Base graphics are a little bland but there are mods for that too.  I've put more time into this game than most triple A's I've bought recently.			",109,29,0,51,19,1,33

												This game is amazing. I've probably spent a couple hundred hours in a drm-free version of the game, and I've also played the original Mount & Blade and Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword.It takes hundreds and hundreds of hours to finish the game (by finish I mean become a king/queen of all Calradia), and even after that, there are tons of great community mods that will keep you entertained for even more time.Pros:- great soundtrack- amazing combat mechanics- tons of great modsCons:- somewhat repetitive dialogue options, but it can be fixed with mods.

												A very tough game, brutal learning curve (for both singleplayer and mutliplayer), but singleplayer is worth it once you learn how to play and do good. I wouldn't recommend multiplayer unless you like getting constantly shrecked by people with 1000's of hours played. The skill ceiling in multiplayer PvP combat is so high that you feel like a sloth fighting a Jedi Master when you're just starting out. If you've got the balls to try and catch up to people like that who have been playing for years, more power to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game may seem simple on the the first glance but due to the various features such as the swordplay and horse combat, the fight always feels fresh and quite enjoyable to the point it gets chaotic swinging and watching enemies fall dead with a spash of blood.The single player is very detailed with various commander like actions and factions fighting on a large scale map, but this is just a small sample of what is to offer as you can play however you like, being the commander of a large faction driven army or rasing a gang of looters and bandits to raid the lands.This experience is only made better by the addition of the multiplayer which allows you to fight as one of the various soldier type units that built up the armies that you could make on the singleplayer. There are a vast amount of game types and there are still a large amount of people playing to always be in a 90+ match. I would recommend the Siege gametype as these matches useally have the most players on them.One of the best games I ever through money at. ",75,6,0,8,8,1,18

												What are you: a peasant, an impoverished noble, a sociopath, a man looking for riches, or just huntin' for ♥♥♥♥♥es? Whatever the cause, it doesn't matter now. Because you're broke, ♥♥♥♥♥! You arrive penniless in this new land looking for wenches, glory, booty, blood, or any combination thereof. In case if you're a moron, and you forgot the title of this game already: this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Mount & Blade: Warband. This game doesn't run off fancy graphics, or modern physics. It is powered off of your precious time and your sorrow filled tears that are wet on your cheeks.Want to be a King? Get to work peasant! Want to become a merchant scouring the lands for riches? Get to work peasant! Want to be a bandit, just looting villages, and destroying the wayward dreams of many a common peasant? Arise my Lord with sword at the ready! What am I saying here you ask? I'm saying it's a game for real men. If your balls are low, and blessed with a fine carpet patch of hair, this is the game for you. If you play in anything but the hardest possible mode in the game, just sit down and grab a bite to eat at a local Weenie Hut Jr, while you tape your♥♥♥♥♥♥in between your legs. It's obvious that you won't be needing that any time soon. ",103,2,1,9,2,3,7

												I highly recommend this sandbox rpg game where you can be both the commander ordering your troops but also being the kickass slayer in the field while doing that. Choose your allies, fight for them, or just be a mercenary. Of course you will need an army, so gather recruits, train them into cool wariors trough your harsh training or even faster, from real fights, but that may end up getting some of them killed.Also don't get too cocky on opponents, especialy if you choose to play realisticaly like i do (no exit without save, thus no loading back at a previous point). Don't forget to feed your troups otherwise they will starve and loose morale, win difficult fights and get morale and renown, bet on yourself and win in tournaments and get gold, participate at feasts, try to impress a lady. Tired of being a mercenary? Choose a kingdom and swear a vassalage to the king if you have good enogh standing, and get feafs according to your contribution. You choose your way, whatever it may be, depending on what you like.I suggest buying this game which would get you over 100 hours in singleplayer. How do i know by having just 20 hours till now ? Because i firstly played this game outside of steam. If you are not sure if you will like it, try waiting for a discount.P.S.: Multiplayer and modability is a + :)			",307,42,8,34,25,4,30

												This is really the most unique game I have ever played. There is a steep learning curve to it for sure.. But once you understand how the combat works, get your own style of fighting down, you'll get the most intense experiences you've ever felt in a game. It was worth all of those troubling hours of getting killed over and over. I have put 2200 hours into this game within the past 2 years. Still not tired of it.			",127,11,0,7,11,3,14

												After having pumped 200+ hours into the game I think I should write a review to support the game, so here I go.Mount & Blade Warband, released in 2010, a kind-of sequel to the original Mount & Blade, is a First/Third Person Action RPG/RTS set in a medieval open world. You set your own goal - live a life as a mercenary, become a Lord of one of the kingdoms, join a claimant to a throne in his battle to take, as he/she thinks, his/her rightful place as king, or go against all of the kingdoms and create your own.You start the game completely on your own in one of the capital cities of your liking where you happen to get your first quest. You then recruit soldiers for your troop and either be a good samaritan who takes care of the bandits and helps villages, or be the feared vandal by raiding caravans and villages.Now, putting together your troop and controlling it in battle is where the RTS part comes in.All your soldiers can be put in groups (similar to ordinary RTS control groups which you select with the 0-9 keys) to always only select those soldiers you want, giving you a lot of control over them. In battles you can give them all sorts of commands you could think of, including, but not limited to, telling them to use only certain weapons that they possess.Another special thing about this game is the very skill-based combat system.The melee combat system is based on attacking from four directions and being able to block them - of course by blocking in the direction the swing comes from. This can be really tough sometimes when there's a lot of stuff going on or if your opponent has a rather fast weapon.You can set up how you want to swing and block independently. Do you want it to work by going into the corresponding direction? Or only by mouse movement?In singleplayer, for beginners, you can even enable automatic blocking. This will result in you only having to press the block button when a swing comes in, of course you still have to know when to block and when to swing. This setting does not apply to multiplayer though, there it is up to the server wether there's automatic blocking or not - but most likely you'll only be seeing automatic blocking in player vs bot games (there are special modules that are based on fending off enemy waves with other players).The multiplayer mode is something that first came with Warband, and I think it's pretty solid for an indie game (except for some minor things, but later onto that).It supports up to 250 players and several modes, including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Last man standing Deathmatch and of course castle siege, similar to sieging a castle in singleplayer.Apart from all that great stuff the game also has an amazing mod support. Search moddb.com for Mount & Blade mods (for both the original game and Warband) and you'll understand what I mean.As many pros as this game has, it also has a few cons.A big problem in multiplayer, similar to other games (like Chivalry, for example), are the trolls.There are a lot of times when you have a lot of fun and fight a bunch of great battles, and then there's the trolls' prime time.At that time, things are going to get messy. You randomly get hit, shot and kicked by a teammate just to annoy you and then that person just runs along as if nothing happened. When you try to take revenge, they will turn things around and make you look like the vermin, causing everyone to go at you. Classy trolls.That's about the negatives I could think of and it isn't really the games' fault.To round this review of, I'll give a short summary:Pros:-solid melee combat system-troop management-good graphics (remember that this was and still is an indie game - I think the graphics are absolutely fine despite what others have said. Besides, the graphics in M&BII have been improved by a lot.)-great multiplayer with a high number of players supported and several gamemodes-mod support-always challengingCons:-engine limitationsSo I come to the conclusion that I can clearly recommend this title to others. Also keep an eye out for the upcoming sequel!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warband is much better than its predecessor, named simply Mount & Blade. Its basically the same game with updated graphics and enhanced gameplay features. Also it has a very fun multiplayer that people still play! Definite must own game since its so fun.Like before, you start off with nothing. You have to build up your army, level up your character and companions. Theres no real goal in the game, but you get several quests from different lords in game. Its a sandbox. Very fun. Nothing like storming a castle with your army at your side.			",1229,376,57,122,119,15,131

												A fantastic sandbox medieval RPG, with hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay. Innovative and enjoyable combat, as well as plenty of community mods which further the already immense ""replay"" value (I say ""replay"" because the game never truly ends). One of the only games I personally can put large amounts of time into without ever becoming bored. BUY IT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is about the best medieval first/third person game out there. First off you dont really know what the hell youre doing in the Campaign which is a completley open sandbox to do whatever the hell you want. You can become a thief and prey upon poor villagers or merchant caravans or plundering villages on a whim. Or you could be a lord and fight for your king alongside other lords (you also get lands). You could be a king/queen and start your own faction by conquering castles and recruiting lords from other factions or from companions found in taverns. Each faction also has different play styles. The khergits for ex. are 99% horsemen. Whereas the nords are 100% infantry. But my favorite part about this game is the pvp....IT IS NOT A PAY TO WIN SYSTEM (after all you did pay 15 bucks to get the game) Each game you start with a certain amount of money to buy equipment for a certain class (archer,cavalry,footman) Though the equipment does help in battle youu get money by killing enemies, which gets you better equipment in that one game. Next game your money is reset and then off to the killing fields. -Got run over by a stray horse-Got pegged in the face with a throwing axe-Got kicked off a wall by a teamate-Kicked that teamate off a wall-Got impaled by a lance -Glitched off a siege tower and got blasted to the moon-Kicked a guy in the nuts and killed him-Got murdered by a cult of naked men armed with sticks-Got a headshot across the map-Got headshotted across the map-Got brutally murdered by a nord with a giant axe-Smacked a guy in the face with a mallet-100/100 would play for eternity			",52,7,0,8,8,1,17

 Note: I have been away from this game for a small amount of time, so excuse me if some of the information I give you is incorrect.  General If you don't like medieval games, this game is the last thing you'd want. This game is both third person and first person. There are 3 main classes with every unit in the game, including in multiplayer. The three classes are  Infantry, Archers, and Horseman.  the weapon usage varies with each class. The factions are  Vaegirs, Rhodoks, Swadians, Sarranids, Nords, and Khergits.  These factions are constantly at war with each other. You can affect the game in a massive way, or a small way. In both singleplayer and multiplayer, people can affect you and you can affect people in a variety of ways. From covering an archer as an infantry class to covering infantry as a horseman class, the customization is a great part of the game. The graphics are obviously not the best, but that's just what you get with an older game. Don't let that control your whole opinion of the game. There are no real spoilers to the game, as there is no hand-holding, or ""missions"". There are quests, but you can choose to take them. Singleplayer Singleplayer is a great part of the game that not many people will get bored of right after starting. You start out with a small band of men that are only able to defeat bandits, which can eventually turn into a 300 man army attacking a rival king. You have the choice to do whatever you want. If you allign to a faction for the purpose of destroying it, you can slide your way up the ranks, and get people to rebel from the faction with you, or just work your way up by taking a city by yourself. Multiplayer Multiplayer has a series of game modes, from dueling to sieges. A good amount of the players are veterans, and can teach you whatever you want to know. That's how I got a lot of my experience in multiplayer. Multiplayer is very similar to singleplayer, but in my opinion, better. It actually feels immersive, as you have an actual challenge. I don't feel very comfortable killing AI, as it doesn't feel real enough to me. In my opinion, multiplayer is better than singleplayer to me in every way. Even though there is no map, the battles feel much better in all aspects. Napoleonic Wars Napoleonic Wars, the DLC for Mount and Blade: Warband, is fantastic.  NOTE: There is no Singleplayer for Napoleonic Wars.  Even there is no singleplayer for NW, the multiplayer is great. Most of the combat that happens is ranged, as there are muskets in the game. All muskets are able to switch to melee mode with X, which helps out a lot, rather than having a fist fight in the middle of a classical battle (which is possible as well). Many of the maps are made by the community. The addition of cannons, swivel guns, and mortars really helps out with taking out many men at once. It is unbelievably easy to get attached to. In my opinion, the DLC is at a good price, for the amount of content included in it. Conclusion Overall, the game is completely worth the price, along with Napoleonic Wars. If you would like to know more about the game/DLC than I explained, just message me, and i'll help you out. Thanks for reading me review on Mount and Blade: Warband and Napoleonic Wars.

												Haven't been playing this for a while, but wandering through my library I wondered why I haven't left a positive review for this, because it richly deserves it.Now the base game is not all that impressive after you play it for a long while, but for a first timer it is adorable and might I say mind blowing. There is sooo much to do in it. The graphics might be ar*se but it more than makes up for it with its gameplay. And mods breathe a life into this mod the likes of which only Elder Scrolls games modding rivals.With Bannerlord on the way, I'd recommend this to anybody who is interested in Bannerlord and are wondering about Warband, definitely give it a try. And my personal recommendations if you wish to play a modded version are *Prophesy of Pendor and Floris Mod Pack*			",59,10,0,23,8,0,20

												Mount & Blade: Warband is one of the best games I have played in a while. The combat is solid, the factions have their own strengths and weaknesses and the battles are hectic and massive. This is one of the only games I have seen that actually lets you be part of the battle instead of some sort of skygod. Did I say the battles were awesome yet? If I did let me say it again, the battles can range from small skirmishes to large scale battles. In addition to the field battles you also have the ability to seige castles and cities and if that isn't your style, why not raid a few peasent villages for loot and plunder!There are countless things I could say that are good about Mount & Blade: Warband including the Mod support. Like Game of Thrones? The have a mod for that. Want the game to take place in Feudal Europe? They have a mod for that as well! There are a bunch of other mods for the game so the replay value is extremely high.The game does have a couple of downsides though.One of them being the graphics. If you are looking for a visually stunning game this may not be for you. Along with that there is very little voice acting. The only voice acting you will hear are the warcrys of the soliders on the battlefield and the bandits as well as some farmers, so don't be expecting Morgan Freeman or Jennifer Hale as voice actors and voice actresses.The early game is quite difficult as well (or at least it was for me.) You will constantly be attacked by Bandits, Sea Raiders and the like until you amass a big enough force to take them and then still they will  sometimes attack you.But if you can look past these flaws I think you will have a great time. I know I did! Thank you for reading my review for the great game and I am sorry if this review isn't that great as it is my first review!Thanks for your time.Best regards-A Crazed Engineer			",11,1,0,4,3,2,2

												This is a game that relies heavily upon the community. I couldn't imagine it any other way, the Line Battle events that are organized, are extremely fun, and making your way up through the ranks of your preferred regiment, is quite intriguing. All regiments are usually similar in structure, and ranks are usually assigned on skill/time basis. If you have the time to learn, and become involved, you will meet countless friendly individuals, and you will associate yourself with this game, just remember, you need to also purchase the Napoleonic Wars DLC.Wolfgetz Amaraden :D,Dyson			",62,7,0,5,1,0,0

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a medieval-themed RPG where you take control of a character with the goal being to complete quests and conquer Caldaria.The game can be hard at first but is a lot of fun. At the beginning its just you, but the more you progress and level up, the bigger your army becomes. Your units can also level up and become stronger and stronger. Most of them die, unless they have an unique name - then they can only get unconcious. You can fight other armies, besiege and defend castles and create your own faction.Unfortunately, theres repetitiveness and grinding that you will have to do and thats when I found the game boring. One example being that before you have enough men to take a castle you need to grind for XP, so you can level up another skill which lets you have more soldiers in your army. Another being that once you create your own faction and finally gain enough right to rule its just a matter of you taking all the other castles in Caldaria and theres A LOT of them, but its the same thing all over again.You can download numerous mods all differently themed be it medieval Japan, Star Wars, Game of Thrones or even ones which let you conquer Europe. Its still the same game though and there will be grinding and repetitiveness.Overall though, its a fun RPG and perfect for people that like history or highly-moddable games.			",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												What are you: a peasant, an impoverished noble, a sociopath, a man looking for riches, or just huntin' for ♥♥♥♥♥es? Whatever the cause, it doesn't matter now. Because you're broke, ♥♥♥♥♥! You arrive penniless in this new land looking for wenches, glory, booty, blood, or any combination thereof. In case if you're a moron, and you forgot the title of this game already: this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Mount & Blade: Warband. This game doesn't run off fancy graphics, or modern physics. It is powered off of your precious time and your sorrow filled tears that are wet on your cheeks.Want to be a King? Get to work peasant! Want to become a merchant scouring the lands for riches? Get to work peasant! Want to be a bandit, just looting villages, and destroying the wayward dreams of many a common peasant? Arise my Lord with sword at the ready! What am I saying here you ask? I'm saying it's a game for real men. If your balls are low, and blessed with a fine carpet patch of hair, this is the game for you. If you play in anything but the hardest possible mode in the game, just sit down and grab a bite to eat at a local Weenie Hut Jr, while you tape your♥♥♥♥♥♥in between your legs. It's obvious that you won't be needing that any time soon. ",103,2,1,9,2,3,7

												This game may seem simple on the the first glance but due to the various features such as the swordplay and horse combat, the fight always feels fresh and quite enjoyable to the point it gets chaotic swinging and watching enemies fall dead with a spash of blood.The single player is very detailed with various commander like actions and factions fighting on a large scale map, but this is just a small sample of what is to offer as you can play however you like, being the commander of a large faction driven army or rasing a gang of looters and bandits to raid the lands.This experience is only made better by the addition of the multiplayer which allows you to fight as one of the various soldier type units that built up the armies that you could make on the singleplayer. There are a vast amount of game types and there are still a large amount of people playing to always be in a 90+ match. I would recommend the Siege gametype as these matches useally have the most players on them.One of the best games I ever through money at. ",75,6,0,8,8,1,18

												This is about the best medieval first/third person game out there. First off you dont really know what the hell youre doing in the Campaign which is a completley open sandbox to do whatever the hell you want. You can become a thief and prey upon poor villagers or merchant caravans or plundering villages on a whim. Or you could be a lord and fight for your king alongside other lords (you also get lands). You could be a king/queen and start your own faction by conquering castles and recruiting lords from other factions or from companions found in taverns. Each faction also has different play styles. The khergits for ex. are 99% horsemen. Whereas the nords are 100% infantry. But my favorite part about this game is the pvp....IT IS NOT A PAY TO WIN SYSTEM (after all you did pay 15 bucks to get the game) Each game you start with a certain amount of money to buy equipment for a certain class (archer,cavalry,footman) Though the equipment does help in battle youu get money by killing enemies, which gets you better equipment in that one game. Next game your money is reset and then off to the killing fields. -Got run over by a stray horse-Got pegged in the face with a throwing axe-Got kicked off a wall by a teamate-Kicked that teamate off a wall-Got impaled by a lance -Glitched off a siege tower and got blasted to the moon-Kicked a guy in the nuts and killed him-Got murdered by a cult of naked men armed with sticks-Got a headshot across the map-Got headshotted across the map-Got brutally murdered by a nord with a giant axe-Smacked a guy in the face with a mallet-100/100 would play for eternity			",52,7,0,8,8,1,17

												Wow this is a difficult game to describe. A sandbox action RPG set in a medieval land (fantasy, but realistic- no dragons, elves etc). After creating a character and completing a couple of short quests, the world is basically yours to explore and you can play as you please. You get money and/or xp by hunting bandits, pillaging, trading, selling prisoners, fighting tournaments, completing quests... and much more besides.There are 6 factions all competing for control of the realm. You may decided to ally yourself with one of them, serving the King as a vassal, fighting his wars and seizing towns and castles. You may decided to assist a claimant to the throne, creating a rebel faction to usurp the current King, or you may proclaim youself King and create your own faction. Be aware that this is a dynamic and ever changing world- relations rise and fall, lands are conquered or pillaged, and lords may betray their King and defect. Every action has a consequence.The game world is presented in a basic overworld map, switching to 3rd person upon entering a town, castle or village, or when in combat. The combat itself is the real meat of the game, allowing the player to swing, thrust or chop depending on the movement of the mouse. Riding on horseback also adds to the fun factor, and learning to time your strike as you gallop towards the enemy is key.You may also recruit militia and companions into your party, and they will join you on the battlefield. They can be given commands (such as follow, hold and charge) and will also earn xp and level up. The command system is simple, but works well. If you don't want to get blood on your shiny new armour then sending your troops ahead to fight without you is often a legitimate option.The game does have a few quirks that will annoy some people (such as companions bickering, complaining and abandoning you). Fortunately there is a program available to download (TweakMB) that allows you to easily tailor the gameplay mechanics to better suit you.Buy this game if you enjoy solid combat, open-ended gameplay and epic battles.

												Title: ""Me and another man's wife: A trip 'round Calradia.""Lord Gundar or something was not in good terms with me.So I asked him if he had any task for me. Well enough he wished for me to escort his wife from Praven to Uxkhal expecting her to be well guarded under my war party. Well all right, hope he would then like me more.I went into the Tavern buying best wine for everyone that night. Went to the market doing usual stuffs selling and buying weapons/horses/armors/ and cheese for my cohorts. There was no war going on so I must have got sidetracked or something. I went then to the Nord territory hopefully to train some recruits into Huscarls. Going round and round each village and town.Damn it hit me then I forgot about Gundar's wife! Lady Isna......well she's still in my company and there's like 15 days left. Plenty of time no problem. It'd be good to show her around the country a bit. Hang in there lady.Two days later we arrived at Sargoth hey there's a tournament going on. Oh man how I love tournaments, so we joined, I and all my cohorts. Sweet, placed the bet, awesome! I clicked ""View Participants"". OMG Lady Isna has just joined the tourney! LOLOL big time. Damn she'd probably wouldn't last the first tier.So simple enough, I have got pretty good at tourneys so I won the first round and second too. Curious enough I checked again the remaining participants. OH SHE'S still IN!! WHAT THE HELL, OLD GAL?!Went into the arena again, this time I try to look at the logs on the screen and BAM! Lady Champion Fighter knocked out by Lady Isna!!! OMG Gundar, did you know that your wife is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ female warrior!! xD xD :O!!!! Defying all expectations, she made it to the final. Unbelievable! This is it! You or me lady Isna. I have never given this much thought to a female NPC in the game before, and that includes my wife Lady Elys who's awaiting my return at Suno.We both got a shield and an axe. She came right charging in.....man a lord's wife has never been more terrifying. I sidestepped evading her overhead plunge then kick her with the ""E"" button, and finished it off with a slam from the right. BAM!....I won with a single hit. God who would have thought a Lord's wife with hitpoints so low would make it to the final.Hmm all right, time to really get to work. I probably shouldn't screw this quest up. Checked my quest notes. Oh we still have like 13 days to take her to Uxkhal......Or..........we could go round the country doing tourneys together :D :D. So long story short, that's what we did. Went to a couple more tournaments/attacked some bandits together. And suddenly, the Nord declared war on the Kingdom of Swadia, so I took her finally to Uxkhal and we exchanged good byes. She said she hoped to see me again.To tell the truth, it was a bit disheartening to see her go. It was rather a fun thing to do during peace time. I could not have asked for anything more :D. A call to arms from our Marshal, I made ready my troops and prepare for another journey to war.At the back of my mind I still remember her charging at me from the first tourney, and it left me wondering why would she need an escort in the first place.........1000000000/10 would escort another man's wife to tourneys again.

 Note: I have been away from this game for a small amount of time, so excuse me if some of the information I give you is incorrect.  General If you don't like medieval games, this game is the last thing you'd want. This game is both third person and first person. There are 3 main classes with every unit in the game, including in multiplayer. The three classes are  Infantry, Archers, and Horseman.  the weapon usage varies with each class. The factions are  Vaegirs, Rhodoks, Swadians, Sarranids, Nords, and Khergits.  These factions are constantly at war with each other. You can affect the game in a massive way, or a small way. In both singleplayer and multiplayer, people can affect you and you can affect people in a variety of ways. From covering an archer as an infantry class to covering infantry as a horseman class, the customization is a great part of the game. The graphics are obviously not the best, but that's just what you get with an older game. Don't let that control your whole opinion of the game. There are no real spoilers to the game, as there is no hand-holding, or ""missions"". There are quests, but you can choose to take them. Singleplayer Singleplayer is a great part of the game that not many people will get bored of right after starting. You start out with a small band of men that are only able to defeat bandits, which can eventually turn into a 300 man army attacking a rival king. You have the choice to do whatever you want. If you allign to a faction for the purpose of destroying it, you can slide your way up the ranks, and get people to rebel from the faction with you, or just work your way up by taking a city by yourself. Multiplayer Multiplayer has a series of game modes, from dueling to sieges. A good amount of the players are veterans, and can teach you whatever you want to know. That's how I got a lot of my experience in multiplayer. Multiplayer is very similar to singleplayer, but in my opinion, better. It actually feels immersive, as you have an actual challenge. I don't feel very comfortable killing AI, as it doesn't feel real enough to me. In my opinion, multiplayer is better than singleplayer to me in every way. Even though there is no map, the battles feel much better in all aspects. Napoleonic Wars Napoleonic Wars, the DLC for Mount and Blade: Warband, is fantastic.  NOTE: There is no Singleplayer for Napoleonic Wars.  Even there is no singleplayer for NW, the multiplayer is great. Most of the combat that happens is ranged, as there are muskets in the game. All muskets are able to switch to melee mode with X, which helps out a lot, rather than having a fist fight in the middle of a classical battle (which is possible as well). Many of the maps are made by the community. The addition of cannons, swivel guns, and mortars really helps out with taking out many men at once. It is unbelievably easy to get attached to. In my opinion, the DLC is at a good price, for the amount of content included in it. Conclusion Overall, the game is completely worth the price, along with Napoleonic Wars. If you would like to know more about the game/DLC than I explained, just message me, and i'll help you out. Thanks for reading me review on Mount and Blade: Warband and Napoleonic Wars.

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a medieval-themed RPG where you take control of a character with the goal being to complete quests and conquer Caldaria.The game can be hard at first but is a lot of fun. At the beginning its just you, but the more you progress and level up, the bigger your army becomes. Your units can also level up and become stronger and stronger. Most of them die, unless they have an unique name - then they can only get unconcious. You can fight other armies, besiege and defend castles and create your own faction.Unfortunately, theres repetitiveness and grinding that you will have to do and thats when I found the game boring. One example being that before you have enough men to take a castle you need to grind for XP, so you can level up another skill which lets you have more soldiers in your army. Another being that once you create your own faction and finally gain enough right to rule its just a matter of you taking all the other castles in Caldaria and theres A LOT of them, but its the same thing all over again.You can download numerous mods all differently themed be it medieval Japan, Star Wars, Game of Thrones or even ones which let you conquer Europe. Its still the same game though and there will be grinding and repetitiveness.Overall though, its a fun RPG and perfect for people that like history or highly-moddable games.			",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												Warband is much better than its predecessor, named simply Mount & Blade. Its basically the same game with updated graphics and enhanced gameplay features. Also it has a very fun multiplayer that people still play! Definite must own game since its so fun.Like before, you start off with nothing. You have to build up your army, level up your character and companions. Theres no real goal in the game, but you get several quests from different lords in game. Its a sandbox. Very fun. Nothing like storming a castle with your army at your side.			",1229,376,57,122,119,15,131

												This is about the best medieval first/third person game out there. First off you dont really know what the hell youre doing in the Campaign which is a completley open sandbox to do whatever the hell you want. You can become a thief and prey upon poor villagers or merchant caravans or plundering villages on a whim. Or you could be a lord and fight for your king alongside other lords (you also get lands). You could be a king/queen and start your own faction by conquering castles and recruiting lords from other factions or from companions found in taverns. Each faction also has different play styles. The khergits for ex. are 99% horsemen. Whereas the nords are 100% infantry. But my favorite part about this game is the pvp....IT IS NOT A PAY TO WIN SYSTEM (after all you did pay 15 bucks to get the game) Each game you start with a certain amount of money to buy equipment for a certain class (archer,cavalry,footman) Though the equipment does help in battle youu get money by killing enemies, which gets you better equipment in that one game. Next game your money is reset and then off to the killing fields. -Got run over by a stray horse-Got pegged in the face with a throwing axe-Got kicked off a wall by a teamate-Kicked that teamate off a wall-Got impaled by a lance -Glitched off a siege tower and got blasted to the moon-Kicked a guy in the nuts and killed him-Got murdered by a cult of naked men armed with sticks-Got a headshot across the map-Got headshotted across the map-Got brutally murdered by a nord with a giant axe-Smacked a guy in the face with a mallet-100/100 would play for eternity			",52,7,0,8,8,1,17

												The single player campaign is hindered by a couple of very bad traits such as siege’s have only one point of entry, the limited number of troops on the battlefield and, in general, the whole UI and micromanagement of the party/Kingdom system.The combat is one I’ve enjoyed the most out of of any game, simple to pick up and hard to master, and, even though it's getting on in years with an old version of directx honestly it still looks good.With it's flaws it's still a great game offline and online, vanilla or modded.

I have something like 400 offline hours. The multiplayer is fun, however trying to get a game in New Zealand can be hard some times. Awesome game, make your own way in the world.

												Haven't been playing this for a while, but wandering through my library I wondered why I haven't left a positive review for this, because it richly deserves it.Now the base game is not all that impressive after you play it for a long while, but for a first timer it is adorable and might I say mind blowing. There is sooo much to do in it. The graphics might be ar*se but it more than makes up for it with its gameplay. And mods breathe a life into this mod the likes of which only Elder Scrolls games modding rivals.With Bannerlord on the way, I'd recommend this to anybody who is interested in Bannerlord and are wondering about Warband, definitely give it a try. And my personal recommendations if you wish to play a modded version are *Prophesy of Pendor and Floris Mod Pack*			",59,10,0,23,8,0,20

												One of the more innovative games I've played in recent years, Mount and Blade combines strategy and real-time 1st person combat beautifully. The combat is unique, and certainly has a learning curve to become accustomed to the attack timing of swings and so on, but it is very fun when you get the hang of it. Bows and crossbows are a well-functioning mechanic, as well as the sword and board aspect. Lancers, spearmen and viking nords are even effective and playable in some situations. Castle sieges are much fun, however the AI could sometimes use work in how the army maneuvers up ladders and into castles, as they have a mob mentality where all forces tend to focus on one group of enemies exclusively, occasionally to the detriment of the whole if they are being picked off by tower archers or bottlenecked and beaten one by one.This game has some wonderful mods, some that greatly reduce the micro-management aspects, some that go to great lengths to fix some of the finer details that were probably not given the development time they deserved in the original such as trading, the mechanics of politics and allied heroes for hire. There are literally hundreds of mods for this game that span everything from different wars, regions and times to crossover reworks such as turning Mount and Blade into the Star Wars universe or The Walking Dead. One mod I would highly recommend is called the ""native expansion"" mod for Mount and Blade, and it doesn't change the basica gameplay or mechanics, but it adds heaps of new troop types, including the ability to fight against and hire elite troops, expands the trading aspects greatly, increases village upgrade and management options, and fixes many bugs from the original. It also adds death knights, if you're feeling tough. You might not be after you face them.The end-game in the conquer the world campaign is a bit lackluster, as you often end up at a certain point in the game where you reach a peak of sorts regarding controlled castles/towns and it feels as though you are treading water, constantly running around to defeat huge armies of other kingdoms so they do not retake old properties while you are trying to expand to new places. This is a balance issue with the kingdoms armies and your hired heroes who you've sent off to patrol different areas as liege lords.It has some drawbacks, the biggest being that the way it is built really does not allow for multiplayer beyond single scenario sieges (first person pvp battles). The strategy portion of the game (riding around the kingdom trading, negotiating, questing, conquering) is built in such a way that whenever the player stops the game is paused, so any sort of multiplayer in this sense would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to sync up, without butchering it into a turn-based shell of itself which I cannot imagine would play well. Although understandably some games are just not cut out for multiplayer, Mount and Blade would be amazing if a multiplayer co-op or pvp were possible while preserving the current gameplay.All in all, Mount and Blade is an amazing game and I highly recommend anyone who enjoys medieval combat and real-time strategy give it a chance!

												I highly recommend this sandbox rpg game where you can be both the commander ordering your troops but also being the kickass slayer in the field while doing that. Choose your allies, fight for them, or just be a mercenary. Of course you will need an army, so gather recruits, train them into cool wariors trough your harsh training or even faster, from real fights, but that may end up getting some of them killed.Also don't get too cocky on opponents, especialy if you choose to play realisticaly like i do (no exit without save, thus no loading back at a previous point). Don't forget to feed your troups otherwise they will starve and loose morale, win difficult fights and get morale and renown, bet on yourself and win in tournaments and get gold, participate at feasts, try to impress a lady. Tired of being a mercenary? Choose a kingdom and swear a vassalage to the king if you have good enogh standing, and get feafs according to your contribution. You choose your way, whatever it may be, depending on what you like.I suggest buying this game which would get you over 100 hours in singleplayer. How do i know by having just 20 hours till now ? Because i firstly played this game outside of steam. If you are not sure if you will like it, try waiting for a discount.P.S.: Multiplayer and modability is a + :)			",307,42,8,34,25,4,30

Starting from just another nameless peseant,  you can rise to be a powerful Lord or the ruler of your own nation.  The game doesn't force anything on you as you can travel where you want in this sandbox game.  The multiplayer is pretty good.  Plenty of people in one game that makes it actually feel like a warzone.  Also if you tire of the vanilla version there are plenty of mods to choose from, which helps to liven up the game.  Base graphics are a little bland but there are mods for that too.  I've put more time into this game than most triple A's I've bought recently.			",109,29,0,51,19,1,33

												This is a game that relies heavily upon the community. I couldn't imagine it any other way, the Line Battle events that are organized, are extremely fun, and making your way up through the ranks of your preferred regiment, is quite intriguing. All regiments are usually similar in structure, and ranks are usually assigned on skill/time basis. If you have the time to learn, and become involved, you will meet countless friendly individuals, and you will associate yourself with this game, just remember, you need to also purchase the Napoleonic Wars DLC.Wolfgetz Amaraden :D,Dyson			",62,7,0,5,1,0,0

												A truly great game.This game is great because :- It is free-roaming. You can explore to the edge of the world from the start of the game.- It is hack and slash game. The combat is typical, but great enough. There are a lot of weapons, such as swords, shields, bows, crossbows, throwing axes, throwing knives, etc.- It has a great modding communities. You could play using a Medieval Europe mod, or some AGOT Mod, or some fantasy-setting with elves mods. Some less-intrusive mods such as better troop system is also available.- The graphics are acceptable, and no lags in major battles.- Your character, while in individual basis is superior due to your skill, will require your troops support to win the battle, so it won't be like you could kill 1,000+ of troops in one sitting without getting a scratch.- A limited economic simulator in the campaign map, where cities/villages/forts could change their wealth based on the actions of players and NPC.- The NPC characters do something (though sometimes it is not very smart). All NPC will gather troops, patrol their own fiefs, conduct diplomacy, join tournaments, getting married, etc. In war enemies NPC will besiege your towns, loot your villages, etc. The NPC is more livable than most games.- A lot of side activities : tournaments, feasting, marriage.- Lots of skills to be trained on : tracking, path-finding, foraging, etc.Downside :- Lack of story. But you don't need story.- Lack of mission variety. Most mission only encompass of kill X or escort Y. Some are do interesting, but not very much variety.A great game that should be bought.

												My favorite game of all-time, but get some mods (Brytenwalda via ModDB) or Viking Conquest brah(if it's good); you don't have to add much to vanilla Warband to have a good time. Careful though, you may become a Nord yourself...or were you one already....?In all seriousness, the modding community is the best there is in gaming. Ex: Brytenwalda, Vikingr, Full Invasion, Prophecy of Pendor, Mount and Gladius, Silverstag, Perisno, etc, etc, etc.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, could play for hours if I wasn't playing so many other games. The combat system is very fun and easy to use. Building your own army and fighting against others is what this game is about. If you enjoy games with really good medieval combat you won't be dissapointed with this game. It also has an online mod which you can download and play which is very fun because huge armies of people fight against each other and it just looks and feels epic! :) ",99,22,4,15,13,0,6

												Mount and Blade Warband is what every game should aspire to be. Sometimes you find a game that resonates with you, and goes beyond the game itself into a kind of meta-game and opens doors for you to do your own thing. Traditionally this is called sandbox - the problem with most sandbox titles is there is literally no direction. Warband avoid that weakness while still allowing you to feel the freedom and be inspired by it. The gameplay can be either simplified or incredibly unrelenting. The difficulty settings alone can make two games entirely different in every way. I enjoy playing an unstoppable warlord, a beast of death and carnage, a visage of loss and trauma to all who stand against me (I play on the easiest settings, which makes my troops take far less damage and inflict greater damage to enemy units). Or you can boost the difficulty and turn it into a fairly realistic army game, where your troops are just as easy to kill as the enemy. Many games will give you a sense of power, but few capture the feeling of charging down a hillside with 50 armored knights at your back and crashing into the enemy formation. For the price, you will not find a better game on planet earth. And this doesn't even begin to touch on all the mods created by a hugely inventive and dedicated community. Seriously, buy the game. Give it ten hours to learn the ropes and you will love it. If you don't, I will eat a shoe. (I will not eat a shoe)			",97,25,0,32,11,1,19

												Lightly grease two baking trays. Pre-heat the oven to 220°C/425°F/Gas 7.Measure the flour and baking powder into a processor. Add the butter and process until a crumble, then add the sugar. Or make by hand by rubbing  the butter into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.Beat the eggs together until blended and make up to a generous 300ml (1/2 pint) with the milk, then put about 2 tablespoons of the egg/milk aside in a cup for glazing the scones later. Gradually add the egg/milk mixture to the dry ingredients until you have a soft dough. It is far better that the scone mixture is on the wet side, sticking to your fingers, as the scones will rise better.Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and flatten it out with your hand, or use a rolling pin, to a thickness of 1-2 cm (1/2 – ¾ inch). Use a 5 cm (2 inch) fluted cutter to stamp out the dough by pushing the cutter straight down into the dough (as opposed to twisting the cutter) then lift it straight out. This ensures that the scones will rise evenly and keep their shape. Gently push the remaining dough together, knead very lightly then re-roll and cut more scones out as before. Arrange the scones on the prepared baking trays and brush the tops with the reserved beaten egg/milk mixture to glaze. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the scones are well risen and golden. Cool on a wire rack, covered with a clean tea towel to keep them moist. Serve as fresh as possible, cut in half and spread generously with strawberry jam and top with a good spoonful of thick cream.How to make Scones, I really shouldn't need to persuade you why to buy this. Just do it.			",70,1,1,8,3,1,10

												This game never fails providing me with the medieval atmosphere when I need it.Creating a new character in this game is a joy. When you just start creating your new character and send it to the world you are confronted with so many little decisions and adventures that you can take on many approaches. Be a soldier, a merchant, an outlaw or an adventurer - You can do it! The first 10-20 hours in any game are simply pure fun and all are unique in their way. Choosing your lord is exciting, joining a war is exciting, attending tournaments is exciting - it is all just great and has a unique feel that sits just right.However, the game seem to stop giving an effort at late-game, once you become strong enough to be a lord which is the one and only end-game scenario you can achieve, things become dull and repetetive. You will go about the same way from castle to castle as you slowly see the map turning your color. Expect no suprises, there will be none as politics barely exist and every war can be calculated and work as expected. Once you have the leverage over the game it will stay there and the game basically ends. The tactics are nice in this game. There are alot of ways to go about into battle and a combination of skill and strategy is needed to curve through a rough enemy. However the AI that is against you is pettiful at best and will always act similiar in terms of strategy, making it too easy to manipulate. there are only handful of scenarios and tactics you need to grasp and once you get familliar with them managing the battle becomes just another repetetive thing.The economy is also nice, however getting too much into it doesn't help you by much and you can probably profit better by just killing stuff. I still like it being there.Alot of design flaws... Auto resolved battles between AI is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it almost does not matter(if at all) which type of troops battle against which type of other troops or it the battle was a siege or an open battle. The AI gets more money than you by having cities and castles which breaks immersion and breaks their whole point of logical economic system and makes you feel as you are treated as a player rather than a character within the world.  Diplomacy is merely a joke, there is nothing interesting to do with prisoners. Being captured always ends the same way for you. Characters can't die. Killing bandits is too profitable and destroying their hideouts usually gives you nothing and stops their spawn which is anti intuitive and kills profit. I can go on for ever with the design flaws of this game, but it is expected from a small company.I mention all this flaws just to say I still recommend this game, because understanding flaws is easy for a reader but understanding the sense of wonder and atmosphere I get each time i open a new character is beyond simple words and I think you should buy the game to experience that.

												Personally I would say this game is a great game, however, I feel there are a few details to know before buying this game. This game was made quite a good number of years ago and therefore the graphics are also a bit outdated so if that is something you can't get over I would not suggest buying this game. Also this game does have a bit steep of a learning curve but once you learn how to play it is definetly worth it.Now as to why I think this game is so good:Well first of all there is no story line which some would see as a bad idea but the way Warband uses it, it actually works. It allows for almost any possible course of action to achieve your own personal goals wether it be becoming rich, becoming King, or even marrying a noble lady. Secondly, the modding community is huge which is constantly adding mods that can increase your experience in the game or even add even more to said experience such as a mod called the Freelance mod which makes it so you are now able to play as a regular soldier in a Lords army. Thirdly, the multiplayer can have up to 200 players! How many ""next generation"" games do you hear of being able to have 200 players fighting eachother the the death in brutal and bloody combat. Fourthly, there is a DLC for this game which I have taken a particular interest in. This mod is the Napoleonic Wars DLC which allows you to play in multiplayer games as a soldier from the time period of Napoleon conquering Europe. This DLC while not having single player (although there is a mod that is coming out eventually that will have singleplayer) seems to draw you in with its organized communities. While the initial prospect of running around in a line and having to listen to orders may seem daunting especially considering that there is generally no space between each person in a line, I assure you it is actually a lot more fun then it sounds. Imagine being able to play as a artillery unit that is able to shoot at unit such as that or playing as cavalry and gloriously charging your enemy and cutting down any that get in your way. Or getting a reputation as a deadly sniper as a part of a skirmisher or line infantry regiment. With 200 players able to play in one server at once all these units can all be in the same server working together. So imagine marching towards enemy positions with artillery flying overhead and the cavalry charging past you while the skirmishers snipe important enemy personel.			",87,8,0,17,14,0,16

												Well what can i say, i've spent just over 500 hours ingame, and mostly single player. This game has awesome re-play value. The multiplayer is brutal, but it does have an awesome community following. The mods change this game completely, so many great mods out there. The melee fighting is brilliant, and still better than most medieval style melee games action wise. If you prefer gameplay over graphics (even though you can make the graphics better with mods) then this is the game for you, Give it a try and i can guarantee you will not be dissapointed.

												So I'm finally writing a review for Warband, one of the best games I've played for the longest time. 4 years now and I'm still coming back, but the thing is, I'm not playing the vanilla game. Oh no, this is one of the most mod-friendly games out there. The vanilla game is good, yes, I enjoyed it the first time I played, but mods just improve it so much that there really is no point to play the vanilla version again.Basically, in this game you got to become the ruler of the land. In vanilla, the land is called Calradia and you are destined to rule it. You make your character, pick your history and then basically start out as nobody. The world is open to you, you can be anyone in this game. A trader, a mercenary, a bandit, an explorer, a vassal to a monarch, but the path leads to one thing - becoming a ruler yourself.Also, there are mods which don't require you to become a ruler of anything, mods which are just open world battles, adventures, roleplaying or all of them combined.

												This game provides some of the best feeling combat mechanics I have ever played with. The fighting with cavalry is particularly great, as the swings you throw with your sword/axe/stick feel heavy and very satisfying when they hit. But most of all this game has to be played for its multiplayer, with a huge scope for medieval battles with your friends, it is a great fun experience. Definitely recommend this, as well as the Napoleonic Wars DLC. Great medieval awesomeness, guaranteed!			",11,0,0,1,3,0,3

												So I'm finally writing a review for Warband, one of the best games I've played for the longest time. 4 years now and I'm still coming back, but the thing is, I'm not playing the vanilla game. Oh no, this is one of the most mod-friendly games out there. The vanilla game is good, yes, I enjoyed it the first time I played, but mods just improve it so much that there really is no point to play the vanilla version again.Basically, in this game you got to become the ruler of the land. In vanilla, the land is called Calradia and you are destined to rule it. You make your character, pick your history and then basically start out as nobody. The world is open to you, you can be anyone in this game. A trader, a mercenary, a bandit, an explorer, a vassal to a monarch, but the path leads to one thing - becoming a ruler yourself.Also, there are mods which don't require you to become a ruler of anything, mods which are just open world battles, adventures, roleplaying or all of them combined.

												Графика тут конечно не главное! Главное атмосфера и фирменные плюшки присущие только Mount & Blade: Warband,если вы когда нибудь хотели быть средневековым рыцарем или кавалеристом или лучником или арбалетчиком или копейщиком....короче если вы хотели мочилово в стили а ля средневековье берите моунт.Тут кстати есть тактическая составляющая и пока вы не достигли врага (или он вас) можно подумать как побольше народу завалить.Множество режимов. Для новичков рекомендую карту Арена. (деадматч или теам деадматч) p.s. Лучше брать когда распродажи,мало ли, не понравится, а так денег меньше потратите.Оценка 7/10			",214,11,7,18,19,3,60

												For every player who likes third-person/first-person medieval action, this game is so much worth it! Mount And Blade Warband does a fantastic job to recreate a medieval world and puts so much effort in detail.You can become a well-respected trader or a warmongering king! The possibilities are endless!NOTE:When you are more of the historical person (like me), I recommend highly you try the mod 1257 Anno Domini. It's Soooooo good! Exploring medieval Europe in an brutal timeperiod. Become a vassal of one of the many kings, choose your allegiance to one of the countless factions or become a king of your own. Where Mount and Blade Warband did a very good job, the modders of 1257AD did a fantastic job!Good Points:- Huge troop choice- Countless possibilities- Eye for detail- Looks amazingBad Points:- May become repetitive. But If you can roleplay your hero, you can play this until the end of times.- Relatively slow start. (Building up renown, army, relations,...)Conclusion:This game earns a 8,5/10(Note: This is my personal reflection of the game and mod)			",88,14,3,15,11,1,28

The multiplayer is brutal, but it does have an awesome community following. The mods change this game completely, so many great mods out there. The melee fighting is brilliant, and still better than most medieval style melee games action wise.

												This game never fails providing me with the medieval atmosphere when I need it.Creating a new character in this game is a joy. When you just start creating your new character and send it to the world you are confronted with so many little decisions and adventures that you can take on many approaches. Be a soldier, a merchant, an outlaw or an adventurer - You can do it! The first 10-20 hours in any game are simply pure fun and all are unique in their way. Choosing your lord is exciting, joining a war is exciting, attending tournaments is exciting - it is all just great and has a unique feel that sits just right.However, the game seem to stop giving an effort at late-game, once you become strong enough to be a lord which is the one and only end-game scenario you can achieve, things become dull and repetetive. You will go about the same way from castle to castle as you slowly see the map turning your color. Expect no suprises, there will be none as politics barely exist and every war can be calculated and work as expected. Once you have the leverage over the game it will stay there and the game basically ends. The tactics are nice in this game. There are alot of ways to go about into battle and a combination of skill and strategy is needed to curve through a rough enemy. However the AI that is against you is pettiful at best and will always act similiar in terms of strategy, making it too easy to manipulate. there are only handful of scenarios and tactics you need to grasp and once you get familliar with them managing the battle becomes just another repetetive thing.The economy is also nice, however getting too much into it doesn't help you by much and you can probably profit better by just killing stuff. I still like it being there.Alot of design flaws... Auto resolved battles between AI is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it almost does not matter(if at all) which type of troops battle against which type of other troops or it the battle was a siege or an open battle. The AI gets more money than you by having cities and castles which breaks immersion and breaks their whole point of logical economic system and makes you feel as you are treated as a player rather than a character within the world.  Diplomacy is merely a joke, there is nothing interesting to do with prisoners. Being captured always ends the same way for you. Characters can't die. Killing bandits is too profitable and destroying their hideouts usually gives you nothing and stops their spawn which is anti intuitive and kills profit. I can go on for ever with the design flaws of this game, but it is expected from a small company.I mention all this flaws just to say I still recommend this game, because understanding flaws is easy for a reader but understanding the sense of wonder and atmosphere I get each time i open a new character is beyond simple words and I think you should buy the game to experience that.

												Personally I would say this game is a great game, however, I feel there are a few details to know before buying this game. This game was made quite a good number of years ago and therefore the graphics are also a bit outdated so if that is something you can't get over I would not suggest buying this game. Also this game does have a bit steep of a learning curve but once you learn how to play it is definetly worth it.Now as to why I think this game is so good:Well first of all there is no story line which some would see as a bad idea but the way Warband uses it, it actually works. It allows for almost any possible course of action to achieve your own personal goals wether it be becoming rich, becoming King, or even marrying a noble lady. Secondly, the modding community is huge which is constantly adding mods that can increase your experience in the game or even add even more to said experience such as a mod called the Freelance mod which makes it so you are now able to play as a regular soldier in a Lords army. Thirdly, the multiplayer can have up to 200 players! How many ""next generation"" games do you hear of being able to have 200 players fighting eachother the the death in brutal and bloody combat. Fourthly, there is a DLC for this game which I have taken a particular interest in. This mod is the Napoleonic Wars DLC which allows you to play in multiplayer games as a soldier from the time period of Napoleon conquering Europe. This DLC while not having single player (although there is a mod that is coming out eventually that will have singleplayer) seems to draw you in with its organized communities. While the initial prospect of running around in a line and having to listen to orders may seem daunting especially considering that there is generally no space between each person in a line, I assure you it is actually a lot more fun then it sounds. Imagine being able to play as a artillery unit that is able to shoot at unit such as that or playing as cavalry and gloriously charging your enemy and cutting down any that get in your way. Or getting a reputation as a deadly sniper as a part of a skirmisher or line infantry regiment. With 200 players able to play in one server at once all these units can all be in the same server working together. So imagine marching towards enemy positions with artillery flying overhead and the cavalry charging past you while the skirmishers snipe important enemy personel.			",87,8,0,17,14,0,16

												Lightly grease two baking trays. Pre-heat the oven to 220°C/425°F/Gas 7.Measure the flour and baking powder into a processor. Add the butter and process until a crumble, then add the sugar. Or make by hand by rubbing  the butter into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.Beat the eggs together until blended and make up to a generous 300ml (1/2 pint) with the milk, then put about 2 tablespoons of the egg/milk aside in a cup for glazing the scones later. Gradually add the egg/milk mixture to the dry ingredients until you have a soft dough. It is far better that the scone mixture is on the wet side, sticking to your fingers, as the scones will rise better.Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and flatten it out with your hand, or use a rolling pin, to a thickness of 1-2 cm (1/2 – ¾ inch). Use a 5 cm (2 inch) fluted cutter to stamp out the dough by pushing the cutter straight down into the dough (as opposed to twisting the cutter) then lift it straight out. This ensures that the scones will rise evenly and keep their shape. Gently push the remaining dough together, knead very lightly then re-roll and cut more scones out as before. Arrange the scones on the prepared baking trays and brush the tops with the reserved beaten egg/milk mixture to glaze. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the scones are well risen and golden. Cool on a wire rack, covered with a clean tea towel to keep them moist. Serve as fresh as possible, cut in half and spread generously with strawberry jam and top with a good spoonful of thick cream.How to make Scones, I really shouldn't need to persuade you why to buy this. Just do it.			",70,1,1,8,3,1,10

												Mount & Blade: Warband is one of the best games I have played in a while. The combat is solid, the factions have their own strengths and weaknesses and the battles are hectic and massive. This is one of the only games I have seen that actually lets you be part of the battle instead of some sort of skygod. Did I say the battles were awesome yet? If I did let me say it again, the battles can range from small skirmishes to large scale battles. In addition to the field battles you also have the ability to seige castles and cities and if that isn't your style, why not raid a few peasent villages for loot and plunder!There are countless things I could say that are good about Mount & Blade: Warband including the Mod support. Like Game of Thrones? The have a mod for that. Want the game to take place in Feudal Europe? They have a mod for that as well! There are a bunch of other mods for the game so the replay value is extremely high.The game does have a couple of downsides though.One of them being the graphics. If you are looking for a visually stunning game this may not be for you. Along with that there is very little voice acting. The only voice acting you will hear are the warcrys of the soliders on the battlefield and the bandits as well as some farmers, so don't be expecting Morgan Freeman or Jennifer Hale as voice actors and voice actresses.The early game is quite difficult as well (or at least it was for me.) You will constantly be attacked by Bandits, Sea Raiders and the like until you amass a big enough force to take them and then still they will  sometimes attack you.But if you can look past these flaws I think you will have a great time. I know I did! Thank you for reading my review for the great game and I am sorry if this review isn't that great as it is my first review!Thanks for your time.Best regards-A Crazed Engineer			",11,1,0,4,3,2,2

												This game really surprised me. I went into it with a negative mindset however, my mind was quickly changed! This is game truely is a ""create your own adventure"" game. You create everything from your character, their backgrounds, their purpose, jobs etc. My favorite part of the game are the ""Custom Battles."" You create what game mode it is, the two sides fighting, the number of troops and so much more! This game may have pretty bad graphics, but graphics have no affect on how fun a game is! this game is must have for any Open world, Fantasy, Medival, or RPG fans!100000000000/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warband is a game where you play as anything from a lowly peasant to a lowly noble and become a somewhat less-lowly monarch of a low fantasy world. While the base game is fun, I do recommend getting some mods installed, as they vastly improve upon the vanilla gameplay.Also: Don't expect to be amazing in MP instantly.			",81,9,0,28,53,3,52

 A brilliant RPG Just picture a vast continent filled with 22 cities and 48 castles each with several villages split amongst 6 factions constantly at war fighting for control and it's all your playground. Do you play the noble knight, swearing homage to a lord and defending the poor peasants? How about a bandit pillaging the villages and raiding trade caravans to line your pockets? Or maybe you have aspirations for the throne. Build an army and carve out an empire under your own banner. These are but a few options that you can take.There are a sizeable amount of skill options that allow the creation of many types of characters from the heavily armoured knight to the swift horse archer.The game has a rather steep learning curve however practice and patience will give results.The difficulty is easily customised to your preference from the options menu.The graphics are dated by today's standards and there are still some bugs.The multiplayer is still active at the time of writing with many dedicated players.It offers multiple game modes / Deathmatch(free for all) / Team Deathmatch / Siege (teams attack and defend castles) / Capture the Flag / Battle (no respawns).The community is a mixed bunch, with about an equal split between friendly and ill mannered players.There is a vast active modding community that offers players the ability to change the settings and mechanics of the game. Genkokujo(Sengoku jidai era of Japan), A Clash of Kings(Game of Thrones) Anno Domini(13th Century Europe), Just to name a few.

This game has a lore that will bring you back and back again, and always has new things to throw at you, some may kill you, some may make you the ruler of calradia			",49,3,0,7,6,0,6

												This game can take many hours away from your life as you participate in large medieval battles, do side quests for other people, make relations with lords and kings, spend money on armor, weapons, and horses, create enemies with other factions, take over castles, raid villages, kill people, ransom people, get married, start your own kingdom, become a new king, and much more. Plus warband includes multiplayer and is easily moddable.Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys medieval games and RPG games in general. ",110,2,0,9,14,0,12

												This is a game that I've been following since a beta release of the very first game of the series. Even though neither its graphics are flawless nor its script is awesome, it **will** entertain you for many seasons to come.What shall you become? A vassal, a mercenary, a raider or will you try the impossible: to become the one and only King of Caraldia? You'll choose. This is by far the best game in the series so far. Definitely.Um jogo que acompanho desde uma versão beta do primeiro da série. Os gráficos não são os melhores do mundo, nem o enredo é excelente, mas vai te entreter por muitas estações.O que você será? Um vassalo de um dos reinos, um mercenário, um bandido ou tentará ser rei da Caraldia? A escolha é sua. Este é o melhor da série. Definitivamente.			",688,244,18,103,58,4,95

												This game has two cameras First person and third person, Now the point of that game well there really isn't you choose the path you will take and the future of calradia, This game is an open world mix between a Strategy/action/adventure, You can become a bandit or kill them for loot! You can become a Vessel of a lord or a mercenary for the multiple factions or even make your own faction In this game or you can choose your own path and loot and burn villages, take over towns you name it this game is actually multiple games in one! You will never get bored there are so many mods that change all that you know about Mount and blade! You will not regret buying this game!			",155,18,2,22,41,1,50

												Over a thousand hours poured into the game. I decided its time to say exactly why I've spent this much time playing it.Warband is a game that attempts many things, being a medieval combat sim, a sandbox, a RPG of sorts, and much more. It has many strengths and a few weaknesses.PROS:Strong modding community. There are hundreds of innovative and fun mods that reall revamp the game and add new life to it each time you play.(To name a few, Blood and Steel, A New Dawn, cRPG(this ones MP), Perisnio, and thats not even scratching the surface). Infinite replay value. Each time you replay you can do something completly new and differentThe melee combat is somewhat difficult to learn but once you do its innovative and always funMultiplayer in just native is somewhat boring, but there are a few mods that add tons of new stuff. Like Persistent World which makes it sort of like an MMO, cRPG which adds consistent characters, and I'm sure there are a few more.CONS:Lack of things to do in Native gets a bit boring.Ranged in base game and most mods is very overpowered.

												This game really surprised me. I went into it with a negative mindset however, my mind was quickly changed! This is game truely is a ""create your own adventure"" game. You create everything from your character, their backgrounds, their purpose, jobs etc. My favorite part of the game are the ""Custom Battles."" You create what game mode it is, the two sides fighting, the number of troops and so much more! This game may have pretty bad graphics, but graphics have no affect on how fun a game is! this game is must have for any Open world, Fantasy, Medival, or RPG fans!100000000000/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best non-fantasy medieveal games on the market especially if you like to roleplay like a mother ducker, and big hairy grunting men with syphilis and gonorrhea.There's a ton of replayability to this game as well. I always like to start a new play though, because it's such a treat to start up a new game just to see all the hairy grunting men competeing for my affection. There are many different factions to choose from so you should never be bored with the same old man for long, just sell him into slavery and find another barbarian heartthrob cutie who satisfies your needs. Now once you have all that money from being such a savage you need to accessorize. You'll have tons of weapons and armor to choose from so you can pimp out you and your new boy toy the way you want.Once you look the part and you've become the best pimp in all the land you obviously need a place for you and your hunky piece of meat to stay. Don't you worry! There are God Damn castles for you and your man to run around in, NUDE, while all the peasents suffer because of the poor decisions you've made. Hope you're happy.Once you swoon all the hunks and dispose of the genetic abominations, you can become king causing your male escort ring to never be questioned again by those unworthy. On top of all this you can download excellent mods that further enhance the expierence by turning all the men into glorified sex gods. My personal favorite being Floris, which just takes everything and turns it up to 11, OH LAWD!!So if becoming a slayer of the One Eyed Trouser Snake is your interest, buy this game right now. Especially with Mount and Blade 2 Bannerlord coming over the horizon; promising glistening, sweat dripping, hairy chested men with the testosterone levels of Harambe and the Manhood the size equal to that of a horse's. Honestly this game is a must buy just to prepare you for the upcoming release. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my hunky meat toy and his gang of pirates led by Captain Brown Starfish.			",55,2,0,7,3,0,2

												I'm going to point out only the pros and cons because i have people to send to the gulag and don't have the time to write a full review, yet.Pros:-Immersive realistic medieval world;-Amazing combat system;-Large map with a good instant map creator for battles;-Excellent faction diplomacy mechanics (for an fps rpg);-Large choice of weapons and armour, that  match existing kinds of armour that existed at the time.-Ease to mod;-Excellent mechanics for creating parties and armies, with realistic modifiers such as morale, salary, etc..;-Massive battles up to 300 people at a time, with tons of bodies that stay;-Amazing siege system with victory or defeat bringing criteria such as remaining food in the city/castle, how long to build siege equipment-Doesn't require a powerfull computer;-Tons of great mods available;-No capitalist foreign intervention;-Freedom of choice relative to your history, what you do, what you become, you can shape the fait of kingdoms, drive them to be empires or erase them from history, become a dreadfull bandit or a renown lord, you can even found your own kingdom; -Good multiplayer includes servers with up to 200 slots, amazing maps and game modes, and tons of fun, especially in a clan;Cons:-Graphics;-Game instability due to the insalation of mods or add-ons;-Once you conquer Calradia there is not much else to do;-Singleplayer will get you hooked up for 200 hours before you go buy Napoleonic Wars and forget about Native;-Swadians knights=rage+frustration;-""Overpowered"" weapons in multiplayer don't allow for good balance in matches, especially sieges;-Hard to learn combat since singleplayer bots play in a different style from 90% of players who won't give you a chance in the game and will constantly abuse you;-No russian bias;9.7/10 would m&b again.

Look at how few people actually dislike the game.			",311,60,5,26,21,1,18

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a game like none ever before. It is peerless, perfect and a true everlasting masterpiece.It is an open world sandbox medieval RPG large scale battle simulator.Start out as an unknown adventurer and rise to be one of the mightiest lords, if not a ruler, of the entire realm. Don't get put off by the dated visuals, the depth is infinite and Warband is one of the best ten games I have ever played in my entire life so far. (And I played thousands of them)What might start out as a confusing journey to some, becomes the pinnacle of immersement when you're riding with 200 knights along you into battle, singling out the enemy commander and killing him in single combat while dozens of arrows hit the ground next to you.I can't wait for Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord to finally finish development. It is personally my most expected game of the decade.			",529,261,7,96,60,4,154

												I told my cousin about this game. I told him it was cheap and that maybe he'd like it.He said, ""Why not?"" and later purchased the game. That was the last time I have spoken to him. No one has seen or heard from him since he installed the game. We try asking if he's alright, if he wants to hang out, how he's doing, etc... Nothing works. No response. We have pretty much given up at this point. Thankfully I do know that he's alive and fine. I can see his green name on my friends list, nearly 24/7, showing me that he is in-game traveling and fighting his way through the lands of Calradia. I miss you Stealth. We all miss you. If you are reading this, please, please message me or any of your friends back. We are starting to get seriously worried.10/10			",71,4,1,10,3,0,4

												Great flight mechanics, solid cutscenes too! Those romance scenes are actually pretty decent for the engine they are on.  I really got attached to Talim, given her cute and innocent personality. I'm also glad they is no early game grind either, its just click matchmaking and your on your way to quick espionage action. I really wish they were politics involved too, it would really reflect the political instability in Gracemeria, given the turmoil after the meteors.But Taleworlds really have to work on the penetration system for the weapons. I mean seriously, theres times where I've been one-shotted in the hull armor with by an Arquebusier in mid-lane. As a CSAT Ranger nonetheless, 10 minutes after the paradrop!Don't listen to the hate either, the microtransactions are very worth it, and are very cheap for the amount of content they give too. I bought a few DLC skins for the MMO mode, where 1000s of players get together in a 3-way faction open war. My recomendation? The Naval Warfare DLC that comes equipped with authentic and historically accurate weaponry for the period.All in all, flight combat is a blast, avoid the riflemen, try not to get ganked, and romance everyone. 0/10 Terrible Voice acting.

												Mount and Blade: Warband is a sandbox RPG set in the fictional land of Calradia. This game is certainly in my top five favorite games of all time, and my Steam in-game hours tell that story. This game is full of nostalgic elements which make up for its graphical and other technical shortcomings.   M&B: Warband is one of a kind. It has immersive gameplay, sophisticated yet simple troop managment, a vast variety of weapons and armor, multiple factions, marriages, relationships, companions, wandering poets, belligerent drunks, great combat mechanics, tournaments, enterprises, and nostalgic, humorous dialogue during encounters with lords and bandits alike.   With so many options as to how to play the game, this game has a high replay value, you can play multiplayer, custom battles, be a wondering scoundrel, a bandit raider, an honorable gentleman, a hated vagabond, or even a lord of an existing kingdom or king of all Calradia!     This game has a few downsides however. It takes many hours to learn the game mechanics well, and hundreds of hours to successfuly conquer Calradia (if you even dare attempt it). It also lacks graphicaly and at times lacks some immersive elements that many would enjoy (mods can do wonders, however).   If you want a game with medieval lore, a great modding community (I would recommend the ""Diplomacy"" mod is you would like more options as a lord when it comes to diplomatic relations and such), addictive gameplay, and full of challenging economic, diplomatic, and military dynamics, look no further than Mount and Blade: Warband!

												Mount & Blade: Warband is a grand role-playing experience set in the land of Calradia. What this game lacks in graphics, it makes up for in mechanics. Where it falls short in deep characters, it redeems itself with raiders drinking from your skull. This is a great game for doing what you want, and having some fun while you do it. I find these types of experiences to be some of the best to be had in within a game. The combat is streamlined, and the multiplayer really shows off how well the combat can function when participating in duels. I'd recommend this game both for its single-player campaign where you are thown into the world to discover your purpose, and then achieve it; along with its multi-player modes which is fun to challenge yourself in combat, or ruin someone's day with throwing axes. I've made a video discussing how story-telling works within Mount & Blade: Warband. Feel free to check it if the topic interests you! -

												Multiplayer is alot of fun. There are many people scrambling around fighting and having fun, rounding from seiges, to duels, to even large battles. The modding community for this game makes many great mods, multiplayer or singplayer. My personal favorite mod is the Brytenwalda mod.  The DLCs for the game are great aswell, in the case of napoleanic wars, there are many regiments and fun yet grueling line battles to go around. All in all, I give the multiplayer a 7/10 and the singleplayer a 9/10 as I feel it is more fun than the multiplayer. I recommend this game to anyone who feels they may like it, it is worth a try!

												This game,If you enjoy a great allrounded RPG this is for you. Yes its getting old and a new game called bannerlord is coming out soon but you just want to wait go ahead but not trying Warband will be a big mistake.i've played this game for hours on end and enjoyed every second, the grueling hours sat sieging a castle to realise you've been oblivious and there is now a huge army behind you helping their ally, or when you get your first castle won through pure strength and decide it isn't enough and go for more and by the end you control nations.as you can tell i love this game and so should you.

												Mount and blade warband is a game that drops you into a land where you must pick one of 7 different nations. At first when picking my character's backstory I realized that your past effects the way you communicate with nobles and people, also determines you skills on the battlegrounds.When I got this game I thought it would just be a game that would concentrate only on combat and nothing much else. I was so wrong about what I thought this game would be. The more I play through it, the more I learn about it. I never thought I would be the leader of a kingdom when playing the game. The game devs made some really good things when making this game. They made an atmosphere and vibe that makes it feel all realistic. I don't know how they did it... but they made me like an rpg for the first time in my life( which I get really bored of rpgs fast). I can obviously tell that the way that the different possibilities that occur are made with love, almost as if the devs were determined to make this game with much enthusiasm. Although when there comes a game, no matter how good it is, there will be flaws. For example: Not able to lead your troops with a lot of options(Movement: charge, stand ground, hold position, etc.). It restricted me from making alot of battle strategies that I could have used to win the fight, but instead I am  to do nothing but only 3 commands. All of the other problems I have with this game are trivial and should not move your away from buying this game.			",90,13,0,2,9,2,6

The gameplay is ok but if you get bored you can enable cheats which is like a big guilty turd on your brothers bed.  Fun while it lasts with a bitter guilty aftertaste.  The real treasure lies in it's mods which are seemingly endless and some are bigger than the game itself.Would recommend as a fun time sink.			",71,4,0,6,7,1,9

												Best game ever made. Easily get 1000 hours over this. If you like knights, medieval era and roleplaying this game is definitely for you. If you like the 1700-1800 era aswell you can get the DLC napoleonic wars. Its really fun to join regiments and do a so called linebattle (Clan Battle). I love the cannons in that DLC, and I love the Persistent World mod aswell (Doesnt require any DLC).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He stood and observed the audience with tired, almost lifeless eyes. Cleaning his throat, he started his speech:- Today it is my third day without Mount & Blade: Warband. 70... 78 hours to be precise...The audience was shocked. The silence rested in the room for few seconds until someone on the left started a timid clap, leading the rest of the room. Everybody was marvelled - how could someone start playing Mount & Blade: Warband and quit for 78 hours?! That was almost beyond comprehension.He said, with a half smile on his lips but the fatigue in his soul still clear in his eyes:- Thank you, thank you. It is hard, but I am struggling. After 3 years and a half, I believe... my brothers, I believe I will never look back.A young boy could be seen whispering in his neighbour's ears- Do you think I'll get there some day? Do you think I will manage to stop playing one day?to which the other boy replied- We can only dream... he has shown us that there is hope...The audience went nuts and clapping and shouting of joy; that's what they have been waiting for, for a hope, that that young man had just unannouncedly brought to them all. With a gesture of his hands, he urged the audience to quiet down, his life slowly coming back to him at that moment, the smile brightening up in his face, and then he said- My brothers! I am free! I shall never play Mount & Blade: Warband anylonger. I have prevailed.Filled the hearts with that hope that day, that young man has never returned the MBW Addiction Centre. Two days from that he would find out that he was very wrong - he answered the call to save Calradia, and returned to Mount & Blade: Warband, and was once again showered by the glory of the battlefield.- One does not simple stop playing Mount & Blade: Warbandhe thought. Yet this time he was almost right for that was almost the truth. None, none of them could possibly rid their lives from Mount & Blade: Warband ever again, until that day in which a greater glory would await.Until Mount & Blade: Bannerlord, their souls was bound - and they knew it.

												Mount & Blade is a very fun, its takes some skill to know when its just not your fight in the Single Player and alot of team work in multiplayer. Mods/ DLC for M&B are also very fun... especially Napoleonic Wars DLC there is a large community for it and regiments for you to play with .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wasn't interested in this, but now I see what all the positive reviews are about. The overworld RTS elements mixed with actual FPS Medieval Battles is awesome. Recruiting/Upgrading soldiers, plundering villages, sieging castles. Really addicting. I didn't see much going on online but my time played is all Single Player. Bad first impression...looked and played pretty ghetto, but I was hooked right away after getting out on the map recruiting. There are some ""So bad it's good"" elements, but for the most part it's just fun.			",283,53,7,55,12,2,20

												Great game anyone who buys this game will satisfied by the amount of time played and the amount of mods it has. It is an amazing game over all. The graphics aren't really a bother because you are more focused on trying to murder everything in your way. If you don't believe me try the demo for the first game it isn't as good but it gives you the basics of what mount & Blade Warband is like.			",46,3,0,2,7,1,1

												Probably one of my favourite games ever, not only is it a fun and challenging game but it also has a great modding community that just makes things so much more amazing.  If you pick this game up I would suggest the Floris mod, adds a whole lot of stuff to the game to keep you going for many hours.			",63,6,1,10,11,0,3

												With the exception of TF2, this is one of the few games I could say I have spent every hour playing, rather than eating sandviches for hats. Be it the satisfying single player, heavily modded or otherwise, or the devastating multi player, this game has the only melee combat system I will ever truly love.Oh and napoleonic wars is interesting too. I used to do linebattles and so on in a group for it.			",272,50,2,57,65,3,61

												Pros:1. Funny voiceover2. Great modding community. I have personally seen a better community only at Medieval II Total War3. Combat mechanics, considering the fact that the game was released in 20104. DLCs are worth paying, not like those ""add a character"" or ""add a weapon"" DLCs5. Good optimization. One could even play it on those 50$ mini-PCs-6. Interesting singleplayer story.Cons:1. Bugs now and then.2. No voicechat implemented. For the people who like medieval games, I strongly recommend this game.			",51,3,4,5,9,0,21

												I decided to write a serious review for this game to show my respect and unfortunately, disappointment for warband.So the concept is simple, ally with a faction until strong enough, then create your own faction to take over the world. The good1. RealismThis game is brutal, you spend hours and hours grinding for the perfect army and then accidentally save at the wrong time or activate realism mode. You lose your army and become a prisoner, when released, only to be beat up b the pirates you once pwned on a daily basis.2. ModsThere are literally thousands of mods in this game that completely revolutionize your experience of warband. After combing through 5 total conversion mods, I conclude that the modding community for this game is very talented and dedicated, mods or warband potentially could give it hours more of content.3. CombatAction in this game isn't exactly the selling point of this game, but not too shabby. Stradegy, though often mentioned in reviews, is not really its highlight. After much thought, the most effective stratedgy seems to always be having the cavalry flank, and infantry in front of the archers as shields. The intricate commands offered by the game gives chance for experimentation with the game's combat mechanics. The Bad:1. Lack of incentivesThere is no goal of this game other than (I'm assuming) to conquer the factions. Now even if that itself were a reasonable incentive, I feel like the lack of storyline in this game makes it hard to sit through hours of combat grinding and trading to obtain a bigger army. Addition of smaller, story related objectives would motivate me better than tedious grinding, doing the guild master quests' over and over again. The others:1. GraphicsAgain, no the selling point of this game, but acceptable as the game isn't dependent of graphics but rather its creative playstyles and hours of tinkering with the game, therefore making graphics only a small portion of this review.2. WorldThere should be more characters in the game. The first few hours might appear fresh with different quests given by every king, guild master and village elder, but very soon players realize they are just the same quests. Though the world seems lively and flexible to the player's play style, soon, merchant players will realize there are trade routes that always guarantee profit, players that make money off prisoners will realize most battles are simply repetitions as long as one is powerful enough. Though the game promises diversity, the world of warband limits this features.Verdict:A great bang for the buck, I personally have spent a few dozen happy hours on it. However, the game is rather dry in late game.			",82,16,0,20,10,0,4
