												Doom Rails is a Car combat game which promises to speed up the gameplay and add a great twist to it. But is it a game you will want to race through ? In Doom Rails you can pick from a few diffrent racers and the stories pretty simple. You are trapped in a mad scientist lab and you have to race through 5 diffrent tracks to win youre freedom. The story is okay for this kinda game but the most important thing is the gameplay. So how is it ? It has to be one of the worst car combat games ever to be created. The Enviroments are pretty similar and are boring. Even though you can change the track in always feels the same so it gets stale quickly. The games you trying to complete goals which are timed while other racers try to kill you. The game cheats horribly. So let me explain. There are weapons that you need to kill enemies that are laid on the track. When you hit a buttont to get them you always miss them. When you pick them up is decided by dumb luck. Enemies constantly spawn on you so its hard to kill anyone or get an item. Overall Doom Rails is a pathetic excuse for a car combat game and not to mention it has DRM that states you can play the game only on 5 machines. Doom Rails is boring and a poorly done game if you want to pick it up wait for a huge discount. I give Doom Rails a 4/10			",904,350,32,94,59,7,85

												This classic by Naughty Dog has aged so well and still to this date you can feel the emotional bonding between the protagonist 'Doom Rail' and Ellie as they struggle to survive in a post apocalyptic world run by your evil clone 'Doom Rail' hence the title 'Doom Rails'.This intricate plot bridges and intertwines between Naughty Dog's present triple A titles including 'Call of Duty 4' and 'Madden 53' so i suggest you play doom rails first before you can experience their newer titles at a more personal and emotional level of entertainment.
