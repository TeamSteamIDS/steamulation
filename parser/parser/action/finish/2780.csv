												IF YOU HAVE A INTEL HD GRAPHICS CARD ON WINDOWS 7 64BIT. THIS GAME WILL NOT WORK UNDER THE NEWEST PATCH. (1.18). THIS BUG WILL NOT BE FIXED. THE GAME WILL NOT BE UPDATED.IN ORDER TO GET IT TO WORK WITHOUT BUYING A COMPLETLY NEW VIDEO CARD, 1) RENAME ARMA.EXE TO ARMAOLD.EXE2) SEARCH AROUND FOR A ARMA.EXE THAT IS FROM VERSION1.14 OR EARLIER, PREFERIBLY V1.143) MOVE THE NEW ARMA.EXE TO YOUR GAME INSTALL FOLDER.4) THEN, IN THE DOWNLOAD SETTINGS , SET THE GAME TO ****NOT**** AUTO UPDATE.5) enjoy.MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK WITH THIS FIX. THE ONLY WAY TO GET MULTIPLAYER TO WORK IS TO GET A NEW VIDEO CARD SINCE VERSION 1.18 DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH INTEL HD GRAPHICS. NIVIDIA IS RECOMENDED.			",73,24,2,16,55,0,33

												There isn't much to say, it's a good tactical shooter. The missions are fun and it's full of drivable vehicles. Commanding a squad of soldiers is a little tedious because of the clunky command system but you get used to it. Other than that, I rather enjoyed my time in this game. There isn't anything particularly bad about it, the missions were challenging and I died a lot but I did manage to get by eventually. The campaign is non-linear, it gives you simple choices between differing fronts of engagement and those choices have benefits and consequences. I recommend it to anyone who fancies tactical shooters.Pros:Challenging missionsFull squad commandsMany drivable vehicles (air, ground, sea)Non-linear campaignLarge open maps with fairly detailed environmentsInteresting tactical firefightsCons:Some distant sounds will sound like they're near you.Large scale engagements will sometimes resolve themselves before you even get there to take part. I often got lost and had to take detours through hills and towns just to get to the engagement point and by the time I got there, the battle was already won or lost. You need to be quick when you get your objective.Objectives are not always clear. Might require some exploring, trial and error.Neutral:Menus/UI feel touchy and don't always respond to the first clickNo music (for me it isn't a con because I usually turn game music off anyway)AI is sporadic at best. It will either spot you from 800m away and snipe you or it will walk in random directions 100m off until you shoot at it. But once you do get it's attention, it seems to do alright in a fight.Overall, I liked this game, it was fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a gamer who owns all ARMA series, I really want to say, from a retrospective perspective, the game is improving over years but not quite. The graphics and physics certainly become better in latter ARMA2 updates and in ARMA3: vehicles respond to rugged terrains, ragdoll systems etc. Yet that is the only thing I feel ""realistic"" about this game. Other elements are not at all close to real. The map is huge but monotonous(I guess because it's largely computer generated); the way objects interact is ultimately awkward(they still struggle with it in ARMA3); close-up scenario looks beautiful but depth field is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥. These ruthlessly dim the only few other highlights of ARMA.			",34,7,1,2,6,0,8

												Do you enjoy a challenge? Do you enjoy modding games? Do you enjoy being shot in the back of the head from six miles away while you are behind a tree? If you answered yes, no or maybe to all of the above, then ARMA is the game for you. Seriously, it is a classic military sim. However, sometimes it’s so realistic that it’s unreal!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma is the true sequel to Operation Flashpoint and, seven years after its release, I still rate it as one of my all time favourite PC games. The gameplay feels a little clunky compared to subsequent Arma titles but for an old game Arma offers an impressive freedom of movement and immersion. It also has a relatively easy mission editor and I've spent many hours playing Arma online.			",64,2,2,11,15,0,10

												ARMA is an extremely interesting concept - unique (as far as I know) to the ARMA series - that is very nearly pulled off. The realism creates gripping gameplay, with immersion being let down by AI and audio issues. The game is bound with plausible (if a bit simple) storey, with a few twists throughout that gets the player thinking! The graphics are also very well done (for it's age), with fantastic scenery delivered by a well optimised engine that allows for smooth, 60FPS gameplay!A few issues, but worth a look as one of the precious few examples of the realistic shooter genre!

												Attention WIndows 8 users, dis[ite what people say this DOES work on Windows 8, my friend has 8 and played it with meyesterday. That being said this ArmA title is amazing and is like arma 2 but it can run on super low end PCs if you set your graphics settings right and it will still look good. I reccomend setting toggle zoomout to be in sinc with your optics button in the controls it looks amazing. Also, download ACE mod 1.0.9 of the internet and the game becomes AMAZING, like up to par with newer ArmA titles if not better. If you wan't to play CoD this game is not for you go home, but if you wanna play the defining milsim experience of last gen buy this its 7 dolars+ you can play lan online with your friends using tungle but the internet gamespy servers are shut down so you have to use tunngle.

												I cant get the game to work on windows 7, I have tried everything! Is there a way to downgrade so it will work? when I start the game the words are just grey boxes and there are no textures durring the game. This ruins the game. I have been an arma fan for a long time and this was going to be my first time playing an arma title. I am very dissapointed and am hoping there is a way to fix this. plz help!!!!

												Don't buy this game.  Not worth it.  Too many different errors with no really good fixes.  Can't tell if the problem is with steam or the developer but either way no one seems concerned with fixing it and neither really wants to be contacted about the game.  So it is not worth the hasell and its a gamble if you could even get it to work.  About a 10% chance that it will work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												waste of my time and money. every single arma game I buy is a disappointment to me. They claim to be real but all it is it's a broken game. Realistic games don't need to scroll a wheel to interact with everything. AIs are dumber than a hamster. On top of that making everything hardcore doesn't make it real. They have to learn from America's Army games what is realistic or not. They did do a great job with the map. That is the only thing I like about it. But, no matter what this game feels broken to me. Oh and one last thing. This is clearly an imitation of Battlefield 2. You can see the resemblance in the look. Also you can't help to think that since Battlefield 2 started the hole modern warfare fever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this game. The intro takes 30 mins and if you die at the beginning you have to wait 30 mins again. So NEVER waste your money on this game.			",69,4,2,6,5,1,3
