												Oh my....This mod seems really fun.....but no one plays it.When I say no one, I mean NO ONE.I went to try this mod out.There where no servers to pick from.So I decided to Play offline not knowingthat YOU CAN'T SEE THE ZOMBIES.Which is complete BS.Anyways sorry for my rant, but I do nto reommend this mod to anyone due to the fact NO ONE PLAYS IT.If you can find some friends to play it with you.AND you can see the zombies, then this game would be a blast.Also to bad the devs don't even support the game.                                                         3/10- No one plays it, but is fun if you can actully see the zombies.

Update: April 16, 2016Also, when I uninstalled Defence Alliance 2 about a month ago, my entire file in Killing Floor folder disappeared. I lost all of my mods (some are rare to find) that I worked hard searching for it and typing the codes into the ServerPerk mod. Defence Alliance 2 should be remove from the Steam store page.

												I don't know if this happening to anyone else, but I couldn't see the enemy at all. Is that supposed to be like that? If so, that is the worst thing I haave ever seen, no indications if the enemy is near you, only the blip on your radar. The aiming mechanics and the overall combat, was shotty at best. I couldn't reload unless I ran out of ammo in my clip, and I never figured out how to throw grenades, because my character decided it was best not to. To sum it all up, I'd say this is not the game to get until there are major changes. If I were to rate this out of ten I would give it a four, due to the fact that I at least got onto a map to play.			",26,0,0,1,1,0,1

												This should just simply be removed from Steam. Like everyone else I got it with Killing Floor, so naturally I was intrigued.Booted it up, seemed fine. No crashing, no glitches so I carried on.No servers available, well thats understandable I guess. So I started my own offline match. It crashed twice and the third time I got into the game and I got 18 achievements for no friggin reason.So after that, I thought I'll still give it a go. Walking around felt shoddy, The guns look bad.But alas, I carried on. The game told me ""Incoming"" and I was ready. But wait! Whats this? The enemies are invisible!If youre one of those people, like me, who will try a game despite negative reviews, please dont waste and hour of your life. This game has been abandoned and will probably never be updated again.Go back to Killing Floor.			",228,31,0,16,10,1,6

I'm not gonna bother with that.Here's what you now get as of this review post:

												Defence Alliance 2 is a total conversion mod for Killing Floor. The mod features six different perks and each of them have their own special abilities. Two teams face off in attack or defend scenarios where the attackers must complete their objectives before time runs out.The multiplayer is dead, there is not even one server available. Defence Alliance 2 is an awful mod with a lot of bugs and it lags as hell. It is better to play the original game instead of this mod.

												Seems like no one plays this mod anymore, it kinda became boring. Decided to play offline and frickin hell can't see the zombies either. Sorry but I do not recommend this game until  the invisible zombie bug is fixed and more people has started making servers for others to play on.			",16,0,0,0,1,0,2

												Defence [sic] Alliance 2 is dead in every sense of the word: no servers to play multiplayer on, no stat progression means no unlocks and non-functioning achievements. But you probably wouldn't have wanted to play this anyway, at least not for anything other than a quick laugh.The two main modes are 'one-sided bot deathmatch' and 'Killing Floor but with two dozen survivors and also the specimens are invisible', both taking place on all of six maps with assets so bland you'd think they were ripped from Unity.What passes for this game's music will drive you mad if you dare play for more than 10 minutes - a fitting punishment, really. The devs went silent in 2011, so we can safely say this is even deader than the original UT2004 mod.I mean, this would have been playable (in a sense) if it were still functional. It isn't functional...but it's still functional enough to be so bad it's good, if only for a little bit. Here's the real kicker though: this travesty is bundled with the original Killing Floor, so there's no real way of avoiding it if you want to play KF.At least SAM works with this game if you really care about that sort of thing.

												Defense Alliance 2 is a total conversion mod for Killing Floor featuring team based futuristic FPS game play. DA2 blends fast paced action with class based tactics to create an experience that is instantly enjoyable while still offering very deep gameplay. Two teams face off in attack/defend scenarios where the attackers must complete their objectives before time runs out. The mod features six different classes: Medic, Mechanic, Rocketeer, Machine Gunner, Sniper and the Rifleman, each with their own special abilities. Players can set up their own turrets such as cannons, miniguns, and rocket turrets, place ammo boxes, heal other players, use EMP grenades and rocket launchers against turrets, and more.In addition to the regular DA2 gameplay mode, Defense Alliance 2 for Killing Floor now features a new gameplay mod called Co-op Specimen Survival. A small group of players are set against waves of specimens. Players can use turrets and mines to build up their defense then have a limited amount of respawns with which to defeat the waves of incoming specimens. Cant recommend this♥♥♥♥♥♥			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												Update on Recent Activities:I just called the Suicide Prevention Hotline and told them I played this gameThey said, ""Just f*cking do it, p*ssy.""~Please continue to the actual reviewThis is the literal worst thing that I have ever played on any platform. Ever.I am saddened and deeply depressed that I spent 1.1 hours of my life attempting to fix and play a mutilated and broken piece of steaming and smoking garbage.How does such a classic as Killing Floor come to literally be burnt down and beaten with a rusty baseball bat until it's bloody code spills all over the dust covered ground to become this atrocity? Frankly, I should sue the developers of this torn up piece of digital hell that they created.Playing this has insured my impending alcoholism and has secured and set me up for a future of hard drug abuse. No copious amount of cocaine and no dangerous dose of heroin can ever erase this vile horror from any memory of mine.Every day I go through tedious hours upon hours of psycho-therapy from the results and trauma of playing this mangled mass of script and code made by teenage monkeys in the process of mating on a keyboard. The developers should be ashamed that humans can even sink this low. This is proof that the game market is going to hell and the human race is slowly dying. This is proof that evolution cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be true. No intelligent being with half-functioning opposable thumbs can even possibly create something this truly terrible. Therefore, this must be proof that this game was created by a newly born reptile from a hidden reptilian race underground attempting to code a game to brain wash us into wanting to kill ourselves. After playing this, I know that it will probably succeed.I'd rather put my limbs into a giant blender than play this again....2/10.			",63,8,0,12,2,0,4

												soooooodid you guys forget the zombies?i got a bot game going, not really understanding beyond shoot zombies, got going.the bots shooting and i looked at what they were shooting at.nothing.i thought, well, maybe they are killing them too fast?nope, the models for the zombies didnt loadi kept playing. shooting in the general direction of the zeds, and quickly figuring out a new game of hide and go seek with guns. they were not fighting back much and that lead to me trying to free teammates.  it was, kinda fun for a bit. i mean, it might be a good mini game or something, invisible zombies. i just, go and try it, see if you get the same bug. maybe it would not appeal to you like it did me, but hell, it was kinda funny			",42,3,0,1,4,0,12

												Yup, you've heard it by now, this game's broken beyond repair.  If you can even access the main menu (as unlikely as that is),  you'll be met with no servers active, and solo play is impossible due to endless bugs and invisible hostiles.  Best to just throw the game into the fire of lost potential along with Duke Nukem Forever and Ride to Hell Retribution.			",41,3,0,4,2,0,0

												This is truly, irrevocably horrible. I know it's just a mod and it's free...but...it's bad. REAL bad. First of all, there's only four maps and they all like like reject levels from Halo. But you could even make the argument that there's just 3.5 maps since two of them are basically ugly snow fort or what ever. All the weapons are clunky and unpleasant to look at, like these horrible metal bricks someone slapped on my screen. The bots all have perfect accuracy, able to fire across the entire map with ease. Because of this the player mysteriously starts to lose health the moment they spawn. Unbeknown to them, there's some goon standing on a hill slowly shaving away their health. Plus, the only sense of conflict in the short, chaotic and at times incomprehensible matches is how many hapless rejects need to be thrown at the engineer's turrets before any progress can be made.

Good luck trying to throw a grenade! Other aspects of gameplay are terrible as well. I got spawned in the same place 5 times, leading me to die multiple times by the same guy. Online is a joke, good luck finding a server with a decent amount of players. Just stay the hell away from it and let this pathetic thing die.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
