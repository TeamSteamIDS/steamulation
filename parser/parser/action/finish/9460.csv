 I bought this game long ago, when it first released, to the people that complain and give it bad reviews, all i have to say, is, its your fault you bought it now, because what this game was, is no longer, you should have done your research before hand.I bought this game when on its release like i said (The play time hours you see are not represenative of what i actually played, since at that time such hour stat system did not exist) and in its glory days, was an amazing game, i had endless hours of fun with this, from sniping (the way sniping is meant to be done in large maps) to close quarter, vehicles, you name it. This game was ahead of its time, and its true worth was on the multiplayer, and so i cannot recommend you buy this at the current time, since the multiplayer is long gone, there are no servers.So, a few years back i would have told you to buy it, because the game was absolutely fantastic due to its amazing multiplayer, but now, i suggest you stay away and dont buy the game, because you wont be able to get the old experience from before.But, still, i will give this a Thumbs up, because i once came to love this game, and the game was a fantastic addition to my collection then, and because although you are best not buying this game anymore, it was a damn good one years back, and that deserves at least some apretiation from my part, so as a thanks, a Thumbs up for this once upon a time very good and ahead of its time Game. Thanks Frontlines, but i guess everything comes to an end.  Note: I will stress this here, so people, can understand and they dont let themselves fall into hole, The game is not playable anymore, there is no multiplayer, all servers have been shutdown, there is no way you will be able to play it online EVER again, do not yourselves get fooled, if you think there is such way, use it at your own risk. But it is from my experience that if something is too good to be true, then its because it is. Dont let yourselves take risks unnecesarily, its not worh it, i have been gaming for years now, so you can take my word for it, or maybe not, its your call, but i talk from experience.

												A pretty solid single player experience as a near-future, open-world-ish, Military themed FPS. It's not a full open world, as it's one structured area per level. I think ""open level"" would be a better description. Think of a battlefield map that has your forces moving from one side of the map to the other (like the front line moving in the trailer). This open level mechanic is refreshing for a single player experience (that isn't battlefield with bots) compared to the modern military shooter campaigns which are very linear. There's still a hint of linearity as each mission is basically about 3 target objectives (at a time) you have to capture/destroy but you can pretty much get to each of them in whatever order you want. Then another 3, and so on, until you've basically hit ever point of interest in the large scale level. It plays out somewhat like Crysis (1) or FarCry (1), but better in my opinion because the combat comes sooner, is more sustained (more ammo, more bad guys, & less time traversing the map), you have allies to fight alongside you, you're given more choice via multiple simultaneous objectives, and the level design is more than just a jungle (it's an urban jungle)This game lets you use vehicles (tanks) but you can survive w/o having to use them (unlike fights in battlefield). Then there's also using drones (RC cars/helicopters with mounted guns/bombs), which occures quite often-more than I would wish in an FPS game but at least its not the majority (or even the entirety) of any particular mission and It's possible to get the through the mission w/o using them, though can be difficult at times.Graphics may be slightly dated, but they're unified and solid. Sound is generic but it gets the job done well enough without detracting too much from immersion. Dialog is simple, not much depth. Same with the plot, but this is good as it doesn't try to cram a bunch of narrative/history into your brain when you've come to play a shoot 'em up action game. The controls are tight. You have health regeneration so as long as you have cover, you can almost always stay alive. There are still times where you may die, but the open-world game mechanic makes dying less frustrating as you are not forced to follow the exact same path that just got you killed!!No aim down sights, just some weapons with scopes as alt fire. You're able to choose your ""class"" (pre-set loadout) if you die and have to respawn in the campaign.Overall, great fun playing the single player campaign as an open level shooter. I was disappointed with the last few levels in the cities as you couldn't enter many of the large buildings which greatly restricts your movement and attack options compared to the previous levels in the game.

												This is a fun game.It ain't Battlefield, though it certainly tries very hard. Bad news first: Servers are down, you won't find anyone to play with online. Thankfully, the single player mode has a lot to offer. If you're old enough to remember Battlefield 2 and how they said it'd have a single player campaign, I'm pretty sure that's what the designers of that old frigate had in mind when they thought about it, even though it never came through eventually (thanks for that, Obama!).Graphics are still decent, weapons are neat, vehicles rock. The little boondoggle drones keep ingame monotony down. The story is surprsingly well written. I really liked how much thought went into all that just-slightly-beyond-tomorrow-tech - the experience is similar to the recent 2020-future Cowadooties, though far less spectacular, of course. Still, the designer's artistic achievement is to be applauded, if Call of Duty Advanced Blabla comes up with pretty much the same ideas five years later. Naturally, the immersive aspect is rather reduced when compared to a big-budget game like Battlefield. Often you'll find yourself just blasting at simpleton foes or hammering away at a distant installation with and IFV chaingun. Nonetheless, I was playing through this game with a big grin on my face, if only because it actually felt like a good old GAME instead of these new overscripted pseudo-movies. I'd give the single player experience a straight 8/10, though that number drops significantly after the first pass.Like I said, a real fun game. Definitely recommended when on sale, you won't regret the four hours or so it takes to  finish. After that, go for two double cheeseburgers at Mickey D's and feel like you're 15 again and all's well with the world for about an hour.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Man, I remember so many late nights playing this game.  Was a shot load of fun, esp when I would fly drones over a sniper and detonate right behind them.  So sad this entire company collapsed.I recently managed to locate the dedicated server files and was thinking about putting up a server and hopefully finding maybe 10 or more people who would want a weekly game night for FFOW.    I dont even see any dedicated servers available for rent anymore so I doubt anyone plays much.  Any interest?  Hit me up on steam.BEWARE if you are buying this game:  I remember single player was fun but there is NO multiplayer.  You can start a LAN game but there are NO BOTS to play against.  So you better have friends pleb.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic FPS, that I remember spending weeks playing when it first came out. This is the game that a lot of current FPS games learned some of their tricks from. The Campaign is fun, each mission is really long and broken up into usually 4 parts. There are not that many missions, but honestly the story gets told well, and I think there are enough missions to suit it. Some of the missions are fun enough to replay a few times, especially the defense segments, which this game excels at. Between Remote Control Droens, to Auto-Turrets, and stationary weapons you can place like the rail gun; you can have a lot of fun on these missions, and others.The multiplayer used to be fantastic, huge battlegrounds with jets, tanks, drones, and soldiers thrown into the mix made for some seriusly intense battles. Sadly this game doesn't have online multiplayer servers anymore, although there are some work-arounds if you can find the people to play with, and I know this game has a growing community here on Steam.Buy this game for its fantastic story and fun missions, consider the multiplayer a bonus if you are able to play it.

But it does a fine job of giving you fun, deadly toys to play with, from bread-and-butter handheld weapons to tanks to remote-controlled copters and rovers.  It also gives you enough space and options to choose how you want to approach each battle.  Even if it's not as polished, both these things make for a more fun experience than Modern Warfare.

												Fantastically fun game, but too short! I won't ding it for being short though. Graphically, it's on-par with even today's modern games. Gameplay, it's great. Competent, non-arcade-type gun play without the complexity of some of today's modern offerings. I've owned this game for _years_ and until looking to see if the publisher had done any further Frontlines games, I really never noticed that there was a multiplayer; yes, the option was there, but I guess I never really noticed it. I guess that this game never seemed like it would be a good MP, so maybe that was it; at least it didn't devolve in to some POS CoD or BF cheatfest gaming that only kids play these days, so maybe it's a good thing! Apparently you can still play on LAN though. So, can't ding it for lack of MP when I never noticed MP was really there.If you want a great FPS and will accept kind of a short story, check out Fuel of War, and its prequel or sequel Homefront from the same publisher.

												Frontlines: Fuel of War is a first person shooter developed by Kaos Studios (Developers of HomeFront) and Now published by Nordic games as the company acquired the IP of the game From THQ during the Closure of Bankurptcy of THQ , Kaos Studios was founded by the mod team Truama Studios for their successful PC Modification of the Year mod Desert Combat For Battlefield: 1942, the gameplay felt like a reminiscent to the Mod and Battlefield: 1942 and the story was great, graphics looks awesome, it's funny that this game is a Teen Rated Game of a first person shooter and most FPS games are now moving towards to rated Ms as of today, although saddly i won't talk about the mulit-player that the game used to had but as of today main servers of the game are no longer operating(i hope Nordic games bring the master servers running again) however Lan Mode is still running if you want to play it with friends at your house, more and all this game is great and hope that a sequel would come in the future, i rated this game a 8.1 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grabbed FOW on sale. Good FPS game that suffers from a few glitches. Still a fun game to play to kill some hours of combat. PROS:Ability to shoot, operate vehicles, aircraft (somewhat).Drones are fun to kill enemy with.A large weapons arsenal to choose from.Campaign is pretty straight forward with simple objectives.CONS:Enemy bots are bullet sponges. You can unload 50 rounds into them and they are still standing. Some don't even die from a grenade explosion.Your team AI is horrble. They will get right in your line of fire and stand there. Some will just appear in front of you in an area you haven't covered yet. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
