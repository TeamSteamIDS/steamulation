												Now that I have reached 1,000 hours (or 42 Solid DAYS of time) played in Arma 2...I think I can honestly say that some of the best and funniest times of my life have been spent on this game since when my group and I all bought it in 2012. We were all brought to it by the stunning mod called ""DayZ"", but we found that Arma 2 was so much more then just DayZ. It turned out to be the most awesome and funnest military simulator ever. The thing that makes Arma what it is, is the endless creative freedom and community that bring us memories we will have forever. And I intend to make many more in the next thousand hours I spend on Arma.			",104,14,3,12,14,1,13

ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead is best known for the popular zombie mod DayZ, which is a unique apocalyptic open-world experience.But what many of the players who bought the game only to try DayZ miss out on, is the vanilla game itself and the original experience when you join an organized clan or server to teamwork with other players during tactical missions. All servers use unique player-created missions.The missions are normally PvE, but PvP also exist to a lesser extent. Missions can range from being in an escort of military vehicles, rescue hostages, or attack/defend outposts. The game has a built-in mission editor that is easy to manage. ARMA II have plenty of realistic weapons, vehicles and characters. There are also hundreds of mods that increase the amount of everything.The game suits people who like sandbox, simulations and action games. However, it's not a very fast-paced game like the CoD or BF-series. In the ARMA-series, you might die unless the wound is treated. You have no visible healthbar and you require a map and GPS to know where you are.Useful links:Clans & Communities - Find a clan that fit you.Armaholic[www.armaholic.com] - One of many sites with plenty of usermade content.

												This game will always be embedded in my memory as one of my favorite games. Part of it is the game itself, but the majority of it is the community around it. The community I am specifically referring to is DayZAnarchy. The founder of DayZAnarchy, known as skunk, spent countless hours slaving away at his keyboard, scripting his server to be the best it could be. The work paid off, and I considered DayZAnarchy to be the best DayZ server there was. However, skunk passed away recently. No longer will DayZ be the same for me, or my friends. It makes me realize how much of his work I took for granted. I only knew him for a year, but I considered him a friend. If not for skunk, I would not love DayZ. Therefore, this is not only a review for DayZ, but a memorial for skunk.69/10 would f*** a pumpkin again. Rest in peace man.			",165,45,3,29,32,5,20

												After playing this for a few years now and obtaining over 1000 hours on this game, I think it is time I reach my verdict on it. I believe that, though this game has its challenges, it is one of THE greatest games ever devised for the Personal Computer. I feel like simply doing a Pro/Con review because it's the easiest to format.ProsDEDICATED playing and modding community - even after being out for several years, many people, myself included still play this game religiously.Incredible mod support - There are literally thousands of mods for this game. Hundreds of new, GIANT maps. Thousands of guns. Thousands of new unit types. Even entire overhall mods to change it into the Vietnam war or World War 2. Mods exist to change every sound in the game and graphical mods exist to ease the strain on lower end PC's or make the game more beautiful than it already was.Already expansive game - The game, minus mod support, already contains hundreds of units, vehicles and guns in the case of Combined opsMaps - 15km by 15km maps, enough said. Maps contain multiple towns and villages, and often 1-3 large cities and/or settlements. There are also large area with beautiful landscapes such as rocky cliffs and washing oceans.  Some custom maps can be even bigger. But to put it into perspective, Skyrim's map is about 37 square kilometers, where as the default OA Takistan map is 164 square kilometers (About 12km by 12km corner to corner). Think about that one.Replayability - I do not mean the story when I talk about this, I talk about the virtually INFINITE ability to create scenarios in the editor. Want a tank battle 20v20? You got yourself a tank battle complete with terrain big enough to house it and FOBs for both sides. Want a small special ops team to assassinate a middle eastern dictator from 1.2 km away with a 50 cal? You got it. Want to fly an attack helicopter or CAS jet into the heat of battle? You get the idea. Infinite.Graphics - Though this is something that many people would argue with me about, Arma 2 came out in 2009. Even though it was released later, OA's graphics are no better because the game is still from 2009. It's the same engine and the same game, with a different setting. Given the circumstances, I do have a very nice rig, so the graphics look pretty to me. I constantly find myself looking off a cliff while preforming recon on an enemy position and thinking ""Wow, look at that view.""Realism - This may be a turn off point for many. I, for one, live for realistic games. I often b!tch to myself about other games not being realistic enough. This game, with the addition of a few mods, can be as close to real life as you want it to be. Mods to check out for added realism are ACE 2, Retexture mods for units to make them up to date and state of the art (Changing the US Army units to Multicam from that dreaded UCP camo comes to mind), and the Zeus AI mod.Multiplayer - 100 + player games. Nothing else to say.Now for the cons, these are all the problems that I've found with the game that personally annoy me.Lag/Desync - This is only an issue with larger servers, usually. It can be annoying but rarely 100% game breakingPoor Performance - This game is not very well optimized, and if you have a weak computer, you will struggle to run it with more than 10-15 FPS. Even if you have a good rig, it will usually only max out at about 35-50 FPS. Don't let this turn you off though, you really just get used to it.Ocasional hackers - This happens very infrequently, and it only happens on big servers.Expensive - For a game as old as it is, it is a bit pricy, I reccomend waiting until a Steam sale comes around to make a purchase in the Armaverse.Lack of Realism in Some Places - This is more of a pet peeve of mine rather than an actual flaw. It annoys me that all the US Army units use the SCAR L, considering it was rejected by the Army. The light version of the SCAR is just ugly to me, and when I can, I always mod it out of the Army. This will probably not bother 90% of people considering this game, but for those that enjoy absolute realism, check out the RH M4/M16 pack on Armaholic and it's respective replacement packs. STEEP Learning Curve - Patience is a virtue. You need patience for this game. A lot of it. You will die. A lot. And you'll die some more. Guess what still happens to me regularily. You guessed it. This game is a tactical simulator, if you try to play Call of Duty, you will be swiss cheese every time. The controls can be hard to learn, and I changed them right away so I was more comfortable. Modding the game is not reccomended unless you have experinece modding similar games. Though modding is very simple, things can be screwed up if you delete or put a file in the wrong place.Time Consuming - Processes in the game take a very long time. Firefights can be anywhere from a few seconds to 30+ minutes. The time it takes moving from place to place ranges widely. If you are on foot, expect about a 35-40 minute walk from one corner of a map to another. By plane or helicopter, you can travel long distances in minutes and seconds.Frusturating - It feels really bad when you're almost done with a mission or objective, and get killed.Overall this game is by far my most played and one of my most treasured games of all time. Very few games have the scope of Arma 2 and its many addons. PS: Arma 3 is much less realistic in terms of units and gameplay, but still has the giant maps and mod support. It does have better graphics, as well. I reccomend getting both if you can afford them.EDIT: MAKE SURE YOU BUY COMBINED OPERATIONS OR THE GAME WILL SUCK.			",111,5,2,9,8,1,27

This review is for both Arma 2 & Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead combined. It is recommended to buy both games so you get all of the content and can join all the servers.Arma 2 is a realistic Military Simulator. Below I will review each aspect of the game.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The game has very enjoyable gameplay, with many different weapons and vehicles. You can do missions, play with the editor or play on multiplayer servers with many different game modes. Even if you aren't a fan of realism, this game can still be played casually.   Graphics and Optimisation The game is horribly optimised. Even people with top of the line PCs get around 20-40FPS at times. I personally have old hardware so cannot test the graphics properly, but at low they are still decent, but don't expect Arma 3 like graphics. The game gets extremely frustrating after a while due to the poor framerate. It should also be noted that the controls for this game are extremely uncomfortable to use, by that I mean it is unsatisfying and is the main problem I have with this game.   Additional Content The game features some additional DLC, however not owning the DLC is no problem at all, since the light versions allow players to gain all of the content from the DLC. However, the DLC content will be low resoloution, unless you buy the DLC. The game has no microtransactions. The game can be somewhat pay to win depending on the server, as some servers offer better weapons for premium players, but this isn't every server.   Value The game is worth the full price, as it is very enjoyable and you can get a large amount of hours out of it (for me it doesn't even get boring!). However, some people do not like the game. I recommend trying out the demo before buting the game. The game also goes on sale frequently, so it is worth waiting for that.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 9   Graphics & Optimisation 3   Additional Content 10   Value 7   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 8 Notes: This game is enjoyable both offline and online. It is one of the best military games I have played, but It is not to be confused with fast-paced action FPS games such as CoD. The 2 games are very different.			",78,7,1,5,4,0,6

Best shooter and Milsim ever! but yet the community is being killed by the cancer of DayZ.When you get this game find a server/community and join them because it will take you hours to find a server thats not DayZ i hate DayZ i hope that when the standalone is out they go to that.But this is the best FPS/Sim I have ever played. there is a very little amount of kids.AND DO NOT BUY THIS GAME JUST FOR DAYZ YOU WILL MISS OUT! thanks for reading 10/10			",129,18,6,3,15,1,4

												Brought it for DayZPlayed for at least 2000 hours (Steam didnt count most of it due to me not launching it through there)Most of my time spent in this game was playing dayz epoch, which is hands down my most favorite game (or mod, whatever) of all time, it is basically DayZ (google it if you dont know what it is, which in that case you must of been living under a rock) with base building, YOU CANT GET ANY BETTER!I also played all of the single player campaigns and DLC campaigns, which are good and all, but not the best story.Other than epoch, I probably spent most of my time on Takistan Life, which is the first online role-play I have ever experienced, and gosh is it fun! You can play civ, cop, terrorist, you can follow the law and mine for a living or do DRUGS :3 its up to you!I also played alot of wasteland, which is like a giant deathmatch on a massive map with vehicles and all, oh how many hours I have spent on independent camping the gun store xDMUCH RECCOMEND HIGHLY REPLAY VALUE 10 CAN OF BEANS / 10			",36,3,3,3,4,1,4

Serious community, not too many trolls3. Relatively intellegent AI4. Very realistic compared to most other games5. All vehicles are usable.6. Amazing editor7. Good modding communityCons:1. Way too many dayz servers2. Ai can be very stupid at times3. Randomly deletes 3d configsAll in all, this is a very good game, and i would reccomend it to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1000+ hours but didn't purchase this on Steam till after I was pretty much done with this game.This is probably my favorite game of all time. I never played a game more than this one and I will say why in this review.Back in 2011 or 2012 I remember being bored and looking for new games to play since I was new to PC gaming and always played on Consoles before this. I remember coming across a YouTube video about Arma 2 realism shooting. I thought it was interesting since I grew up playing Halo and COD when I was a kid. I seen this was something new so I thought to give it a go. I came for the realism but stayed when I noticed a server called ""Cherno life"". I had no idea what it was but it sounded interesting. --- My RP Experience ---I load into the server and I see there are Cops and Civilians. I learned that day what a online RP game was like back then. It was the funniest thing I have ever seen. People playing as Cops and chasing people who would rob a bank or gas station or commit murder. Even things like speeding got you pulled over. I never seen anything like it and I just loved it. I remember one day I got tired of some people playing as Cops just doing stupid things like killing civs for no reason and it annoyed me but I was in luck. I came across a video that had ""City Life RPG"" as the title. It was a mod and the very first I went and downloaded. It had things like sports cars and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1979 Honda Civics in the game and if you couldn't afford that than I guess you could test your luck on stealing a car but the cops could find out and you could be put in jail and that isn't fun.There was just so much to do in that mod, you could grow drugs and run a business doing it. You could do the boring legal route to and sell olives which hardly made money but it wasn't illegal. Fishing and illegal fishing (shark hunting) was a thing and if you wanted to just be clean you could even become a cop which was hard as hell to do in this server. Robbing banks was even a choice but usually a stupid one unless you had snipers or were good at tricking the cops otherwise it wasn't worth it. It was pretty much GTA but with real people instead of A.II put at least 1000+ hours into that mod because it was so different and niche that it just appealed to me. I even met people on there who I still talk to today 5 years later. The mod just had one of the best communites ever and nothing comes close to it for me. Like I said in the beginning, I came for the realism side of the game but the RP side I accidently came across kept me playing it for a very long time.--- DayZ Mod ---When I started playing Arma 2, I remember there being 4 DayZ servers. They weren't that popular either but I tried it one day and I loved the idea and the game itself. It was something that has never been done back then. I remember this mod just blowing up and 4 servers became a 1000 in 2 months. Arma 2 went from a niche game with 4,000 people playing at most to one of the top PC games out there all thanks to this mod. Survival games have been changed forever because of the success of this mod that was made into a full standalone years later and is still one of the biggest Early Access titles in history. DayZ was fun with friends but after a few months of playing it and things like Overpoch, EPoch started coming out and all the hackers started joining it kind of going annoying. Combat logging was huge back then to which ruined the mod for me but in the beginning I think it was one of the best mods ever to release.--- Realism Mods ---Played some realism mods for a bit because that is what I was looking for in Arma 2 in the first place. Mods made it so fun to play and for awhile I enjoyed it. I did this for around 3 months and just got tired of the ego some people had. The community kind of ruined it for me but overall I still enjoyed it. Some of the best mods I have ever seen in a game like DayZ so this was nothing short of incredible.I said this before and I will say it again. My favorite game of all time. One of the best communites (in some mods, DayZ was pretty bad after awhile.) and the best mods I have ever seen created in any game. I would recommend this game in 2012 but not 2016. Its kind of dead these days because its such an old game. It might still be worth playing for DayZ mod though since this game goes on sell for as cheap as $2 sometimes. Otherwise just wait for a sell.Best game ever thanks to the modding community.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's okay for singleplayer, but a great game for multiplayer. I enjoyed playing 200+ hours into this game. Mainly the domination and wasteland missions. Graphics are good and very compatible with mods.""But you have 22 hours...""You could say I have 222. My CD key was actually stolen, but thanks to the amazing customer support at Bohemia Studios I was given a spare CD key for free as they were able to identify it was a CD key theft. This encouraged me to play the game even more and enjoy it. Thanks a bunch, Bohemia.			",50,10,4,9,12,0,6

												Bought the Game for DayZ back in the DayS, still do not regret it. Early DayZ DayS where the best. Updates and new features made the game worse over time, so i quit at some point. PleaSe note that my gametime here is not even close to my actual spent time. Arma II itself - one hell of a good game, but sadly outdated. It's a very good military Sim and very fun to play with people you know. Other than that - not really worth buying anymore at this point. Thumbs up for the game, thumbs down if you want to buy it without being in a community which is actively playing it.			",561,189,17,68,47,2,97

												Sincerely, one of the best games I've ever played.The base game and it's DLC are of sufficient depth as to keep you busy for quite a while.  The learning curve to master controls is a bit steep, but once you're proficient, you're set.If you want true milsim, there are plenty of mods and communities to support that.If you're into the whole post-apocalyptic undead-walking scenario, there's a little mod for that as well.In playing this game, I have had some of the most boring times and some of the most exciting times I've ever experienced, and I've had it go from boring to HOLYFXKK in mere seconds.I've fought for my life against great odds and come out on top, I've been shrekt by cheap AI, I've outsmarted entire groups of players (and had them compliment me by accusing me of scripting), and I've walked away from my keyboard while my character crawled a few km to a town so I could fix my broken leg.This game won't always reward you for playing it, but when it does, it's a true reward.

												Not just a combat simulation.... A fun simulation.....Seriously this game gives so much bang for your buck. The amount of hours you can sink into Arma2/OA are insane as there somethng for just about anyone here from the vehicles and weapons to the walking and the missions/operations. There are communities within the game that put on 40+ men operations that take hours and have an insane amount of detail and coordination. Just watch any of the shaktac community's videos and all the different perspectives you can see of a single operation. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and however I myself have never gotten this close to what seems to be the true arma experience I have gotten a more toned down taste of it with several friends doing small missions that just give you this sense of scale and enjoyment you wont find in other games. Outside of its military simulation and the mods that further improve on that aspect you've got mods that have become something like garrys mod in there selection. To name a few; Takistan life, Wasteland, DayZ, Escape Chernarus, a hunger games type and many many more. Your options of play are endless and the mods are just as well done and provide just as much if not more than the base game. Hell Im sure a majority of people that have bought the game did so just to play DayZ. That itself spawned a stand alone game (That is and probably never will be on par with the mod). This game is the represent what it means to be a PC gamer. The experience and freedom you simply cannot get on console. But seriously there are so many key bindings and actions some arent even binded by default and you have to manually go in and find what else you need or want to bind. I've tried rebinding keys to make it more functional for me but I always end up missing a key or running out of keys in a comfortable area. The worst part is I cant tell if this is black mark on the game for being complicated or praise for its complexity and amount of input.... its just brilliant.			",391,50,7,47,10,2,32

												Absolutely one of the most captivating games I've ever played. What feels like 30 minutes will actually be 3 hours. There's so much to do, it's never the same game for me. DayZ, Wasteland, deathmatches, there's no end to this game. I have some of the most memorable moments of gaming in this game.  I have recommended to my friends, bought it 3 times over, even had a friend build a PC just to be able to play this game. If open world survival games are your thing, I would get this 100%. Thanks Bohemia, for creating friendships, stories, YouTube videos, moments I'll never forget, and thanks Rocket for the DayZ Mod although you did a pretty awful job with Standalone.

												60km long neck due to online glitches.3km snipers shot after 30 minutes of tracking and 5 minutes going through range cards, windage, ballistic.Require a bazillion set of mods to work properly. A mind boggling vast amount of weaponry and kit to have too.Might not gleam and shine like Battlefield or Call of Duty but will put all other to shame in terms of having a truly satisfying military simulator experience.You will learn to VOIP or TeamSpeak. You will learn that Tourette's disease are for the weak. You will be patience. You will laugh at the ragers. You will spend an hour to kit your team and 10 minutes to complete the objectives.111/10 would buy again if I go back in time.			",23,1,0,1,1,0,6

												Definitely one of the best simulator games this platform has to offer. Besides DayZ mod you can do so much more like Wasteland (base building and pvp gamemode), make custom missions, player made maps and playing around in the armory with your friends in an online server. Pretty good singleplayer, although I think the multiplayer with all it's gamemodes is where this game truly stands out. If you missed out on the hype and still want to play DayZ mod, I would highly recommend Overpoch by CCG. Either Taviana or Chernarus are both great maps for this mod. Taviana being the best in my opinion. + Gameplay and general feel+ More content than Arma 3 at the moment (e.g. weapons, vehicles, items)+ Operation Arrowhead DLC was free+ Custom maps made by modders (Taviana, Lingor, Namalsk, Sahrani, Panthera)+ DayZ Mod+ Comes with alot of default maps (like Takistan, Chernarus, Utes, Bystrica)+ Alot of different gamemodes+ Great fanbase and community- Graphics (depending on what settings you play on, but on overall high settings it becomes laggy in multiplayer)- Uses more CPU power rather than GPU- Clunky inventory system compared to ARMA 3- Vehicles drive like a cereal box- No weapon customizationThis game is in my opinion better than ARMA 3. Mainly being because of the timeset. I like the weapons better (M4's, AK's, DMR's) and there's alot more vehicles to choose from. ARMA 3 is a bit too futuristic for my taste, and the weapons in that game do not make any sense. Overall 10/10 and highly recommendable.			",95,6,4,9,17,0,9

												Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is an excellent expansion. It provides an abundance of new content and a beautiful new Central Asian setting, and a respectable number of new factions and armaments.  Arma II's single-player campaign achieves almost everything that an expansion should be.The thing to remember with the ARMA series is that it is more of a combat simulator rather than a simple shooter. To survive and proceed, the player has to learn tactics. Run and gun tactics of many games out there just will not work here. Tactics are the key to success in the mission objectives.This series still holds the crown as the best military simulators around.			",370,106,12,36,35,6,44

												I ran up some stairs once and broke my legs and bled to death. My friend got his neck snapped by a tree because he went prone the wrong way near it. I drove a bike over a small bridge and it flipped over and crushed my spine. I drove a missle truck over a slightly larger bridge and it bounced up and down until it landed nose-first into a ditch and exploded the second I exit out of the rear left tire. I vaulted over some barbed wire and it teleported me under the map and I fell to my death. I combat carried my friend out of fire and he disappeared into the a black void where no light or cry for help escapes. I vaulted over a dam and got stuck under water. I rode a bicycle slowly over a bridge and made it safely to the other side where the rear wheel got stuck in the bridge and I got launched into the stratosphere when I got off. My friend landed a chinook on top of me and I survived until I climbed a ladder that teleported me to the ground instantly. I ejected out of a helicopter and survived the 230 meter drop because I landed on a 80° angle. I shot a bicycle with a tank and it didn't get damaged. I rode said tank over the bike and it flipped over while the bicycle remained standing. I unpacked a machine gun into the side of a building and could shoot out of it while no one could directly shoot at me. I got called an autist for not saying ""Copy"" and ""Over"" when talking in Independent faction chat. A hacker teleported everyone in vehicles into a hangar and they all exploded and the server crashed. I rode my UAZ off a ramp and the back wheels got stuck on it until they slipped off and the car exploded. I ran my armored car through a tree and took 0 damage to any parts and didn't get slowed at all, I then drove through a bush and took massive hull damage and the front tires were destroyed and was stopped instantly. I landed a helicopter near a bush once and it destroyed my rear rotor. I drove a tank at full speed over a small rock formation and it worked like a normal ramp, while an actual ramp damaged my turret and hull and brought me to a full stop. I planted a mine near a bridge and it didn't detonate when a tank drove over it, but when a civilian on a bicylce rode past it, it triggered. I wanted to be a cop in a roleplay server to abuse my power and they demanded I get on their teamspeak and do a job interview. I shot down an admin's jet on a wasteland server because he was carpet bombing every event area, he called me a hacker and banned me.			",144,14,0,15,13,2,22

												I´ve spend 1.5k hours of my life on this game. Thats one of the best ways i can explain this game. ArmA 2 in only one word: Fun! Every time i think about ArmA 2, i remember the old DayZ days with my friends, and oh boy, i can tell you guys, DayZ Mod was the best time ive spend on steam. But i dont wanna talk about my memories, i wanna give you guys a serious review, so lets get started:Weapons: There is a big variety of weapons, and a lot of different options for every weapon, for example theres your ""vanilla"" m4, and then theres options with holo sights, grenade launchers, silencers and so on. Its not like in ArmA 3 where you can put the attachments on by yourself, but its still well made. Also, every weapon feels, sounds and looks different. The Weapons dont feel as realistic as ArmA 3 weapons do, but you still have to compensate for bullet drop, and the velocity of the bullet. Maps: There are many maps in ArmA 2, and they are all unique and well made. Theres definetly a lot to explore, and have fun on playing!Gamemodes: Well, this is kind of sad, but theres not really any other servers than DayZ nowadays. But lets be honest, i think the main reason people buy ArmA 2 is DayZ, just because its unbeatable by the SA.Movement: Well, the movement in ArmA 2 is not as complex as it is in ArmA 3. Of course you can lean, crounch, prone, walk and run. The movement system feels smooth, and is reliable.Overall: This game guys, let me tell ya, its one masterpiece of a game! Buy it, seriously, buy it! Its worth every penny, and for 15 euros its in my opinion the best game you can buy at this price point. And if you just want to test it out, and you dont think its worth 15 euros, then buy it on sale, you can get this game for 2 euros. Once you get into the game, you cannot stop playing it, trust me guys!			",34,6,0,4,1,0,1

												Introduction:ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead is the standalone DLC (Downloadable Content) Pack for ArmA 2, A Military Simulator by Czech developer Bohemia Interactive. ArmA 2: OA is the only standalone DLC pack for ArmA 2. Multiple other DLC packs play part in Takistan, Including the BAF (British Armed Forces) DLC and PMC (Private Military Contractors) DLC.The Map(s):ArmA 2: OA is set in the fictional Middle-Eastern country of Takistan. Takistan has many towns, villages and cities to explore, with two airfields on either end of the map. The map of Zargabad, A Small desert city in the middle of nowhere, quite small compared to Chernarus or Takistan, but the city is hugh compared to Takistan's largest, Rasman. Zargabad also comes with an airfield and a few buildings here and there. the PMC and BAF DLCs use this map as well.The Gameplay:ArmA 2, as a military simulator has many aspects involved in succeeding. To me, and many others, the most important is Teamwork. You have to work as a team to get things done in this game, and I love that consept. It is very slow paced, very tactical, and aimed at people that don't like to get things done rambo-style. Movement is extremely fiddly with the inability to walk through clearly enterable spaces and breaking your legs on the oddest of places. The game is fairly old, however, coming in at a 2010 release, a year after the original ArmA 2.Graphics/Voice Acting:Graphics and Voice Acting are quite shameful, but the game is old and developed by a Czech developer making an english game, and the quality is tolerable.The Multiplayer:The ArmA Multiplayer is quite easily where the most fun is to be had. With excessive mods and gamemodes developed plus the original gamemodes implemented to play with your friends, i've spent 99% of my OA Experience on the Multiplayer. My most enjoyable moments on the multiplayer moments were on Takistan Life: Revolution servers. TLR, as it is abbreviated to, is a Roleplay Mission File for OA.My Issue(s):My only Issue with OA is the fact that when update 1.63 was released, it wiped out an extremely large fraction of all multiplayer servers. I took this as a sign of BI telling us to go to ArmA 3, which is quite rude. Luckily, servers are popping back up here and there, which is a very good sign.Summary:Overall, All ArmA games are amazing in my opinion, but ArmA 2: OA gets the cake. Congratulations to Bohemia Interactive for making such an enjoyable, but serious game and I hope this review was found helpful.Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10 / 4.5 out of 5.  ",57,0,0,2,10,0,6

												One of the best military simulators out there! if you are interested in realism to a degree, then this is the game for you! The game has good dlc but there are some bugs you will encounter, they arent to annoying but sometimes can give you a good laugh. Check it out if yo uwant to fly some jets , helis or just dfrive some cars and tanks. Really fun game and it also has a lot of mods that makes a lot more of gameplay to the game so you can keep enjoying the game in new ways.

												It was a drizzly day in the Chenarus. As usual, I was sitting in the woods, listening to the majestic sounds of nature, the birds chirping, the wind murmuring through the trees, as I waited to see other people. All of a sudden, ""POWPOWPOWPOW"". Instinctively I dropped down, and heard the sounds of bullets rushing past me, which sounded completely different than how Hollywood makes it sound. I judged the direction of where I was taking fire from. 40 ... 43 ... 45 ... 3 o clock! I saw a dark clad man jogging forwards holding a Russian PKM, which he probably found in a helicopter wreck. As I raised my gun, my M16A2 ACOG, I adjusted the scope to compensate for the bullet drop, and leaded my target.""POP! POP!"" I heard the scream of the man, and decided to slowly inch forwards. He wasn't done yet. 20 meters away, he suddenly opened fire. ""RATATATATA!"" He was injured. Instead of his shots hitting me, they went right into the ground, because he was forced to prone after his legs were broken. With one shot, I silenced him. Then, I took some food and ammo from his body, and went out to seek more targets.10/10			",92,8,4,3,13,0,19

Writing about how realistic is it would take a lot of time - just believe my words and if you are fan of modern, realistic warfare games you should get it immediately.

												If you like sandbox military simualtors you should def buy this game!1. You can setup and edit your own missions or whole campaigns with as much or as little detail as you want. It can be a lot of fun to make missions for friends and swap missions. I really enjoy building in depth detailed missions.2. I would not buy this game for the campain. This is not like a modern day skyrim. The AI can be very stupid. I call them situationally dumb troopers. The villagers do not do anything but stand there and die. There is no situational awareness for any NPCS. The villagers do not have a dialy/nighty life cycle. They stand 24.7 and do nothing interesting.It takes a long time to communicate critical details to your squad: such as GET DOWN your under fire. They often just stand there while you wail at your squads reaction to enemy fire.3. The mission editior is what makes this game worth it.YOU CAN build an awsome campaign/map/maps. 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Listen to me now. This game is unbelievably awesome. Most of these reviews - if you take care to read them, are from when the game first came out. It has come a long way - and so has the hardware to support it. Buy the game - even better if you buy combined ops - or buy ArmA II and Operation Arrowhead and combine them. It's not that expensive. Join a clan - a good one - one without ridiculous requirements to maintain membership. Play with the crew. Get to know them. And run some of the most immersive, realistic, expansive, open-ended, tactical, fun, glorious missions you have ever seen. ArmA vets laugh about CoD. We mock CoD. Because CoD doesn't have anything on ArmA. Seriously. Buy it and play it. Learn it. It's tough - we know. But good things come to those who wait - and put in the effort - to learn a real game. And if you can't figure it out - after just a few hours of applied effort - a look or two through the controls menu - and maybe even asking a question or two on multiplayer - then go away - we don't want you here anyway. Go back to your CoD where enemies throw themselves into your bullets and you are virtually invincible. We will be busy fighting serious **** enemies - human or AI - and trying not to get shot even once - because this game does not f*ck around.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												it ruined my life10/10More than 1k hours on this accoun, and at least 500 more combined on the beta version, off-steam and on my other account, it's one of the best games ever made.The core game is great, still competing with big titles after all these years of its release, but the mods made it even better. Be it ACE and realistic mods, be it DayZ and its variants, or basic Life/RPG mods, this game offers everything you'd want.Arma3/DayZSA Comparison:--------------------------------------------When compared to Arma3, it's barely worse. Both games are great, and got their own special feel. Arma3 is newest. so it'll keep having fresh content and an active community, and that's its main advantage over Arma2.-Buy this instead of DayZ Standalone, it is, and will forever be, better than that piece of crap. Other than SA being horrible, overpriced, and a complete lie, Arma2 has more to offer. It actually is playable, it actually has content and you can do endless things, not just glitch around and starve to death while eating.Plus, Arma 2 is almost always really cheap on steam, like $5 for the core game, the expansion and all DLCs			",83,6,0,11,5,1,10

The gunplay is the most realistic ive ever seen the graphics are great, driving is mostly solid, and the map is huge and ive only been to a section of it. The wasteland mode is the best part of the game, where you scavenge for food, water, weapons. and you can build your base pretty much anywhere and its a great game to play with friends. there is a huge lineup of modes of transport.

												Despite not playing very often anymore, this game still has a thriving community (mostly in DayZ Mod servers) and is still very fun all around. It was the sole reason behind me making a Steam account, back when the original version of DayZ was gaining popularity. To this day, I still go back on to play with friends that I've met on DayZ or through Arma, or at the very least play recklessly on a Wasteland server, which requires no mods. Yes, the game can be very buggy, the community toxic more often than not, and ping issues may plague you, but this game has been the source for untold hours of fun, frustration, rewards, tense situations, and insane gameplay for so many people. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to access and explore a game with so many dynamic features and meet some awesome people; there is a well-grounded reason why this game has 14x more positive reviews than it does negative reviews.

												Game for everyone who enjoys team based gameplay, tactical approach with mixture of simulation and realism. Great way to spend hours in cooperative singleplayer or multiplayer or PvP game modes. Close-to limitless mod-able abilites of game and easy to use mission editor allows nearly infinite ways to replay the game value. Yet to decide You  must taste the greatness of it's gameplay Yourself.			",609,254,34,97,100,9,180

												I LOVE this game. It's a tactical shooter/military simulator that has singleplayer, coop, and PvP. There are hundreds of vehicles, weapons, and player models for you to use, so each time you play, you try something new. However the game also has some parts that bring it down. I will list all the good/bad points.The good:Emphasis on realismEmphasis on multiplayerWide array of equipment, all usable in-gameSmall but active, mature and helpful communityGood graphicsGood atmosphereEasy to learn, difficult to masterLarge map, open world. Able to travel over entire countryGood inventory systemFun custom missionsReplayabilityThe bad:Bad voice acting. Every time you order people around, it feels like all the words are spliced. For example: ""team RED. go to that TANK""Clumsy infantry movement. While sprinting around for kilometers in open areas feels fine, moving around in buildings is slow, clumsy, and innefecient. You will notice that you either move too fast or slow for CQB, and that your gun won't fit through doors unless you're holding it down.Large amount of HDD space taken up. This game can take up around 15 gigs on your hard drive.No low-spec computer support. While you can turn graphics options down, you will find it hard to target enemies over 1 kilomenter away when everyone's texture is just a blur and there's a great big wall of fog right where they are.The engine. There are no ragdoll physics at all, object collision doesn't always work, shadows take up much processing powerAll in all, if you can get past the poor engine, you will find this game extremely addictive and fun. 8/10			",72,9,0,9,5,0,6

												The Arma series has always held interest for me. It is one of the few shooters that has a learning curve. Playing smart, knowing your limits, and understanding tactics will give you the edge every time. I enjoy the large maps and the ability to play terrain. Its not a bunch of hallways and passages covered by an army of snipers. Vehicles and emplacements are powerful modifications and enhance the style of play. Everyone has a job to do and the team suffers if someone comes short. The DayZ mod is also enjoyable and employs some of the same tactics and skill with the ""zombie"" aspect. This is a great game and offers varied forms of play and there are a TON of mods available. It is worth getting Operation Arrowhead even if it is outdated. All of the Arma Games are a great option.

												I LOVE arma 2: OA and personally i think it is worth getting arma 2 with OA over arma 3 as arma 3 will become a good gaem within 3 years and arma 2 atm is exeptionally good. There are many vehicles and weapons to pick from. At first, yes i did find this game boring but the best thing to do it find yourself a unit like i did. This makes the game fun as you will do co op quite often and operations. Also this game has many good mods to it which makes this game from fun, to i have no life now, arma is my life.10/10			",165,15,4,9,23,3,9

Posted: July 12, 2014
												'Do you recommend this game,' Steam asks me. I do, emphatically. I hope this anecdote from an in-game multiplayer experience I had will explain why. Prepare yourself for ARMA2: The Review: The Movie.Spring, 2011; early in my ARMA career, first tour of duty after a Steam Sale. I'm a fairly fresh recruit, seasoned with a couple dozen game-hours spent trudging through an expansive and swampy learning curve. Spent today at work, drove home, made dinner, cleaned up; it's Game-O'clock. Steam. ARMA2. Launch. Menu surfing, looking for multiplayer. Server browser hits my face with lists of information. -AWP-Warfare Capture the Island mode looks appealing tonight. Played it a couple times before, and I feel comfortable with the basics by now. Server connection established.Click! I'm in, filling the boots of a digital NATO badass. Apparently, international treaty organisations occasionally require the service of men with guns. Disturbing thought, but I'm no politician. I'm just a nobody with a rifle, taking orders that filter down the food chain. Those orders fill my mind now. Objective: town. Location: nearby...as the crow flies. Heh, the team's commander does have airborne technology unlocked, I just don't have the cash to buy a lift yet. Looks like I'm taking the scenic route. A quick check of my map tells me I'm at one of our hidden frontier bases and that there's two whole mountains between me and the nearby town. Great... I'll be taking the scenic route to the scenic route. The map tells me more: several of my team members and their A.I. controlled task forces are currently approaching the town. I'm already late for the party :(Might as well bring the fireworks.The base I'm at has only an armour factory and infantry barracks, but both will well suit my rapidly forming battle plan. I'm thinking heavy calibre fire support from high ground, overlooking the town. The topographic information in the map shows that the road I'll be taking is nestled around a minor hill as it approaches the town. Perfect. I'll park two BMPs there and they'll provide overwatch of the whole area while my comrades finish their capture of the town. An LAV will ferry me and one squad of A.I. infantry to the combat zone. I spend the required funds and set the plan in action.Wait a tick, BeatYourHeadIn, are you telling me you actually have to plan how you’re going to get your troops and equipment from point A to point B in ARMA2? Logistics in a game!? Yes, actual logistics...in a game with a map so FRIGGIN’ big you need to employ logistical planning skills to see any sort of success. And it's not boring!Back to the story. Formation of a military convoy. A few orders issued to my A.I. controlled task force later and the BMPs are on point while I lounge in the command chair of the LAV at the rear of the column. I man the turret-mounted automatic grenade launcher, a devastating weapon. Its barrel is ominously pointed at and tracking a lollygagging friendly player as my convoy departs base. Yeah, that's right chump, make one wrong move and I'll end you! Though itching to test the power of my new toy, I decide it's not worth getting banned over.  I let my teammate live, for now.The A.I. drivers of my convoy are as dim as a new moon, but I can fine tune my plans and keep up with current events while they drive. It's an 10 to 15 minute (realtime) drive that negotiates a winding mountain pass through an elegant evergreen forest. These are backroads, unpaved; enemy forces unlikely to be using this route. I feel secure enough that I spend most of the trip looking at the map, reading topography, lanes of fire, positions of friendlies. I smile when I realize I could probably minimize ARMA2 and play a few rounds of Counterstrike while my convoy travels.Dying immediately is certainly the last thing I'm worried about as I crest the peak of the second mountain.Suddenly: EXPLOSION..DEAFENING SOUND..FROM BEHIND..MASSIVE DETONATION..JESUS H. CHRIST WHERE IS THAT VOLUME KNOB! What is going on here!?My turret pans to the rear of the LAV. The sight, what a sight...I'll never forget. Fire. Wall. 60? 70 feet tall? A wall. Of fire. Taller than the trees in the forest, literally FILLS my view from left to right. There is nothing in view except the fire. I'm in awe. Confused. Shaken. I've seen 'splosions in this game before, BUT NEVER LIKE THAT! Did somebody tried to nuke me FFS!? I know there's no nukes in this game mode, so...Over the cacophany of destruction: the scream of jet engines. Very close. As the flames die down, a large shape traverses the air over the crest of the crag. Airframe, Sukhoi configuration. Enemy. Wing tilted down slightly; canopy visible. I know he's surveying the carnage below him. Hunting me. Cursing his aim when he sees the LAV still intact. I feel small, molecule small; what I just witnessed was caused by his war machine. Napalm bombs. Heavy ordinance. Whatever it was, it dealt complete destruction to that forest.Understand this, readers: in this game, air superiority is a literal phrase. Air is SUPERIOR in this game. This isn't your Battlefield ""oh look I can shoot a few rockets from my jet fighter and maybe kill one or two goofs on the ground and then reload (because reloading rockets on a flying jet makes a lot of sense) and kill a couple more goofs"" experience. No! In ARMA your aircraft can have a payload of more than a hundred devastating rockets and you can fire 'em full auto like a machine gun and destroy an entire town worth of goofs on the ground if you wanted to. Ha! Forget about balance! This is the real life Shiznit. Modern air forces don't invest heavily in war planes because they're ""balanced"". They invest in them because they can kill a hell of a lot of people quickly! ARMA2 knows this. Simply put, the developers have a big Bohemian boner for air power.But BeatYourHeadIn, what happened next? Tell us! Okay, I'll tell you. A miracle happened. My convoy survives the 'splosion to end all 'splosions. My battle plans go up in smoke like the forest around me. My current objective is to live through the next 30 seconds. The LAV is the only reason I'm still alive. It is damaged, but drivable. I order my drivers to haul♥♥♥♥♥in a forwardly direction. I track the Sukhoi as the convoy labours onward. The receding bogey performs a wide highspeed U-turn. He's heading straight for me again. Relentless much? He's the UPS guy we all wished was real: the one who comes back after he missed you the first time, instead of leaving a note telling you to pick up your package at the office near the airport!Then, from beyond the first mountain I had passed: a smoke trail racing skywards. Anti-aircraft missile! Ha! RETURN TO SENDER, A-HOLE! Two vectors intersect in a puff of smoke and light. Direct hit! Booyah! Wait, uh... he's still flying at me. HEY! HE'S STILL FLYING AT ME!With black smoke billowing out of his engines, this topgun is still determined to deliver my severance package. Frantically, I order the BMPs to target the limping jet. Cannon rounds arc through the sky in attempt to smite the airborne menace. Sukhoi Dude is getting closer, but he's losing altitude. Fast. He's now descending below my level on the mountain, looking up at me through the trees as he approaches. None of the BMP fire connects, but it doesn't matter. THIS GOOSE IS COOKED BOYS! Relief. Now, his desperation salvo of rocket fire is way off-target; falls harmlessly some distance away. I watch him frantically yaw right and nose up as his fighter loses the last of its life-sustaining lift and plummets in a sideways cartwheel into the trees. The inferno he leaves behind is a feast for the eyes. There was nothing left but a dark crater.Now, I can start thinking about that town again...What, are you apes gonna dig him a grave!? We got our own mission to die for! Forward march!All that's left to say is: play this game!			",116,23,0,18,15,0,34

												I know what you are probably here for, DayZ or Island Life. Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead is a game for very serious, and mature gamers. This has gruesomley hard game types. It is very fun, with things such as DayZ and Island Life. Those are the ones that I have played, but I\'m sure there are plenty others. You must have a higher end PC to play this game. I reccomend this game to anyone who has a decent PC, and is ready to spend hours on end gathering things, just to lose them. I rate it 9/10.			",94,7,1,8,4,0,1

												What can I say? It's the one and the only ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead, probably one of the most well known games amongst the PC gaming community. This game has everything for everyone. You want to stroll around in a zombie infested wasteland full of players trying to kill you instead of zombies? It's got that! You want to fly in a special ops raid on an insurgent filled town at night with the glow of green illuminating your room while tracers fly on the screen? It's got that! You want to play as an abusive cop and beat down the local civilian population for driving in the middle of the road? It has that too. Yes ArmA II:Operation Arrowhead has just about everything you could ask for, but it does have stuff you didn't ask for. Like AI's that are either blind of Vasili Zaitsev, Zombies that come through walls to get you, and other weird glitches that although are not game breaking, are annoying at the best of times. Whatever your fortay me be in video games, I am sure that Operation Arrowhead can fullfil many of your hopes and expectations from a now old, military simulator that is at the top of its respected genre of games. Whether you want to be a pilot, infantry soldier, tank operator, marksmen, civilian, rebel, or police officer this game can give you what you want. It is for these reasons and more that you will discover, that I recommend this game even so long after its initial release.			",96,6,3,9,25,0,25

My GTX 230 could run it on the lowest graphics for around 20fps, but frankly the game look horrid. Upon upgrading to two GTX 660 TI's and an octocore, Ultra graphics make the game look so damn beautiful.

See what makes this a great game is the community, now im not gonna say that everyone is super nice aand mature but the majority of them are. This is a fun♥♥♥♥♥game with a variety of gamemodes my personnal favorites are takistan life and domination but it isnt for everyone. If you like fast paced gameplay this isnt for you but if you like to have to get tactical or you like to roleplay or you like to snipe people from the top of a hill and afterwards have a huge feeling of triumph than this is the perfect game for you definately worth the money			",63,4,0,1,2,1,1

												Getting older day by day, you may think Arma 2 is a game of the past. That is not the case, as it is still massively popular mainly thanks to the gargantuan number of mods that have benn made for it. If you purchase Arma 2, you are buying over 25 games in one. It's really hard to become bored, as there is always something new to play! However, due to it's age, the physics and graphics may be a tad annoying at times, but i seriously recommend it to anyone who loves a good simulator, and who also loves shooters!

												Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is a versatile game that has not only great developers, but also a fantastic community. For the most part, it's a (sorta) laggy, buggy game. But it's a laggy-buggy game that I love. Arma II rose to fame with the DayZ mod. DayZ is still thriving and in support today and makes an excellent addition.Pretty much just ignore this because I'm doing it for a badge. But really, Arma's great. Wasteland's fun.

												After years of playing Arma ever since Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis back in 2001, this game is great, It has quite alot of content and replayability value, but however after the release of Arma 3 Apex, this game seeems more and more like a distant past but a very good forefather to Arma 3. Alright lets get down to it. The game is very fun to play its another of Bohemia Interactive's Military Simulation, Open World, Free-Roam, Singleplayer, Coop, Multiplayer and you name it of what tags it can go under, It can go under just about any tags, depending on what mods you use really, The game is extremely moddable, thousands upon thousands of mods to this game, But there are things that displeased me alot about this game, Mainly the day and night cycle, Daytime is fine no problem, but the night time is horrible, you literlly cant see♥♥♥♥♥♥1 meter infront of you or in other words 3 feet. That was quite frustrating especially with DayZ, where you had no Night Vision Goggles. (HIV Confirmed). However thats not the worst, The Optimization in this game... can be a bit weird with certain computers, On mine it ran OK. But if i were to turn it up you got massive framerate loss compared to Arma 3, of course Arma 3 uses a updated Engine and so on. But this game really is a stinker when it comes to Optimization. Even though the Graphics are great for It's time. For People With Low End to Mid End Gaming Rigs: And you as you read this  wonder if this is worth your money since you have a low to mid-end gaming rig, well my suggestion is No. That is, because its really ironic, Arma 3 runs far better on lower end rigs than this game would ever do. You would get more Framerate in Arma 3 and of course would have a better experience with Completely new reworked physics, graphics and other game mechanics that runs very well on low end PC's compared to this game. But again. But On what I truly appreciate about this game. Takistan Life. HAHAHA, gotta be one of the most fun version of Life I've ever played, honestly. Despite the flaws in this game you can look past it, but Im on looking forwards, I probably wont return to Arma 2 ever again, but I will always have fond memories with friends in this game on all the stupid fun♥♥♥♥♥♥we did. And most of all the diverse setting of missions and quite a huge Coop Campaign, I think there were like 4 Campaigns and all of them are Coop Playable. What I would rate this game 9/10 a strong one too :)			",147,20,0,19,41,0,30

												ArmA II (Armed Assault 2) is one of the best war simulation  games i've ever played (together with ArmA 3 and  Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising).  The realism is   amazing *second only to ArmA 3), the massive open world nature of the game  and the different modes of play that are available, plus the   extra non essential  DLC that you can purchaseall add  depth to this superb game.  It's not  a Call of Duty, in yer face shooter, with  a linear   SP campaign, but a versatile, open   game with a mission editor  and loads of  free  custom made content that'll see you playing this game  for years to come. (I've played more than double the hours  that are quoted on my profile as I originally owned the  disc version of the game before I purchased it via Steam)  The environments you can explore in  ArmA II and expansions  are massive, covering  hundreds of square miles of  forest, country side, towns, villages and desert regions.  There's  masses of  weapon types, loads of vehicles and   airborne  planes and choppers that you can  play with and the online community  is  massive.  The game    is also   set up to use the track IR (a tracking device that allows you to look around  the games environment and frees up your hands  as you can lean around corners just by tilting your head instad of using  the Q & E keys, or you can look behind you , lean forwards and you zoom in on your enemy.  The hardware is expensive, but it gives an unparralelled   immersivness to the game.For me, ArmA II is  by far one of the best military simlation I've ever played (the only exception so far being ArmA 3).  If you like to  play a stealth game this is definitely the game for you; no run and gun, but a real military simultion.			",4946,1933,224,565,877,79,758

												What to say? 1200+ hours of fun spent in my legal copy of  this game, another few hundred hours in the editor and I still dont have enough. Vanila Gameplay is Really good single and multiplayer both, (multiplayer is significantly more fun) but once you install mods like ACE, TFAR (or ACRE) Blastcore, and JSRS you enter an completely new and mindblowingly awesome dimension of realistic gameplay. Yes the game is also buggy like hell, but the bugs are not gamebreaking and sometimes they are hilarious. And once you get familiar with the most common bugs they will stop bothering you, and you will be actually able to avoid them most of the time. ",25,5,0,1,7,0,8

												Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead is simply the best military simulator around. Graphics are still good, performance with current gen hardware is good.This game for me has zero cons, not even the bugs. For if you play this game for a long time, you'll get used to the bugs and you'll know how to play around them.Do you think this game isn't worth it anymore because of Arma 3? Well, I like Arma 2 more than 3. It feels way more natural, performance is better and weapons feel more realistic.If you are looking for realistic tactical shooter, no reason not to buy.If you are looking for fast paced fps, don't buy, for it's not fast paced and way more unforgiving than other shooters.

 Arma 2: Combined Operations REVIEW  Just so people don't get confused Combined Operations is Arma 2 + Arma 2 OA. Arma 2: CO is a fun military shooter while being realistic but not too realistic if you get what I mean.I can't say much about the campaigns as I have only gotten past the first mission on both Arma 2 and OA so I'll skip that section.The multiplayer is massive and can go upto nearly 100 players! (I've actually seen a server with a 200 player cap!) there is also a wide range of missions both default and user-made. However not all user-made missions are perfect and can have weird framerate drops, missing scripts and glitches. These missions range from generic deathmatches to total domination of the entire map with up to three factions brawling it out which is very fun if people ya know... Work TOGETHER. Which leads me to the community side of things.The community is rich with mods that add stuff like: armies from around the globe, weapons ranging from sci-fi sniper rifles to classic bolt-action rifles, maps of real world locations or comepletely made-up islands! There is so much modifications yyou just have to see it for yourself! The community is  most of the time  friendly and have loads of groups that play together with teamwork. Now here come the more dissapointing parts of the community. See you won't get much teamwork or friendlyness outside of these groups or clans. You WILL come across people who love to ruin the experience with people ranging from lowlife teamkillers (Sometimes its on accident) to hackers. You also get racists, random banners (Doesn't mean Battleye ban) etc. There is just a bad chunk of rot in the game so beware.You may also find it hard to actually PLAY ARMA 2! My goodness what ever you do if you want to PLAY ARMA 2 please for everything that is Arma USE THE FILTERS. The serverlist by default is spammed to absolute hell with DayZ. Which I consider a TOTALLY different community (They don't ""play"" Arma 2 they play DayZ).Now you may be thinking by most of the screenshots in the Community Hub  ""These graphics are terrible""  Well...1. The graphics most people set its LOW, LOW, LOW, OFF, OFF, OFF and LOW with a hint of 800x600. These people are A. People who struggle with the game's unoptimized performance or B. Have♥♥♥♥♥♥PCs that cost $400.2. The graphics are quite nice maxed out (Not that I can max them out ;_;) and if these are below your standards may I suggest you give it a shot.Now the fun part! Gameplay is... Fun? Is that the right word? I don't care I think it is fun to play, bit clunky at some parts but it is generally all good. The main focus is infantry combat which is nicely in-depth with range finding, sneaking about, misc buttons, etc. The game has A.I. companions that tell you to do♥♥♥♥♥♥but where it's really at is commanding them... Which is a interesting experience. The A.I. ISN'T the best I will tell you that right now! They can go through walls (Only really happens with LOTS of A.I.) They can't drive properly even if their life depended on it but there are mods that make the A.I. better. You also have the ability to use heaps of cars, trucks, bikes, planes, jets, APCs, jeeps, tanks and helicopters all with a little difference or a massive difference in speed, mobility and armour.Now before I wrap this up this game is VERY far from flawless and you will experience bugs and glitches that will only ever happen in Arma 2 depending on what is happening these can be downright annoying or pure hilariousness! These are the following examples of what we call being ""Arma'd""1. Death By PhysicsYou may be wondering  Wait other games can kill you by phsyics!  While you may be right but Arma 2's ""physics"" engine provides the most hilarious and interesting experience I've ever had in gaming.I've been killed by running into a non moving vehicle 3 times, I've had my legs broken or have been killed by rocks or similar objects more times then I can remember, I've been flung by vehicles further then the longest sniper shot and I've had my own vehicle flung into the air so high that it puts NASA to shame.

												Countless hours of my life was spent playing this game. I picked up combined operations (A2 + OA) for $6.24 when Bohemia retired A2, and it was the best decision of my life. I regret not picking up the DLC to play other DayZ servers, but I enjoyed the other various servers, like Domination or Wasteland. Operation Arrowhead introduced me into FPS and it is an experience I would love to live again.			",21,0,0,1,3,0,0

												A marvellous, diverse, realistic and truly amazing game. So, why not recommend? One word: Battleye. Quite possibly the worst anti-cheat system I've ever seen in all my years of gaming and now that Steam has integrated with the servers, you may not even purchase new CD-keys for the same account. Thats right. Legally and legitimately bought CD-keys for this game have no use if you've already bought the game on Steam. Battleye has proven to be a stable as a house of cards, kicking people and denying them online play for nonsense such as ' Battleye failed to intialize ' and other such technical problems that plague the system which unfortunately was never perfected. It's a shame, because the game has a LOT to offer in terms of online and i'd personally jump to ARMA III if my computer could handle it but alas, I'm stuck in the single-player limbo of this game and confined the hacker friendly online servers. In short: Good game,♥♥♥♥♥♥devs ruining it with an unstable ' Anti-cheat ' nightmare system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good tactical military shooter not your standard run & gun fps. It requires a bit more patience than most shooter games and more time to master some of the weapon ballistics and vehicle handling like flying choppers and planes. The campaign is not to bad, it's more fun playing either multiplayer or coop missions, two of the more popular online types Dayz & Wasteland are what are generally played online, I personally prefer wasteland which is more combat orientated than Dayz. The game has been out for a good while now but with mod support and a powerful in game editor this game has been quite fun, if you haven't picked it up yet it's worth a try on the steam sales! 8/10			",118,15,3,12,15,1,18

 Get ready for a badass shooter! This will be semi quick, I've only been able to play about 30 - 45 minutes at a time before my latptop overheats (Will write an entirely new review later on, this is just to give a honest heads up on what to expect) so I don't know much about the scenarios quite yet or if they're worth playing but I can tell you that the bootcamp alone has me interested in playing as much as I can, I also learned this is NOT a fast paced shooter for the most part and is infact very strategic, I wouldn't know too much on how to handle the more commender-esque moments as I often played the ""freeplay mode"" and made a base asap for that UAV drone just to see what it's like up in the sky raining hellfire and let me tell you, the graphics for an older and non-AAA game shouldn't even compare to this game's as the locations are very well detailed and worth taking note of at times, I can't say I'm a fan of the land vehicle gameplay (HMV's and Tanks) but that's never been my cup of tea but I do like sitting back at 1000M and picking off pesky threats with a M24 while they spray violently and missing every shot along the way or taking out a small convoy with a unmanned drone, anyhow besides that not much is notable about the game as far as I can tell, the variety's fair regarding weapons/vehicles/etc (However without the original ArmA II you wont be able to use most of the normal gear or so on without paying a few extra bucks) and a fair amount of mods are out for this game that extends the realsm of this game by a ton.Imo this game is worthy of a Good rating on it's own, but as I mentioned earlier some of the variety of this game comes from the original ArmA II so if you plan to get this game then try to buy Combined operations.Combined operations (Original and Op:AH) 9.3/10Operation Arrowhead 8.5/10			",111,15,0,12,6,2,12

												This is a good tactical military shooter not your standard run & gun fps. It requires a bit more patience than most shooter games and more time to master some of the weapon ballistics and vehicle handling like flying choppers and planes. The campaign is not to bad, it's more fun playing either multiplayer or coop missions, two of the more popular online types Dayz & Wasteland are what are generally played online, I personally prefer wasteland which is more combat orientated than Dayz. The game has been out for a good while now but with mod support and a powerful in game editor this game has been quite fun, if you haven't picked it up yet it's worth a try on the steam sales! 8/10			",118,15,3,12,15,1,18

												This game... buy this and Arma 2 and you have guaranteeed 1,000 hours of fun. There is so many stuff to do there once you get the hang of the game (Which is pretty hard).- DayZ mod which I've spent a lot of my time on and also many cool 'Submods' for dayZ such as Epoch, Overpoch.-The campaign.-Wasteland -Arma 2 life mod. RP-Editor to mess around or create actuall mission of your own with it.The game tends to have many glitches and bugs in some of the mods, but still is an amazing game.Arma 2 doesn't perform very well on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cpu's because it renders everything at the same time, it also doesn't have a very good optimization. You will need at least a i3 or fx 4300-6300 to play MOST of the MODS at a smooth framerate.  GPU won't matter a lot. Once you got like a 560-650 it won't make any difference when Upgrading. The only thing that will improve perormance in game is a new cpu and some config tweaks.Other than that the game is really fun, you will just have to trust me on that and see for yourself.

												Bought this for the DayZ mod, and I wasn't disappointed...Very glitchy, poorly optimised, low frame rates in towns, random deaths, can sometimes glitch jump through walls, players using hacks, getting killed when you're a fresh spawn and have nothing, server donators/mods spawning with helis and AS50's, random leg breaks, random bugs which kick you out of flying helicopters, weapons disappearing when you switch them out from your backpack, zombies glitch hitting you through walls, getting stuck in vehicles, not being able to get in vehicles.All in all it's a fantastic game.But seriously, team-work based gameplay can be a-lot of fun, and the huge open world with no loading screens is great.Also don't listen to the minimum required specs, you could play this game on a machine built by Lord GabeN himself and it would still run like it's being played on a toaster.

												*Funny review*Tried a bit.''Serious''So,If you looking my review you obviusly know about ArmA serie or you are quite bit know about it.Lets begin with the gameplay.Gameplay isn't simple as you thinking every atmosphere will effect you''being shooted in leg,lung,near explosion etc etc''and these effect isnt effective out of battle.But when you in a firefight it will effect a lot.Like sprinting n running not works. Cus when you run your character tires and your aim is goes right left like real life.When you get suppressed your characters seeing is blurs.Etc.Lets talk about GEARS-WEPS-VEHICLESA bunch of weapon and A ♥♥♥♥ING BUNCH OF vehicle and gear in this game.Like real life you cant actually see at night without nv or flashlight.Silencer is more than minimap spotting especially at nights.Vehicles is an dimension.Like t34/t72/m1a1/m1a2 is only a little part about of it.Planes is specialized at helis.But not at jets(happens in all arma games nvm)Lets talk about modes.DM-TDM is normal modes.BUT there is 2 modes i really love and special for only arma.Cti a.k.a warfare.Whole real warfare.You can be commndr or soldier its fun and realistic af.Commander can build base,move hq,set waypoints,set missions etc.General approval/:Gameplay 8,7/10Graphics   7,9/10 Good for its time grapsAudio        6/10 Some weps got same soundsOverral     7,2/10Would die while doing HALO jumps in warfare.AND A NOTENever play alone or you will be bored.If you wanna play just add me.

												ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead has got to be one of the most amazing first person shooters I have ever been able to get my hands on. It is an amazing expansion to the already amazing AMRA II. It has an amazing blend of story and action with different yet very well thought out controls. For left and right handed people. The wide variety of vehicles and weapons works so well with the settings in which the game is based in. I absolutly love the multiplayer! The high number of servers with hundreds of thousands of people playing on them even to this day! This is also backed up by the ground breaking DayZ mod which has an amazing blend of the classic multiplayer's firefight action and a high number of zombies out to get your brains!Pros:- High number of players still active- High number of servers- Amazing graphics- Wide variety of things to do and weapons/vehicles to use- Great storyline- Amazing equipmentCons:- Complicated controls for helicopters and planes- A few glitches in the multiplayerOverall, ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead has gained itself a well earned 10/10!

												This is by far the best game I have ever played. I have put so many hours into this game, there is so much do do such as creating a battle over a city, or just huge battle in a big field. You can play this game for litterally hours on end without getting bored. There will always be something new to create or to download. So if I were you, and I didn't have this game I would quickely get it and download it.			",34,1,0,2,2,0,11

												ArmA 2:Operation Arrowhead is serious realism. IE:realistic ballistic calculations,tactical mechanics. Better FPS than ArmA 2. Expanded armory for infantry,and larger vehicle base. Even with the release of ArmA 3, this game still holds a great following, including myself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing the Arma Series for around two years; I can honestly say that it is my favourite series despite all the bugs and glitches. Arma has without a doubt one of the most active gaming communities that create endless amounts of content. Without these moders and script writers the franchise would have ended a long time ago. In steam alone I have 62 hrs played but out of steam using play with Six launcher and other launchers I probably have close to 1000 hrs played. Arma will disapoint at times when you get killed because you rolled into a tree but its worth it!. It can be slow but you can grow to love that, it's not for everyone but i highly recommend it even with the Release of Arma 3. It simply does not have the same feel or enough content to surpass the classic Arma 2.			",71,5,0,4,4,0,4

												Probably the best realistic shooter I have ever seen. Although the campaigns are not as good as in the original Operation Flashpoint, the gameplay was vastly improved, and the missions are quite good too, unlike like in any other ArmA (save for OFP). If you have never played this series, then you ought to download a demo and give it a try! Although the game is very unoptimized and controls are clunky, it is the best as war simulation ever went in video games. Good singleplayer (and mission editor), and great co-op multiplayer, which should give you at least dozens of hours of entertainment. PvP multiplayer isn't as good in my opinion, although it has its followers. ",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												What do I have to say about Arma 2? Its great game and has so many things you can do, from fighting in the battlefield with your comrades to living a peaceful life as a civilian in the beautiful maps of Takistan, or Chernarus. But, don't mistake this for a simple sandbox FPS, It is far from it, I don't recommend this for people who are used to simple controls, unless you are willing to spend some time in the tutorial for a couple of hours. The campaigns with the DLCs and without them are amazing to play, except the one in the Army of the Czech Republic DLC. I personally give this game an 8/10 for great storyline in the campaign, the amazing modding capabilities in the game. The only faults I find are some bugs, the Army of the Czech republic dlc was disappointing since I couldn't really see the story behind it.			",52,1,0,4,2,0,0

												+ Best warfare simulator+ realistic+ beautiful Graphics+ perfect to play with friends+ massive open-world+ beautiful atmosphere- Worst anti-cheat ever seen - bad optimization (biggest pc in the world will have problems with this)- confusing and terrible controls while inside vehicles- confusing controlsYou will need hours, and hours, to be a ' pro ' in this.Realisticly? buy ARMA III even dayzmod doesnt work for ARMA II, on ARMA III you use ' Exile mod ' to play zombies with friends, but anyways, both games have tons of weapons, and both games have a free map to explore, you can do your own scenarios, and your own ' weapon set 'my rating: 85/100			",57,6,1,13,6,1,8

												Best game ever, hands down. As long as you know atleast two friends who own this game.If you're gonna buy it, buy Combined Operations because both ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead are so cool and unique that you gotta have both of them.Very realistic military simulator but if you're playing on easy it can still be played like an action movie where an RPG takes down your tail rotor so you start crashing into a forest, everyone gets down and takes cover behind the chopper as your enemies converge on your position to make sure you're dead and an epic gun fight starts.The best aspect of this game is the scale and the amount of content. There's hundreds of vehicles, hundreds of weapons, hundreds of units, tons of maps, and like 10+ factions in total, all with their unique arsenals, vehicles, tactics and appearance. This game can either be played with a clan on huge scaled battles with medevac choppers on standby and armor swishing over the plains while getting carpet bombed by Warthogs or it can be played as a small rebel force, fighting either russians or americans or whatever you want, basically, hiding in the woods at night with only flashlights, waiting to ambush a convoy and steal their weapons and medical supplies.The best experience you can have in this game is with atleast 15 people because then you can experience the realism that this game is intended for and people don't have to multitask, such as one person being infantry and chopper pilot at the same time etc.This game is a solid 10/10 and most of the bugs in this game are managable and/or hillarious. Recommend using mods with this game, even if you don't like mods, some mods like ACE, you just can't live without.			",151,13,2,23,16,0,20

												Probably one of my favorite games, Arma 2 OA isn't nearly as good as Arma 3 but it's very fun. IF you get regular Arma you can also play DayZ Mod, the original!Pros: Tons of things to do in the editorLarge mapsYou can play as a cowYou can make firing ranges (well more like many things you can imagine)DayZ ModQuite a large amount of mapsMaps are usually hugeCons: Graphics aren't good (compared to Arma 3 or something like that)If you play as a goat you go super slow :(Editor can be pretty hard to mess around withSometimes it's hard on my FPSNot fast-paced like COD (this can go either way, if you like to chill in a heli headed to the AO, strategizing with your squad etc or if you like to go balls deep, M4 firing..) A great game, buy it. PS if you read this far you probably read about the fast paced♥♥♥♥♥♥ on some multiplayer servers you can simply parachute into the AO with your M249 at the ready			",73,4,1,8,5,0,8

												This game can be really confusing, especially ""Epoch/OverPoch"" Mods, a lot of bugs/glitches, fps drops, Doors and walls are 1 of the most dangerous enemies because they can break your legs or it'll put you to unconscious, it's really hard to find a nice not laggy server, the game requires a good pc, well the ""Epoch/OverPoch"" Mods does, other ones doesn't, the game has a lot of minuses, but if you've played the game for a long while, it can be the most fun game there is. Playing alone is kinda annoying and not that fun, but if you've a whole squad then it's awesome. I really suggest getting this game, it might be not that good optimized like ""ArmA 3"" but in i find ""ArmA 2"" more fun than ""ArmA 3"", Also it's not expensive.  11/10!			",164,23,3,15,15,1,17

In fact, its not a shooter, its a simulator. If you want an easy ride into an arcade like experience, stay away. If you want a realistic simulator, go ahead, but i would recomend arma 3 instead, even though i didnt play it yet.

												Many people buy this game because DayZ, but they miss online battles in ARMA. Domination in ARMA requires team play,its very fun game to play with friends,multiple roles that you can play (Sniper,Medic,Team leader,Fire team leader,Pilot,Crewman...) so find your role and help your team in battle! I totaly recommend this game			",56,2,3,2,5,1,4

 ENGLISH VERSION This game is cool ! Why ?1.Takistan life - There you can be civilian , police man , soldier and terrorist ,but if you want to be terorist you need BIG squad , cars , and money.2. Wasteland - I dont like this mode , because there only PVP and have helicopters , tanks  and other.. (If anybody have it its bad )3. AND THE BEST !! DayZ Mod . There you can be ,,Hero'' and ,,Bandit''.You have ,,Humanity'',If you kill hero's your humanity will be low.There you have missions with bandits ( they are bots ) .The missions is HARD !!   BULGARIAN VERSION Тази игра е готина . Защо ? 1.Такистан лайф - Там можеш да си цивилен , полицай , войник и терорист , но ако искаш да си терорист трябва да имаш ГОЛЯМ отбор , коли и пари.2.Уейстленд - Аз не харесвам този мод на игра , защото има само ПВП и хеликоптери , танкове и още.. ( ако има някой в тях е лошо )3. И НАЙ – ЯКОТО !! Дейзи мод.Там можеш да си Хиро ( Герой ) и Бандит.Там имаш „Хуманити"", ако убиваш герои твоето хуманити ще бъде ниско.Там имаш мисии с бандити ( Те са ботове ) .Мисиите са ТРУДНИ !!

												ARMA II Operation Arrowhead is the very first expansion, and biggest for ARMA II, this can be played as a standalone game, and has a little more content than the original game. When DayZ first was released everyone was eye-ing this expansion as a way to install DayZ, since this was required. But people overlooked the quality of this standalone expansion. Taking place in a desert-like middle-eastern country, named Takistan, this is just a playground of destruction. With various gamemodes you can find yourself doing Co-op missions with friends, like flying helicopters, freeing hostages, clearing camps etc. Or you could do some full-scale massive gamemodes (Domination, Warfare, Deathmatch and Capture the island)This game is most definently must have, if you dig military sims, and are an owner of any of the other ARMA games.

												ArmA 2 OA - Best Military Simulator yet! This game has everything, that is requires in reallife (including @ACE MODS).They're so many mods to fit this ""game"". I probaly have 1,000+ hours plus. (using a different client to run the game).Pros:Using the editor they're so many variables to use.Using realistic military weapons.The game has many Faction's. (RU, UK, US, PMC, etc)They're so many gamemods for this game. (DayZ,ACE/ACRE,CO-OP,IslandLife,Realism Unit, etc)Cons:I suggust they should add a underground system. When you crash the helicopter you automatically blow up which is not realistic, some just bash to the ground. It really depends how fast you going and how hurt the helicopter is.Better performance for low-performance users. Optimze the game better, god dammit!Overall. 11/10.			",214,46,8,42,22,2,35

												This is a review for the series in its totality. ARMA II and its expansions were a welcomed breath of fresh air to mainstream FPS/TPS games. Everything about this game is military ops to the letter. Real Time, Open world combat where one wrong step over a ridge can end you up flatlined. Tactical thinking is requierd in most situations on the campaigns, and sometimes even micro/macro management of your forces. Be aware that even though this game is kind of getting long in the whiskers, setting your visual settings to all high and max draw distance is not advised. The max draw distance of 10,000 (meters) will crunch even the best of Graphics card, and you will notice and performance drop. Every building in the game is descrutible (from what I have experienced). Also there are some bugs with ARMA II base game. They include, but are not limited to weapons/gear disappearing when exiting water, vehicles not spawning in when you buy them, AI getting vehicles stuck for no good reason or not properly moving to a waypoint, and in certain situtaions, losing command of certain purchased units, notably in your squad. Despite these flaws, ARMA II is still and fun and challenging series. And the multiplayer has loads of fun as well. Everything from testing weapons, to dropping a bomb on a group of civillians and watching them go sky high while your frames drop to the teens.			",21,2,0,6,5,0,6

												This game is so addictive. It wasn't supposed to be, since it's a hardcore military shooter. But it is. Especially if you are playing the Wasteland mod, the graphics and engine are outdated, game is full of bugs, yet, it is one of the best games I've ever played, because of the gameplay. If you like being a rifleman, a heavy machinegunner, a tank gunner, a heli pilot (or gunner), a jet pilot/gunner, it doesn't matters, because it's war and you can be whatever you want. 10/10			",88,5,2,6,8,0,4

												Turned out to be one of my all-time favorites. Operation Arrowhead patches so many bugs of the basic Arma II and essentially makes it a new game.While the game is still riddled with flaws, it is just awesome. A fantastic tool for tactical war-sim gameplay if you're so inclined and you bring a bit of brain matter into the equation.Grab your friends and roll in a tank, build up an outpost, dominate a crowd of kids in a plane or ditch the whole public domain, install ACE and ACRE, find a platoon and immerse in tactical infantry gameplay the way you did when you were still in boot camp many moons ago.Be a leet sniper and parachute into the action in hopes of quickscope headshots just to get mauled by enemy fire every two minutes or learn about the range of firearms and proper range estimation and use camouflage to your advantage as you work your way from one objective to the next under the cover of friendly surveillance.Shout into Voice-Over-Net because mommy doesn't understand you or join an ACRE server, learn about the use of radios and broadcast your grid reference to your platoon commander on VHF, over.The choices are yours to make once you realize that no two servers are the same and you don't actually have to play with toddlers.I will love this game forever and for always.

												The most realistic war simulator game i ever play. It's great, probably my favorite game of all time..ARMA2OA it's a tactical shooter focused primarily on infantry combat, however it also features significant vehicular and aerial combat elements. The player is able to command AI squad members which adds a real-time strategy element to the game. This is further enhanced by introduction of the high command system, which allows the player to command multiple squads using the map.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This by far is one of my favorite games due to it's sheer replayability and large community, not to mention all the mods. If you're looking for a game to play with a group a friends but you would like to take a more serious angle on your playing experience I totally reccomend this game.			",34,6,0,3,10,0,4

												I've owned this game for some years now and I tend to go back to it now and then. For me I really only bought this game for the Dayz Mod and kind of theft this game to rot in my library. I had never played the vanilla game and only used it to get to Dayz. However, when I did play it I couldn't get away from it. My 130 hours or so should explain that. Yes, most of that time I spent playing Takistan life with friends granted but other game modes were very interesting to say the least.  I never played the main campaign and don't tend to either, I believe this game is best when playing multiplayer; but only when you are with friends. Playing this game without a friend or two gets boring after a while, you can try and make new friends but if you're like me that isn't going to happen. Does anyone else love the glitches on this game ? I do, especially the ones on the Dayz mod where planes would bounce on the ground and you would die because of it, or when you try to vault into a blown up building only to break your leg. Loved it. The Dysnc! Oh god, if you want to be in the passenger seat and watch as the driver crashes into every tree in the game then this is the game for you to realise that it didn't actually happen? I like this game and always will do, but due to the lack of friends to play with and the fact I can't get the Dayz mod to work this game is some what dead to me now and will forever be a memory of the good times I had, an their were some good ones. 6.5/10. Why ? Because like I said before, its only fun when you're playing with friends and it gets quite repetitive after a while and very boring and stale fast,  and to many it is only a way to get to the Dayz mod which now for me is dead. Maybe if you were buying this is 2011-2013 then it would be great fun.   ",199,21,6,17,21,1,25

												This game has a ton of mods and modes to have fun with. The controls feel ""strange"" at first i find, but if you get used to it everythings good. This arma is better than the 3rd installation since it doesnt require you to buy tons of dlc to have the experience you're supposed to get. Arma 3 sadly requires dlc if you dont want to have a disantvantage over other players.			",121,6,0,14,17,0,20

												Military simulator, meaning it's much harder and more unforgiving than other first person shooters on the market. Nonetheless fun, with an extremely varied selection of weapons and vehicles, whether civilian or military. It however requires a pretty beefy processor and graphics card. There are many fun gamemodes other than DayZ, like Takistan Life, Warfare, Domination and Wasteland (personal favorite). If your computer is powerful enough, I recommend checking out Arma 3. Better graphics, and a lot more content.			",75,6,1,9,13,0,6

												My first experience with this game was designating targets for airstrikes by other players while a massive firefight happened around me. Since then, I've coordinated a mechanized infantry assault in Afghanistan, led a charge of Shermans into battle against Tiger tanks, conducted recon through the jungles of Vietnam, defused IEDs blocking the path for the rest of my platoon, and flown F-14s from aircraft carriers while my friend and I blast ""Danger Zone"".It's not the game for everyone, but it certainly is the game for me.

												ArmA 2 OA - Best Military Simulator yet! This game has everything, that is requires in reallife (including @ACE MODS).They're so many mods to fit this ""game"". I probaly have 1,000+ hours plus. (using a different client to run the game).Pros:Using the editor they're so many variables to use.Using realistic military weapons.The game has many Faction's. (RU, UK, US, PMC, etc)They're so many gamemods for this game. (DayZ,ACE/ACRE,CO-OP,IslandLife,Realism Unit, etc)Cons:I suggust they should add a underground system. When you crash the helicopter you automatically blow up which is not realistic, some just bash to the ground. It really depends how fast you going and how hurt the helicopter is.Better performance for low-performance users. Optimze the game better, god dammit!Overall. 11/10.			",214,46,8,42,22,2,35

												A Video game for anyone who ever relishes the triumphal note of western war films, who gets carried away by the moral high of being on the winning side. For those who saw the good in the Gulf War, saw how many people America helped and was proud to live in the Western world.ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead is an anti-war game. Its opening scenes are not the declaration of war, but soldiers celebrating its end. Then coming to grips with its consequences.It's hard to really adequately describe this game. Let me try. ""Operation Arrowhead"" does an excellent job of showing just how gonzo modern warfare has become. You've got unemployed reservists going to the Middle East for kicks. A takastani army who uses gas attacks, electric shock torture and other atrocities to fight the rebels. Thrown in the mix is a U.S.-educated taki whose businesses were destroyed by the Americans.Not the best role playing game in the world. Funny, shocking, thought provoking and honest, 8.5/10.

												This is a review for the series in its totality. ARMA II and its expansions were a welcomed breath of fresh air to mainstream FPS/TPS games. Everything about this game is military ops to the letter. Real Time, Open world combat where one wrong step over a ridge can end you up flatlined. Tactical thinking is requierd in most situations on the campaigns, and sometimes even micro/macro management of your forces. Be aware that even though this game is kind of getting long in the whiskers, setting your visual settings to all high and max draw distance is not advised. The max draw distance of 10,000 (meters) will crunch even the best of Graphics card, and you will notice and performance drop. Every building in the game is descrutible (from what I have experienced). Also there are some bugs with ARMA II base game. They include, but are not limited to weapons/gear disappearing when exiting water, vehicles not spawning in when you buy them, AI getting vehicles stuck for no good reason or not properly moving to a waypoint, and in certain situtaions, losing command of certain purchased units, notably in your squad. Despite these flaws, ARMA II is still and fun and challenging series. And the multiplayer has loads of fun as well. Everything from testing weapons, to dropping a bomb on a group of civillians and watching them go sky high while your frames drop to the teens.			",21,2,0,6,5,0,6

Get yourself a plot pole and build a base and be the king of Chernaraus. For only $25 I absolutely reccomend this game, and when you do get it you will regret you didnt have it sooner.

ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead is most definitely worth the purchase even if it is just for the mods.Personally, i bought both OA and Arma 2 solely for the purpose of playing the DayZ mod. Though in recent weeks ive discovered that both OA and Arma 2 have even more to offer as an online game. The use of the ACE and ACRE mods opens up the online skirmishing to a whole new level of realism and combat, and the extensive community which consistently develops more and more modifications for both Operation Arrowhead and Arma 2, means that theres always something new and interesting either being added or updated.Even still, if you're not too interested in the online aspects of the Arma series; the Single Player aspects offer much too - and the detailed and expansive world which has been created for you to battle in is both vast and utterly brilliant.I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, and the base Arma 2 game, as a must have for your Steam Library.

												I got ArmA 2 outside of steam back in 2012 before the gamespy shut down and since I bought it back then I have thoroughly enjoyed it. In total I have amassed at least 5,000 hours of actual gameplay.I bought the game because I was at a friends house who had the original ArmA 2 from 2009 and when I seen the game I thought there was a lot of potential because of how it is open world.Almost everyday since I have had the game I've played around an hour a day but recently it has started to decline due to the game dying due to old age and useless updates for the DayZ mod.I think it is safe to say that this game is a fantastic game although it may have a bunch of bugs still in it, but the time has come for Operation Arrowhead. It is a 7 year old game in June and there hasn't been any real significant updates since the last corepatch in winter 2 years ago (or so I think). There has been no new dlc, only BattlEye Anti-Cheat updates to keep the hackers out.People need to understand that it might seem like a good game to buy now, but I encourage you to save your money for ArmA 3 if you don't have it, or, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.I have been watching the population of this game recently and there has been a steady decrease of players. Just 2 months ago there was an average of 5,000 people concurrently playing, this number has now halved and I don't see it increasing again.It has been a good journey, but the road must come to an end.

												What a perfect game this is. Remember this review is MOSTLY opinion orriented. This is after playing many hours, both alone and with friends. I don't know where to begin. There is SO much stuff to do, with SO many mod spin-offs (Such as Origins, Epoch, OverPoch.) that it could easily have you playing over 5000+ hours if you are hardcore.Absolutely INSANE amount of players/content. It actually feels geniunely terrifying when you get into a firefight. This is NOT a running simulator, as long as you put the effort in, you could have a working vehicle within 15 minutes of your spawn. Also, helicopters.AI Missions, in case you get bored and need some extra loot. Very diificult to do, but the payoff is insane.Helicopters/Jets, depending on the server. Awesome.Tons of weapons, pretty easy to find one.Here's a big one: KOSing is NOT a major problem. Unlike H1Z1, you actually have a chance at making friends most of the time.No microtransactions. Everything's fair.Large maps, could take you up to an hour to drive through the whole thing if you taking the road the whole time.No persistent loot, so you cannot just server hop.Friendly people are everywhere.Our lord, Frankieonpcin1080p plays this game.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes, forget H1Z1, THIS is the best Zombie/Survival game to date.			",100,5,1,3,4,0,1

Also, helicopters.AI Missions, in case you get bored and need some extra loot. Very diificult to do, but the payoff is insane.Helicopters/Jets, depending on the server. Awesome.Tons of weapons, pretty easy to find one.Here's a big one: KOSing is NOT a major problem. Unlike H1Z1, you actually have a chance at making friends most of the time.No microtransactions. Everything's fair.Large maps, could take you up to an hour to drive through the whole thing if you taking the road the whole time.No persistent loot, so you cannot just server hop.Friendly people are everywhere.Our lord, Frankieonpcin1080p plays this game.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes, forget H1Z1, THIS is the best Zombie/Survival game to date.			",100,5,1,3,4,0,1

												Military simulator, meaning it's much harder and more unforgiving than other first person shooters on the market. Nonetheless fun, with an extremely varied selection of weapons and vehicles, whether civilian or military. It however requires a pretty beefy processor and graphics card. There are many fun gamemodes other than DayZ, like Takistan Life, Warfare, Domination and Wasteland (personal favorite). If your computer is powerful enough, I recommend checking out Arma 3. Better graphics, and a lot more content.			",75,6,1,9,13,0,6

												This game has a ton of mods and modes to have fun with. The controls feel ""strange"" at first i find, but if you get used to it everythings good. This arma is better than the 3rd installation since it doesnt require you to buy tons of dlc to have the experience you're supposed to get. Arma 3 sadly requires dlc if you dont want to have a disantvantage over other players.			",121,6,0,14,17,0,20

HUD was not the only thing that is new in the expension, new armd cars, helicopters and guns are new.DayzThe main reason whay people bay Arma ll and Arma ll:Operation Arrowhead is to play Dayz. Dayz is a mod to Arma ll. To play the mod you nead Arma ll and Arma:Operation Arrowhead. Most of may time in Arma ll:Operation Arrowhead is in the Dayz.

												Definately one of my favourite games of all time, there is a broad spectrum of things you can do with the right mods equiped, be it the infamous ""DayZ"" Mod, or just a standard Co-op Mission. I definately recommend this to anyone with even a small interest in a tactically focused Shooter-Game.Additional players/friends improve the experience drastically.TL;DR Buy it, be it just for ""DayZ"" but try the other possibilites too if you find the time.10/10			",101,6,0,6,22,0,16

												This game is wonderful, the infantry and vehicle combat is spectacular although the vehicles have some wonky physics but overall the game does what it does best, simulate combat in a realistic environment. The campaign was overall good and the online play is exceptionally good if you play with friends or even by yourself. Although if you are going to purchase this game I'd recommend buying all the DLC at once since the PMC DLC also has a very good story to it and adds cool vehicles and weapons.			",39,3,1,6,8,0,8

												I don't know why it shows so few hours played, while in fact I have finished the campaign. It must be because I played it with some DLC on, or I don't know.I found Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead extremely intriguing and enthralling. You get into a lot of realistic scenarios and you end up managing things at different levels. I would recommend it to gun nuts and whoever has an interest in military operations.Nevertheless, it has its downsides: the learning curve is very steep, and frustrating at times. The game also tends to crash every now and then. On top of this, there are bugs and glitches, which force you to become paranoid about details, but well beyond what should be reasonably expected in a game.I will make some examples, so to ensure you are well aware of the issues with the Arma game system:- You are well into a mission until you realize some of your men have been left behind. Are they wounded? What happened? Simply this: you gave the ""everybody embark the vehicle"" command and yet some of them didn't manage to get in (not because of vehicle size, but because all the trajectories of NPCs are glitchy and buggy);- Driving vehicles is a pain in the ***. And I am talking cars and motorbikes... not airplanes and choppers. Controls are realistic beyond reasonableness: all vehicles' drift and reactions to gravity and the like are extremely realistic. Only difference is that I don't ""feel the wheel"" while I'm sitting at my desk... thus making the entire vehicle experience painful to no end;- Sometimes, a mission will not be completed simply because of a bug... thus runing ages of gameplay spent getting to a specific point in the map;- Endless menus to control everything friendly AI does... you have to use all your keyboard just to get somebody to do something decent like searching for an IEDOverall, it is a very nice game, but picking it up after maybe one year not playing it... and I am back to step 0: I have to re-learn all keyboard commands from scratch. So annoying.			",10,1,0,1,0,0,7

												Arma 2 OA is one of if not the most relictice games of all time. it is hard to lern and fun to play.Gameplay:Gameplay is not esay and is not to be overlocked so if you like the army and are not afrad of dieding over and over and over then pick it up and it is a good game. and it is best in good detail everything feeles alive and is good when you kill someone so in that aspect it is rely good. Animations:Not good animations but far from the wost i'v seen so not much to talk abote here. Story:The story of Arma 2 OA is that the tacastan (do not know how to spell it) army has seized control of the contery. the US laed coaltion is to bring down the tacs and liberaty the contery. And the story is reliy well pulled out for a game like this.Verdict:Arma 2 OA Is a good game with good gameplay for the type of game it is and my finel verdict for Arma 2 OA is a 8.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game to chew up hours of free time. Play almost 100 hours and I will never regret those hours spent playing the  DayZ mod optional with the game, which I encourage you to try. Look up popularly known Youtube content creators like JackFrags, FRANKIEonPCin1080p (I know he had a couple of scandals regarding the hacking incidents, such a shame) and PsiSyndicate.Fantastic game DayZ is.Although a bit more expense required to play this game compared to other survival games (Rust, Romero's Aftermath and Minecraft etc.) it is still worth a buy. I bought the package with most of the DLC (ArmA 2: Complete Collection, costing $39.99 USD without any sale) making the game look fantastic. Runs extremely well on Windows 7 - 10.There is a deep aspect of survival in this game, making it one of the most realistic zombie post-apocalyptic games on Steam. Heavily refined over the years, Arma 2: DayZ Mod is a fantastic game to play. Great fun with friends and can get lonely playing solo in the in the zombie apocalypse.Does require deep concetration and skill to maximize enjoyment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ArmA 2 is the kind of game that was made only for the hardcore military shooter buffs. This game is so challenging and diffcult that it makes Call of Duty and Battlefield look like Angry Birds by comparission. Not everyone will like this game so I only recomended to military buffs and anyone who started playing military shooters back in the late 90's / early 2000's. Remeber the old school Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon, its basically those games on a massive scale. The game pays the greatest attention to details and realism as players must work with their team to complte their objective. Be it the single-player or multiplayer, ArmA 2 is true gift to the hardcore gamer.The exspansion packs / DLCs also add to the longevity of the game and if you could get the entire collection during a Steam sale, do it.

												This arguably one of the most in depth military games out there, the modding community has also really made some stellar missions, and other content. There is an entire website dedicated to new vehicles, weapons, camo, game over hauls, and maps. It really has something for everyone, and can also be modded to play the famous DayZ mod which has countless hours on its on. Arma II: OA really shouldn't be called a game, its more like a sampler. You can literally play exactly what you want, if its an idea there is a mod it really is a shining example of what cooperation between a developer and their fanbase should look like in the whole industry.The game can be demanding on your setup so make sure you have a good CPU, lots of ram, and decent graphics card. The settings cranked in this game make it pretty damn gorgeous so you will not be dissapointed. The game is often on sale as are all of the initial dlcs, which add various new things, and also unlock the full potential of high res texturing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even with the amount of time I've put into this game I've barely scratched the surface. And most of that has come solely from the level editor.The editor is really fun to play around with, helicopter raids, tank missions, HALO jumps, patrols, ambushes, you name it, you can more than likely do it.The only real problem you might encounter with this game is its difficulty. There is a pretty steep learning curve to get used to it. Theres no second lives, theres no attack dog bonuses. It is probably as close as you'll ever get to war.I wouldn't recommend this to any looking for a quick, CoD style deathmatch. ArmA II's combat takes patience, practice and more patience. A definate must-buy for anyone looking for some large scale warfare, tactical combat or military simulation games.			",93,3,0,7,9,0,8

												Overall, a really nice Military-Simulation.Though, it is one of the buggiest Games i have ever played.But that is the charme of ArmA2 imo.I can only reccomend it for anyone who wants a good,real Military-Simulation. Multiplayer can be endless hours of fun with all those mods out there.8/10			",95,5,2,7,7,3,21

												This game is insane, this is definetly the most realistic game, ive ever played. I originally picked this up to play the DayZ Mod (which is great by the way), but I had no idea what else was out there, the arma II editor is crazy. There are servers like Wasteland, Island Life, and a absolute ton of custom maps, I have owned this game for about 2 years now, (July 18th 2012, don't quote me on that) and I am still playing it today, I have a lot more hours but they won't show because I played DayZ on DayZ Commander. I truly recommend this game to anyone that likes realism, intense firefights, and is generally a hardcore FPS player.			",128,8,1,10,4,0,12

Posted: January 5, 2013
												I am literally in LOVE with this game.Arma is one of the very few games that has managed to suck out 200+ hours out of me, without me getting bored of the content within game. It is an amazing game that you should have at least tried if you are a gamer, I mean c'mon the Multiplayer of Arma II is free, and the best parts of the game are in the multiplayer!Arma 2 OA is a standalone expansion from Arma 2 and it offers a completely new experience to the other game with a whole new upgrade to the look and feel of the game which is worth the full title cost. It is set in the fictional country of Takistan which is torn apart by the OpFor forces stationed there and is trying to be recovered by the BluFor forces stationed three. The game also allows the player to play in the old map Chernarus, but only if you own a copy of Arma II or have the Arma II Free game installed. The single player gives you the experience of being there and commanding a unit. The single player also features parts where you are in control of your superiors and takes a different direction of how a mission is played. What it does is it gives you and objective, guidelines, but you don’t necessarily have to follow them, but for the sake of story and depth its best to play within reason. The game allows you to learn from your mistakes, adapt or play in way that nobody else has, For example I was in a mission where all my men died, and I had one injured man left, and I had to get to a rendezvous but we had to face about a chalk of men. From constantly dying in the mission, I learnt that I could not protect my teammate as he would die instantly from any damage, so instead of facing the enemy I ran off and took a stealth route, which I could complete but because of AI Intelligence, he couldn't. And it’s because of moments like that, that make the single player something really special.The multiplayer gives you an experience of user created gameplay that very few games allow you to do, and this is one of the trademarks of the series. With some game modes and missions that you can play together with others, most people prefer to play user generated missions or game modes. The mission side of things is very simple. You get given tools that with a basic knowledge of google search or scripting allow you to create a mission that could be put in the single player of the game itself. I myself have made a few of these types of missions, ranging from border patrols, races to a vehicle and weapon showcase created to test out all the vehicles and weapons in the game and enable anyone to learn how to fly a plane or helicopter in game, without getting yelled at for wasting a valuable asset in certain multiplayer game modes. Game modes made by independent developers or groups of people is where the main fan base of the game stands at. Some of these 'gems' include:-Domination, a team based game where you are part of an army working together fighting and liberating towns from the OpFor stationed in them. -DayZ which now has evolved into a standalone game, is a whole new game mode in which you are one of the many survivors of a zombie infestation and you try to live within that scenario getting over the many obstacles that would exist including in depth problems like health and blood loss and social problems like gangs bandits and trust.-I44 is a whole re-branding of the game. It’s called Invasion 1944 and is set during the invasion of American Troops into Europe. The whole game is remade with a WW2 feel, with iconic weapons, gear clothing and vehicles. You have at your disposal, the German, British and American army to play with playing historical battles or some of the user-Generated games modes within Arma II such as DayZ and Domination.-ACE Is an upgrade to the already semi realistic game that Arma is. It offers more depth, challenge and realism and is seen as a mod for the more hard core fans, or people that like a more difficult game or a more enhancing experience in comparison to the vanilla version. It achieves this by adding little details everywhere such as fainting and ear protection from explosions. Also it adds more difficulty with things like shooting and stamina making the game that one step more realistic.-WasteLand is a scavenge and co-operate game mode in which players must earn money to make and but defences for their team, with a goal of domination and annihilation of the other team and the land around. The last game mode I want to talk about RP civilian life or as it’s now known as 'RPG Life'. This game mode adds a Sims like aspect to the game, as you play a civilian who can live his life normally or he can become a criminal or rebel and fight the police force who are in charge of keeping peace in the country. With trading, working and doing normal things like eating and drinking this game mode is one that will never be the same twice. Now this isn’t a full review of the game so I'll stop at the game modes and not expand any further as I could go on forever, talking about this game. So in short I give this game a 85/100, the reasons?Some Positives:-Has a decent campaign with a whole new approach to how a mission can be done-The multiplayer is and unlimited canvas with almost unlimited potential.-The community is a wide and strong one adding a lot to the game itself.-The Semi-Realism is an enhancing experience that adds on a lot to the game.Some Negatives:-There are a lot of fundamental ideas that are expected to be seen in sandboxes that are missing.-There could have been a lot more things done by the developers than just leaving the community to handle it and where there was support it was usually not in the places needed-There are some really bad flaws in AI and horrible animations that really take away from the game			",60,2,1,2,14,0,9

												What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier; it's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.			",103,12,0,11,9,1,13

												This is a really good Military Simulator. there are tons of guns, armaments, objects, etc. you can use to create whatever kind of situation you see fit. like rebels stealing NATO supplies, or US marines taking over Russian FOBs. plus this game has tons of mods, including the infamous ACE/ACRE mod and the ever popular DayZ mod. gamespy might be shutting down next month, but this game will be ever so strong in the Multiplayer department. besides the mods, there are tons of realism units out there, like th 15th MEU and the JTF207, there's a clan out there for everyone. and if you arent into clan based dealings, maybe you could try your hand at an Role Playing server? there are different kinds of RP Life servers on ArmA 2 OA, such as the common Chernarus and Takistan life servers, to ones such as City Life RP and TCG RP servers. like the realism units, there's a community for everyone. the greatness of this game is that you have the freedom to do what ever you want, how you want it, and when you want it.

												ARMA II Operation Arrowhead and it's brother, ARMA II, are both fantastic games that, at times, can feel more like a movie then a game. ARMA II can have the most cinematic feeling at times; your squad is wiped out, rescue bird has gone down and you're alone against oncoming swarms of hostile units that want to drag your dead corpse through the street and display your flak as a sign of victory, of have the deafing roar of the A-10 fly above your head and wipe that small town ahead of you to nothing more then a smoldering wreck of adobe and taliban weapon caches.I highly recommend this game to any one seeking a tactical and down to earth take on the modern FPS genre.

												Pros: It is fun, realistic, and very moddable. Controls, once you set them up how you like, are easy. Single player was interesting, but most of the entertainment in the game comes from multilayer. There aren't many servers [other than DayZ] still running, but with a few mods and a good server, you can have all the fun you want.Cons: The game requires some background into the series, otherwise it might take some time getting use to. Graphics are alright, but I usually run on low-normal to keep the FPS at 60. aside from that, its a fun game.10/10 would crash a C-130 into a car for revenge again.			",56,2,0,1,3,0,9

Community- very active.- Mod community is very active.- Island Life and/or Takistan Life are  GREAT mods if you like roleplay.Gameplay-Good tactical gameplay functions.-If you just got the gaame, there are multiple scenarios to play that will  get you used to the game.Graphics -Does not take too much to play this game.-I play on a laptop with graphics all the way down and it runs fine, but if you have a desktop you should be ok for graphics on medium +.Bottom LineFantastic game. Obviously i think that this game is worth it considering i have that many hours playing it.**see my page for pictures of me playing island life**Thanks.			",50,9,0,5,13,0,3

												It s a classic in modern 3D combat game, A true fan (like me) likes a twitch in controll system not a instant kill aim like all other FPS shooter games. This hard controll system game likes to use your brain as a weapon. Hide, crawl and steady your aim gets this game a physix mind brawl control mastery. Know your PC when you play this one. One FPS drop and your in a wolrd of hurt. Only for expert shooter gamers. Thumbs up.			",77,4,3,3,3,0,11

												Can't review Arma 2 alone idk why lol. Arma 2 is worth $13 if u like a really realistic shooter. The game is really fiddly and hard to play so i don't really like it. Arma 2's dlc is amazing but the base game it self isn't really worth playing. I thought battle field was fiddly but once you play this FWAH. Maybe because i'm a scrub and too used to easy games like C.S and Cod lol. If u can learn well then it's a decent game but get opperation arrowhead expansion for all the mods and stuffs 4/10 For Arma 2Opperation Arrowhead is what u want if you're playing Arma 2. Games like Dayz, Wasteland and Epoc are so fun to play with friends and can still be fun solo. The expansion cost $20 but you'll need the base game as well which can be bought for $25 or $4 with a few extra DLC's. In Operation Arrowhead there are really fun games to play like Epoc, dayz,wasteland and they’re amazing. 6.5/10 idk i just find it hard to play lol can't even fly a heli. For Arma 28/10 Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												I know this is not Arma II, but normal Arma II wont let me write a review. Arma is a Great Game, one of the best warfare games out there. For new players this game is no call of duty, its only 100 times better and more realistic. For you battlefield vets, you might feel a little more comfortable, but do not be mistaken this game is hard as s***. Everything is realistic, bullet drop, weapon accuracy, anniexty attacks, aiming after sprinting. My biggest advice is COVER and PAITENCE.  If you want to succed, you need to understand the aiming and then waiting it out and choosing the right positions and stances for you and your team is key to not dying over and over and over and over and over. The Story Is Great, the main storyline takes you on a trip of Razor team a UNSC recon squad. Memebers Sergant Miles, Sergant Cooper, Sergant Skypes, Sergant Brian, and Sergant Rodriguez. They are part of the USA invasion force of Chernarus in efforts to pervent an evil Cherno force from over throwing the government. Decisions and failures affect the outcome, Thats right this game has 3 endings. How you play is up to you, Chernarus's future lies in your hands. Failure to stop so will lead to the destruction of Chernarus or Russian complete domination of the region. Will you save the country or doom it? I give this game a 9.5 out of 10. The only reason why i don't give it a perfect 10 is AI are dumb sometimes and that normal Arma II has no more Servers to play normal Warface or annex or things like that. The DLC for this game is great for the most part, I highly recommend Operation Arrowhead, the dlc runs 10 times smoother on the new map and you can play normal Arma II on it. It is smooth offers a brand new map and tons of new weapons, tanks, and helis and cars. The story it has is kinda bland, but offers a fun new cool story. It offers a brand new multiplayer. There are some servers for normal warfare still running, but full servers are hard to come by for normal Conquest as I call it. Most people are friendly and team work is highly encouraged. Dont be stupid and you might make new friends. DayZ is also Extremely great, but I will write a entire review for that later, but with the stand alone out fewer normal DayZ servers are out and the modded servers are just filled with douches and bandits who have no honor. It is survival horror people, you should survive and Roleplaying only makes it ten times greater. I hope to see some of you out there on Arma II and DayZ. So what are you waiting for, Buy this game and see what lies in store for you. See you on the battlefield.			",42,1,0,1,2,0,1

												This game is amazing and fun! I enjoy playing all the Arma series, including DAY Z. If you love action, shooting, tactical, war and multiplayer games, then Arma 2: OA is for you! Check out Arma 3 as well!  I rate the Arma 2:OA and everything else associated in the Arma series a rating of 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best military game every made. I've fallen in love with this game, wether it be in DayZ, wasteland, RPG, or just the base game I can be sure I'm ganna have a good time. The gun play and fighting mechanics are amazing and killing people has a great satisfaction to it. There is nothing more satisfing than sniping the driver out of a moving truck at 500m and watching the truck swerve and smash into a wall. Or when you get in a fire fight and they break your leg but you still manage to kill all 6 guys who are attacking you then crawl across a field to find morfine. Its just a great game and I highly recommend it too anyone who doesn't mind a big learning curve and randomly dying from some guy 700m away with a as50 every once and awhile. Also this is NOT cod so dont expect to be getting like 80 kills. This is a military simulator it is not a arcade shooter. That means no raging please. ANYWAYS... get it. Its amazing game. 10/10			",35,2,0,2,2,0,5

												The surprise hit of the year, due to the DayZ mod.  A three year old game with graphics that surprisingly, can hold its own against more modern games.  Some minor annoying engine problems.  Slower, more methodical movements may annoy twitch gamers used to traditional shooters.  But this game is geared to be more of a simulation than a shooter.  Play with an open mind and imagination and you might not be disappointed.  If you just want to shoot and kill stuff this might not be for you.			",398,131,10,69,47,6,83

												ArmA 2 is the kind of game that was made only for the hardcore military shooter buffs. This game is so challenging and diffcult that it makes Call of Duty and Battlefield look like Angry Birds by comparission. Not everyone will like this game so I only recomended to military buffs and anyone who started playing military shooters back in the late 90's / early 2000's. Remeber the old school Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon, its basically those games on a massive scale. The game pays the greatest attention to details and realism as players must work with their team to complte their objective. Be it the single-player or multiplayer, ArmA 2 is true gift to the hardcore gamer.The exspansion packs / DLCs also add to the longevity of the game and if you could get the entire collection during a Steam sale, do it.

												The Vanilla game is amazing, both the singleplayer and Multiplayer, but the multiplayer is something unique and extremly fun if you have a group of friends to play with, I mainly bought this for DayZ though, and that is probably on of the best mods I have ever played, the only mod that I think could matc this one is Desert Strike for Battlefield 2 or the reality mod for Battlefield 2 to. But if you now get bored of that you will be able to spend several of hours into the vanilla game of this if you now could stand the realism! Can't wait for Arma 3!			",211,33,3,29,18,1,29

												Okay let me start off by saying I have many more hours of gametime than listed above and experience in other ArmA games in the series.  I originally bought this game mainly for Dayz but quickly realized this game has extremely unique and untapped potential in its singleplayer and other vanilla multiplayer modes if you are patient enough to learn how to play them. This game is everything in one a military simulator, ♥♥♥♥ around and troll simulator, building and management, player crafting, open world exploring, mass vehicle battles, zombie apocalypse survival, you name it. This game will give you a unique experience everytime no matter how many hours you place into this you can make friends, have amazing friendships, and betray them and steal everything they love within minutes. Drive around, kidnap innocent people, make them undress, and then shoot them in the legs forcing them to crawl to survival while they get eaten alive by zombies. What's not to love? 10/10 most realistic and unrealistic simulator ever, best to play with a couple of friends. But be wary of strangers you meet, they may shoot you and steal your baked beans. Protect your beans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a very good multiplayer experience. It's realism will immerse you as if you are really there. There are a variety of guns that not only look like their real-life counterparts, but also act like them. Vehicles in this game are also pretty good. They look pretty much the same with their real-life counter parts but are not that realistic (rocks can easily flip your tank). Some problems with the servers though; it can be easily hack. Also, the controls are rather complicated and practically takes half of your keyboard. The campaign is uninteresting as the characters are flat, the voice acting is unconvincing, and the storyline sucks. But the multiplayer- even though servers are often hacked - are well worth it.

												An amazing game that I have sunk so many hours into, this game is the height of FPS and FPS-Strategy, this Military Simulator offers many modes, missions and it's own editor.Modes - The main modes are:Campaign - The main ARMA 2 campaign with additional DLC campaigns, you can also input player-made campaigns into this by pasting them into the folder.Missions - Random missions that can either be played in singleplayer with AI or multiplayer with some mates, the developers were so generous to include scripted missions to show off the potential of the editor, even the campaign was made with the editor!Editor - Probrally the best thing about the game, the in-game editor, a VERY simple layout of the map where you can plot units, vehicles, buildings, groups, etc and give them objectives, or if you're proficent, scripts. The editor utilizes everything about the game and is A LOT of fun, you can make huge battles, EVAC missions, training missions, anything you can think off!Gamemodes - There are a variety of gamemodes that're imputted into the game, the main one is CTI (Capture the Island), however, there are many player made ones, such as Takistani Life, Domination, Wasteland and many more.ARMA 2 OA is a amazing game offering a endless amount of possibities and is why I have sunk over 300 hours onto it, it is a great game and is so unique, unlike many FPS shooters these days... *cough* Call of Duty *cough* It's cheap, it's fun and if you can break through the learning curve, you'll LOVE this game! 10/10 - True game of the decade!

												Okay let me start off by saying I have many more hours of gametime than listed above and experience in other ArmA games in the series.  I originally bought this game mainly for Dayz but quickly realized this game has extremely unique and untapped potential in its singleplayer and other vanilla multiplayer modes if you are patient enough to learn how to play them. This game is everything in one a military simulator, ♥♥♥♥ around and troll simulator, building and management, player crafting, open world exploring, mass vehicle battles, zombie apocalypse survival, you name it. This game will give you a unique experience everytime no matter how many hours you place into this you can make friends, have amazing friendships, and betray them and steal everything they love within minutes. Drive around, kidnap innocent people, make them undress, and then shoot them in the legs forcing them to crawl to survival while they get eaten alive by zombies. What's not to love? 10/10 most realistic and unrealistic simulator ever, best to play with a couple of friends. But be wary of strangers you meet, they may shoot you and steal your baked beans. Protect your beans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really love this game but sad arma 3 setting is not at modern time like this one. I recommend this game for everyone.

												This may be the greatest game in existence.Despite its many bugs and glitches it is a great game. Hundreds of hours of fun. Even with the amount of time I've put into this game I've barely scratched the surface. And most of that has come solely from the level editor.The editor is really fun to play around with, helicopter raids, tank missions, HALO jumps, patrols, ambushes, you name it, you can more than likely do it.The only real problem you might encounter with this game is its difficulty. There is a pretty steep learning curve to get used to it. Theres no second lives, theres no attack dog bonuses. It is probably as close as you'll ever get to war.I wouldn't recommend this to any looking for a quick, CoD style deathmatch. ArmA II's combat takes patience, practice and more patience. A definate must-buy for anyone looking for some large scale warfare, tactical combat or military simulation games.			",93,3,0,7,9,0,8

												Arma 2:OA is one of the better games of our time. Although clunky, the game provides a great military-sim experience. A great deal of Arma's success is probably due to the widely popular mod, DayZ. Although DayZ takes the fame, there are dozens of other flushed out mods, such as BattleRoyal and Wasteland that have a large population. It is also relatively simple to create your own custom game or mod using the editing tools that are provided within the game. The game also features a series of campaigns that are worth your time. Overall, I would highly recommend this game, especially if one is a little bit hesitant on the price tag for Arma 3.			",56,9,0,2,15,1,5

Posted: January 5, 2013
												I am literally in LOVE with this game.Arma is one of the very few games that has managed to suck out 200+ hours out of me, without me getting bored of the content within game. It is an amazing game that you should have at least tried if you are a gamer, I mean c'mon the Multiplayer of Arma II is free, and the best parts of the game are in the multiplayer!Arma 2 OA is a standalone expansion from Arma 2 and it offers a completely new experience to the other game with a whole new upgrade to the look and feel of the game which is worth the full title cost. It is set in the fictional country of Takistan which is torn apart by the OpFor forces stationed there and is trying to be recovered by the BluFor forces stationed three. The game also allows the player to play in the old map Chernarus, but only if you own a copy of Arma II or have the Arma II Free game installed. The single player gives you the experience of being there and commanding a unit. The single player also features parts where you are in control of your superiors and takes a different direction of how a mission is played. What it does is it gives you and objective, guidelines, but you don’t necessarily have to follow them, but for the sake of story and depth its best to play within reason. The game allows you to learn from your mistakes, adapt or play in way that nobody else has, For example I was in a mission where all my men died, and I had one injured man left, and I had to get to a rendezvous but we had to face about a chalk of men. From constantly dying in the mission, I learnt that I could not protect my teammate as he would die instantly from any damage, so instead of facing the enemy I ran off and took a stealth route, which I could complete but because of AI Intelligence, he couldn't. And it’s because of moments like that, that make the single player something really special.The multiplayer gives you an experience of user created gameplay that very few games allow you to do, and this is one of the trademarks of the series. With some game modes and missions that you can play together with others, most people prefer to play user generated missions or game modes. The mission side of things is very simple. You get given tools that with a basic knowledge of google search or scripting allow you to create a mission that could be put in the single player of the game itself. I myself have made a few of these types of missions, ranging from border patrols, races to a vehicle and weapon showcase created to test out all the vehicles and weapons in the game and enable anyone to learn how to fly a plane or helicopter in game, without getting yelled at for wasting a valuable asset in certain multiplayer game modes. Game modes made by independent developers or groups of people is where the main fan base of the game stands at. Some of these 'gems' include:-Domination, a team based game where you are part of an army working together fighting and liberating towns from the OpFor stationed in them. -DayZ which now has evolved into a standalone game, is a whole new game mode in which you are one of the many survivors of a zombie infestation and you try to live within that scenario getting over the many obstacles that would exist including in depth problems like health and blood loss and social problems like gangs bandits and trust.-I44 is a whole re-branding of the game. It’s called Invasion 1944 and is set during the invasion of American Troops into Europe. The whole game is remade with a WW2 feel, with iconic weapons, gear clothing and vehicles. You have at your disposal, the German, British and American army to play with playing historical battles or some of the user-Generated games modes within Arma II such as DayZ and Domination.-ACE Is an upgrade to the already semi realistic game that Arma is. It offers more depth, challenge and realism and is seen as a mod for the more hard core fans, or people that like a more difficult game or a more enhancing experience in comparison to the vanilla version. It achieves this by adding little details everywhere such as fainting and ear protection from explosions. Also it adds more difficulty with things like shooting and stamina making the game that one step more realistic.-WasteLand is a scavenge and co-operate game mode in which players must earn money to make and but defences for their team, with a goal of domination and annihilation of the other team and the land around. The last game mode I want to talk about RP civilian life or as it’s now known as 'RPG Life'. This game mode adds a Sims like aspect to the game, as you play a civilian who can live his life normally or he can become a criminal or rebel and fight the police force who are in charge of keeping peace in the country. With trading, working and doing normal things like eating and drinking this game mode is one that will never be the same twice. Now this isn’t a full review of the game so I'll stop at the game modes and not expand any further as I could go on forever, talking about this game. So in short I give this game a 85/100, the reasons?Some Positives:-Has a decent campaign with a whole new approach to how a mission can be done-The multiplayer is and unlimited canvas with almost unlimited potential.-The community is a wide and strong one adding a lot to the game itself.-The Semi-Realism is an enhancing experience that adds on a lot to the game.Some Negatives:-There are a lot of fundamental ideas that are expected to be seen in sandboxes that are missing.-There could have been a lot more things done by the developers than just leaving the community to handle it and where there was support it was usually not in the places needed-There are some really bad flaws in AI and horrible animations that really take away from the game			",60,2,1,2,14,0,9

												Can't review Arma 2 alone idk why lol. Arma 2 is worth $13 if u like a really realistic shooter. The game is really fiddly and hard to play so i don't really like it. Arma 2's dlc is amazing but the base game it self isn't really worth playing. I thought battle field was fiddly but once you play this FWAH. Maybe because i'm a scrub and too used to easy games like C.S and Cod lol. If u can learn well then it's a decent game but get opperation arrowhead expansion for all the mods and stuffs 4/10 For Arma 2Opperation Arrowhead is what u want if you're playing Arma 2. Games like Dayz, Wasteland and Epoc are so fun to play with friends and can still be fun solo. The expansion cost $20 but you'll need the base game as well which can be bought for $25 or $4 with a few extra DLC's. In Operation Arrowhead there are really fun games to play like Epoc, dayz,wasteland and they’re amazing. 6.5/10 idk i just find it hard to play lol can't even fly a heli. For Arma 28/10 Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												I have never played a game quite like this. It is slightly ""clunky"" to play, in tending towards realism, but it manages to pull it off. It's hard to make a sandbox game immersive in my opinion, but nothing makes you feel like you're in a real world like dropping into Chernarus for one mission or another. Definitely not a twitch game, but you can experience what feels like total desolation wandering around the landscape with your rifle, coming across another player only infrequently, making the experience punctuated by panic. Of course everyone mostly bought this for DayZ and that mod is excellent, but I would recommend checking out some fun other basic OA missions like ""Wasteland"" or ""Takistan Life"".

												ARMA II Operation Arrowhead and it's brother, ARMA II, are both fantastic games that, at times, can feel more like a movie then a game. ARMA II can have the most cinematic feeling at times; your squad is wiped out, rescue bird has gone down and you're alone against oncoming swarms of hostile units that want to drag your dead corpse through the street and display your flak as a sign of victory, of have the deafing roar of the A-10 fly above your head and wipe that small town ahead of you to nothing more then a smoldering wreck of adobe and taliban weapon caches.I highly recommend this game to any one seeking a tactical and down to earth take on the modern FPS genre.

												ArmA 2 is the kind of game that was made only for the hardcore military shooter buffs. This game is so challenging and diffcult that it makes Call of Duty and Battlefield look like Angry Birds by comparission. Not everyone will like this game so I only recomended to military buffs and anyone who started playing military shooters back in the late 90's / early 2000's. Remeber the old school Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon, its basically those games on a massive scale. The game pays the greatest attention to details and realism as players must work with their team to complte their objective. Be it the single-player or multiplayer, ArmA 2 is true gift to the hardcore gamer.The exspansion packs / DLCs also add to the longevity of the game and if you could get the entire collection during a Steam sale, do it.

There are servers like Wasteland, Island Life, and a absolute ton of custom maps, I have owned this game for about 2 years now, (July 18th 2012, don't quote me on that) and I am still playing it today, I have a lot more hours but they won't show because I played DayZ on DayZ Commander.

												Having proudly served in the 2nd Royal tank Regiment for 27 years, I came into this game with some reservations. Whilst it is not totally accurate, I don`t think any game can be, the developers have come very close to replicating real word weapons and vehicles. The combat itself is ok, although either the standard SA-805 is not in here, or it is in disguise. Minor niggles aside, I can whole heartedly recommend both this game and the DLC.  I have had, and look forward to many more hours of fun, only this time, if I get shot or killed, I can just start again  lol.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Vanilla game is amazing, both the singleplayer and Multiplayer, but the multiplayer is something unique and extremly fun if you have a group of friends to play with, I mainly bought this for DayZ though, and that is probably on of the best mods I have ever played, the only mod that I think could matc this one is Desert Strike for Battlefield 2 or the reality mod for Battlefield 2 to. But if you now get bored of that you will be able to spend several of hours into the vanilla game of this if you now could stand the realism! Can't wait for Arma 3!			",211,33,3,29,18,1,29

												This is definetly the ultimate MilSim, why? the graphics, modding scene and general fun gameplay and content. Did i mention mods?Seriously this is better than the core game, what's better is that if you own both via combined operations everything merges together which grants you acess to EVERYTHING, it's like when you brought lego minifigures from other sets onto different sets and made crossovers.The voice acting is still cheesy BTW''IM AT GRID ZERO FOUR TWO ZERO.''

												While I'm still not sold on this mainly because I'm not a huge fan of Day-Z, the Arma 2 epoch and overpoch mods are definitely a lot more fun to play than standalone as it transports the game from more of a running simulator into a faster pace environment that allows for more pvp, also the missions vs AI are reasonably fun.

The multiplayer experince is certainly spectacular with the infinite amount of gamemodes you can play, for instance: Takistan Life, Wasteland, Domination, Deathmatch, Armory(V2,V3, Losis 1.5), and many others!!

												     After many months of watching some of my favorite YouTubers play this games extremely popular mod, DayZ, I finally decided to convince one of my friends to buy it and play with me. Our first session was very disappointing because of its clunky controls and glitchy gameplay. We were sad that we wasted our money on it, but decided to give it another shot the following day. After a couple of hours getting use to the controls and figuring things out; we began to love it.      That being said, it has easily turned into one of my favorite games I've played this year. Once you get use to the controls and figure out how to avoid all the glitches it is definitely worth a buy. I would easily recommend you purchasing this game.			",94,15,2,12,16,4,7

												I was selling oil when a 7 year-old demanded I give him my money before he pulled out a snub nosed revolver and shot the tire off my truck. I faked a surrender before punching him in the nose and grabbing the gun. Holding the gun steady, the iron sights positioned with his bald chrome dome right in the center, I said: ""Make my day, punk."" before I delivered a .357 round right in his forehead. As his blood splattered across the hot desert sands I holstered the weapon, walking around to the back of my truck and retrieving a handy tool-kit which I used to replace the flat tire. I drove away from that place, and that fresh corpse, with a tingling satisfaction. Yet, I still felt dissapointment. Why did it always have to come to violence?10/10 Would re-examine the depressing duality of human existence again			",114,5,1,21,20,0,18

It gets better every time I play. Personally, my favorite mode is the Invasion 1944 mod. DayZ is another really good mod for this game also.			",47,2,0,2,0,0,0

												""dayz mod is amazing.game itself is also great once you learn the mechanics."" Heh, that was from 2012, wow.I picked up ARMA II primarily for the DayZ mod, which I kept hearing about on reddit. I eventually watched numerous gameplay videos of it and was captivated by the idea.Later, when I decided to try the rest of the game, I realized how amazing it was, the attention to detail was absolutely remarkable.If you like combat/army simulators (that's simulation, so you aren't going to be running around like in Call of Duty destroying everyone by yourself arcade-stylle), intense squad-based gameplay, realistic combat (bullet drop, zeroing your sights, etc), and challenging gameplay, then you will love ARMA II.The aesthetics are fantastic, so much so that you are strongly advised to run the benchmark missions (yes, it comes with benchmark missions) to see how it will run on your PC, and during different scenarios (moving, firefights, explosions, etc). The music and sounds are stellar - with enough practice, you can actually tell what type of weapon was fired, and the approximate distance. You'll even be able to differentiate the different model types with enough experience.The controls take some time to get used to. You do a lot of micromanaging with your mouse - to refill ammo you will need to open your backpack then manually chamber the new magazine. Pack management is grid based, so you will need to make sure that each item actually fits into your pack. The learning curve is moderate to very difficult if you are not familiar with combat/war simulators, and playing the tutorials is strongly advised (if not mandatory) if you expect to understand how to play the game.The gameplay is incredible! Mod support is very strong, and I recommend you check out the available selection for the particular mods that fit with the playstyle you desire (many make the game even more realistic, as if it weren't realistic enough). There are vehicles you can use, and many intro missions allow you to test the different factions, vehicles, and equipment. The story is pretty good, with lots of variety in free missions. There is a mission I play over and over again that is extremely expansive - you are tasked with taking over the majority of the map. As commander of the mission, you can build structures (like more barracks, weapon emplacements) and hire reinforcements (purchase vehicles, recruit snipers, commando teams) to help you achieve your goal. As you succeed in liberating different areas, you will be awarded with more cash.The reason why I play this mission over and over again is because it is really fun and there are countless ways for you to proceed through the mission (you can attack different areas, and with different army set ups). Another reason why I play this particular mission over and over again is because I keep dying by the second major firefight I get into. The game is extremely challenging, even for seasoned gamers.Overall, if you like difficult scenarios and realistic combat, you must give this game a chance. The DayZ mod is a nice bonus. Highly recommend!			",250,87,0,51,38,2,49

												Arma 2: OA is a wonderful military simulator, boasting tons of fantastic mods. DayZ has fueled Arma 2, allowing it to rise up into popularity and giving people a look at the sim. Though, sure, you can buy Arma 2 just for the DayZ mod or Wasteland, but Arma 2 can hold itself up on its own, with the mods that base themselves around it being nice little bonuses that keep you from running out of content.The engine's core issues do detract from this. The game is easy to run on singleplayer, but multiplayer is rather taxing. The engine doesn't utilize your resources that well, which doesn't result in fun. Though I can mess around on anything vanilla Arma 2 at very high with a steady and smooth framerate, modded multiplayer gamemodes appear to completely wreck the FPS even at low, which is what prevented me from playing DayZ. Due to this, I played Arma 2: OA and Arma 2 as Armas instead of modding bases, and still had a lot of fun.The gunplay is solid, realistic, and tense. The controls are a bit clunky, and the first person view is annoyingly shakey, but third person holds up (but can easily be exploited.) The AI can be rather stupid at times, and singleplayer is rather harsh, forcing you to restart if you meet your death, but it is rather fun to play missions you pick up from the community or just try some of the base ones, or even make your own.

												I got this standalone for the Invasion 1944 mod.I am a HUGE WW2 game fan but I also love tactical games. This (and Brothers in Arms) are the perfect combination.Anyways, let's get to the actual game, not mods.The game has great gameplay but I was not impressed with the graphics as much. The graphics are OK for the time, but not only did the first Call of Duty have better graphics than this, but Arma 3 had better graphics for 2013, like, BY FAR.You may see the time I have played the game and I know it isn't much. It's just 6.9 hours at the moment. That's because though video games may be very important to me, I'm just gonna say it, I'm not one of those addicts that play 1,000 hours in the first few months of the game being out. Anyways, overall, I'd rate it a 7.9/10.			",110,10,1,8,7,0,2

Obviously i think that this game is worth it considering i have that many hours playing it.**see my page for pictures of me playing island life**Thanks.			",50,9,0,5,13,0,3

DayZ made this game how it is today, if DayZ didn't exist, then i don't think arma 3 would ether.DayZ is the main reason some players have purchased these games. i would defently recomend that you download DayZ and buy arma 2 and operation Arrow head ASAP, because DayZ isn't a bad mod, it allows players to play an almost endless gameplay of fun and anger. so this review isn't telling you about how good this game is, it's telling you to buy Arma 2 and arrow head to support the Arma team and also download DayZ to get the most fun out of Arma games as you can.

												ARMA II is a spectacular mil-sim that's all about tactics and strategy, running and gunning won't get you far here. This game features a wide variety of firearms, big and small, as well as vehicles and aircaft that can really change the tide of battle. ARMA focuses on representing it's wide assortment of toys accurately, you will find a level of detail here that is uncommon in most other shooters. That being said, it does not achieve full simulation of most things. You could probably find more accurate car characteristics in a racing game, and better aircraft simulation in a dedicated flight-sim game. It doesn't matter though, the combines arms feeling this game creates will make you feel like you're in a real battlefield.If there was one thing I had to complain about, it would have to be the 'feel' of moving and aiming. To me, everything feels very clunky and tougher than it should be. If you like a tactical experience of a battlefield, get this game. It really shines, in a small squad with your friends breaching a house, or in a huge battle in a city, this game is great for all aspects of war. My recommendation: Join/host a game of domination or insurgency with a group of friends, both are very fun experiences that my buddies and I couldn't stop playing for hours.

												ArmA II: OA is a great game which when put together with ArmA II to make ArmA II: Combined Operations can cover all the weaknesses OA had when compared to ArmA II.Though the game takes a bit of dedication to get comfortable with, once you get used to the control system it has a massive amount to offer. It has a massive choice of weapons, vehicles and troops, along with having Combined Operations you have access to two massive maps (Takistan 164 km2 and Chernarus is 225 km2), one desert and one in a forested country.Apart from the games vanilla mechanics is the massive modding community surrounding ArmA II. These can change the game in massive ways as well as add to them. Everything from DayZ, a zombie survival, to ACE, Adding new sounds, items, vehicles and mechanics to increase the realism and plausibility of game mechanics, such as first aid.After experiencing the vanilla game and maybe a modded version which is all multiplayer friendly with servers scailing over 100 slots which run smooth, you can go into the games editor which allows you to create fully scripted missions with or without mods, with a user friendly interface that lets you make simple missions, test them and make them instantly multiplayer.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes simulators or squad based shooters, though it would depend on how comfortable with mouse and keyboard they are as a gamepad just wont work with this. make sure to pick it up in a sale as you can buy ArmA II and ArmA II: OA which gives you content from both in one, for a stupidly cheap price for a game which you can easily spend hundreds of hours on.

												Arma 2:OA is one of the better games of our time. Although clunky, the game provides a great military-sim experience. A great deal of Arma's success is probably due to the widely popular mod, DayZ. Although DayZ takes the fame, there are dozens of other flushed out mods, such as BattleRoyal and Wasteland that have a large population. It is also relatively simple to create your own custom game or mod using the editing tools that are provided within the game. The game also features a series of campaigns that are worth your time. Overall, I would highly recommend this game, especially if one is a little bit hesitant on the price tag for Arma 3.			",56,9,0,2,15,1,5

												Most likely the most rivetting mod (day z) ever made. This game is a sheer catalyst for immagination for coders and scripters. I've sunk most of my hours into Epoch servers and they've given me what I've wanted from survival/sandbox shooters. It takes time to develop skills and understand everything from general AI and zombie behaviours to the sound of a gun and being able to tell approximately how far the ♥♥♥♥ers are away from you. I started PVP and ended up in PVE because the community has ruined the hero/bandit aspect. To get a good idea and to study up, I suggest watching frankieonpcin1080p on youtube (fanboy, sorry). He and Jack will show you how to play in a comfortable and entertaining way. Do me one favor if you buy this game though, GIVE IT TIME! Have patience and you shall enjoy.			",92,3,10,14,8,0,10

												This is going to be a not so informative review of Arma 2.The game itself is a fun game, and has a lot of realistic elements to it, as it should to fit the simulator category. I heavily enjoyed it for that purpose and also the fact that it was heavily moddable to create a unique community filled with plenty of games to play. There is just one problem that was very very much so of a problem within this game; The game's Engine. The engine that makes this game run is absolutely terrible, it's incrediblyt clunky, and extremely unoptimized, even though this game is made when it was, it still can struggle to run on high end PC's of today in 2014. This game is almost un runnable without launch parameters. Other than that, this game is definitely a recommended game of mine, very fun, very clunky.			",80,2,1,7,3,1,3

												This really isn't a review on Op Arrowhead, as much as DayZ Mod. It's awesome, and I am starting to see Standalone catch up. Of course, it's nowhere near it YET. The mod I feel takes a lot of work to be able to really enjoy your stay on a server. I wish they hadn't gotten rid of DayZ Origins, because that was the version I loved the most. Anyway, reccomended ONLY if you have friends to play with.			",85,7,0,5,6,1,6

												Okay let me start off by saying I have many more hours of gametime than listed above and experience in other ArmA games in the series.  I originally bought this game mainly for Dayz but quickly realized this game has extremely unique and untapped potential in its singleplayer and other vanilla multiplayer modes if you are patient enough to learn how to play them. This game is everything in one a military simulator, ♥♥♥♥ around and troll simulator, building and management, player crafting, open world exploring, mass vehicle battles, zombie apocalypse survival, you name it. This game will give you a unique experience everytime no matter how many hours you place into this you can make friends, have amazing friendships, and betray them and steal everything they love within minutes. Drive around, kidnap innocent people, make them undress, and then shoot them in the legs forcing them to crawl to survival while they get eaten alive by zombies. What's not to love? 10/10 most realistic and unrealistic simulator ever, best to play with a couple of friends. But be wary of strangers you meet, they may shoot you and steal your baked beans. Protect your beans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really good Military Simulator. there are tons of guns, armaments, objects, etc. you can use to create whatever kind of situation you see fit. like rebels stealing NATO supplies, or US marines taking over Russian FOBs. plus this game has tons of mods, including the infamous ACE/ACRE mod and the ever popular DayZ mod. gamespy might be shutting down next month, but this game will be ever so strong in the Multiplayer department. besides the mods, there are tons of realism units out there, like th 15th MEU and the JTF207, there's a clan out there for everyone. and if you arent into clan based dealings, maybe you could try your hand at an Role Playing server? there are different kinds of RP Life servers on ArmA 2 OA, such as the common Chernarus and Takistan life servers, to ones such as City Life RP and TCG RP servers. like the realism units, there's a community for everyone. the greatness of this game is that you have the freedom to do what ever you want, how you want it, and when you want it.

ARMA II can have the most cinematic feeling at times; your squad is wiped out, rescue bird has gone down and you're alone against oncoming swarms of hostile units that want to drag your dead corpse through the street and display your flak as a sign of victory, of have the deafing roar of the A-10 fly above your head and wipe that small town ahead of you to nothing more then a smoldering wreck of adobe and taliban weapon caches.I highly recommend this game to any one seeking a tactical and down to earth take on the modern FPS genre.

												Lets look at a game that was sitting in the back of the war on Call of Duty and Battlefield. With all of the first person shooters out there this is one of the best ones out there. This is one of the best first person shotters because of the realism that goes into this game. From cars,to wildlife,gunfights,and massive worlds this game is one of the most detailed games out there.And for the zombie lovers theres Day Z. A massive multiplayer mod for Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead the player must survive and gather what they need to survive. There are also other players out there to kill you. Some friendly and some bloodthirsty it will keep you playing for hours.			",43,5,0,6,7,2,2

												Pros: It is fun, realistic, and very moddable. Controls, once you set them up how you like, are easy. Single player was interesting, but most of the entertainment in the game comes from multilayer. There aren't many servers [other than DayZ] still running, but with a few mods and a good server, you can have all the fun you want.Cons: The game requires some background into the series, otherwise it might take some time getting use to. Graphics are alright, but I usually run on low-normal to keep the FPS at 60. aside from that, its a fun game.10/10 would crash a C-130 into a car for revenge again.			",56,2,0,1,3,0,9

												first off, this game isn't popular for what it is. DayZ made this game how it is today, if DayZ didn't exist, then i don't think arma 3 would ether.DayZ is the main reason some players have purchased these games. i would defently recomend that you download DayZ and buy arma 2 and operation Arrow head ASAP, because DayZ isn't a bad mod, it allows players to play an almost endless gameplay of fun and anger. so this review isn't telling you about how good this game is, it's telling you to buy Arma 2 and arrow head to support the Arma team and also download DayZ to get the most fun out of Arma games as you can.

												An amazing game that I have sunk so many hours into, this game is the height of FPS and FPS-Strategy, this Military Simulator offers many modes, missions and it's own editor.Modes - The main modes are:Campaign - The main ARMA 2 campaign with additional DLC campaigns, you can also input player-made campaigns into this by pasting them into the folder.Missions - Random missions that can either be played in singleplayer with AI or multiplayer with some mates, the developers were so generous to include scripted missions to show off the potential of the editor, even the campaign was made with the editor!Editor - Probrally the best thing about the game, the in-game editor, a VERY simple layout of the map where you can plot units, vehicles, buildings, groups, etc and give them objectives, or if you're proficent, scripts. The editor utilizes everything about the game and is A LOT of fun, you can make huge battles, EVAC missions, training missions, anything you can think off!Gamemodes - There are a variety of gamemodes that're imputted into the game, the main one is CTI (Capture the Island), however, there are many player made ones, such as Takistani Life, Domination, Wasteland and many more.ARMA 2 OA is a amazing game offering a endless amount of possibities and is why I have sunk over 300 hours onto it, it is a great game and is so unique, unlike many FPS shooters these days... *cough* Call of Duty *cough* It's cheap, it's fun and if you can break through the learning curve, you'll LOVE this game! 10/10 - True game of the decade!

												The surprise hit of the year, due to the DayZ mod.  A three year old game with graphics that surprisingly, can hold its own against more modern games.  Some minor annoying engine problems.  Slower, more methodical movements may annoy twitch gamers used to traditional shooters.  But this game is geared to be more of a simulation than a shooter.  Play with an open mind and imagination and you might not be disappointed.  If you just want to shoot and kill stuff this might not be for you.			",398,131,10,69,47,6,83

												Pros: 1) Feels like a military simulation game ,not another CoD or BF clone.         2) Hundreds of different mods. You can find Vietnam,WW2,Korean War,Afghanistan and Iraq  mods.You name it.         3) Multiplayer is a life experience. Join a well organised clan ,experience unique events and scenarios.          4) Active community and lots of well populated servers.         5) The map editor provides absolute freedom on creating your own scenarios.         6) You need the game in order to play the DayZ mods. ( orelse you can buy the DayZ:Standalone) Cons: 1) All of the campaigns in single player .Nothing special about them .          2) Really hard to install the mods manually.          3) Game is getting old . You possibly have to move to Arma 3 within a couple of years.Verdict : One of the best games i ve ever played !			",43,1,0,6,8,0,16

												I got this standalone for the Invasion 1944 mod.I am a HUGE WW2 game fan but I also love tactical games. This (and Brothers in Arms) are the perfect combination.Anyways, let's get to the actual game, not mods.The game has great gameplay but I was not impressed with the graphics as much. The graphics are OK for the time, but not only did the first Call of Duty have better graphics than this, but Arma 3 had better graphics for 2013, like, BY FAR.You may see the time I have played the game and I know it isn't much. It's just 6.9 hours at the moment. That's because though video games may be very important to me, I'm just gonna say it, I'm not one of those addicts that play 1,000 hours in the first few months of the game being out. Anyways, overall, I'd rate it a 7.9/10.			",110,10,1,8,7,0,2

												Hello, my name is Jack Hollows. I started playing this game, and truly didn't like it, but later on I saw the true character of the game. There are a variety of servers on Arma 2:OA. For example, Island Life. Island Life is a theme used for RP within the Arma 2: OA community. The game is very fun, and I recommend buying it. Also Arma 3 is out, so if you want to try out both then BUY THEM BOTH!			",22,0,0,0,3,0,0

												This really isn't a review on Op Arrowhead, as much as DayZ Mod. It's awesome, and I am starting to see Standalone catch up. Of course, it's nowhere near it YET. The mod I feel takes a lot of work to be able to really enjoy your stay on a server. I wish they hadn't gotten rid of DayZ Origins, because that was the version I loved the most. Anyway, reccomended ONLY if you have friends to play with.			",85,7,0,5,6,1,6

												I know this is not Arma II, but normal Arma II wont let me write a review. Arma is a Great Game, one of the best warfare games out there. For new players this game is no call of duty, its only 100 times better and more realistic. For you battlefield vets, you might feel a little more comfortable, but do not be mistaken this game is hard as s***. Everything is realistic, bullet drop, weapon accuracy, anniexty attacks, aiming after sprinting. My biggest advice is COVER and PAITENCE.  If you want to succed, you need to understand the aiming and then waiting it out and choosing the right positions and stances for you and your team is key to not dying over and over and over and over and over. The Story Is Great, the main storyline takes you on a trip of Razor team a UNSC recon squad. Memebers Sergant Miles, Sergant Cooper, Sergant Skypes, Sergant Brian, and Sergant Rodriguez. They are part of the USA invasion force of Chernarus in efforts to pervent an evil Cherno force from over throwing the government. Decisions and failures affect the outcome, Thats right this game has 3 endings. How you play is up to you, Chernarus's future lies in your hands. Failure to stop so will lead to the destruction of Chernarus or Russian complete domination of the region. Will you save the country or doom it? I give this game a 9.5 out of 10. The only reason why i don't give it a perfect 10 is AI are dumb sometimes and that normal Arma II has no more Servers to play normal Warface or annex or things like that. The DLC for this game is great for the most part, I highly recommend Operation Arrowhead, the dlc runs 10 times smoother on the new map and you can play normal Arma II on it. It is smooth offers a brand new map and tons of new weapons, tanks, and helis and cars. The story it has is kinda bland, but offers a fun new cool story. It offers a brand new multiplayer. There are some servers for normal warfare still running, but full servers are hard to come by for normal Conquest as I call it. Most people are friendly and team work is highly encouraged. Dont be stupid and you might make new friends. DayZ is also Extremely great, but I will write a entire review for that later, but with the stand alone out fewer normal DayZ servers are out and the modded servers are just filled with douches and bandits who have no honor. It is survival horror people, you should survive and Roleplaying only makes it ten times greater. I hope to see some of you out there on Arma II and DayZ. So what are you waiting for, Buy this game and see what lies in store for you. See you on the battlefield.			",42,1,0,1,2,0,1

												Arma 2: OA is a wonderful military simulator, boasting tons of fantastic mods. DayZ has fueled Arma 2, allowing it to rise up into popularity and giving people a look at the sim. Though, sure, you can buy Arma 2 just for the DayZ mod or Wasteland, but Arma 2 can hold itself up on its own, with the mods that base themselves around it being nice little bonuses that keep you from running out of content.The engine's core issues do detract from this. The game is easy to run on singleplayer, but multiplayer is rather taxing. The engine doesn't utilize your resources that well, which doesn't result in fun. Though I can mess around on anything vanilla Arma 2 at very high with a steady and smooth framerate, modded multiplayer gamemodes appear to completely wreck the FPS even at low, which is what prevented me from playing DayZ. Due to this, I played Arma 2: OA and Arma 2 as Armas instead of modding bases, and still had a lot of fun.The gunplay is solid, realistic, and tense. The controls are a bit clunky, and the first person view is annoyingly shakey, but third person holds up (but can easily be exploited.) The AI can be rather stupid at times, and singleplayer is rather harsh, forcing you to restart if you meet your death, but it is rather fun to play missions you pick up from the community or just try some of the base ones, or even make your own.

												Allow me to tell you a story about one of my many DAYZ experiences.I was an experienced, well equipped and ruthless bandit settled down in the northwestern region of Chernarussia on my favorite Epoch server. I was camping a medical mission, ever so carefully scanning the treeline with the scope mounted on my Designated Marksman Rifle. Just as I was about to give in and depart back to my base, I saw a rather distraught, careless Bambi wandering through the treeline I had been scanning. At the time, I was situated in a grouping of thick bushes, wearing a ghillie suit to camouflage me from anyone who dared to oppose me. I grinned, thinking that with one left click I could drop another pathetic Bambi, adding another murder to my endless list. I was about to do just that, when the Bambi turned, and looked straight at me. He stopped dead in his tracks, a look of regret and fear painted over his face. He held only a 5.56 mm M4A1 in his grasp, and wore the default spawn model. For the first time in my bandit experience, I felt sympathy. I felt like there was more meaning to this game than to mindlessly kill fellow survivors. My heart dropped when I realized that I had carelessly murdered hundreds of others like him. It was this moment I had decided to muster up the little humanity left in my heart, and spare the poor fellow. I felt good about my decision. I stood up, grinning ear to ear. I mashed the Q and E keys on my keyboard, indicating I was friendly. And then suddenly, a gunshot rang out, the bullet whizzing right passed my ear. I stood there in disbelief. The Bambi's gun was smoking, his face detirmed, filled with stupidity and bloodthirst.Except he was playing on a♥♥♥♥♥♥machine that granted him most likely a pathetic 10 FPS. I chuckled to myself, and blasted the sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s brains onto the trees behind him.One more Bambi added to my list. He was among much more to come in the future. It was worth tho cus he had mtn dew on him that sold for a hefty one 10oz gold my nig			",91,2,0,5,5,0,3

												I haven't played too much just yet, but I definitely can see that this is an amazing game, quite nicely replicating that military feel. Get ambushed, prepare an ambush, drop support, rain hail after hail of artillery shells, build a base, buy tons of weapons, tons of units, explore massive maps, work as a team with your allies, and face brutal and sudden deaths. Fly attack helicopters, get rammed while flying by another plane/heli, drive a tank, command massive squads, snipe and firefight all with realistic bullet drop, and more. Go nightvision, parachute out of a plane, get pinned down, run out of ammo, get utterly slaughtered. 15/10 Role-Playable-good and spot on.You'll find the best experience on an up-to-date computer with decent performance characteristics.

												During a sale, you can get the complete edition with the core game with all its DLCs for $8 CAD. There are many things you can do in this game such as: DayZ, Life Servers, Escape, Capture the Island/Warfare, and many other types of games. There are many communities and clans where you can make friends. I reccomend this game for the cheap price and the amount of content it can pack.			",115,6,2,14,7,0,9

												The game itself + the dayz mod makes this game a must buy in my book verry realistic army thurd or first person shooter and the dayz mod is a great way to play... It makes the game into an awesome zombie servival shooter where you can collect parts and build car's/ helicopters, and try to servive by finding food water ammo and med supplies all while trying to avoid gitting eaten or shot in an ever changeing envirnment with a risk vs reward system that sets this mod appart from anything ive seen in a long time but be careful though because your not the olny one trying to servive the zombies and they might not be as forgiveing as the zombies are... I meen if zombies were forgiveing :P 10/10Note: the dayz mod is on a presistant timeclock that is set to the timezone the server is located in what this meens is if you log into a server thats hosted out of the US it may be pich black and you will have to use torches to see anything good luck with that....

Mods on this game make Arma 2 DayZ Mod Amazing. The mods are different maps and differents weapons in those maps. Personally i enjoy DayZ namalsk, DayZ epoch, DayZ Overwatch, and Obviously DayZ Lingor. This game really lets to experience to survival and military survival playthrough. Some Maps have missions, and some just let you roam around and gather supplies. One goal, Survive or be eaten. Dont allways think zombies are the only people to watch out for. People, they are comming and they are everywhere!The Game: 10/10My game: 9/10 Because of the lag on my bad computer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played OFP ( still do ) for hours and hours, online, offline, modded or Vanilla. Back in those days i was amazed by the immersion and realism ( as in how hard it actually is to hit targets while running for your life ) and the well though off storyline. Then came ARMA ( still play that too ) and ARMA II and graphics improved, AI got better and a whole new world opened with addons like ACE and a diversity of vehicles and units ( even our proud Dutch army is modded...wich makes me proud as i served there for 15 years ). So, the Pro's :Modding is almost endless...annything you might want, it's there...It looks and feels nice, but on older systems you will have to trade looks for performance because it's a heavy game!Con's :The campaign is virtually unplayable, buggs and triggers / scripts that don't work can make your game feel incomplete.It's NOT an ARCADE type, Battlefield, COD shooter...there's a steep learning curve for firsttimers.Conclusion :Is it worth buying? Hell YES it is! If you like tactical and full immersive online war, this is your thing.			",24,1,0,6,11,0,2

												The game itself + the dayz mod makes this game a must buy in my book verry realistic army thurd or first person shooter and the dayz mod is a great way to play... It makes the game into an awesome zombie servival shooter where you can collect parts and build car's/ helicopters, and try to servive by finding food water ammo and med supplies all while trying to avoid gitting eaten or shot in an ever changeing envirnment with a risk vs reward system that sets this mod appart from anything ive seen in a long time but be careful though because your not the olny one trying to servive the zombies and they might not be as forgiveing as the zombies are... I meen if zombies were forgiveing :P 10/10Note: the dayz mod is on a presistant timeclock that is set to the timezone the server is located in what this meens is if you log into a server thats hosted out of the US it may be pich black and you will have to use torches to see anything good luck with that....

												One of the reasons to why i built myself a computer, was that Arma 2 was only available on PC. Arma II Operation Arrowhead is what i would describe as the best Mil Sim that is commerically available. Released in 2010, Operation Arrowhead expanded the features of Arma II and enhanced the game a lot. Instead of playing in Chernarus, a new map, Takistan was introduced to the Mix. A combination of Dunes, Settlements and Airbases is what made this map special for me. Honestly, Most of my time was spent on the mission editior, just making new scenarios for my friends when we would play multiplayer. You have to have a basic understanding of programming in order to make Fluid and Fun mission, as the Mission editor does not hold your hand, it throws you out into the big world, where you either consult forums or learn by trial and error. In regards to gameplay, the game feels right, the game world can be very dynamic. Vehicals and Weapons is what really makes the game here. There are over 300 weapons (including Variations) and 80 Vehicles. The Vehicles handle nicely, and weapons feel authentic, except for the gunfire sounds. Squad interaction and Commanding is a big thing in the game, and it works very well, the AI will move stealthily, hide, and ambush on your command. Moving on, The Graphics are nothing spectacular, but they are not bad either, mostly the textures and lighting are a bit dodgy. Another problem is that the game is not very well optimised, so AA and ATOC will drop your frame rate by a lot unless you have a high end card. Apart from those issues, the graphics are okay. There is a campaign in the game, however, it is seldom played through to my knowledge. But the campaign is solid, nothing special to it, and not to forget that the voice acting is quite frankly, terrible. Finally, the main reason to why people love this game, is the Multiplayer. Servers can handle up to 100+ players, and many of these servers often have an emphasis on millitary simulation, so you have the full package; Real tactics, Radio Chatter, and team play. The multiplayer world is also a bit unforgiving, as it can happen that you play for 20 minutes and not encounter a single enemy, and as soon as you encounter your eney, he kills you in one shot. well, such is warfare. I recommend this game to millitary enthusiats and people who want to play a realistic team based gameGameplay: 9/10Campaign: 5/10Graphics:   6/10Multiplayer: 10/10P.S There are thousands of mods for this game			",145,15,7,18,29,0,24

												Writing this post DayZ SA release. I get the feeling that the mod will be popular for a good while yet since the standalone just isn't quite there yet and people enjoy mods like Epoch and things the SA doesn't have so there's that still. Apart from that, the game is amazing. It has a steep learning curve but if you can stick with it and get past that, the game is too good. The map(s) are huge and Chernarus in particular is something special. The amount of different game modes (excluding DayZ variations) is enough to keep you playing for many hundreds, possibly thousands of hours. Game modes go from small 8 player missions to massive 100+ servers / missions. I'm really♥♥♥♥♥♥at trying to say why this is good but there's an attempt.			",126,7,2,17,6,0,32

												Ok so reviewing Arma 2 OA. Well its a really good game you can have a ton of fun with friends even solo.The game is  bad only coz you need a good CPU to run it on 30+ FPS.If you ignore small bugs the game if fine.It has a lot of mods to offer from RP mods to Day Z mods with are really fun and there is endless things to do.You can be a bandit but meh almost every one is(WE NEED MORE GOOD  GUYS!) ehem. so yeah ton of fun it goes on sale a lot of the time for under 5$ give it a go.

												One of the most freakin best games I've ever played.  This really realistic game is boss compared to mw1 and all the other games back when this one came out.  Although this game isn't for everyone, if ur really into cod and you actually liked MW3 then your not gonna like this, how ever if you can addapt to this game like I did, you'll probably never play cod again.  This awesome game come's with a ton of game mode's, some of my favorite are Takistan life where you live your life as a civ or a terrorist, or a cop. And domination another one of my favorites.  Definetly think of getting this game, it's not good just because of DayZ.			",103,2,1,4,3,1,13

												I originally bought the game just to play DayZ Epoch, which I can say I loved...I really had no interest in another military first person shooter, I already played enough, the Battlefield series (Great series) , Medal of Honor (Good series) , America's Army (O.K.) and Call of Duty series (Garbage), I know all you CoD fan-boys will hate me for that, but in my opinion it went down hill after Call of Duty 2 . Then the DayZ Epoch server I played on shut down, shortly there after my friend who got me playing, stop playing and went on to other games, and my Arma 2 collections sat un-played.From time to time I would try other DayZ mods and servers, most filled with jerks and hackers...Then I discovered DaiZy a single player mod of DayZ, I started playing again and trying some of the different DaiZy mods available, I was having fun again...that lead to finding other mods for the Arma 2 collection like Day of Survival and a host of others...Now I play DaiZy, DoS and the actual game and I love it.I have to say it's the Best Military First Person Shooter I have ever played, and with all the different mods out there for it and the ability to edit your own missions it has a ton of re-play value!I highly recommend buying the whole Arma 2 collection if you want a in depth Military First Person Shooter with a ton of different way to play!

												Arma 2 is the most amazing game the fact that anything can happen not only in dayz mod but from wasteland to arma life it can be slow paced or fast paced giving you the choice on what you do and how you play it out it puts the control in the players hands it is abit of a homo to set up since things went downhill for the mod with gamespy shutting down but nothing that will make you stop playing cause wasteland and other mission files are always optional giving this game so many ways to be played its like DLC but not paying for it EA should learn from games like this.

												ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead is a great tactical shooter/simulator.But, in order to enjoy the gameplay of ArmA 2: OA you need to be in a group that is set up for your specific needs and you may also want to get certain mods to make the gameplay even better. ArmA 2: Combined Operations has brought thousands of hours of gameplay and is still enjoyable to this day. I recommend if you still play it to find a group and enjoy the game with them. This is not a game where you pick up a sniper rifle and camp or just fly helicopters and crash. There is also loads of mods that bring fun experiences like life servers, ACE mod, DayZmod, etc. Game is a 8/10			",123,7,1,16,5,1,20

												Incredible Game, great graphics and great gameplay. However when I say gameplay please keep in mind that this game is very multiplayer driven. This may not be the game for you if you're not the kind of person who likes to download mod and play on multiplayer servers. The Dayz Mod and Island life Mod are great except for the drama that occurs on the communities but other than that its awesome. Long story short:Pros:-great graphics-great gameplay(Multiplayer driven)-Many endings to the campaign based on decisionscons:-Other than multiplayer there isn't much purpose to get the game-Very prone to crash on packed servers(with weak PC) lag is to be expected regardless of computer specs			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead delievers more nail biting singeplayer missions that brang the full realism into full effect, the multiplayer however, is where the majority of players play at. The main reason for why people bought Arma 2 OA is for Dayz, if you want to play like FrankieonPCin1080p you will find a real shock as those moments are very very rare. This game is all round good and fun to play, but a beast of a pc is needed.			",53,2,0,4,3,1,0

												During a sale, you can get the complete edition with the core game with all its DLCs for $8 CAD. There are many things you can do in this game such as: DayZ, Life Servers, Escape, Capture the Island/Warfare, and many other types of games. There are many communities and clans where you can make friends. I reccomend this game for the cheap price and the amount of content it can pack.			",115,6,2,14,7,0,9

												The game itself + the dayz mod makes this game a must buy in my book verry realistic army thurd or first person shooter and the dayz mod is a great way to play... It makes the game into an awesome zombie servival shooter where you can collect parts and build car's/ helicopters, and try to servive by finding food water ammo and med supplies all while trying to avoid gitting eaten or shot in an ever changeing envirnment with a risk vs reward system that sets this mod appart from anything ive seen in a long time but be careful though because your not the olny one trying to servive the zombies and they might not be as forgiveing as the zombies are... I meen if zombies were forgiveing :P 10/10Note: the dayz mod is on a presistant timeclock that is set to the timezone the server is located in what this meens is if you log into a server thats hosted out of the US it may be pich black and you will have to use torches to see anything good luck with that....

												Pros:Ultra-Realistic Combat when playing with the right people. Resembles helmet-cam combat footage from Iraq.Higher Settings = better FPS for some people, somehow. Realistic sounds and visuals. Realistic uniforms and diversity in different militaries around the world. A bright and creative modding community. Class diversity. Cons:Few available servers. 90% Modded servers (Lookin at you DayZ) Occasional bad FPSNearly Pointless classesThe opportunity to Run & Gun COD-style is still present. Lack of variety in weapons (made up for by the detail and variety in types of weapons. Example: About 13 different Ak's)You bought Arma II? Congrats!

												Oh... Where do I start? Arma II OA is more than a game, its better than a masterpeice, its just bloody brilliant and that dosent begin to describe how much there is to this game. With thousands of mods, thousands of missions, and thousands of players, Arma II OA never gets boring, it does the complete opposite and gets more exciting. To get the full experience of this game is just completely impossable, you will never take this game to its full capabilitys, its just that big and in-depth, this game just keeps making its self keep going. Just bloody brilliant			",80,4,4,3,7,0,9

												Arma 2 OA is a great game all around. It's a bit buggy, and the graphics are not exactly stunning, but it is realistic and fun, if you know where to look. The Level Editor is fun to mess around with (think 500 vehicles and helis and planes fighting in a desert filled with chickens) and the single missions (scenarios) contain lots of content, too. The campaigns are lengthy and are diverse. Downloadable content is available, adding even more replayability. Of course, you can't forget that the DayZ Mod requires Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA. The multiplayer is largely unused, since DayZ is what the large majority of the players do with Arma 2. I would highly recommend this to anyone with any sort of FPS interests, and especially if you are interested in zombies games, due to the DayZ mod			",73,5,1,5,5,0,8

												This game is amazing. It still has many bugs like glitchy atvs and the multiplayer screen crashes a lot. But its still worth its money. I will give a little log of my first takistan life as an independent. We had a group of 4 people.1. We get DksHm armored car and start our drive to Rasman.2. We encounter a pmc patrol. losses: 13. We get to rasman and leave a after there being a report of a large pmc group in the area.4. North Takistan is declared to be under martial law.5. We drive to the bank on the west edge of rasman.6. We wait till night and rob the bank.7. While we are robbing bank we are ambushed by pmcs. losses: 2 (including me)8. The last man tries to run but gets ambushed again by an army partrol.

It requires teamwork and since the damage is realistic, you get a sense of acclompishment when you finally take someone down.			",51,5,1,0,5,1,4

												Very great game if you like War. It's very awesome that the game has Autopilot Landing. Helps to land a lot.The guns and phsyics are pretty good.The planes don't have very good physics at all. In fact, the plane physics suck and it's the thing I hate the most about this game. If you are taking off, and you barely touch a car or helicopter (that is on the right of the runway) with your wing, your plane will just turn to the right and be stuck until the server restarts or your reset your singleplayer world.It is pretty fun to mess around in the Editor.Driving with cars, is very awesome. It's one of the things I love to do most when I'm bored. The camera movement is pretty realistic. I love it.The running looks pretty dumb, to be honest. Jumping is not so bad, but the only problem is that there is only one way that he jumps. Very well made game. I like it a lot.			",28,5,2,1,8,1,2

												After being a fan favorite, from my early childhood, this game has truly tested time.With amazing sounds, graphics, and combat, it felt too real for 2010. From the aminious forests and valleys in the northern sectors, to the barren fields where you expect an entire army to start firing at you, this game immerses and involves you.As well, as being home to coop domination, team deathmatch, and more, Arma 2/Arma 2 OA brought and sustained one of its best, FREE, modded expansionsDrumroll please.........DAYZ!Featuring a new way to play, with scavenging, surviving and adapting, Dayz brought a whole new aspect to the Arma environment. Whereas before, you would ignore enemy weapons, explosives and clothing, you now needed to loot and make sure you had enough bullets, food and supplies for any situation...Whereas before, you'd be dissapointed you'd died, and have to respawn at base or restart the mission, Dayz stressed, and panicked you. If you died, you would probably lose your gear forever, lost in the Coyote Backpack of that ghilie bandit at Sniper Hill. Additionally, the game branched out and expanded tremendously out of Vanilla Dayz.Modders added bases (my favorite), new guns/sounds, new maps, new vehicles, a new economy system, and SO MUCH MORE!If a game truly has the best modding community, it's Arma.I hope, that Bohemia continues to create and enhance the Arma experience, in future installments and updates, fixing glitches and annoyances, like physics, destruction, medical treatments, and more.But if you can get a group of 2-3 friends, get in a group chat, and load up this game, it will amaze you with a brilliantly crafted, Tactial masterpiece.Arma 2/ Arma 2 OA: 9.5/10			",106,4,0,2,8,1,3

												First off, this game is one of the greatest experiences I've had on PC since I got into Steam a few years ago.  The development, game play, realism, and everything about this game just makes it a great milsim, whether hardcore or amateur.  This is a great way to experience realistic combat in a danger-filled middle eastern theater environment.  Anyone looking to get into milsims, or just want to learn about true combat the way it is should DEFINITELY consider this game as something to have in your library.			",25,4,1,2,7,0,4
