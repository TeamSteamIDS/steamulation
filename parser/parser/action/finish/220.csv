Classic shooter nearly ten years oldIt might seem weird to dedicate a review to a game that came out on november 16th, 2004. Still, Half-Life 2 is no ""ordinary"" game. Even before it's release, it was the most talked about, and surely most anticipated game up till then. Back in 2004, Valve was still primarily a game-developer, Steam had only just been launched in order to streamline the updating-process for the Valve-games (quite an original and ground-breaking idea since back in those day patching one's game could easily turn into a hazardous adventure). Immediately after its release, Half-Life 2 was loaded with critical praise, and almost instantly rose to the top of all lists defining the best games ever. And even today, after ten years, it still tops a lot of those lists.I played it for the first time only five years ago, messing around with the original Half-Life up till then. Five years ago, the game struck me as still very good-looking and a blast to play, even being five years old. Quite recently I picked it up again, to be honest in the first place to get some of the achievements I had missed during my first play-through (I only got really interested in the Steam achievements this year). To my surprise, the game immediately got back under my skin, so I decided to give it another play-through, and I enjoyed it immensely, hence this review.Of course the Source Engine shows its age: up-close textures get quite blurry, but the wider vistas are still amazingly ""alife"", and the colours and general atmosphere are still exciting. The physics engine - a novelty back then - now surely feels outdated, even crappy, but playing around with the famous ""gravity gun"" makes more than up for this, and surely has its funny moments. But in every other respect, this game is a classic and a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. The story is so convincingly told, that I felt myself beeing ""Doctor Freeman"" again, already during the first chapter (which introduces the gameworld in a very ingenious way which has not been surpassed ever since). The level-design is simply awesome. Compared to modern-day shooters, the interface and the amount of information about the surroundings you get as a player, are minimal. There is no minimap, there are no waypoints, there is no compass, there is no large-scale map. And still, I never ever got lost, thanks to the downright genial way the levels are designed. Still, the amount of freedom you get is great: there are tons of hidden places, byways, or larger spaces to explore, besides the more traditional corridors, but they always manage to lead you in a logical way. This game offers the classic examples on how levels can be optimally designed.Sound, too, is amazing: there is not much in-game music, but when it appears (mostly in the action-packed scenes), it really delivers to the full. Sounds from the guns, NPC's and ambient sounds are extremely convincing. But what still shines most of all is the actual gameplay and the way this games is ""paced"". Sneaky, almost stealth-like scenes alternate with extremely violent action-moments, in a very, very clever way, only to be alternated with puzzles and other moments where thinking is required. The choice of the right gun at the right time is essential, and very rewarding. There is a lot of interaction with other characters, but never up till the point where this gets tedious. And best of all: there are countless moments of surprise, when the story takes a turn for the unexpected. So, yes, this is still a classic, and yes, it's still up there among the best games ever (although I personally would grant it a top-five place or so, the top-three spots taken by more recent ""classics"").For my scorings, I give them as I conceived the game during my actual playthrough, so not taking into account it's a ten year old game.Gameplay: 27/30 (there are some frustrating puzzles and some weird moments with the gravity-gun but everything else is sheer genius)Grahics: 15/20 (the outer vistas are great, the rest is showing its age)Sound: 9/10Longelivety: 8/10 (no multiplayer, but the game has tons of singleplayer gameplay)Steam integration: 10/10 (it comes with trading cards and 33 achievements, most of which really add something to game, if only to explore different ways to achieve things - the way achievements should work imo)Technical: 9/10 (runs very smoothly and I got no crashes, but sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds on loading screens)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall: 88/100			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.Half Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. Half Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.The game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. For a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.The game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.The game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.Apart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. In the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.I experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.Final Rating:9.5/10 -  A Must own and must playIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Half-Life 2 takes a minimilist approach to story development, but delivers a rich, atmospheric, and engaging world that sucks you right in. Combined with novel gameplay elemetns (one of the first mainstream games to make proper use of physics in gameplay), an ensemble of likeable characters—topped off with the much loved Alyx Vance, and well paced combat, this helps to make Half-Life 2 an all-time classic.

NOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Half-Life (1) ReviewHalf-Life: Opposing Force ReviewHalf-Life: Blue Shift ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewTL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Software (Corporation) and is a sequel to the extremely popular and revolutionary 1998 game Half-Life. Half-Life 2 was originally released back in 2004 and was then boasting the newly developed, highly flexible and powerful Source Engine, it then became an instant classic by making good use of new technology, excellent storytelling, gameplay mechanics and an unrivaled online experience. Alongside its predecessor, both games left a lasting impression, particularly on the FPS genre, as an industry standard for future FPS games to come.PLOT (No Spoilers):Half-Life 2 puts the player once more behind the thick-framed bulletproof glasses of Gordon Freeman, an MIT Graduate of Theoretical Physics with an uncanny ability to wield military hardware and the person indirectly responsible for opening a portal to an alien world and exposing Earth to an invasion that is to be known as the 'Black Mesa Incident'. Half-Life 2 is set 20 years after the events of Half-Life 1 and the world is now under the full control of the 'Combine', an interdimensional empire that is currently harvesting the natural resources of Earth including the human race which is now close to extinction.PROS:+ Graphics and artstyle that looks just as good as it is now (2015), as it was eleven years ago (2004).+ Excellent sequel with an excellent story that expands the Half-Life Universe+ Excellent memorable supporting characters such as Alyx Vance+ Great sound quality, facial animation, and voice acting adds to the immersive experience+ Excellent enemy AI+ Great level and environment designs but...(see CON #1)+ Fun gunplay and gameplay mechanics+ Good selection of weapons and equipment with very creative special abilities (Gravity Gun)+ Atmospheric with excellent use of lighting, sound effects and environment design+ Challenging difficulties+ Expanded levels that give some room for exploration, but doesn't destroy the narrative storytelling+ Lengthy game time+ Very affordable price (though I highly recommend the Half-Life Complete pack)+ Multiplayer is still active as far as I can tell+ Tons of available mods that expand player experienceCONS:- Driving section may be a little too long but it does offer a few 'stops' where the player can stretch his leg muscles and trigger finger.- The Squad Support AI is down right suicidal with no command to tell them to stay in place for more than 15 seconds before they follow you again. (This is annoying specially if you're trying to keep them alive against particularly deadly opponents such as Striders)- Rag-doll physics engine can be unrealistically (albeit hilariously) glitchy- No Steam Workshop Support for the multitude of MODS that are available.CONCLUSION:Much like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a MASTERPIECE of a game and is a MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any fan of the first person genre because how else can you describe a game that is almost 11 years old, yet, can still retain all the fun and excitement of a recently released title.WORTH IT?:If you decide to purchase and try this game, I do recommend you purchase Half-Life: Complete so you may also avail of the two Episodes that was subsequently released.FINAL NOTES:Half-Life 2's use of the amazing Source engine reflects on the fact that this game's graphics, despite showing some age, still manages not only to look good, but also to look authentic and atmospheric with its excellent use of sound and music that makes the environment feel alive. Graphics aside, the gameplay has survived for even after a decade and has still not lost its charm. The enemy AI provides an imposing challenge while gunplay and the creative weapons creates one of the most fun and immersive experience you can get on a first-person shooter. Storywise, the Half-Life universe can be considered as one of the most beautifully crafted worlds in gaming history. Half-Life 2 fully emphasizes this point with its amazing and memorable supporting characters that can establish a connection with the player on an emotional level. To recap, Half-Life 2 is the game that once again redefined how modern first-person shooters will be made in the future and remains as the benchmark for good single player FPS gaming experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Im aware this is probably the most reviewed game on Steam, making my own take on this game quite redundant (is there anyone with a unique opinion of HL2, not shared by anyone else? Doubt it).However, i noticed the two best games i got on Steam that i havent reviewed yet happen to be the 2 best FPS's of all time, so here's the first review of the two:Half Life 2 is the role-model for all FPS games ever made:It ""only"" has a singleplayer campaign, but its so well done it doesnt need anything else.- Graphics-wise, know this: it's a 2004 game, i played it on 2010 and not once did i feel they were outdated (then again, im not one of those who care a lot about technical aspects)- Sounds... this is not a type of game where this aspect is very relevant, so i cant recall anything about it really- The Story, even though its not the most original or filled with amazing plot twists, it is still compelling and engaging, making you care about its great characters and what happens next- Gameplay, there's where this game excels. From the now-classic 'no cutscenes / always in control', to the incredible variety of scenarios in each level, each with its own tone and pace, and jam-packed with (this is my favourite aspect of the game...) UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS - seriously, i can recall more than 10 scenes that i'll probably never forget about this game. The weapons are also great, in quantity, diversity and in the fun-factor. The enemies too are varied enough and provide a reasonable challenge (though an higher difficulty level would be great).- The length of the game is also one of the best / longest i've seen in an FPS, though it provides little replay value once finished.Conclusion: Must-play for any gamer out there, to experience a landmark in videogame history, proving again that Valve knows how to make Greatness. Note: Episode 1 and 2 equally recommended to continue the Awesomeness!			",53,11,0,0,3,2,5

												Half-Life 2 is a BLAST to play. Pretty much everything in the game is interactive. You pick up paint cans with the gravity gun and when the can hits, it splatters the object with paint. It always fun to pick up a saw blade and toss it at a creature splitting it in half. If its there you can almost be assured that it can be used.The controls in Half-Life 2 are the exact same as the original Half-Life so veterans will be able to pick up and go very easily. For newcomers to the series the controls are very easy to pick up and very practical. After playing with this control scheme you probably will set all of your FPS games to it.I played the game in normal difficulty and it was pretty challenging, but not too hard. I found myself reloading a lot, and even after doing parts in the games over and over again I was still having fun trying to pass it, unlike some other games I have tried. Even though you may load a lot I found that ammo was hardly an issue. The supply crates are pretty much random and give you what you need the most. So if you are running low in shotgun shells, the next crate probably will contain some. This is helpful but at times I felt that I had too much ammo.The story takes place a number of years after the Black Mesa incident. The G-man awakes you on a train and talks to you for a moment and then vanishes. You soon get off the train and arrive at a place called “City 17”, ran by a dictator figure known as Dr. Breen, your former administrator at Black Mesa. You don't really know why you are there, or how you got there and the Combine roaming around the streets don't seem too friendly. You play through the entire game through Gordon Freeman's eyes really immersing you in the game.I was always in awe throughout the whole game. This game has the best graphics I have seen on any game. The people look life-like. They display their emotions so well that you know what they are feeling. The buildings and the atmosphere are awe-inspiring. You may never want to leave City 17 after you see its beauty. The different lighting in each area was great. You actually felt like you were progressing through the game when you start out in day time, and soon you see the sun setting and then it gets dark again.The music in this game was awesome. You could tell when a big battle was coming because the music would start playing, and your blood would start pumping. The music made the game that much more enjoyable. I listen to the soundtrack and I can see the battles without actually playing the game. That in my opinion is what makes the battles so great.The sound in the game was great. I loved the sound the combines made when they died. Each character had a distinct voice and had astounding voice acting. I have never been as freaked in a game when I hear a howl off in the distance and hear a rain gutter banging letting me know that a fast zombie is climbing up after me. The only reason why this score got a 9 is that there is some stuttering when the game loads or auto saves which can be very annoying.This game took me more than 20 hours to complete after playing around in the game with the physics and such, so it wasn't that short of a game, especially for an FPS. This game is definitely replayable. After playing through the game I invited my friend over so he could play it. He found different ways to kill creatures and solve puzzles that I never thought of, so that in itself is a great reason to replay the game. Also the game on hard is much more difficult than normal giving you more challenge as you go around a second time. Why an 8 then? Well the multiplayer is non-existent as of right now so I can't see myself playing it as much as I could be.This game is the best game this year. The graphics, physics, AI, music and sound strung around a well woven story make for a great time. You should definitely buy this game. If you computer can't handle it then its worth the price of upgrading. Reviewer's Score: 10/10 | Originally Posted: 11/22/04			",585,202,14,94,63,8,99

												We remember the Freeman. We are coterminous. There is no distance between us. No false veils of time or space may intervene. We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber. We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash between the barriers. We are there still, in observance of your final stroke. While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us. That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time.For a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds. Communion of the Vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself. We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow. Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread. Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity. No matter the consequences of this struggle. You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure. With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh.Your bright face obscures your darker mask. We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us. Far distant eyes look out through yours. Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it. We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow. We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock.The way ahead is dark for the moment. What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness. We are a tapestry woven of Vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it. How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass? Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share. We are you, Freeman. And you are us.			",223,24,9,11,9,0,10

												Where to start?Great story and stunning visualsThis game was one of my first ever games to be played when i first made my steam. Ever since i still love the game and allways will. The story is truly amazing and remarkable of all time, once you start playing this you wont stop playing. Source SDK; where to start with this? without this spectacular tool, people would of not have made such sucessfull mods of all time like; No More Room In Hell, Zombie Panic, Garrys mod and much MUCH more.

												(Re-written review)Half-Life 2, an ageless classic of PC games, the title that put Valve on the map, the reason Steam exists today and one of the most ground-breaking titles of it's time. I'm going to say right now to those who haven't played Half-Life 2 to do so immediately, as it is an incredible game that to me has triumphed over the tests of time and remains high on the list of video games that can never be bested.Half-Life 2 is just about perfect in every regard: from it's carefully forged story to the perfected pacing, from unforgettable characters to a steady challenge curve. The entirety of Half-Life 2 is a journey leading the player full circle in their quest to liberate humanity from their omnipresent multidimensional conquerers, the Combine. But if the game wasn't already grand enough, Valve gives the player ultimate control over their physics engine with the highly beloved Gravity Gun (you can call it the Zero-Point Energy Manipulator, if you really want to), a weapon that has never been equaled in any game since. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up objects from the world, like barrels, sawblades, crates and anything you can move and use them as protection against enemy fire or throw them at your foes in a satisfying method. This is even encouraged by the developers, for the level immediately after you recieve the Gravity Gun you are placed in a zombie-infested town with limited ammo and plenty of sharp, explosive or otherwise deadly-when-hurled-at-100kph objects. In other words: A playground for your new best friend. So if you're a recent gamer looking for a timeless classic or a veteran tired of all the two-weapon inventory crap in modern games, I sincerely and whole-heartedly recommend Half-Life 2 for an experience that has never been topped.

												Awesome single player game, mainly thanks to it's AMAZING scenario and it's really immersive aspect. It's probably even the best FPS solo game I've ever played after Portal. As usual in Valve games, there is no cutscenes, all events are lived through Gordon's eyes and that's what makes it so immersive. There are some great passages where you really need to search well for an entry, a way out... The game universe is really great even tho the game doesn't explain much about it. (Combine occupation, Gordon's story... etc) That's why you should raelly browse the wiki for more infos. Many things remind of portal (the musics) (the citadel, that huuuuge building reminds a lot of portal 2) and the 2 games are even supposed to take place at the same time. (There are some allusions to Black mesa in portal and some allusions of Aperture in HL).However the game can be a little buggy, and the achievements are bugged as usual in Source games... Excellent jeu solo, surtout grace a son super scenar et son coté immersif. C'est meme surement le meilleur FPS solo auquel j'ai joué apres portal.Comme d'hab dans les jeux Valve, pas de cinématiques, on vit tout à travers les yeux de Gordon, et c'est ce qui rend le jeu si immersif.Il y a de bons passages ou il faut bien chercher pour une sortie, une entrée... etc.L'univers du jeu est vraiment enorme meme si le jeu n'explique que peu de choses dessus (l'occupation Combine, l'histoire de Gordon...etc ) c'est pourquoi ca vaut vraiment le coup de jeter un oeil au wiki. Beacoup de choses rappelent Portal (la musique, l'ambiance sur les bords) (le citadelle, qui rappele portal 2) et les 2 jeux se passent meme en meme temps, dans le meme univers (il y a des  allusions à Black Mesa dans Portal et des allusions à Aperture dans HL)Seul défauts le jeu bug un peu et les succés eux buggent aussi pas mal, comme d'habitude dans les jeux source.

*****5 out of 5Half Life 3 now, please.What to say about Half Life 2? If I could even explain a fraction of my adoration of this game...it would probably overwhelm you. This game is one of a kind. Taking everything good from the FPS genre and gaming in general, Half Life 2 is a feat I can't fathom.The gameplay is slick, the sound is platinum album status, the characters will stay with you, and the storyline will grip you. If you haven't already bought this game whilst I've been talking, why haven't you?!?!?!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman....Overall Rating: 9.5/10This is the ONLY game than runs for more than a hundred FPS on my integrated laptop, old engine but packs a punch for the graphic. Right from the start of the first chapter, Half Life 2 never failed to amaze me by its spectacular map view after you walk out from a certain point of the game. The combination of sound effects, the astounding map lightings, even the movement and behaviour of the AI soldier (well... mostly) creates a solid realistic feels to the game itself, that gives a good first impression to the players of what the surrounding is going to be.The combat in Half Life 2 feels more lively compared to the first Half Life, the Manhunt, the flashing drones and the soldiers are more intelligent that adds a lot of challenges and varieties into the combat scene. Zombies models are well-improved, the voices for the zombies plus the jumpscare events creates a good mix of panic and suspense feels, thus forcing players to act faster and be decisive during the playthrough. The weapons are well designed, the animations and the sounds of them are great that makes the shooting experience a lot more fun. One thing I don't like a bit, is that the accuracy of the rifle and smg are bad, that bursting and tapping doesn't make any difference. Let's just not nitpick about it, Half Life 2 is already greater than I can imagine.Now what's Half Life without puzzle? they're created with more variaties attached to, most of them involves physics while the others are fun to discover and solve. The lazer pointer that guides the rocket launcher's missile, the boat and buggy shoot-while-driving scene, they're all creative, very fun to play, and gives a lot of joy after you actually solved it by yourself.I honestly feel that the thing that makes Half Life 2 great game, is that how enjoyable it is for all ages. There's lore attached to it, there's also story-related events that makes the play a lot more entertaining, that I'm very recommending this to people who are willing to try something enjoyable.For the people who actually OWN this game but never play it, sad that you've missed a part of the FPS history...

												Six years is a long wait for a sequel, but it was well worth it.  In that time, Valve created their own game engine, known as Source, and with the Gravity Gun quickly became THE game to copy.  Like ClassicDOOM before it, most FPS games that came after Half-Life 2 valiantly attempted to copy the in-game physics engine that allows to to catch and repel in-game props.  Many of them succeeded, but Half-Life 2 was the first to do it, and gamers know where to give credit where credit is due.Once again, you play as Gordon Freeman, mute savior of humankind.  Reawakened by the G-Man from the previous game ""some time later,"" you find that the world as you know it is no longer.  The Combine have successfully invaded and subjuated humanity, and it's only a matter of time before Man becomes just another X-stamp on the Combine's evolutionary whiteboard.  Unless you can rise up to the challenge of liberating your very species, that time will approach far quicker than you'd like.One of the first FPS games to introduce drivable vehicles, adding the Gravity Gun is just icing on this cake (that's a metaphor, not a lie).  Chock full of references and easter-eggs, Valve should be proud that their title has continued to successfully carry the FPS banner.			",97,27,0,11,16,0,8

												So wake up Mr. Freeman - Wake up and smell the ashes...Fresh install again for HL2, such an Epic game for single player.  The layout of this game is tremendous diverse locations and fun firefights.  For many, including myself getting this game meant - getting STEAM? - what was it, how will it work and such.  At the time Steam was a bit buggy and had some issues but that was 10+ years ago and look at it now... its come a long way.  Half Life for me is almost like a bad habit I keep going back to after 16 years of playing HL and 10 years of HL2 I always go back for another run - because there fun!  Why are they fun - its a unique world, decent graphics (top of the line when released), awesome game play, good AI, Killer music and soundtracks, fun characters and the MOD options.  My favorite levels in the game are Nova Prospect & Ravenholm... 2 fantastic levels.  Headcrab zombies and poison crabs - suck especially the poison crabs they make my hair stand up and the sound they make - (girly scream).I am all about Half Life again after my mini rant earlier in the week and the somewhat troublesome news from Valve regarding HL3 - please see the rant in the activity feed.  VALVE CAN NEVER LET THIS GAME END WITH OUT A PROPER FOLLOW UP AND EXPLANATION OF THE MANY LOOSE ENDS AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE QUESTION - JUST WHO EXACTLY IS THE GMAN AND WHY IS HE PORTRAYED THE WAY HE IS?  Recommended game if your the one person out there that has not played it yet, lol.			",273,36,11,23,17,1,37

												Nothing I say will make a difference at this point. I've dreaded reviewing Valve games since Steam reviews first started, because it's a developer I've placed on a very high pedestal, so objectivity is not on the menu. Half-Life 2 is something you've already played long ago or something you sought out just recently, because you wanted more from an FPS. For the past 7 years or so, I've been on a quest to watch movies that left a permanent mark in film history. I sought out those films for that reason alone. If you're on a similar quest with games, you're bound to meet Half-Life 2 on your path. It's a special breed of FPS, an experience so refined that to this day it stands above the rest in the genre, which is why it's my nominee for The ""Test of Time"" Award in the first Steam Awards.If you are completely new to Half-Life, the most envious position to be in, all things considered, then start with the first game. Half-Life, Half-Life: Source or Black Mesa, take your pick. Half-Life 2: Update is another thing to experience. And congratulations, you are now part of the most desperate group of people among gamers. The wait of a sequel and may it be as short as possible for you. Savor your journey from Half-Life to Episode Two and after you've replayed them once or twice, maybe, just maybe you will then hear the happy news we've all been waiting for.			",207,32,4,5,7,0,3

												Half-Life 2. The video game that started the modern generation on first-person shooters and revamped the gaming history into a new era. Originally released in November 2004, the game won multiple game of the year awards and branched gameplay mechanics, including physics and the state-of-the-art game engine that look realistic during its release date. Many people are aware on the game’s popularity and everlasting legacy including various jokes on the awaiting sequel (for many years), but the question remains: Why is this game popular?The game takes place after the events from Half-Life. You play as Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist who got a Ph.D. on theoretical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and knows how to use weapons very effectively; a strange paradox for a character with such features yet highly popular and well-recognized. You are sent to City 17 by the G-Man, a mysterious person or a phenomenon with a mysterious and ambiguous agenda, to overthrow Wallace Breen and the alien oppressors, the Combine. The setting and lore in the Half-Life universe is simply the best, taking some influence from George Orwell’s 1984 or other famous dystopian novels to set the story in tone. Gordon’s influence and previous actions will spark oppressed citizens in City 17 to take arms and revolt against the Combine. From City 17 to the prison at Nova Prospekt, each setting is unique, bleak, but beautifully designed, the game simply defined what a video game should be. Each NPCs and major characters such as Doctor Issac Kleiner, Barney Calhoun, and other characters interact realistically among each other and to you. In regards to Alyx Vance, your ally and companion, Valve spawned the concept of AI teammates and became a true asset in your journey to rally up the oppressed citizens. Besides good character developments, the best attribute for Half-Life 2 was physic interactions and the game engine. The game engine is Source, which feature high-dynamic range rendering, facial animations, and “realistic physics”; the first game that had such a feature like this. Are there criticisms for the game? I believe so, but to be honest, I couldn’t find any legitimate criticisms for the game. If one criticism has to be addressed, then the problem is the loading sections. Yes, those tedious loading that interrupted the “flow” in the middle of a long level or after finishing a series of firefights against Civil Protection or Combine forces. These loading or “checkpoints” really halt the immersion in the game. However, this is very common on all Half-Life games and I hope that Valve would address this (if they are working on the sequel…). Half-Life 2 is pure gold, shining flawlessly on the test of time. With great graphical fidelity at its time, voice acting and realistic AI interaction from your allies and enemies, this game is a rare exception of genuine perfection and grand role model for other game developers to pursue their own game designs. The only thing Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) is a full fledge sequel. Besides many jokes, anxieties, and waning patience for Valve to announce the sequel, the game should be in every PC gamer’s Steam library. No exception. Half-Life 2 is simply the best; a grand overture that started and defined the modern gaming industry in the present time.  ",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												Half-Life 2 is the reason I got into steam and was hooked into PC gaming. When I was a kid, I didn't have no Xbox or Playstation; all I had was my dad's PC with the original Half-Life and Unreal Tournament. Eventually I got my own personal computer when I got older and got a copy of Half-Life 2 in march, 2007. I love this damn game to the bottom of my heart and destroyed my taste in console shooters because of the speed and accuracy of a mouse and keyboard.			",85,8,1,3,4,0,9

												I'll tell you a story.Once, I went to my grandma's house in March- the THIRD month of the year. It was also the THIRD. I arrived at my grandma's house at 3:33. She has THREE houses on her block. I went up to the door, which had THREE chips on it, and knocked THREE times. After THREE seconds, she said: ""Be right there!""- it had THREE words in it. She came up to the door and took off THREE locks on her door. She invited me into the kitchen for cookies, while all of her THREE cats ran past me, one of which had THREE spots on him. She told me to sit down next to the table, which had THREE chairs. She handed me the platter with THREE cookies on it, and said that her THREE cats took THREE of the cookies THREE times. So we sat down for THREE minutes, and talked about THREE subjects: Major companies, Games, and Numbers. After that, we sat in my grandma's living room, and watched THREE different channels. After a while, she started to get thirsty, so I generously got up from one of the THREE sofas, went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. I spilled THREE drinks, but I got more for my grandma. When I came back into the room, she was watching a commercial for a product that said: ""If you don't get it in THREE days, it's free! Only $33.33!"" I sat down and started reading a magazine for children- the THIRD issue. It was on how to add. 1+1-1+1+1=3. That didn't seem appropriate for a children's book, so I went on the computer in my grandma's bedroom, and found out the company had been in buisiness for only THREE years. Now it made sense. It was time for me to leave because I was going to a party with THREE of my friends. My grandma gave me THREE seashells as a present, which I thanked her THREE times for. So then I left out the door, walked to my car, and drove away.So, what I'm trying to say is that I had a great time at my grandma's house.			",83,7,1,9,10,1,0

												John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.to be continued..?			",37,1,1,2,3,1,1

												Even though its not as good as the first Half-Life, it's still pretty much an excellent game in its own right and still holds up  Very Well in terms of Graphics and Gameplay.Everyone on Steam should have this and the 1st Game in their Library IMHO.Pros++Good Storyline, a Great Tour De Force IMO.+Likeable and Lively Characters.+Best Character Facial Expressions I've ever seen in a Game.+Good and Clever Puzzles, especially the ones that involve use of the Gravity Gun (One of the Best Video Game Guns IMO).+Lots of Great Mods like Black Mesa, SMOD, and Underhell for ExampleCons- -I thought the Enemy Variety was lacking, you fight Combine Soldiers and Synths for most of the Game, and you hardly encounter the Xen Aliens (Save the Headcrab and their Zombie Hosts) from the Last Game (I miss the Houndeye and Bullsquids ;_;).-Compared to the Last Game, the Arsenal felt Generic (The Pulse Rifle was a pretty cool Weapon, though I wish they kept the Tau Cannon or Gulon Gun from the Last one).No matter what I didn't like about this, it gets a 10/10.

												In what is arguably a more necessary Steam title to have in one's libary than Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2, Half-Life 2 holds up magnificently as a first-person shooter over a decade since its 2004 release as the first title which required Steam to install and play. The game follows an arc similar to most forms of media, especially film media, with the player seeing highs, lows, and an excellent climax as through the eyes of Gordon Freeman.As stated above, this game remains an amazing title and experience, both in gameplay and in plot, with a great deal of effort directed at character development and map and AI design. You could be told this was released a week ago and would believe it, as both its graphics and physics engine remain top-notch and put to shame those of most other shooters, both at the time and now.The game follows M.I.T. graduate and Black Mesa Research Associate Scientist Gordon Freeman, who, after being placed on a train heading to City 17, faces off against the oppressive Combine Empire that controls the city and the planet. With the help of the resistance movement and old and new friends alike, Gordon fights the Combine as they launch continued assaults against him, viewing his return to be a serious if not the single greatest threat to their dominion.The game is an outstanding example of storytelling, with the arc being one of my favorite in any game released - period. Without a word coming from Freeman's lips, the universe and history of City 17 and Earth in general is greatly explained, and through events the player grows to despise the Combine Empire, which in turn grants extra reward to the player when they succeed in trading blows with it.With an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game's means to convey emotion increase, action scenes become more epic, horror scenes become more terrifying, and emotional scenes become more deep and impactful. The game uses its soundtrack in a masterful way, reintroducing old tunes and beats from Half-Life 1, and introducing a new soundtrack that perfectly fits the situation.The game is also masterful at finding a blend of pleasing and challenging a player; Most concepts are introduced by some form of training to help open the player up to them, rather than forcing the player to learn skills on the spot, though the game makes sure not to help the player too much to keep the challenge going.If you haven't bought this game yet on Steam, I strongly suggest you do so. It's an excellent title that has everything a good game should have: Interesting Plot, well-written characters, interesting and fun mechanics, a fitting and enjoyable soundtrack, good map design, excellent world-building, and so on. It stands 12 years since its release in most majestic fashion with the means to challenge most AAA titles♥♥♥♥♥♥out to the market with its first chapter alone.			",65,10,0,6,15,3,15

												Since this is a first person shooter, let's talk about the guns. For starters you have the basic weapons, pistols, machine guns, a shotgun, grenades, rocket launcher (RPG?) and so on. Some weapons have dual uses like the machine gun has a grenade launcher. The weapons feel very good to use. The pistol has never been so much fun to shoot wow! I'm shocked. The machine guns have real kick to them. The shotgun seems very effective. The rocket launcher is laser guided, which is fun to take down helicopters with. Launch it and guide it to the helicopter, because if you shoot it straight, the rocket will get shot down.The combat is rich and fulfilling with certain segments of driving such as a boat or car segment where you still get out and go into buildings to combat things. There are also puzzles and challenges to breakup the action just like there were with the original game. It keeps you thinking, sometimes over thinking. There are puzzles such as using a crane to move your car, using a washing machine to weigh down a platform and taking out a force field by rolling a car (trying not to spoil). There are less puzzles in this game than the last, most of the puzzles seem to involve combat like using the gravity gun as a weapon.Level design is well thought out. Areas are very realistic and cluttered with things you'd really find in any given area. There are trees, junk, wrecked cars, beds, dilapidated walls, broken floors and so on. It really helps the immersion that these areas feel real instead of a typical video game level. This is a very linear game that does have little points of exploration, but you are cleverly guided through things that catch your eye. Like lights in a room are turned on or a character standing under a light and the game will condition you to subtle cues that they mean ""go here"" or characters will flat out say ""run Gordon! Go now I'll hold them off.""The game has several new or altered enemies. Even the old enemies are more difficult and altered. There are new head crabs, the standard and the venomous kind. For humans that have a head crab on them, they are this game's zombies, smart, difficult, dangerous zombies. You can shoot them in the head, slice them in half, sometimes the head crab will hop off, they scream a horrifying muffled wail, but worst of all... if you don't get moving they will rise again in a matter of minutes. There are several terrifying enemies that with the dark and new lighting really disturbs you and sends a dread through you that other games fail to duplicate. The game really manages to terrify you through other ways, such as traveling beneath a giant bridge actually gives you a sense of height that is strangely intense because you fear falling when clearly this is a video game. Maybe that says something about the game's immersion.Of course there are your run of the mill soldiers, and special ops enemies... but they are intelligent. Several enemies in the game are very intelligent and don't have patterns, but thought processes. Such as if they are injured, they will fall back and get a better position, if they have you pinned down, they will throw in grenades, rush in with guns blazing or bait you into firing at them. They will never line up to be shot; they will fan out so they can all shoot you.In all the game is a lot of fun, but a lot of it isn't, especially if you're a little clueless as to what the story is, because the game won't help you with that right away at least. What might be an intense boat segment of the game might be a long annoyance for some people. Sometimes you can over think puzzles that aren't even really puzzles, but you miss a small lock to shoot off something and end up using the newly acquired gravity gun to pile junk to get over things. What could be a fun car segment with stops in between could be seen as an annoyance to have to stop, because the military has ambushed you or set up a force field.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												( I've played all HL games so far in 2016, so no nostalgia involved)Half-Life 1 was okay/good.  I loved Opposing Forces  even more, and Half-Life 2 overall was even better, with some parts of the game not being that good. At the time of writing this review I haven't played the Episodes, so I don't really know info about them. The game starts with GMan telling you that there's stuff to do, and driven by free choice Gordon Freeman does whatever he wants, as long as he follows the corridor the game opens to him. Jokes aside, the game is a huge and long corridor. A very pretty and well done, well built corridor, but still, the game lacks choice and freedom - though it's not really a problem, as the game is action-driven, always happens something that forces you to go further. Attack from beind, tunnels collapsing, or they say the next goal is ahead of you. And here's where one of the things come in the picture that made the game sooo much better for me that HL1 was - change of environment.  HL1 was in Black Mesa and in Xen, and while the two was vastly different, and the level design was great, you still spent most of your time between walls of BM.  On the other hand in HL 2 there are canals, sewers, city landscape, country-like environment, beach, cliffs, a mining town worthy of horror stories, Combine (aliens) base, and street warfare. Not only the level layout changed, but the style as well. Cities had snipers, zombies and headcrabs were abundant in abandoned places, while combine had most power in the city.  So type of the enemies, coupled with the different environments and available weapons at that point made the game really diverse, while it was really consistent, logical by building up that diversity.Things I loved it in game:- Finally a proper story with recurring characters, and not just random people telling me where to go and never seeing them again.  Actually the story was really enjoyable.- Good weapon selection - they are different, and I think all weapons were useful in certain situations. While one can have a favourite weapon, there wasn't useless ones.- Physics are just awesome. The ragdoll after hitting enemies with the crossbow, how explosions throw stuff around, and how *incredibly* well the gravity gun was implemented in the game. The gravity gun is basically a tech bragging from Valve to show off the physics, but instead of it being a show-weapon, they made lots and lots of situations where it was needed. In modern games a lots of new things are used only for a short period, here the Gravity Gun, the driveable buggy and airboat was used for quite a lot of time, G.G. for the most obviously- Secrets, AKA Lambda-locations. They are not really useful if you're at least average with FPS games, as they only give ammo, health and ocassionally shields, but they balance out the game for people who are not too good at FPS, but pay attention to their surroundings. I personally love it when a game rewards you for discovery.And the negative:- Basically character collision. I finally meet Eli and Alyx, I'm just standing, staring at them talking and then Alyx just pushes me away. In SO MANY scripted moments they just push me away instead of properly avoiding me, and it was really, really annoying and immersion breaking.-Character collision 2.0:  you and your squad.  I demand the rights to shoot those terrible soldiers who block eachother and me - they follow me, staying behind like 3-5 metres, and any time I have to go back they bump to me, to eachother, they pushes eachother away like domino pieces, and it's just superfun when a strider is shooting at me.  -Preposition? The game's start is really weird in my opinion. Climbing though a fence, going in a random house, then getting chased because... why? The game tries to show the Combine bad, so the player would rather flee from them (as lack of means to fight back) but in the game it's not even explained why they are there, and who they are. Which is really weird for me, and made me question the actions and happenings in the first few chapters.These are the only things I can't even grasp how they managed to leave in the game, I can't recall anything else more than mildly annoying.Game is still a lot of fun today, and playing it absolutely made me realize how incredily powerful and useful the engine is, and why there are so many mods based on it - the game is fun:  varied enemies and weapons, there are often some mini-puzzles to solve to go further (like collecting 3 car batteries) make the game still a really enjoyable experience. I would recommend playing it if you want a better gameplay experience than a story  - the story is full with mysteries, but playing the game feels much more rewarding than most newer FPS games proved to be for me.

To this day, this game is still really enjoyable to boot up and just play countless times, I am still shocked that there are people still out there that have not played this game.

												So, I'm one of those guys who has played console games all of his life. I can be very lethal with a controller in hand. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said with a mouse and keyboard. To remedy this disparity, I figured I'd re-enter the world of arguably the most famous PC games of all time... Half-Life 2.I played this game back when it was packaged in ""The Orange Box"" for the Xbox 360. It was definitely enjoyable back then, and there is very little drop off over the years. Sure, the graphics aren't up to par with modern-day games, but they hold up a lot better than the original Half-Life. The gameplay is very fluid. I found the machine gun and shotgun to be my two most used weapons outside of the gravity gun. I used the machine gun regularly throughout the entire game, and it excelled in medium-range combat. However, it had nothing over the shotgun in close-range scenarios. There were many times in which the shotgun kept me safe when I was caught off guard.Speaking of getting caught off guard, this game had plenty of moments that startled me or made me jump from my seat. I mean, I've beaten this game over a decade ago. Yet, I seem to have forgetton how great this game is. The little instances in which some headcrab or other enemy popped up from around the corner or from some dark location scared me more than any other ""Horror"" movie or game has, ever! The environments are well-thought out. There are plenty of objects to interact with, and there are forty-five health caches scattered throughout the game for those who wish to explore every nook and cranny that this game has to offer. The entire story is presented while you control the protagonist, Gordon Freeman. There are no cutscenes. Instead, you can walk around and pay as much (or as little) attention that you'd like to the dialogue. Consequently, I found myself more enthralled by the events that took place. I lived in this world, and I cared about what happened.I'm sure that most people reading this review have already beaten this game, and that's fine. This game has been around for a while. That being said, this classic game deserves to be played again. It may not have the most memorable story, but it has some memorable set-pieces, and the enemies can be challenging at higher difficulties. Simply put, Half-Life 2 is a complete game that ages like fine wine. I appreciate this game a lot more now than I did over ten years ago. So will you.			",24,0,0,3,1,0,1

												""Rise and shine,Mr. Freeman,rise and shine""- G-manHalf-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life,the game by Valve that pretty much wrote the rules for FPSs way back in 1998.I haven't played very much of this game myself,but I can guarantee that anyone who plays it will end up loving this game,even those that didn't play HL1 before playing this game(like me).  The Story Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man,who inserts him in a train arriving at the fictitous City 17,which was taken over by Combine forces. He eludes the Combine forces and meets Alyx and Barney,and joins the Lambda Resistance. He gets to Dr. Kleiner's lab and assists them in attempting to get a teleporter to teleport him and Alyx to Dr. Eli Vance's lab. The teleportation fails,and he goes through City 17 on foot to get to Eli's lab. He arrives at Black Mesa East and meets up with Eli, where he is captured and taken to a combine prison,Nova Prospekt. Gordon goes through a zombie infested town named Ravenholm and is given a Dune Buggy,which he uses to travel to Nova Prospekt. Eli,Alyx,and Gordon escape,the combine teleporter they used exploding in the process. Gordon and Alyx learn they were in a ""slow teleport""during which a week has passed. In their absence,the Resistance mobilized against the combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel,with Gordon,aided by Barney and D0g,goes to the Citadel. He gets caught in a Combine""confiscation chamber"",which destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun,the energy enhancing it's capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon. He is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office,where he is holding Eli and Alyx captive. Breen explains his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine. Breen tries to escape through a portal,but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen is annihilated in the resulting explosion,but just before Gordon and Alyx get killed,time is frozen,and the G-Man appears,praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel,and puts Gordon back into stasis. The characters are pretty cool,even if some of the characters can tend to be annoying*looks at Barney*The music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance.The weapons are pretty good,just really your standard FPS weapons,except the Gravity Gun is added,which lets you move almost any object at will. Heck,you get a crowbar also x) :)This is an amazing game overall,it seriously deserves the critical acclaim that it's gotten,and I HIGHLY recommend this game,even to those that haven't played Half-Life before,it's def worth the 10 bucks10/10 from me :)Sweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												A near-perfect first person shooter through a convincing, imaginative world filled with believable characters. If you haven't played it already then you should, it holds up well against recent titles and embarrasses a fair few.The game has so many little touches that make it better than its competitors. The shotgun has a tight blast radius, so it's effective even at considerable distances. The gravity gun gave meaning to the rubbish strewn across the levels. Who would have thought a radiator could serve as a weapon, a shield and a useful platform to reach high-up areas? The grenades are satisfyingly clunky, the explosive barrels are meaty and I wish that they sold bugbait stress balls. It's probably the nicest sounding weapon in the world (and beyond).This game needs no introduction. It's the game that single-handedly brought Steam onto desktop PCs everywhere. It had to live up to the standards set by the original and it surpassed it in every way. Graphically it was ahead of its time, with detailed character animations and convincing CLUTTER all over the world. Each level leads straight on from the previous so you can almost draw a mental map of City 17 as you journey towards the looming Citadel in the centre. You can see the sun slowly setting as the levels progress and distant sirens and explosions really draw you into the Eastern-European themed city. There's something very lonely about the echo of a gun shot on the cliff levels.Every chapter has its own theme and alterations to the gameplay. You'll find yourself in vehicles, or battling against a certain type of enemy, or battling WITH that type of enemy against another sort. It really makes me wonder why other developers bother even trying to compete with the creativity that this title offers.Is it perfect? Nhggghhh, almost. I could say that the vehicle sections go on for a bit too long and the quiet, talky sections (which used to be my favourite- LOOK AT THEIR FACES!) have aged a bit. I find myself hitting things with a crowbar, waiting for more enemies to kill.Seriously, if you don't enjoy this game then first person shooters aren't for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What else can I say that hasn't already been said about Half-Life 2? The fine folks over at Valve have succeeded in creating not only one of the most immersive experiences a game can offer, but one of the greatest games of all time.  For those who aren't even fans of the first-person shooters, I still encourage you to look into this game. Should you choose to don the HEV suit and take on the role of the crowbar-weilding, badass physicist Dr. Gordon Freeman, I can guarentee you'll be in for the train ride of your life.  I could go on and on about how stellar this game is, but your time would be better spent playing it for yourself.			",55,2,0,7,0,2,6

												You see I never liked rhino's, but that's ok cause this game doesn't have them.So when you start the game you are greeted with sexual sounds of raviolli and meatballs, made by famous chef, Adolf Hitler.  But sadly you don't get to enjoy these banana's because then general mc♥♥♥♥face puts you on a train with Morgan Freeman, btw it's not really Tim Alan.  You are then told it's safer here, and the main character, Master Chief, says ""What can you tell me about the reapers?""  So as you make your way through the holocaust, I mean train station you meet your old friend Barney the zebra, and he tells you to♥♥♥♥♥♥off and get a real job.  And that's when my power cut out because I didn't pay the electric bill.  I then proceeded to get a job at Mcdolan's, and hated every single moment of it.  The end.This game gets 7/Charmander at best.			",174,30,0,16,8,3,12

												Saying this is a good game is like saying water is wet at this point, it's just a given. The pure nostalgia bomb I got from this game is beautiful. It still holds up so many years later. While some of the action later on is pretty darn challenging it's never too much or so much so you feel like you have to give up (the first Half Life had a lot of areas like that, still a good game for the time though don't get me wrong). The dialogue is brilliant and the writing top notch. The characters are really easy to get attatched to- especially Alyx and Calhoun, trust me you'll be wanting them to stay with you the whole game. Definitely a must for people who played the game back in the day and a must for people who want an awesome game. Highly recommended.Kinda leaves you wanting more though.

The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world, so, wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the ashes."" These are the words that plunge you into the dark world of Half-Life 2. You play as Gordon Freeman, a former theoretical physicist, who years after the Resonance Cascade in Half-Life 1, is taken out of stasis by the mysterious Gman. The adventure that follows is, in my opinion, one of the best you can possibly experience in a game. The graphics in the game are amazing. The game was made in 2004 and the graphics still hold up to this very day. The soundtrack is made up of several electronic and ambient songs, all of which were masterfully composed by Kelly Bailey. The gameplay is action-packed, interactive, and, most importantly, fun as hell. This game is an absolute must-play for anyone who considers themselves a ""gamer,"" or anyone who wants to make games.

From the amazingly well thought out gameplay to the beautiful visuals that still hold up to this day it really is a masterpiece. What the game lacks in visual fidelity it certainly makes a comeback with its great story and its entertaining gameplay... Whether it's killing Combine Soldiers with toilets using the Gravity Gun or shooting down a Gunship using an RPG, the gameplay is satisfying.Pro's:Entertaining Gameplay.Rich cast of characters.Deep story.Diverse gameplay.Cons:No Half-Life 3 yet			",67,17,1,3,6,0,1

												This game is acclaimed as being legendary.So, obviously I HAD to play the entire franchise.I'm still hooked on the lore and gameplay.If you're expecting the old fast-paced bangabangkaoombBLAAAMSCHDOWPOPOPOOM of Half Life 1, well, I'll get in to that later.The storytelling and graphics hold up to this day. In fact, some would say they're BETTER than todays. Amazing(?) physics, lighting, and if you get past the mayonaise jar glitch with turret-armed Metrocops, the A.I. is spectacular, often working in squads and providing covering fire for one another, throw grenades, etc.For those old glory fans, this isn't the aftermath of Black Mesa getting nuked. This is the aftermath of a resonace cascade, and gas-masked aliens are here to ♥♥♥♥ up your world view.The level design is certainly iconic. Looming feeling of the Combine always watching you in the Eastern European City 17, sunset-casted and damp Canals, haunting, deathly and heavy night of Ravenholm. Sheer cliffs and winding highways of the Coast, crumbling and invasive metal structures of Nova Prospekt, and the fiery streets of the battle of City 17, soldiers and natural hazards lurking at every corner of the way.Gameplay is, and I'm going to shamelessly compare to HL1, slower than its predecessor, but still lots of fun. Your sprint, possibly to service the more serious storytelling, is literally limited to a meter, and that's WITH the suit. Weapon choice is also notched down from the original, which is slightly dissapointing as well. It's made up, however, for a select iconic masterpiece made specifically for this game: and I'm not talking about any old crowbar. The Gravity Gun is one of the best weapons ever made for a videogame, even if it's introduced quite a ways in to the game.Overall?9.5/10. Very slight imperfections I notice, but otherwise a great choice for any gamer out there.AND THEN THERE'S THE EPISODE-			",42,1,0,2,3,0,1

												A lot can be said about Valve's Half-Life 2. In fact so much has been said that it feels redundant just talking about it. Yeah we all know the games amazing story, and the tight controls, and stunning graphics. I mean JESUS look at those graphics! But what really makes HL2 great, besides just the stuff mentioned? We know its the shining crown jewel of gaming, but do we really know why? The short of it is that the game is extremely solid on all fronts, something that truly can't be said about many games. Everything flows, in a way that AAA games still can't come close to, so much to an extent that I feel people sell Half-Life 2 short, even the people prasing it. Sure games today are made for a wider audience and they get that with shiny graphics and a more streamlined cinematic experience. The games are easier because they don't strive to highlight certain mechanics and instead focus on a wide apeal-story based narrative that can be experienced by everyone. But is that really the case? Truly think about it. HL2 doesn't need to pull you out of the world you have been experiencing in first person to show you a cutscene or have the ""tutorial guy"" , you never follow a map marker or preform a one button stealth takedown. Were made to think AAAs today are much better because theres more there, bigger maps, better graphics, and new toys all come with having as much cash that the companies making these games are willing to pump into them. We feel a sense of evolution that comes with the silver wraping under the christmas tree and are ready to easily consume more and more of the worlds were presented with because everything is made for that reason only. On the contrary Half-Life 2 did something more. The world is experienced by the player. The story is subtle and it only unwraps itself as you peel back the layers of the Half-Life world and see what Gordon Freeman, or you the player, has missed in the last 20 years. Half-life 2's story has a dark tone, with creative interiors and exteriors that never stray from the world being presented to you, refusing to abandon the lore of the world or dampen the experience all while flowing perfectly with gameplay and mechanics. The basics of Half-Life were run and shoot. And they sure as hell kept true to that in HL which is why the game is still so critically acclaimed. And HL2 does this but even better. Its a game truly worth of a sequel, being able to take what the predecessor had done and improving on every way while making each aspect better. The world you run and shoot in is the same world you live in. What AAA games take the time to truly accomplish the blending of the main concept of their game with every other aspect or even use it as one of their misguided selling points? The game Half-Life 2 truly speaks for itself in many ways. Once you have heard one person say it you have probably heard it all. And while we might not have listened well enough for this message to rub off on other games, the effects of HL2 will be felt by those who truly look for a reason to love it.			",62,4,0,2,3,0,1

												>>CAUTION SPOILERS<<Yes.  Just yes.  Half life 2,  Has exceeded everones expectations and has also exceeded the expectations of physics,graphics,and gameplay <--- Important if you couldnt guess.  This game when it popped up.  Everyones mind was ♥♥♥♥ing BLOWN.  People were just amazed about how far ahead valve went in time to make this game, and ♥♥♥♥,  the only cutscene they had at the beginning ♥♥♥♥ing filled every bit of missing info the player (that they needed at the time) had just STARTING the game.  Honestly,  You could not have done a better job showing the sexual tension between Alyx and Gordan grow,  that simple brush hair back in the elevator just showed... ALL of it.  On how they managed to make this entire game in body (should have) made the player feel like he was actually there.  Not a  dude hes controlling.  Not once have I seen/heard anyone say.  ""Yah the game is about this smart dude you control and help him and co. pass the trial and error,"" no. Never seen that.  The WHOLE entire game is about YOU not Gordan freeman. YOU the player.  Are the Person of Interest.  You are the guy with the M.I.T. education.  You ARE, The one Free Man.			",44,2,0,5,2,0,0

												Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman. The sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.A diverse set of enemies is present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; still others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers and medics, and can send his team further from him or call them back.Many of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can use these to build a crude staircase, so sometimes, multiple approaches lead to the desired outcome.Part-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects that he cannot manipulate without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).The game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Until recently,  I haven't ever played a Half Life game. It was only when a Youtuber I watch started a series on Half Life 1. I then booted up HL2 for the first time(I got it gifted to me a while back but hadn't played it). Let me say, Half life hit so many great spots, and I feel confident saying that it was the most fun time I have had in a video game!!! I will soon be picking up episodes 1 and 2 and I am excited for what the series will bring. If you are on the rocks about buying Half Life 2, then I can advise you to purchase it, for less that  $10USD, you can buy a game that gives exciting, action filled entertainment. Also, if you are thinking about value for money, Half Life 2 give a long campaign (It took me 14 hours to beat blind)After playing Half Life 2, I can now fully understand the hype behind Mr Gordan Freeman!!!

												Half-Life 2 is the iconic science fiction FPS. You take the role of Gordon Freeman who joins resistance in dystopian Earth conquered by Combine empire (it has evil corporate feel). Explore City 17 and shoot some aliens, humans and monsters!The games is considered the best video game ever by some. It's definitely very, very, very good. Is it best? Everyone should play it for themselves. It's absolutely worth playing, that's for sure.PROS:- Even in 2017 I believe graphics is wonderful with splendid animation and beautifully made people.- Music is OK. When it's present, it fits the surroundings really well.- Map design and the general feel of locations is great.- Multitude and diversity of locations with various types of combat.- Gameplay physics is magnificent. In some places you have to use physics to progress.- Gameplay ranges from survival horror, through puzzle solving, to urban warfare. At all points it's quite fun.- One of weapons is gravity gun. One of most interesting weapons I've ever used in video games.- Narrative pacing is enjoyable.- Story is quite good. It's not very original. Standard future corporate dystopia. It has no plot holes and works just fine.- Gravity gun is so much fun. Ripping the electronics from the wall in final level - OMG, so much satisfaction :-)- Good voice acting.- You get to play with a huge harbor crane.- Sweet Lord, destroying all that monitors with gravity gun! FUN FUN FUN! :-)MEH:- It's linear. It's enjoyable, but it's linear.CONS:- None.Conclusion: must play. Full recommendation.GAMEPLAY 10/10GRAPHICS 10/10AUDIO 9/10STORY 8/10			",157,83,9,22,24,1,41

												""November 2004 : Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 are officially released on PC around the world, bringing in a new era for the First Person Shooter genre of video game, with advanced graphics & physics."" -WikipediaYou'll end up admiring beautiful landscapes, killing hundreds of zombies or aliens that speak English, shooting a gunship with a gun mounted on an airboat, or with an RPG, sniping enemies with a crossbow, and even destroying a portal to another dimension. And all of this in the Source Engine, arguably the best game engine ever made (even my crappy laptop with a built-in graphics card can run it with 50 FPS with every setting maxed and I'm pretty sure a Raspberry Pi can run it as well).In my advice, Half-Life 2 should be considered as one of the best video game ever made. The storyline is epic and the gameplay is totally immersive and nearly o.r.g.a.s.m.i.c. Oh and btw, happy 10th birthday Half-Life 2!∞/10			",84,9,1,5,9,1,5

												By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- are counting on him.

												The legendary sequel, it does everything that the original Half-Life did, and even better.Zombies, hostile military, head crabs (absolutely ^nothing^ like face huggers), big bugs, aliens, weird new crazy creatures that I don't even know the name of.Lots of guns, and sci-fi guns, including a tool that turns anything of roughly human size and decent weight into a weapon (yes, kill zombies by projecting barrels and circular saws at them), and a ball of energy that you may or may not recognise from Portal.The most round about ways of getting from point A to point B.LazorzPhysics puzzles - now with even more physics!Surprise platforming! (now with even more surprises)The great crowbar of Gorden the Freeman!Infuriating technology! From levers to switches, to the classic button, Half-Life 2 introduces power cables and field generatorsHalf-Life 2 also brings you:Vehicles, such as the boat type thingy, and the car like buggy car... thing... All with full physics support!Story! I mean, yeah, Half-Life 1 had story, but only really right at the start and towards the end. But now, you get story throughout! With actual characters! Who really do have the ability to make you care about whether they live or not!Horror! Oh, yes, you'll appreciate it when it's over. Be sure to make full use of flares...and...Cliffhangers! (Both literal and, err, you know, normal)Considered by many to be the best first-person shooter of all time, Half-Life 2 is one you need to play, and should hold a high priority on your to play list at that. Higher. Higher. Lower. A little bit higher. Okay, you're good			",96,4,1,9,6,0,36

												The best game I have ever played. Its fear of unknown atmosphere and fascinating story are on stellar quality levels. This game collects all the great things that matter in videogames and expands them to extremely high levels of polishment, epicness and pure awesomeness. The result is a perfect gameplay, perfect graphics, perfect audio, everything quite perfect, abundant in extreme quality which you will never forget. One of the greatest achievements of videogame industry. I don't know what to add. Even when I played this game for the sixth (or so) time, I had a wonderful time. Thanks to its perfectly utilized physics engine, the game has a believable world, that is overflowing with interactivity. The Gravity Gun is the best weapon/tool of all time. Every second modern game has some sort of physics interactions in it and maybe even a kind of telekinesis ability, but I have yet to witness such seamless implementation like the Gravity Gun of HL2.

												""Life is not complete until you play at least half of Half-Life 2.""Where do I start with this? Hmm. How about atmosphere?Atmosphere:It's amazing. Wherever you go it feels like it's real. That's my opinion, but yours can be different. Gameplay:It is hard. It is incredibly hard. I had to look up walkthroughs everyhour or so! I rage quited a few times and I felt so angry at the enemies! But what that did do was make the ending more rewarding. When I completed it I thought I was one of the many gods who beat it. The guns sound like...well.....guns. The guns act like real guns. Yeah.......guns.........Music:You need to hear the soundtrack. I dont care if your grandma turned into a potato. JUST HEAR THE SOUNDTRACK. THE MAIN THEME IS ALSO VALVE'S THEME. So whenever you start up a VALVE game you hear the starting of the theme. It's so wonderful to hear it. Why should I get this game?Why not, dingus?This game is overrated:That is true. Some people say it's the best game ever and will force it down your throat that it's the best. Even though it's a classic and one of the best. There never can be the BEST game. ""There is no best, only opinions""- Me.But I DO recommend it. Just do a favor for yourself and get the game and play it!Ending statements:If you're not buying the game and your reasons are not ""I dont have any steam wallet money,"" or ""I want another game really bad,"" then WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION?You havent lived as a gamer until you have played this game. Half Life 3 is the most hyped game of all time! And there's a reason for that! It's amazing and awesome and a classic and one of the best games of all time!GG and many time's I will reMake the right choice and buy this game! It will change your life if you play all the way through it and make a opinion about it. So whatcya waiting for? Hurry up and buy that game ya dingus!*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!

												Half-Life 2 is a very diverse game. Though action-packed, you'll also have moments when you are forced to stop and think... what items do I need and how do I use them to get past this obstacle? Using machinery or sometimes by simply stacking up objects.In some areas you'll be able to drive in a buggy or hover boat with onboard alien weapons, accompanied by fast-paced music to get your heart pumping. You'll also have to cross some scary areas that you don't want to do just before going to bed.I love the controls in this game and there's a nice variety of weapons you can use. The story and the great gameplay makes you wanna keep on playing even after you've finished the game.You can have lots of hours of fun playing through the different difficulty modes. One of my most favorite games, definitely worth to try out!10/10			",58,19,0,3,4,0,6

												""Rise and shine,Mr. Freeman,rise and shine""- G-manHalf-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life,the game by Valve that pretty much wrote the rules for FPSs way back in 1998.I haven't played very much of this game myself,but I can guarantee that anyone who plays it will end up loving this game,even those that didn't play HL1 before playing this game(like me). The plot: Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man,who inserts him in a train arriving at the fictitous City 17,which was taken over by Combine forces.  He eludes the Combine forces and meets Alyx and Barney,and joins the Lambda Resistance.  He gets to Dr. Kleiner's lab and assists them in attempting to get a teleporter to teleport him and Alyx to Dr. Eli Vance's lab. The teleportation fails,and he goes through City 17 on foot to get to Eli's lab.  He arrives at Black Mesa East and meets up with Eli, where he is captured and taken to a combine prison,Nova Prospekt.  Gordon goes through a zombie infested town named Ravenholm and is given a Dune Buggy,which he uses to travel to Nova Prospekt.  Eli,Alyx,and Gordon escape,the combine teleporter they used exploding in the process.  Gordon and Alyx learn they were in a ""slow teleport""during which a week has passed. In their absence,the Resistance mobilized against the combine, turning City 17 into a battleground.  Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel,with Gordon,aided by Barney and D0g,goes to the Citadel.  He gets caught in a Combine""confiscation chamber"",which destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun,the energy enhancing it's capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon.  He is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office,where he is holding Eli and Alyx captive.  Breen explains his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine.  Breen tries to escape through a portal,but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen is annihilated in the resulting explosion,but just before Gordon and Alyx get killed,time is frozen,and the G-Man appears,praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel,and puts Gordon back into stasis.  The characters are pretty cool,even if some of the characters can tend to be annoying*looks at Barney*The music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance.The weapons are pretty good,just really your standard FPS weapons,except the Gravity Gun is added,which lets you move almost any object at will. Heck,you get a crowbar also x) :)This is an amazing game overall,it seriously deserves the critical acclaim that it's gotten,and I HIGHLY recommend this game,even to those that haven't played Half-Life before,it's def worth the 10 bucks10/10 from me :)			",121,25,1,11,4,1,4

												Half-Life 2 promises a lot with all the hype surrounding it, but fails to live up to its gargantuan expectations.  With that being said, it is still a fairly wonderful game.  The dystopian setting is extremely enjoyable, with levels of dry humor that keep you interested.  The game mechanics are similar to the rest of Valve's collection, so you know what to expect.  Quirky additions are what set the game apart--such as the gravity gun and vehicles.  Half-Life 2 is a game you have to play at least once in your life, but replay value isn't promising.

												Throughout 12 years, the game still a legend. I rememver, what for the first time I launched it in 2005 (A year later after release), and it's still remains a real good game, which I enjoyed one more time. Out of simplicity, I would say:  Graphics are good  Sountracks are good Gameplay is great Simple storyI can't say everything about this game, because I am late for a review, and people already described everything in a details. But the only thing, what I want to say - it's worth it. If you still think about ""Get this game or not?"", I would definitely say to you - get it. That's all.			",84,6,3,9,5,2,3

+ The gameplay even to this day is a TON of fun. You will mainly be blasting soldiers, zombies, and a variety of alien-like creatures. You also get to do a fair bit of puzzle solving, exploring, and a few vehicle based driving missions.+ Mysterious yet deep sci-fi rich story. Basically, the Combine (An alien-race) have taken over Earth and essentially enslaved the population. You Morgan Freeman are basically the savior, and lead the rebellion for freedom. (Although trust me, there's a lot more to it)+ Very large open environments with a lot to explore.+ Variety of unique weapons with many that have an alternate fire ability. More importantly the ""Gravity Gun"" which you can use to pick up and launch objects at enemies is just so much fun!+ The Physics and Physics-Based Puzzles were fantastic, even for today's standards. The puzzles  just feel very satisfying and are not overly difficult to solve.+ Personally, the Airboat and Scout Car vehicle missions were a joy to play with a great sense of speed and freedom along with being very well thought out with some unique obstacles.+ Very challenging ""boss"" fights that come in many varieties. You take down helicopters, gunships, Antlion Guards, Striders, and so fourth that are all very exciting and thrilling.+ Ravenholm...a level with a dark eerie vibe infested with zombies. In my opinion, this level was amazing and probably inspired Left 4 Dead. This level was completely different from anything encountered before or after, and is truly a fantastic zombie-survival experience...with a comedic Russian companion to help you along. + For a FPS, Half Life 2 has A LOT of content. According to some surveys, the main story takes about 10-14hours. It took me about 9 hours going through pretty quicky, but I was left feeling completely satisfied.+ Fantastic soundtrack with many atmospheric pieces that really help emerse the player into the game world. + The controls felt great, making gunfights fun and skill-based.+ You get to control companions (including Antlion creatures) for a few missions which is quite enjoyable+ Although this game was made in 2004, I need to mention that the graphics still look good to this day.- I felt like some levels were overly drawn out or a bit too lengthy. Especially Nova Prospekt (The Prison). At some points it felt like I was just going through a very long maze filled with enemies. - The story is lacking in some aspects and can leave new players feeling a bit lost. For the majority of the game you are traveling alone for long periods and are told to go from place to place without a good explanation of what you are meant to be doing and why. Even at the end of the game, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on...~ Just a personal note, but I wish they included some sort of medium range rifle or burst-shot gun. You get pistols, shotgun, pistol, crossbow, and machine guns, but not much to precisely take out enemies from afar. I was also a bit curious as to why they did not give you a sniper rifle as the Combine are seen using them throughout the game.			",2907,1027,99,266,347,21,392

												The Half-Life Series has left a legacy for a reason. Enough said. If you're planning on buying the games individually, dont. Search the ""Orange Box"" on steam and buy it instead. You get the entire series plus Portal, and it comes out cheaper. The Orange Bundle was on sale yesterday for $5 on greenmangaming. Its normally 20 dollars however, which is still a pretty good deal. I think i bought it for $10. so yeah, the bundle can save you some money if you place it on your wishlist and buy it on sale.			",112,20,1,16,6,0,5

												The game is alright, probably 10 years ago it was a masterpiece because of it's engine, story, physics.The weapons are nothing special: SMG, Rocket Launcher, Crossbow, etc are just the typical weapons, but what is unique is the gravity gun and brings more elements to the game.The game is actually pretty challenging. the atmosphere is actually pretty interesting, the zombie models are very detailed and give me the chillies. not to mention, the airboat and other vechiles are pretty fun itself. the story is really good also; for a character that doesn't really talk ever or even have a player model is pretty awesome.overall the game is pretty awesome, i'm not too huge like everyone else. again probably 10 years ago it was a masterpiece. probably that's why everyone is still hyped for half-life 3, because I can't wait too.

												The master of horror games is back!!! Major graphic improvements than the previous Half Life 1 series. You will need to kill even more monsters in this game, that's not all...the most important thing is...you will need to use your ammo wisely and make every shots that you fired count...you will not get much ammo drop than the previous game. Why am I saying this?? The reason is because there are a number of times that I have almost used up every weapon's ammo. Recommended on getting this game when it goes on sale, you will not regret in getting this game. 10/10 for this massive improvement of the Half-Life game			",219,26,4,15,12,0,6

												Half-Life 2, the game that like it's predecessor is seen as a classic. It's time for me to find out if the game still holds up. The story takes place some years after the events of the original Half-Life. Gordon Freeman is woken up by G-Man to find out that the world had been taken by the alien Combine. Gordon is then joined by resistance fighters to find a way to free humanity. The gameplay itself is a mixture of shooting, puzzle solving and exploration much like the first Half-Life game. However, all of this is differently executed in Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2 everything is even more dynamic, because of objects being destructible and having physics, which can result in some memorable chain reactions. The world felt to me like a real open world game, while it is still a pretty linear game. This has to do with the fact that you are mostly outside and you can explore the different areas and interact with npcs. The world you play in is around the same city area, which means that this time you aren't going to other alien dimensions. When you think about it there aren't actually that many new things in Half-Life 2. But the things that are new still deliver new gameplay. For instance, the gravity gun that you get can grab and shoot objects which is great for murdering and puzzle solving. The gravity gun really adds a playfulness to the game. The other real new weapon is the bug bait which is a ball that you can throw on enemies or destinations, which will result in a group of your own aliens going to it and attacking the enemies. The only problem I had with this is that you can only use this weapon in a certain section.  The other new gameplay feature is that you can now drive a buggy at certain parts. I read people saying that it was the worst part of Half-Life 2. In my opinion even though the buggy feels clunky I loved that part the most. It really gives that open world explorer feeling, because of you have to get out of the vehicle to look around. The sounddesign in this game was also done by the same team as the one that worked on the original Half-Life. I can say that I liked this soundtrack even more than the previous one, because of it having more of its’ own style. The epic music sometimes felt a little off though, but they are still fun to listen to. The sound effects add a quirky feeling, and the voice acting is also professionaly executed. The storytelling of the game was mostly well executed, with also including storytelling through gameplay. Sadly, unlike in its’ predecessor, you are forced at certain parts to listen to conversations. This can be pretty annoying if you have to listen to it again, without the option to skip it. I have to say that overall the world, story and gameplay doesn't feel as flawlesly connected as it was in the previous Half-Life. That probably has to do with the fact that the game also wanted to show everything impressive that the engine could do. The game took me 12 hours to complete so it was shorter than the original Half-Life, but I guess that also has to do with the fact that at the beginning I unknowingly played on the easiest difficulty. Later I found out I could actually change it in the options menu. Even with the complaints I have with Half-Life 2 compared to Half-Life 1, I can still recommend it. The game like its’ predecessor was greatly ahead of its’ time, and at some parts maybe still is. While playing I realized that every futuristic game that I played that came out after Half-Life 2 all had big 'inspiration' from the game.  Half-Life 2 is still adventurous enough that it still holds up. Reviews of the other Half-Life games:Half-LifeHalf-Life: Opposing ForceHalf-Life: Blue Shift ",131,29,1,9,5,0,6

A perfect example of a game that never gets oldHalf-Life 2 is undoubtedly a dream dreamed fans of the series. Elaborated in detail, oppressive climate on many levels, from the science fiction thriller to horror in the style of Night of the Living Dead, long memorable. Valve Software work is a must read for any self-respecting player who appreciates not only the intensity of the game, but also its refinement. I get caught for hours, fueling the desire to have both additives, and after graduation to join the crowds at Valve seat, shouting: 'Release Episode Three!'. The game did not impress me in the slightest.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

I was invested in scenes that were serious and the game actually got me scared at a certain segment. The puzzles are also entertaining to do, but not too hard to solve.

At first this game gave me a huge mind blow, all the HUGE changes in the graphics, and the story. The game is so well made and its honestly worth every cent. I Highly recommend on getting this game, especially to the 98' kinds who have also grown with the first Half Life games and Counter Strike 1.6.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Half-Life 2 is an amazing game.Half-Life 2's level design is really good and does a good job at letting you be in a confined space but not letting you feel trapped. It feels authentic in a sense that, if you're in a specific level, you're trapped by actual walls or solid and visible objects; as opposed to invisible objects. Some would think that it might have invisible walls with a futuristic touch, like blue lines going through it, since it is a Sci-Fi game.Half-Life 2 also does an excellent job and making you feel scared. There is one level, Ravenholm, it is absolutely filled with zombies, it is a very dark and eerie level. I remember, the entire time I was playing through it, I was extremely terrified, but had to power through. It was hard.Half-Life 2's combat is pretty spot on, almost no errors anywhere with hitboxes being fine and no noticeable or game-breaking bugs. The game also has a variety of weapons.Half-Life 2 lets you drive 2 vehicles in the game, one of which is a Jeep, it is a very fast land-vehicle. It is mildly difficult to control while at high speeds, which isn't a bad thing, it's to be expected. The Airboat is a fast land and water vehicle which is noticeably difficult to control, at almost any time. The game has a good sue of vehicles in specific levels.Half-Life 2's soundtrack and sounds do sound very modern. The soundtrack is extremely good, and chooses what to play at specific times, but even so, the music it does actually play is very good. Even now, while writing this review, I am listening to part of the soundtrack, Triage at Dawn, it is called. A very, very nice part of the soundtrack. The sounds, even crowbarring a toilet or a wall, do sound very real.The game, I should talk about, doesn't, for me, at least, do an excellent job at keeping you hooked, it took me a while in between play-sessions to get back into it. But I very recently finished it.This all makes out to be a very pleasant gaming experience, and it is highly recommended as a game.91/100 ",53,5,1,2,9,1,11

												Let's get this out of the way: the Source engine is showing its age – later Valve games have incorporated upgrades that are lacking in Half-Life 2. There isn’t much detail compared to more recent games, textures are blurry, and there are problems with lighting and shadows. All of that is true, but it really isn’t fair to criticize the game for that…it was made in 2004, and it looks like it was, but that doesn’t take away from how fun it is to play. And besides, if you’re really concerned about the graphics, you can always download one of the free community mods (Half-Life 2: Update for example) which make it look prettier.On to my thoughts on the gameplay. I think the reason Half-Life 2 was (and still is) so successful is because the gameplay constantly evolves as you progress forward. As soon as you become comfortable, you’re presented with something which changes how you can approach each situation. After playing the beginning – which feels like a fairly standard shooter – you’re given the airboat and giant arenas to play around with. After a while of that, they give you a machine gun on the airboat, changing up how you use it. Then you’re given the gravity gun, and immediately thrust into Ravenholm, a haunting and creepy environment filled with saw blades, barrels, and other things you can throw at enemies. Then comes the dune buggy and ant-lions, and some of my favorite sections of the game. Traveling down Highway 17, dodging ant-lions as you ferret out combine strongholds on the coast, showcases some of the best that Half-Life 2 has to offer.But the game isn’t done throwing new things at you. After fighting the ant-lions, you’re given a tool which makes them your allies, and you use them to assault Nova Prospekt, a claustrophobic prison where you’re given access to automated turrets and have to stand your ground against waves of Combine soldiers. Once you’ve escaped Nova Prospekt, you’re thrown into a full-blown rebellion and given command of a squad of resistance fighters. And then finally, at the end of the game, all of your weapons are taken away except for a super-powered gravity gun, and you get to experience what it’s like to throw men around like rag dolls as you rampage through the citadel.Not all of these are executed perfectly – the squad command sections in particular hilariously showcase the shortcomings of the AI, with companions constantly getting in your way, running out to die from snipers or grenades, and generally acting like morons. Some of the pacing, particularly at the beginning of the game as you run through sewer after sewer and later as you crawl through Nova Prospekt, is tedious and repetitive. But it’s worth playing through those sections to see what comes next, because there’s always something new around the corner.Half-Life 2 still does a far better job than most recent games in shifting the game’s paradigm constantly, and that evolving gameplay makes it successful – and fun to play over a decade later. If it’s been a while since you played it, it’s worth it to revisit it. If you’ve never played it before, it won’t wow you with its looks, but you’ll experience a classic with some of the best gameplay around – and widely considered one of the best games ever made.View the full review here[www.thesewall.com].

The game includes Source SDK, which is needed for (at least some) of the Half-Life 2 mods (e. g. Synergy). Overall, I think it's great game, and has stood up pretty well over the years, and once you're done with this, go ahead and get the other two episoooooodes. Yaaaaaaaay.

This game is amazing- the gameplay, the atmosphere, the things you interact with is just awesome. One of the best FPS games ever made.

												This is one of the few games where you can believe the hype and not be let down in the slightest.  I had been told for YEARS how much of an experience this was but never gave it a shot... Until now.  My mind was blown from the first few minutes and onward it just got better & better.  A true classic in every way.  From the intensely immersive gameplay to the atmospheric and captivating world - Half Life 2 brings you into City 17 and renders it in a way that feels tangible.  Often times I found myself speaking for Gordon only to realize I was just muttering in sheer awe of the technical marvels presented for the time.  I can see roots of modern games like Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite and how they stemmed from this masterpiece.  10/10, 5 stars, two thumbs up and all of the praise I can give.  Valve needs to put out Half-Life 3 or work on another game similar to this as I know that I would pre-order it instantly.  What a genre bending adventure, worth every penny and every minute!

												Half-Life 2 is one of those games that everyone has, but not everyone has played. I still get surprised whenever I come across someone who spends a lot of time playing games, but hasn't finished (or even played) Half-Life 2.The story telling in this game is fantastic. The story, characters and levels are well developed and it's clear just how much time went into making the game. I love all the detail put into level design, character development and design, and voice acting.Some people think the graphics are a little dated, which is true. It's a game from 2004. But if anything, I think it adds to the feel of the game. Additionally, what game will never have it's graphics dated? Technology changes people, gosh.If you have Half-Life 2 in your steam library but haven't yet played or are yet to acquire a copy, I strongly recommend giving it a shot. You won't regret it. You'd better be quick though, you'd want to finish it before Half-Life 3 is released!And of course you've gotta love some ABHing, wall climbing and grenade jumping while speedrunning!Super highly recommended!Happy Life Halving!

												Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life.The game focus on storyline set after the event of Half-Life, in a City 17 somewhere in Eastern Europe. You play as Gordon Freeman, the protagonist from Half-Life and embark on a new journey as he return from G-man stasis. The world that he once knew has changed, the Combine has taken over. Now he must struggle along with his fellow human resistance for survival.Using the new Source Engine, Half-Life 2 has remarkable graphics and far better than the previous Half-Life game. The new physics are incredible, almost everything is moveable. Textures and effects are also even more beautiful. The best graphics of the time.It's a good classic first-person shooter game with the best story, I recommend this.Rating 10/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Half-Life 2 (stylized as HλLF-LIFE2) is a first-person shooter video game and the sequel to Half-Life (1998). Developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on November 16, 2004, following a five-year $40 million development, during which a substantial part of the project was leaked and distributed on the Internet. The game was developed alongside Valve's Steam software. It introduced the Source game engine and, because of Steam, was the first single-player video game to require online product activation.Some years after the events of Half-Life, protagonist Gordon Freeman is woken by the enigmatic G-Man to find the world has been taken over by the alien Combine. Joined by allies including resistance fighter Alyx Vance, Gordon searches for a way to free humanity using a variety of weapons, including the object-manipulating gravity gun.Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 received critical acclaim. It was praised for its advanced physics, animation, sound, AI, graphics, and narrative. The game won 39 ""Game of the Year"" awards and the title of ""Game Of The Decade"" at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most important video games of all time. Over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 were sold at retail by December 3, 2008, (not including Steam sales); as of February 9, 2011, Half-Life 2 had sold over 12 million copies.Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman. The sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.A diverse set of enemies is present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; still others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers and medics, and can send his team further from him or call them back.Many of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can use these to build a crude staircase, so sometimes, multiple approaches lead to the desired outcome.Part-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects that he cannot manipulate without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).The game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.Half-Life 2 presents a dystopian alternate history of Earth, where the resources of the planet, including the human race itself, are being harvested by an oppressive multidimensional empire, known as the Combine. The game is set around the fictitious City 17, roughly 20 years after the events of its predecessor Half-Life.During Half-Life, the scientists, including Gordon Freeman, at the Black Mesa Research Facility, accidentally caused an inter-dimensional instability known as a resonance cascade and later as the ""Black Mesa Incident"", when an experiment on an alien crystal sample went wrong.[1] Alien creatures, such as the Vortigaunts and headcrabs, from the borderworld of Xen, flooded into the facility. Gordon fought his way through them and the government cover-up response combat units, making it to the Facility's Lambda Complex. There, the Lambda scientists helped Gordon teleport to Xen, where Gordon destroyed a large alien entity keeping the rift open. Gordon was then suddenly extracted by the mysterious G-Man, who had been watching Gordon over the course of the game. Impressed with his ability to survive against all odds, the G-Man offered him a job before placing him into stasis, which Gordon had no option but to accept.Some time after the ending of Half-Life, the instability at Black Mesa had attracted the attention of the Combine empire, and they invaded Earth. Humanity surrendered at the conclusion of the resulting ""Seven Hour War"". City 17 became the home of the gigantic Combine Citadel, and Dr. Wallace Breen, the Administrator of Black Mesa who had negotiated the surrender, was appointed representative and Administrator to supervise the survivors on behalf of the Combine.[2] Unable to breed due to a Combine suppression field, humanity matured. The Combine implemented a brutal police state of Civil Protection officers and Overwatch soldiers by recruiting and biologically assimilating humans and other species. Meanwhile, an underground ""Lambda Resistance"" of humans and Vortigaunts, now working together, was formed. This saw Freeman as a saviour who would lead them to freedom.20 years after the Resonance Cascade, the Combine emerge from the portal with advanced technologies, enabling them to conquer the world in 7 hours. Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man, who inserts him into a train arriving at City 17.[3] After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport to Eli's resistance base known as Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory in City 17, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to progress on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.[4][5]Gordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets another resistance scientist, Dr. Judith Mossman.[6] Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot D0g and gives him a ""gravity gun"", an instrument which allows Gordon to easily pick up and move large objects. Black Mesa East comes under Combine attack, and Eli and Mossman are taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Separated from Alyx, Gordon takes a detour through the zombie-infested town of Ravenholm with help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon arrives at a Resistance outpost. He uses a customized dune buggy to travel across a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt.

												Half-Life in 1998 changed the FPS genre forever with its storytelling technique and graphics.  Half-Life 2 set the standard once again.  A perfect sequel to the original game that is still a blast to play.  Half-Life 2 offers great graphics, great sound, great action and pacing of the action, great storytelling and possibly still one the greatest 1984 like atmospheres ever created.  This is a lengthy game and well worth every minute.  A good variety of enemies, NPCs, sceneries and vehicles to ride.  This is still the game that all games should be compared to.

												A classic staple for anyone wanting a good FPS game to get started with on Steam.My favorite part was when the combine decided it was a great idea to still charge at me in the dozens despite watching me having just gone through most of their forces like a kitten catching and eating a mouse. Needless to say, many laughs were had all around as they Combine seemed to have no issue with the losses and kept on going.Meanwhile, most people standing aside Gordon were dumb enough to usually stand in his way and became meat shields, only for more to join and continue to do what they do best, stand in the way and try to reassure Gordon he has ""no reason to worry."" Five seconds later they are down for the count, Gordon, Alyx, and Eli move on.The game has many fun things all around, shotguns, gravity guns, rockets, grenades, crowbars, shotguns, antlion minions, magnums, crossbows, shotguns, allies dying beside you by being complete idiots. Oh, did I mention shotguns yet?9.5/10 - Great Comedy FPS, would play again for the comedic value that Gordon's allies provide.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												John Freeman walked like speed of light back to his motorcycl and left behind the bad place behind him. John Freeman had to ride his motorcycle really fast back to the office but John Freemans gas ran out. John Freeman jumped fast off the motorcycle and landed on dead peoples hands.""Gordon Freeman is now these hands... i must kill the next boss and live up to full-life consequences!"" John Freeman said out loud.John Freeman picked up a laser gun and aimed it at trees to see if he could. John Freeman shot and tree fell down in front of him. John Freeman seen eggs fall out of the tree and he put them back home safe.""These birds dont have to see Gordon Freeman yet. its not time."" John Freeman said to him.John Freeman had to walked faster and was back at his office work and on a computer. He looked on the internet and found the next boss.""I know his weakness now"" John Freeman said. And after that he got emails from someone. John Freeman opened up the emails and read them.""Dear John Freeman, how are you? I miss you at home come home safe and soon with Gordon Freeman for thanksgiving dinner. Love mom."" John Freeman looked at it and got sad and yelled ""I WILL KILL THE BOSS AND GORDON FREEMAN WILL BE HAPPY SOUL!"" then he turned on off the computer and wet on the platform again down to his other more faster motorcycle that had gas in it this time.John Freeman put the laser gun on his motorcycle and his machine gun and his rocket gun that he found on the side of the motorcycle. He went through traffic and went fast like litning to back to Ravenholm and back to the bad place where Gordon Freeman was. John Freeman went off road and did backflips and landed on back wheels but kept going too.John Freeman went really fast again like before and was soon back again at Ravenholm but saw more zombie goasts. John Freeman said to them ""Zombie goasts i have killed your friends at the old house and i dont want to shoot your heads. move near the countrysides and you will be friends of John Freeman."" The zombie goasts said that ""no we will kill you"" and walked fast to John Freemans motorcycle. John Freeman waited until they were in front of his motorcycle and backflipped off his bars and shot heads below and landed and walked fast to where the next boss was.""you will be one of us!"" yelled the dead zombie goasts. John Freeman laughed and shot a rocket at them.John Freeman saw the next boss far down the road and walked slow this time. He walked really slow like a turtle and sat down on a rock and watched the next boss near the dead last boss and where the place that Gordon Freeman was. The next boss was laughing at John Freeman so John Freeman said ""YOU WILL NOT LAUGH AT ME!"" and shot a rocket at him since that was his weakness.The next boss died and John Freeman was happy. He walked over to the dead bosses and put them under the ground and planted pants on them so instead of messy dirt and dark there was pretty things there now to be happy.John Freeman walked to where Gordon Freeman was lying dead and crushed from the next bosss feet and looked down. A tear droped out of John Freemans eye and landed on Gordon Freeman.""You are dead bro and i killed the evil boss."" John Freeman told Gordon FreemanThen John Freeman saw something bad. A headcrab was on Gordon Freeman! Gordon Freeman standed up and said ""John Freeman... you got here slow and now i am zombie goast. you will pay...""to be continued...? ",120,7,0,2,3,1,13

												oh Half-life 2... if i can compare it to a real life situation imma say when you like after divorcing your first wife, ...yeah it was a hard divorce but still it was meant to happen, and right now you are with your second wife, she is very beautiful you never imagined that you can have this majestic creature as a wife but as i said same with hl2 no matter how much time you play with it, how much a good time you spent with your wife you will unfortunately get bored so you are dreaming of a third one but you know deep down inside you that you can't have a third wife..., yeah sure the divorce worked with the first one but the 2nd wife is your last chance cuz you know you grow older and you wont have another more beautiful wife than this one so you keep dreaming of a much beautiful and much younger woman but when you wake up it'll all go away, so you keep praying to our lord and saviour daily to fulfill your wish, your dream but he never listen to us, all what he does after all this years of waiting with doubts is an AMA on reddit and respons to some questions with salty respons and leaves you without any real respond no comfirmation at all, why lord Gaben WHY...we..i just want Half-life 3 :'(anyways one of the best games 10/10 would divorce again			",21,0,0,0,1,1,0

												Half Life 2 was released in 2004, 6 years after the first one. As i said in my Half Life review, the game revolutionized the FPS genre.https://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/70/It was among the first games to add narrative to its game. To account for the change, it also made the level design very linear. Previously, FPS games would have a very maze like level design.Half Life 2's budget consisted of $40,000,000. I am not sure how much time and money was spent on the source engine itself, but from the development timeline, it seems that source engine was developed from the very 1999, shortly after release of HL1. Why do i want to emphasize of the source engine so much? Well, the main goal of the source engine was to provided realistic physics and facial animations.StoryIn the first game a portal opens up from a planet named Xen. You end up destroying the Queen, thus braking the portal link and ending up in captivity of Gman. The events of Half Life 2 happen 20 years after Half Life 1, somewhere in a eastern Europe town called City 17. Human race got enslaved by Combine, an alien race that was in war with Xen, which got interested in Earth after the events of Half Life 1. Gman decides to send you to City 17 to help the resistance.The realistic facial animations, and graphics in general that source engine provided really add up to the experience. The character really come to life thanks to those facial animations.The faces looked very real unlike say, Max Payne. It really took some time for that technology to appear in mainstream games. Sure, by 2004 there were plenty amount of games that would have a very narrative focus, like Fahrenheit (2005) for PS2. But just imagine how much more immersive it would look if it actually tried to focus on facial animations. Half Life 2 had one of the best facial animation techniques, until LA Noire came out. That game used motion capture.I also felt satisfied with the level the game provided. A zombie town for example. Or a land with arachnid creatures popping out of the sand. The boat chase. Or the one where you have to use the crane to get you car to the other side of the gate. Finally, there is a final chapter with a gravity gun.GameplayHalf Life 2 was the first game to feature physics. Because of that it allowed them to explore new horizons.The game would give the player a gravity gun, which allows you to use objects from the environment to your advantage. You can pick up sharp objects and cut enemies in half with them, or use explosive barrels to lite them up, or simply smash them with something heavy, or even something like tossing back a grenade.There are also new enemy types. New head crabs types were added. They also decided to improve on the zombies aspect of the game and even added a variety of zombie types to the game. There are also arachnid creatures, sort of like ones from Starship Troopers. At one point in the game, you will be able to control them.When you are not fighting these guys, you will be fighting the Combine, who use guns. At times you will also be fighting striders, which are 3 legged machines, sort of like the ones from War of the Worlds. Finally, sometimes you will also be fighting small flying drones. Due to their size, you can actually use the gravity gun. They are also sharp, so you can even cut with them.Thankfully, they decided to dial back on the amount of platforming in this game, though the game had puzzles added, mostly physics related.The game has a total 13 chapters, which is about 15 hours of gameplay.Additionally, it also provides a huge mod library. A lot of my favorites came about by being mods of HL2. Games like Chivalry, Natural Selection, Stanley Parable, Insurgency.			",498,99,13,68,57,7,114

I never understood why Half Life 2 fans loved the game so much.. Until i played it!First ImpressionAt the very beginning I couldn't understand much because it was hell breaking down and there was a lot of running and shooting.. At the same time i couldn't stop emphasizing on how atmospheric the game was. When things calmed down, characters appeared and storyline started making sense.. Amazing!The Beginning(no spoilers)A town that lacks of green, made of worn off buildings with rusty vehicles that don't work anymore. This is the first place we ended up first. Afraid civilians don't talk to each other and remain silent and scattered, while CivilProtection serves and protects the crap out of us all with taser clubs. Men and women dressed in full body suits, speaking through a voice distorter to sound unnatural, became one with the tyrant system just to ensure a better meal.You, Doctor Freeman, try to escape the town, and then it all starts..EnvironmentThe distorted voices of the CivilProtection and the Overwatch Soldiers and the heavily mechanized radio chats/dialogues, the hot deserts and wet sewers, the dark buildings and the empty highways affect the gameplay really heavily. Half Life 2 was the only game that made me forget to blink, thanks to its ability to totally mesmerize me and make me think that i really was out there surrounded by danger!CharactersCharacters are so sophisticated.. They were not made to look pretty (damn these cinematic mods), but their personality and actions earn your admiration and soon after you start to care about their well being.On the other hand, teams of rioted civilians that form around you are not that smart AI and end up serving as meatshields for you to survive, which is sad.WeaponsDespite the real life weapons (TBH crowbars never looked so badass!), there are weapons like Gravity Guns, Pulse Rifles and Bugbait seeds. Bugbait seeds are seeds that help you manipulate and use against the enemies a specified species of monster (Antlions) that would otherwise attack you. Enemies have sniper rifles, but we never got our hands on them.EnemiesWhile the enemy humans are after us, many nightmare fuel monsters turn against us too as we get in their way. The notorious headcrab'ed zombies that slowly hunt us down and the skinny taller ones that run - or even climb - towards us and let out a haunting scream as they jump upon us! The barnacles hanging from the ceilings, the toxic headcrabs and many others make their appearance throughout the game.Stage ProgressingHalf Life 2 is one of those games where there is only one way towards the end of the stage, that is tricky to find out. Moving on requires thinking of ways to move obstacles or to raise gates etc. It won't fit to players who want a game just to kill time. You have to deal with puzzles here!OutroIt's a 10/10 game. I loved it. It is so well made i can't find something to whine about. If you don't have it yet, just get it. If you already have it, play it again!Now.. Where is Half Life 3..?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not as good or as original as the First Half-Life, Half-Life 2 continues the story of Gorden Freeman, following the events of Half-Life. Taking place some time in the future, Gorden must navigate his way though a drastically changed world, encountering old friends and foe's alike. Supplied with a varied array of weaponry and access to mission-critical mounts like the modified buggy, Half-Life 2 offers new challenges and hidden secrets to satisfy lovers of the series. All in all, not a bad game, but not as good as the original.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												This is the source game engine. This game was the bomb when it came out in 2004 and it is still known as one of the best FPS games on the market but this game has a huge bit of history behind it when Valve finished Half-Life 1 they wanted to make a sequel right away but in 2003 after the E3 showcase of the game an ANON German hacker had leaked the files onto the internet and at the time the game was virtually unplayable. This also leaked some CSS BETA content and TF2 ALPHA content but this was one of the biggest thefts at the time and it will stand out in gaming history for a long time and it will always be with the people that have lived through 2003. Finally in 2004 this game was released to the general public with an outstanding physics engine, astonishing shader detail, a jampacked level editor in the files and daziling facial posing NOW can you see why this game is defined as a classic. BECAUSE IT DID SUCH A GOOD JOB AT BEING ONE YA DINGUS. My final rating for this game is a 10/10 since it also has full joystick support BOOM oh and it has GMOD content.			",80,7,0,3,4,0,2

												I have to finally review this. It's probably my favorite game of all time. Other shooters may surpass it in some ways, but Half-Life 2 is the most meticulously crafted FPS campaign I've ever played. The pacing is unsurpassed and Valve does a great job of adding variety without resorting to cheap tricks. It's a must play on PC.

												I think Half Life 2 is a great first person shooter from 2004, with a 9-10 hour single player campaign. There are a wide variety of weapons to use, along with well hidden lambda caches to find and use to your advantege as you battle through City 17 and through the outskirts. However, I don't think Half Life 2 is as amazing as most people claim it to be. ""10/10. 11/10. Best game ever!"" It kinda makes me laugh... With Half Life 2 being a very solid shooter. I find It difficult to follow the story, or figure out why these events in the game are happening; It feeels like it's out of nowhere. For example: The Combine. They are not in the original Half Life. All that's explained is they are this Inter dimensional organization That wants to enslave Humanity, and you have to fight them. Sequel bait endings are the least of satisfying endings ever, and this game has that.I rate Half Life 2 with a solid 8/10. When this game goes on sale, definitely pick it up. I got the Half Life Collection for about $5.00That's my review for Half Life 2 and I will see you on the next one.     Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548			",67,2,1,1,2,0,0

												In the spirit of it's predecessor, Half-Life 2 was a groundbreaking FPS at the time it was released.  Most notably was it's use of in-game physics.  Many objects (including enemies) can be used to solve various puzzles and used as weapons throughout this experience.  The actual story is somewhat of an enigma, but the path you are driven to follow and the characters you meet along the way make journey enjoyable nonetheless.  I never experienced the feeling that I was killing enemies simply because I had to progress or the play becoming monotonous.  Each chapter, and indeed the many parts of thereof, was composed of a variety of challenges that were easy enough to pick up but not always as easy to execute.  The only con I can come up with is the squad you get at a point in the game and their inability to stay out of your way at times (especially in narrow hallways D:).    This fast-paced shooter belongs in every action gamer's library. Bravo Valve!			",259,133,3,43,11,0,13

												After many years I finally completed HL2 and its expansions, and really, it's a game that stands out in the FPS genre.The gameplay is fluid and dynamic, has a satisfactory pace that keeps you stuck to the game and can dose the action sequences with parts that you should play more cautiously, exploring the environment. The AI is a strong point, and although there is little variety of enemies, you don't have a repetitiveness feeling while playing. The Source Engine needs no comments, even after almost 10 years of launching the graphics and physics effects are still convincing. The sound effects are also great.It's in the plot that the game stands out even more, the story is great and is able to keep you immersed in the storyline like few games can, there is a good dose of mystery about some events and some of the most epic and charismatic characters. Gordon Freeman is arguably the most badass and emblematic protagonist of the gaming world, without even saying a single word. The secondary characters are also well-built and charismatic.I highly recommend for those who haven't played. In case of not having played the first and its expansions, is good to seek a source with information about the events prior to this title.9/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

Half Life 2 is my favourite one, for it's variety of enemies, characters, creatures and puzzely levels, that sometimes will block you on a point of the map and let you think for minutes ""Where the hell is the way?"" (don't worry, you'll figure out). Last but not least, the story and the audio are amazing. You should quit gaming if you didn't play Half-Life.			",104,5,4,11,6,0,4

												This is the classic Valve first person shooter single person campaign.  If you buy one game on Steam, this and the Half Life 2 episodes should be it.The classic story of Gordon Freeman. Exploreable environments and useable / moveable objects, voiceover actors with alternate conversations. Is linear but you can explore alittle of each map.  Autosave works good.  Has a great story. Has Steam achievements and badge cards. It may be old, but still very good.And there are plenty of interesting free Modded games that require Half-Life 2 on Steam.for more info:

												More than 9 years old and it's still better than what other FPS games are being churned out today.  Instead of being some elite marine, Gordon Freeman is nothing but a scientist forced to fight for suvival.  And the game plays like that.  Without your Biohazard suit you feel about as useful as any of the other Citizens in the world.Each level is unique and brings around its own gameplay challenges and puzzles.  Do you stop at that house with the smoke comming from it, or continue without stopping?  It's your choice, you are not expected to defeat every single enemy you come across, you can just simply run away.  Not always though.The enemy AI is efficient, even if it may cheat somewhat.  They will advance and use cover, use flanking techniques and move as a squad.  It is let down how it seems to know exactly where you are, even after losing line of sight.  Or perhaps the AI is more intelligent than I'm giving it credit for and can hear my footsteps?  Gordon does sound flat footed at times.The physics engine is still absolutely amazing and well oiled. Need to get over a ledge, but it's too tall?  Good job there is a see-saw next to it, just load the other end with all those bricks lying around to counter balance your weight.  Can't get that draw bridge down, because you are on the wrong side?  No problem, knock it over with that crane.  Ran out of ammo?  Well luckly there is a toilet bowl here and the gravity gun is fully charged.If there is only one thing to gipe about and I do have only the one.  It's the companion AI.  Wait, just here me out.  It starts out fine, with Alyx, just the one.  She get's in your way a bit now and then.  Nothing too annoying, even though she sticks to you like glue and will follow you down every small dead end ally or single exit room.  She will apologize for being in your way, then move away a bit a moment later.  OK, not too much of a problem.  Then you get 4 companions.  All do the same, all stick to you like glue when going down dead end ally ways and block the exit.  The companions can apologise as much about being in the way they as they can, but it will get infuriating at times.  I was evantually glad when a strider wiped them out in a later mission, with no site of reinforcements.Voice acting is tremendous and you also form bonds with the main characters.  Helped along with the facials expressions the engine is capable of.  I don't remember seeing another video game where so much detail can be put through via facial expressions to show the emotions of each character.In closing, Half-Life 2 is a brilliant FPS which hits the right notes in almost every area.  While not a technically impressive as some games released today, the game mechanics are solid and provides an interesting universe and characters to explore.  If you have nether played it, buy it now.  There is no reason to wait for it to go on sale either.			",229,18,2,16,14,2,36

												This is the best Valve game of all time, probably is my favourite game. The game cost me 1.99, on sale, the regular price is 9.99. It has beautiful views, places and every single detail is incredible for a 2004 game ... and how did they made those graphics in 2004 ?! It´s just beautiful! The game had never crashed or bugged, it works very well in my laptop, and I don´t have a Gaming PC. The action is very exciting, I was never bored playing this game. From rooftop chases and helicopter chases with a futuristic jetski and incredible and creative guns, Half-Life 2 will always be a great game.			",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Ho rigiocato HL2 dopo 10 anni. Ho impiegato 4 giorni a finirlo, contro il mese impiegato 10 anni fa. Questo mi rassicura non poco riguardo alla mia memoria e capacità di apprendimento, evidentemente non ancora del tutto devastate dall'età... Il gioco si presenta ancora molto bene, e quando si inizia è difficile smettere (un po' come con le sigarette). Certo lo stupore provato la prima volta, per la grafica, la fisica e il gameplay oggi non c'è più, ma il divertimento è comunque ancora assicurato. I percorsi obbligati, gli enigmi mai troppo complicati e le ottime possibilità di salvataggio rendono il gioco sempre scorrevole e mai frustrante. L'HDR ha reso la grafica ancora più realistica (per un gioco di 10 anni fa, ovviamente). Un po' lenti i caricamenti, e i salvataggi  causano spesso momentanei inceppamenti, particolarmente fastidiosi a livello audio. Resta in ogni caso un gioco fondamentale, una vera pietra miliare da non perdere assolutamente.I replayed HL2 after 10 years. It took me four days to finish it, against the month took 10 years ago. That reassures me more than a little about my memory and learning ability, apparently not yet completely devastated by age ... The game is still very good, and when you start it is hard to stop (a bit like with cigarettes). Certainly the astonishment felt the first time, for graphics, physics and gameplay today is no more, but the fun is still yet assured. The obligatory paths, the puzzles never too complicated and very good chances of saving make the game always smooth and never frustrating. The HDR made even more realistic graphics (for a ten years old game, of course). A little slow the loadings, and saving often produced momentary jamming, particularly annoying to hear.It is in any case a crucial game, a milestone not to be missed.			",25,2,3,0,3,0,1

												I am your college professor that you requested, with a doctorate in Mathematics. I will break this down as simply as possible and end this debate as approx. 10 students have already asked me this today. The problem as it is written is 6÷2(1+2) , the ÷ cannot be substituted with a fraction bar because they have different ranks on the order of operations. It is an illegal math move to do this. The bar ranks with parentheses, ÷ is interchangeable with *. therefore the problem must be solved as 6÷2(1+2) NOT 6 (over) 2(1+2) we do the parentheses first, so 6÷2(3), the parentheses are now no longer relevant, because the number inside is in it's simplest form. Every single number has implied parentheses around it. 6÷2(3) (6) ÷(2)(3) 6÷2*3, or even converting the division to multiplication by a reciprocal (a legal math move) (6)(1 (over) 2)(3) are all correct ways to write this problem and mean exactly the same thing. Using pemdas, where md and as are interchangeable, we work from left to right, so (3)(3) or 3*3= 9 Just because something is implied rather than written does not give it any special rank in the order of operations.The problem in it's simplest form, with nothing implied would look like this: (1+1+1+1+1+1 (over) 1) ÷ (1+1 (over) 1) * ((1(over) 1) + (1+1 (over) 1)) From here, nothing is implied, This again, works out to 9. If the symbol '/' was used this whole debate would be ambiguous since that symbol can mean ""to divide by"" or it could mean a fraction bar. HOWEVER, because the ÷ symbol is used, it can not be changed to mean a fraction bar because that would change the order of operations and thus the whole problem, you can't change a symbol to mean something because you want to, in doing so you are changing the problem. Once and for all, the answer is 9. But 9-6=3 thereforeHalf-Life 3 confirmed			",173,29,1,14,10,0,2

												Despite being an FPS where most guns are not particularly satisfying to shoot (crossbolt is an exception!), it overcomes that weirdness with awesome set-pieces and level design. An intriguing though vague story and amazing music help, and it's fairly lengthy. Just give in a little to the game's world, and you'll take a lot of enjoyment out of it.			",432,125,15,47,30,6,77

												John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.to be continued..?			",59,10,0,3,3,1,6

												I recently finished this game, after playing the first one and the expansion packs. I already called Half-Life 1 one of the best games i've ever played, but this one is my all-time favourite.The game is not even nearly perfect, it is perfect. It's action packed, it got GREAT graphics, animations and more for a game from 2004 and it even got moments which were truly epic.Unlike the first one, this one offers more puzzles, greater and more evoirments and more action and even a little bit of horror in it. You not only fight against one enemy, no you get to fight headcrabs, helicopters, City 17 Guards, zombies and more. You kill them on your own creative way around the middle of the game when you get more weapons like the Gravity gun, one of my favourites. It let you travel to so many cool area's and not only on foot.. You get to travel to there with for example a car. Absolutly amazing. It's one of the few games of 2004 that offered so many beatiful content and realistic fighting. For example, around the end of the game, you get to control rebels against City 17, they help you, and give you health if needed. Sure, it got it's bugs, sometimes it also brought me motion sickness.. But that didin't stopped me from playing it.The ending and the mysterious G-Man makes me wanna' play Episode 1, which i surely will. It's only 9 bucks, so if you want to spent that money on a epic journey with enough replay valaue, then go ahead. Buy this game, a game which i think, never gets old and always will stay one of a kind.Great job Valve, this is one of your games to be proud of. ",770,207,34,101,64,5,118

												An amazing game, a must buy, a must play, if you have enough money to buy it then just buy it now.Best way to buy it is through the Orange Box, not just do you get Half-LIfe 2 but also Episode One and Two, plus portal.An action packed game with great moments such as entering the Citadel and getting the Super-Charged Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator, or dashing through Ravenholm. Earth in this time of story has been taken over by Combine forces, but Half-Life isn't one to tell you the story uphand, that can be found with uncovering the deeper story. No time for cut-scences, well there aren't any but that's okay as it keeps you being the Gordon Freeman, it realy does imerse you in the game. Not just comat based based but also Physics too, with some here and there small Physcis puzzles. Later in the game as you progress, gather more weapons and more harder Combine enemies hunt you down you can take control of Antlion insects (something that was once an anoying enemy) and members of the Resistance (People like you who are trying take back Earth and their lives).Throwing and shooting explosive barrels is aways fun.Weapons of Crowbar and Gravity Gun, Glock and Magnum, SMG and Pulse Riffle (both have alt shots), Shotgun and Crossbow, and Grenades and RPG.There are two veichles in which you'll encounter in the game, the Boat and Buggy, personally I never liked the Boat and Water Hazard is one of my least liked chapters in the game, but the Buggy is pretty cool.There are boss battles (if you would call them that) from Hunter-Choppers, Gunships, Striders and Antlion Guards. Over coming these challanges is always an amazing thrill. Each place is always destinctively different and fun.The main problem I have with this game is that even with all this action, a lot of it at times felt a bit samey, but that is dealt with costant upgrade of tools and weapons. Another fault with the game (Both are fixed in Episode One and Two) is that you never seem to stay in one place, always constantly moving from a-b and no c, even though places are memerable.An amazing classic game and experience, with a rich story and lore. I loved it, if this is your first FPS (doesn't count only online ie. Counter Strike or TF2) then thats okay too as it was my first one, more amazingness then flaws, still holding up today in our modern day (Still doesn't have Valve's HDR) gameplay and graphicaly, a game that most FPS inspire too, the amazing, Half-Life 2. A must have, a must buy. Make sure you also get Episode One and Two (they are expansions), and best way to buy is through the Orange Box.In short words, an amazing Sci-Fi FPS and in all an amazing game, but not as good as it's sequals, amazing. You need to play this game.			",41,6,0,4,4,0,7

												An amazing game, a must buy, a must play, if you have enough money to buy it then just buy it now.Best way to buy it is through the Orange Box, not just do you get Half-LIfe 2 but also Episode One and Two, plus portal.An action packed game with great moments such as entering the Citadel and getting the Super-Charged Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator, or dashing through Ravenholm. Earth in this time of story has been taken over by Combine forces, but Half-Life isn't one to tell you the story uphand, that can be found with uncovering the deeper story. No time for cut-scences, well there aren't any but that's okay as it keeps you being the Gordon Freeman, it realy does imerse you in the game. Not just comat based based but also Physics too, with some here and there small Physcis puzzles. Later in the game as you progress, gather more weapons and more harder Combine enemies hunt you down you can take control of Antlion insects (something that was once an anoying enemy) and members of the Resistance (People like you who are trying take back Earth and their lives).Throwing and shooting explosive barrels is aways fun.Weapons of Crowbar and Gravity Gun, Glock and Magnum, SMG and Pulse Riffle (both have alt shots), Shotgun and Crossbow, and Grenades and RPG.There are two veichles in which you'll encounter in the game, the Boat and Buggy, personally I never liked the Boat and Water Hazard is one of my least liked chapters in the game, but the Buggy is pretty cool.There are boss battles (if you would call them that) from Hunter-Choppers, Gunships, Striders and Antlion Guards. Over coming these challanges is always an amazing thrill. Each place is always destinctively different and fun.The main problem I have with this game is that even with all this action, a lot of it at times felt a bit samey, but that is dealt with costant upgrade of tools and weapons. Another fault with the game (Both are fixed in Episode One and Two) is that you never seem to stay in one place, always constantly moving from a-b and no c, even though places are memerable.An amazing classic game and experience, with a rich story and lore. I loved it, if this is your first FPS (doesn't count only online ie. Counter Strike or TF2) then thats okay too as it was my first one, more amazingness then flaws, still holding up today in our modern day (Still doesn't have Valve's HDR) gameplay and graphicaly, a game that most FPS inspire too, the amazing, Half-Life 2. A must have, a must buy. Make sure you also get Episode One and Two (they are expansions), and best way to buy is through the Orange Box.In short words, an amazing Sci-Fi FPS and in all an amazing game, but not as good as it's sequals, amazing. You need to play this game.			",41,6,0,4,4,0,7

												This game is everything that the original game is not.  Indeed, Half-Life 2 is the franchise grown up, and proving that it still has legitimacy in todays gaming world.The story of Half-Life 2 is a bit of a roller coaster in that there are great moments of narrative flow and others where you are left scratching your head a bit thinking ""why did they put that in there?"".  But saying that, there are plenty of ups to the few downs.  The story is overall strong and immersive with a few deviations that help create a vibrant lore.The game mechanics are obviously much smoother, and well structured.  By todays standards, they stand up.  There are some nice features with the engine that work well.  The feel of the game when using certain weapons and the ability to manipulate some aspects of the environment help the gameplay support the story.  There are still a few things that don't seem right, such as no hands on steering wheels, being able to climb a ladder whilst simulatenously reloading or firing a heavy weapon, getting caught on obstacles, and the clumsy and altogether painful squads that do 2 things - 1) Die over and over, and 2) Get in your way when you need to do a run and gun (or often a grenade lob and duck).  The squad could definitely have used some more commands other than point and press C to have them run uselessly a couple feet before returning to interfere.The weapons pretty much were a joy to use, especially the Pulse Rifle and the SMG.  No alien weapons to use in this game, other than the Antlion Pheropods, and this was the clumsiest weapon.  A few odd decisions were made with some of the weapons though, especially the .357 Magnum revolver.  Having a total ammo store of 18 rounds resulted in this being an often unused weapon.  Surely, Gordon could carry more than 18 bullets for this gun, considering the number he could carry for some of the others like the 9mm with a total ammo store of 168.  I'm sure it was for a balance purpose, but only being able to carry 18 rounds felt silly and frivolous.  The magnum went from being a mainstay weapon of the original series to a bit of a joke weapon in my mind.Of the gameplay, I'm so happy that they decided to move away from the platform styled approach.  Moving across impossible terrain features and engineering in the original games made it feel like a caricature of a game.  Those titles didn't know if they were a shooter, narrative or platformer, often falling more towards the latter.  This game for the most part does away with that completely.  There are still a few gameplay components that aren't well thought out, mainly by being overly long and taking something novel and at first fun, and making it tedius - namely riding the airboat, and crossing the sand without touching it.  Both were fun at first, but quickly devolved into just hoping that it would soon be over, but nope - there was more and more of it.  Still, those didn't detract too much from the game as a whole.The passage of time in the game, like in the first one though, still seems odd.  The immersion of that point is lost easily with the change from night to day as you are constantly on the move, never seeming to rest.... Jack Bauer, eat your heart out.Overall, Half-Life 2 was and still is a great game, and my concerns with the game are more exagerated nitpicks than hangups.4.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The second game in the incredible Half Life series.Obviously this game has made VAST improvements over the original. In terms of graphics, gameplay, animations, etc. Not only that but it has a modding community. Now it may not be as grand as Bethesda's modding community. But what THIS particular modding can do uniquely is make fan-base games, and other things from the engine that Half Life 2 runs on. There aren't any real negatives to this game. Sure the vehicle controls are bit iffy when playing on a keyboard. But that's just a nitpick. You can just play this game with a controller. The game is pretty straight forward like the first one. You are 'now' legendary Gordon Freeman. You are thrusted back into the world that you ""left behind"" to come back and realize the world is different while you've been gone. A new threat has taken over the world and now it's up to you and the Resistance to put an end to the Combine.And of course, the game doesn't really give you everything all at once. It spoon feeds you. So don't expect all the answers to be um...answered! Lol. If you are a fan of the original Half Life. I recommend gettng this.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												Why are you reading the reviews? Why haven't you purchased this yet? Jokes aside, oh man, I can't express how much enjoyment I get when I play this game. Ultimately, this is my favorite game out of all the games I own.I owe it to one of my Steam friends who generously purchased the Half Life pack for me (while it was on sale too), for me so I could play Half Life. Out of all the Chapter's, Welcome To Ravenholm was the one I played the most, yet it's hilarious too because I HATE this chapter because I get scared way too easily. Yet the suspense when going through the town and being surprised by zombies or headcrabs, it's kinda hard to not hate this part of the entire game. Zappy's, as I call 'em, are now on the good side, and I'm glad because they shocked my♥♥♥♥♥too much in Half Life 1 lol. Damn Zappy's, why you gotta shock my butt so much? Another thing about the enemies/protagonists was the weapons you could use when you killed a Combine Soldier. 3OP5me. Overall, this is one of my favorites, I can play this so many times, but I wouldn't get tired of playing it no matter what. So stop wasting time reading this and buy this game!

												A must-have for PC gamers. While Half-Life 1 most certainly hasn't stood against the test of time, Half-Life 2 has aged like fine wine. Even ten years after it's release, the game looks and feels good. Playing as the mute Gordon Freeman, who arrives off the train in City 17, discovers that the city has been taken over by a force only known as the Combine. Shortly after, he meets the protagonists of the game. If I have to make a complaint, it's that none of the characters in Half-Life 2 besides Gordon and the Gman were in Half-Life 1, so you're just supposed to assume that they were there during the Black Mesa incident. To fully understand the story of Half-Life 1, all you have to do is watch the first ten minutes and the last five minutes of the game. I suggest that you skip straight to this one, and if you really want to pick up Half-Life 1 make sure it's less than $5.			",163,30,1,8,6,2,5

												Because you see what happened after Black Mesa, because you want Alyx and because it's the sequel of one of the best FPS in the world.Half-Life 2 is simply set in a world post-Black Mesa, where an entity known as the Combine took control of the Earth, thanks to Dr. Breen, your ex-boss, that negociated the peace. And what peace! Police is brutal, resistance fighters are sent to their death in Nova Prospekt or bombed with Headcrabs missiles, the extinction of mankind is planned as no children can be conceived because of a force field suppressor and Dr. Kleiner, your mentor, has as pet an Headcrab (which is a sort of disaster for your buddy Barney Calhoun.The gameplay is still the same: you shoot, you kill and you try to stay alive between Headcrabs, Antlions and Combine units. And with your arsenal (bazooka, smg, shotgun, crowbar, antlion stuff, crossbow, etc..), you'll be well equipped. The Gravity Gun is also THE new feature: you can take items and throw them or just carry them. And you'll love the Super Gravity Gun at the end of the game.The story will make you visit City 17 before and during the battle for freedom, you'll also take an escape road but very dangerous, see what happens when a town is bombed with missiles, meet a crazy priest, go to the beach, break into a high-security prison and even meet Dr Breen in person. The settings are varied, now that you're outside of Black Mesa and the scientific environement.The new enemies are the Combine Army, kinda replacing the HECU units sent to Black Mesa, but with a better technology, the Antlions, a new alien race, that will be your allies and new types of zombies due to new headcrabs: a faster one and a poisonous one. You can set them in fire too.You'll ride also a buggy and a hydroboat, which is changing from the wagon cart from Black Mesa.Otherwise, the allies will be resistance fighters with their chiefs like Eli, Alyx or Barney, though Alyx will be more your sidekick by moments than Barney. Also, the Vortigaunts, these aliens from Xen with green rays, freed from their enslavement, can assist you and recharge your protection.With the Source Engine, Valve managed to get beautiful graphics but also, good physics, thanks to the Gravity Gun being the new toy for many players.And the soundtrack! It's still marvelous. Still feeling danger or sad moments or adrenaline.Half-Life 2 can be seen as perfect in every aspect... apart the loading time. Or the fact that achievements got implemented at a late date after the release of the Orange Box on Steam (X-box owners had achievements in 2007, PC players got them finally in 2010).Anyway, fun, drama and action are present and Half-Life 2 is really a must-have.

												One of the best FPS games out there! It may be an exaggeration but Half Life 2 remains - even today - one of my favourite games. I believe this game aged well and it looks good even today which marks the 10-year anniversary of this game. Valve later on released some updates to the Source Engine so the game support widescreen and has some extra features to make it look and run better.Story-wise it is an excellent follow-up to the first game as now we have an alien race called Combine who have already invaded and enslaved humanity. Freeman - our numb protagonist - is now tasked with aiding those people who rose up to defy these visitors from space. While some of the creatures we encountered in the first episode return in Half Life 2 you mainly fight against humanoid-like creatures. It's a nice touch and it also showcases the artificial intelligence which is also superb in the game.There are varied environments in the game and there are two things that keep you interested throughout your progress: occasionally you can hop into a vehicle and drive to your next destination. Early on you cannot access this car but you can use a boat to go through a sewers-like stage. The second - and probably best - feature of the game is the Gravity Gun. A gun that does not have ammunition and requires objects - objects in your surroundings that you can pick up and launch at your enemies. There is a level specifically designed for this weapon; a level where ammo is a scarcity and you rely on the precision-aiming skill with the gravity gun.Single-player campaign offers a long (10-15 hour) experience and the game has two expansion packs (the two provide you with roughly 8-9 hours gameplay time). While Episode 1 is a bit of a letdown Episode 2 is an excellent expansion pack.I wish Valve concluded the story of Gordon Freeman with releasing a final episode (Episode 3) or a 3rd sequel. I believe this request - coming from not just me but from the community - is well justified.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Yes, I would like to start this review by saying that this is my second favorite FPS game. That is not say that it is in the second place because it is almost impossible to choose between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. And that would be unfair as well. These games are from different centuries but both are great, equally great. So what makes is so great? Let's find out... First and foremost I'm absolutely blown away by the story. Maybe not by the story itself but by the way it's told. The first game made me feel in the center of attention and action. It felt like it was very important to complete the mission but without making me feeling some sort of superhero that will win anyway. It may sound strange but I can't better words for it. And it continues here with one of the best intros I have seen in a game. Do you remember how the first game ended? Yes, it ended with a monologue of a man in a blue suit after which you agreed to work for him without really knowing who is working for. This game start with another monologue saying that the time has come for you to unleash all your skills and complete another very tall task. It all feels amazingly tense and even though you're ready to spring into action you are not a superhero so don't expect being handed a machinegun and go around shooting. As I said the narrative is outstanding throughout the game series and it makes it feel very realistic and natural. I don’t want to spoil it for you so I'll let you see it for yourself. What I can tell you though is the way I felt when I started playing. Let's continue then, shall we? So you awake several years after the end of the first part. It is somewhere in the eastern Europe from what I can tell by the architecture, well by what is left from it. The atmosphere is very grim and depressing and you're alone in a unfamiliar city trying to figure out what you need to do and if there are any friends of yours. The first thing you notice are the screens with propaganda and giant tower that you can see from any part of the city. And all of that really put me in the mood to fight. Because clearly someone is controlling the city and most likely the earth.  All of that is backed up by incredible ambient sounds and music. I don't know if it really makes sense to talk about music in this game but if you read review on the original game you'll know that it is something. It follows you around submerges you entirely into everything that is happening around. I first played the game in headphones and that was very wise decision and I'd recommend that to you as well. What kind of atmosphere can be there without proper visuals. And graphics are certainly there. And not just any graphics. Probably the best for the time. For me that is. But considering that it has been more than 10 years since the release of the game you could argue. But if you're into more realistic visuals you can find a mod online that will turn the game into eyecandy. So this game has amazing sounds, graphics and story. How does it play then. Well, it pays absolutely fantastic. It is a true sequel and it carried over everything that made the original such a great game. Suit is there, crowbar is there, awesome guns are there to accompany dynamic and fast-paced shooting action. Even if you're not shooting you can still feel the adrenaline. Guns are fantastic to use, blasting through the enemies. And there's variety of enemies ranging from headcrabs to helicopters and giant striders. All of them have very good AI and they never made me feel an overpowered protagonist putting down handicapped enemies. It's complete opposite because I found myself many times low on ammo and low on health hearing suit AI saying ""User death imminent"". What Half-Life never lacked are the unusual weapons and you'll some this time as well. For example Pulse Rifle which is my favorite and something very special - Gravity Gun. The latter really helps to get out of sticky situations when you're low on ammo or being overpowered by zombies. It has so many uses and every time I figured out something new I felt real scientist. By the way this time you're not doing everything alone. You have friends that will aid in the battle. I would characterize their AI as limited but sometimes they are really helpful. In my opinion their role is to make you feel as a part of Resistance more than anything else. And they certainly succeed at that. You will come across quite a few puzzles. What would Half-Life game be without puzzles. They are not that hard but require you to see the big picture. Gordon Freeman went to MIT so those puzzles should be not a problem.  As with the original game I played Half-Life 2 more than once. I played few times just didn't feel like playing something else and then I played it once again to unlock every single achievement and then I played it prior to Episode One and Two to refresh memories This game is definitely worth picking up even though it's more than 10 years old but it still has that tense, action packed gameplay, immersive music and graphics that hold up today in my opinion.More reviews from Gameaways Curator ",135,9,0,6,0,0,2

												Half-Life 2, the amazing sequel to an amazing action series. This game has one of the most in-depth and gripping storylines I have ever played. The graphics were amazing for its time, and still hold up to this day, not to forget the outstanding physics engine, that surpasses any other game's physics no matter what.The game sucks you right in, you get instantly addicted to the storyline, even though it starts out a bit slow in the beginning. The game's characters are all extremely well done, and each one you get the maxium hate/love for them. Half Life 2 is no doubt one of the best games to ever come into existence, it would be shameful to be on steam for a very long time and not enjoy or play this game. Definetely recommend to those who want to expierence a tense, epic, adventurous, yet a depressingly beautiful game. An instant classic.			",63,5,0,5,2,0,0

												This game is very successful to begin with so there isn't much to say I guess. It's a classic among the FPS genre. Featuring the source engine which was amazing at the time this game has been mind blowing.        The gameplay is very simple just like in the previous game and there's plenty of action to go on, besides that there are puzzles that come along the way. The arsenal ranges from a crowbar to a smart rocket launcher and other alien technology. There is one heroine that accompanies Gordon for a good part of the game. There's at least 20 hours of gameplay in the game without episode 1 and 2.       The story revolves around Dr. Gordon Freeman who used to work in the Black Mesa research institute and he is one of the survivors from the incident that had a major roll in the invasion of the Combine that occured afterwards. He is hired by an individual with mysterious abilities, the motives of this person are unknown to Gordon. From here on Gordon is placed in City 17 and he begins his struggle against the Combine.      The graphics and the mechanics of the game are very good to date and bug free.      The soundtrack is pretty fitting if I may say so myself.       The only issue regarding the game would be the stupidity of the NPC's and possibly the lack of harder difficulty choices and the the changes between them are minor. If you haven't played the first game, you should give it a try.			",153,30,0,20,10,0,18

												This is not a 'game'. This is a way of life. It will grab you by the nether regions and take you on a rollercoaster ride to Ravenholm and back. Tremble with fear as the screams of those terrifying fast zombie things echo in your ears. Sigh with relief as you take out you first strider, only to realise there are 3 more. Laugh at Eli Vance's stupid voice and the way he is carried around in a pod for half the game. So if you haven't played this game, wake up and smell the ashes.			",49,8,0,3,5,0,2

The puzzles are challenging and the action is enjoyable, it's much more than just shooting and pushing buttons. There are countless times when I spent a while thinking about a puzzle and there are a few occasions when I was thrashed by a headcrab!

												I still think this is the best FPS out there. It's single player, yes, but for many of us who enjoy a good story and mechanics over multiplayer features, this games, on this genre, has no equal. Gonna make this review short, as I don't think I can add much more to what is already known.Graphics and AI are old, sure. But still looking great compared to some games nowadays. But the main focus of this review is the story behind the game. The lore. The map designs. Everything is so well done that you almost feel it's a movie and not a game. If you like FPS, this game is a must. My recommendation, however, is to first play HL1. Then get this one			",56,14,0,18,2,0,9

												Half-Life 2 is the long awaited sequel to the original Half-Life game and makes it's unique mark as quite possibly be one of the greatest game or greatest FPS game ever created. Half-Life 2 was created using the Source engine which runs flawlessly with gorgeous visual, physics interaction, and smooth gameplay. Half-Life 2 improves upon every single aspect of the original game including a longer and more solid story and campaign. The best thing about Half-Life 2 is the Gravity gun, which allows you to pick up and throw any object - making even a toilet a deadly weapon! If you only play one FPS game in your life, the choice is simple: Half-Life 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												awww what can i say about the legendary Half-Life 2 that hasnt been said already?maybe i could mention the unmatched pacing of the game with amazing memorable chapters like ""Point Insertion"" and ""We Don't Go To Ravenholm...""i could talk about the excellent physics-based puzzle design, which is extremely intuitive yet challenging and satisfyingi could also mention the fantastic gunplay and weapon variety, many of which have a secondary fire to spice things up, and includes the all-time favorite Gravity gun which lets you abuse the physics engine in highly amusing waysand i could never go on without describing how the game seamlessly combines gameplay and storytelling, never taking control away from the player just to barf exposition into your faceand how could i even forget to mention the excellent cast of likeable characters that populate this grim futuristic dystopia, brought to life by some of the best voice acting there isi might as well mention this is my favorite FPS ever, my 3rd overall favorite game of all time and the fact this game is just as good today as it was almost 10 years agobut all that has probably been said before, so ill just go and say that the ""Anticitizen One"" chapter was very disappointing, thats pretty much the only fault the game has			",257,51,5,26,17,3,56

												Half-Life 2 is great game with good action and a great story to it. It may look a little dated but its still a great game to play since its very cheap now.+ The story is very good and adds lots of depth,+ The game looks alright but when it came out it would have been very good as there is so many details thoughout the landscape.+ The voice acting is spot on and draws you in.+ The music and sound effects are good but there is not much. I am going to give it a plus becasue what there is makes it good. Quality over quantity.+ Controls are simple yet work very well which is exspected.+ The game is about 10 to 15 hours. It depends on if you take your time or not.+ Having Steam Achevements and Trading Cards adds reply value but not much.- As I was saying there is not much reply value. There is the story and thats it. But you can do it again if you like to collect Steam Achevements.-Because the game is just story, There is just one path which you have to go. This can be okay but there is not one part were you choose two ways.Half-Life 2 is a good game and have a great story to it. I would give this game an 8 out of 10 and I would recommend it to anyone of has Steam.			",116,9,1,8,13,0,3

												First and foremost, Half-Life 2 is a stunning game. While I try not to hype it too much, it may be hard to do the experience justice. I have played through it at least six times, and it is still fun to get to those edge-of-your-seat moments when you may know what is going to happen, but you still need to push to make it to that point. Half-Life 2 is an amazing sequel to what has to be one of the finest games of all time. The series is very well made, the story is extremely well written, and the gameplay is nothing short of breathtaking and very animated. Playing as Dr. Gordon Freeman and seeing through his eyes is truely a spectacle to behold. There are so many interesting plot twists and delicious high-tension moments, that the only way to truely experience them is to play the game. I guarantee, once you play you will know why so many people have absolutely fallen in love with the series, and can not wait to see it continue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is realy great game. I never played this game before, and I heard everwhere ''Half Life 2 is one of the best games ever''...So, well, i decided to buy it. Along with Episode 1 and 2. And i dont regret it. Half Life 2 must be old game, from 2004, when I was only four, but it realy is good game. I usualy play only open-world shooting games, like GTA, Saint Row... Well Half Life IS some kind of open world, but, not like I imaged. But then I started to play and... yeah... One more thing I can tell about it - It have the best storyline of every game I have been playing. Also, there aren't any cutscenes, maybe except beggining and ending. Everything happens throught Gordon Freeman eyes.So....Story - 11/10Gameplay - 9/10Graphics - 9/10 (for 2004 game)Characters - 10/10I realy recomed this game for everyone, well, except little kids (because of zombies :) ) and I REALY wait for Half Life 2 - episode 3.

												9/10A marvel of gaming. Dang. Seriously. This freakin' game's story is top notch. It's one of those games that is just so crisp and clean, where you feel like you can do anything, that makes it such a wonder to video games. HL2's story is worth the purchase all by itself, but with the combonation of all the mods that are available to you, it allows you to reach out to so many more completely different but amazing mods. The gameplay, story, soundtrack, and everything in between in this game is perfectly crafted to create a well-rounded masterpiece of gaming. Go buy it, right now. New to gaming, old to gaming, blind, mute, deaf, I don't care, just buy it. Seriously.			",153,23,0,20,12,0,18

												All hail the crowbar!This is the game that got me hooked on shooters. In that respect I guess it has a lot to answer for! And, along with Episodes 1 and 2, it remains my favourite to this day. Valve have taken their 1998 classic Half-Life and improved on it in every conceivable way. Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 -- the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters. I could bang on about this game for ever and a day, but just let me say this: play it -- you won’t regret it.5/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												With this title being around 10 years old, and with community content available to update the looks of the game, Half Life 2 is 'The' Iconic game for any Windows PC. One would think the Singleplayer story based game has limited replay value, but it is suck a thrill to pick up and play time and again.

												En su momento alla por 2004, ya jugue a half life 2 y me encanto, ahora, repescándolo de nuevo, me da la sensación que no puedo decir lo mismo, al igual que dije que deus ex era un juego al que todavía no habían superado aún con sus años, éste es un claro ejemplo de que se quedo anticuado. Sigue siendo un gran juego, pero a día de hoy, numerosos juegos le superan en cuanto a IA de enemigos y sobretodo de los compañeros, que es horrible. Un juego que marcó època, pero marcó, en pasado, ahora ya no. Destacar negativamente, aunque esto no tenga que ver nada con el juego, el nefasto doblaje al español, patética es poco, para hacer eso, que no hagan nada y lo oimos en V.O.			",428,155,6,77,20,3,66

												Valve set a standard with the first Half Life, and this one raises the bar. You can tell a landmark has occurred when most of what comes after is derivative in some way. The worst part of playing a game this good is being unable to enjoy mediocre titles without feeling let down. A good sign of an underperforming developer is when they react to being compared to games like this with the phrase 'gamer entitlement'. If you only play games with friends, download the Synergy mod available on Steam.			",797,227,24,139,78,4,202

												Well...The graphics are pretty good for a game that was made in 2004. And the updated has even better graphics. The story line,Characters and their storyline,Our storyline are all good, So in this game you are playing as Gordan Freeman a scentist from Black Mesa Facality. He made a test but failed and got all Xen Monsters to the real world (Xen is another dimension full of ohter creatures...Most are dangerous) So as gordan tries to escape by finding weapons from people who died. He later on met a mysterious character reffered to (Gman) Some say he is god while ohters say he is A goverment. But who knows. So Gordan meets this character and this character wants Gordan to be his (Employee) Oh and here is some information about him (Gman is neither a bad or good character. Sometimes he helps you while ohetr times he makes it harder for you he is a mysterious character and no one actually knows his actual name its just because in the files gmans files is  called ""G_Man"") So Gman leaves and Gordan gets teleported to where he was. I dont remember mutch more. But this is just a feedback not an entire story. So i rate 10/10 Because the storyline and characters and weapons are all just perfect im sure you should igve this game a try. But i suggest trying playing the demo. If you like the demo you should buy the game :) It is worth the money. There is a mod too called ""Synergy"" This mod lets you play Half life online..Any kinda half life game and is 100% free as long as you have atleats one hl game..You will only be able to play the HL Games in synergy you ahve already bought You need Atleast one of the HL Games from the series to actually play Synergy You can chose from Half life 2, Half Life 2 ep 1, Half Life 2 ep 2 Thats all i know you can use but yeah i suggest you play this game.

												HALF LIFE 2 REVIEWHalf Life 2 is the first FPS I ever played. I remember when I bought the Orange Box on PS3 I was just amazed! 5 years later replaying it on PC it just adds to the amazing quality of the game. I loved every single second of it and is one my most favorite games of all time. Half Life 2 is a tense, thrilling, and all around amazing game that should be played by everyone.NOT FOR: People who don't like FPS's. I would still recommend trying it out, but if that's not really your thing, I don't think Half Life 2 would change your mind all that much. However keep in mind that this is more of an old school first person shooter, unlike say Call of Duty. This game doesn't tell you where to go or how to get there, maybe not as much as the original Half-Life, but still a far cry from the crazy hand holding a lot of modern games have today.FOR: People who want to play or try out a different stlye of FPS. This is not Call of Duty. No constant checkpoints or arrows showing you where to go. While this may prove frustrating for some...(It was for me the first time I tried it.) It proves to be extremely rewarding. On a other note this game doesn't have regenerating health which up's the challenge factor considerably. Even on easy you can every easily die if you don't react fast enough. IN CONCLUSION: I hope this review finds you well and if you want some other games like Half Life 2, make sure to get it's sequels Episode 1 & 2 . Also try out Portal and Portal 2 as they are in the same universe. (The Portal series is a puzzle game so it's different, but it's in the same story universe.)  Lastly play the originaly it'll be worth it.			",555,84,35,64,16,3,34

												If you could only play one game in your entire existence on this Earth then play this game. It is a work of pure perfection and I believe you have not lived if you haven't played it. Half-Life 2 is a signal player, FPS, action, sci-fi game. It came out in 2004 yet is still an experience no other video game developer has been able to replicate. I find it amazing how this game doesn't have cutscenes or tells you what to do next. I strongly urge anyone who has not played this to buy it right now and play it immediantely. Then buy episodes 1 and 2. Then cry over the non-existence of Half-Life 3.Warning: Watch out for those head-humpers.			",108,24,1,18,2,0,3

												What is there to say about Half-Life 2? Saying it was good, would be a waste of the entire internets time. So here's a more detailed description: This is a game that is still generaly better than most games made from 2012 onward. I never was a full PC gamer untill around 2010, and by then I played most triple A games that were available to me on console. Half-Life2 is a great game even if you like most generic money grabbing piles of♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game has something for just about everybody. If you like a good FPS, this is your game. If you like a good horror game, this is your game. If you want a puzzle game, this is the game for you. This game was made in 2006, and was around 6 years ahead of its time. The physics engine does its job and there's enough things that either fly out at you in the dark, shoot at you for not ""picking up that can"" (:D) and areas of the game that require skill and stratergy. Not so less that its to easy, and not so much to feel impossible. The story line of this game is overall entertaining and great. If you want to know who Gordon Freeman (the primary protagonist) is, here's a quick rundown: Gordon Freeman is a silent protagonist, wait come back, here's where it gets interesting. The involment of the game is dependant on the player entirely! During the start of game, you could be a guy, who has been sent into the furutre to kill John Conne- I mean, Alyx Vance. The dialog is enough to envolve you but not so much that you feel like the massive hero who immortal! No. The game's story revolves around who the player wants Gordon Freeman to be, thus creating the best video game character who ever existed, because of vanity reasons. So lets get onto graphics, 2006 THE END. No just kidding, Being a PC gamer faced with Alpha's and other games who dont have great graphics so they dont matter to me. They're good enough to see what you have to kill and who you are, also: NOT USING THE SAME (BLEEP)ING TEXTURE ON WALLS MAKING (BLEEP) CONFUSING! Anyway, my overall review score is 96/100 (same meta-score but then again the only game to get 100/100 in my opinion is Portal, so yeah) ",73,7,3,9,19,1,8

												A perfect example of a game that never gets oldHalf-Life 2 is undoubtedly a dream dreamed fans of the series. Elaborated in detail, oppressive climate on many levels, from the science fiction thriller to horror in the style of Night of the Living Dead, long memorable. Valve Software work is a must read for any self-respecting player who appreciates not only the intensity of the game, but also its refinement. I get caught for hours, fueling the desire to have both additives, and after graduation to join the crowds at Valve seat, shouting: 'Release Episode Three!'. The game did not impress me in the slightest.			",16,2,0,0,2,0,0

G-Man: Rise and shine doctor Freeman. Rise and shineThe only Free Man, the Opener of the wayBest game ever!!! Really you cannot be a gamer without playing this first! <3 Have some true fun with Gordon Freeman!No jokes... Why you should play this?-It is old, but it still is the masterpiece of the First Person Shooter genre-No cutscenes, you only see the world by Gordon Freeman point of view-Source Engine allows you to experience very good moments with physics-Source Engine have good graphics but even the oldest of computers still might be able to run it-The history is really interesting. (You might wanna to play Half-Life 1 first and after you finish this game, play the episodes.)-The Futuristic stuff here is awesome, despite you still see old technoloy. (This game was made on 2004, so yeah)It still keeps being the best game ever, and trust me, only HL3 will pass this game. If it will ever be released...1337/10 ...wait what?			",91,7,1,5,5,0,6

												Half life 2 is a game that plants you in a post apocalyptic world where you are controlled by an alien species called the ""Combine"", while playing the original game is not needed, it does slightly help explain things. If you haven't played it don't worry, the story progresses at a pace where you can learn each thing easily.The second you start you are in nothing but a moving train to help you get the hang of the controls, as you progress you can find a variety of weapons that become steadily more complex as the game progresses. While old, this game is a definite recommend for those that can afford it.			",94,7,1,20,12,2,7

												This is realy great game. I never played this game before, and I heard everwhere ''Half Life 2 is one of the best games ever''...So, well, i decided to buy it. Along with Episode 1 and 2. And i dont regret it. Half Life 2 must be old game, from 2004, when I was only four, but it realy is good game. I usualy play only open-world shooting games, like GTA, Saint Row... Well Half Life IS some kind of open world, but, not like I imaged. But then I started to play and... yeah... One more thing I can tell about it - It have the best storyline of every game I have been playing. Also, there aren't any cutscenes, maybe except beggining and ending. Everything happens throught Gordon Freeman eyes.So....Story - 11/10Gameplay - 9/10Graphics - 9/10 (for 2004 game)Characters - 10/10I realy recomed this game for everyone, well, except little kids (because of zombies :) ) and I REALY wait for Half Life 2 - episode 3.

 ""By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.""  Story  Half-Life 2 is the direct sequel to the award-winning original, Half-Life, released on Nov. 16, 2004. The story continues the adventures of past-Black Mesa researcher and scientist, Gordon Freeman. After being put in stasis by G-Man after the Black Mesa incident, Gordon is sent out again almost 20 years after the event, greeted by the barren, desolate, and oppressed world that is planet Earth. The event that was the Resonance Cascade, which opened up a portal from Xen to Earth, allowed the creatures from Xen to flood in, killing scientists and marines alike. The aliens of Xen were followed by a greater, even more powerful race, called the Combine, who started and ended the Seven-Hour war, declaring the creatures of Xen and humans of Earth as their own. They took control of the Earth, and started funnleing out a never-ending stream of soldiers, who beat down and controlled the human populace. When Gordon steps out of stasis, he joins the Resistance, a human and alien force who constantly battle the Combine to once again free the Earth.  Gameplay  Half-Life 2's Gameplay is centered around the use of weapons in combat, as in the original. Yet, as not seen before, you are now given the oppurtunity to explore your surrondings completely, finding tucked-away areas and hide-aways brimming with secrets and discoveries. The game is set in a first-person view, with your character, Gordon Freeman, not talking or reacting to the enviroment in any verbal way. This gives You, the player, complete immersion and focus, letting you feel, see, think, and do exactly how you want and the way you want. Valve, the creators of the Half-Life series, have created one of the best realistic-physics engine to date, the Source engine. This means that any and all items, vehicles, furniture, materials, weapons, creatures and people will react to the enviroment realistically, such as weight, visibility, health, and more. There are many weapons to use, such as the SMG, Rocket Launcher, and brand-new Gravity Gun. The Gravity Gun can pick up objects in the game, even the heavier ones like barrels and dressers. You can use the Gravity Gun to pick up objects out of the way, punt them great distances, and use them as blunt weapons when thrown. And, yes, the crowbar is back, which can be used for breaking obstacles and killing enemies.  Graphics  The Graphics of Half-Life 2 are made by Valve's game engine, Source. With this, the enviroment can look fresher then ever, with swaying grass and rope, white clouds and bright suns, and shiny, polished floors, and rough, cut wood. The graphics of Half-Life 2 are not, in any way, a showcase of today's games, but do feel surprsingly realistic and crisp, and look quite good even after all these years.  Overview  Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece of a game, winning over 39 Game of the Year awards, among others, and is widely considered to be the best game of all time. The characters are unique and quirky, like rebelious Alex, nervous Dr. Kleiner, and confident Eli. The enviroments range from city streets, to zombie-infested rooftops, to a Combine-controlled prsion. Weapons are powerful but require precision and focus, battles are challenging but have to be examined and tactically played, and the enviroment is breath-taking but deadly and dangerous. This is the kind of game every person should play at least once, from indie-game casuals to multiplayer tryhards. So, put on your H.E.V. suit, grab your trusty crowbar, and become The One Free Man.

												Edit: 11/23/16- Nominated this game for the Steam Awards: Test of Time Award***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN 2007... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it***Arguably the most anticipated sequel to a video game ever, Half-Life 2 has had fans itching to play it since its proposed development in 1999 after the huge success of its predecessor Half-Life. Over those five years, Valve, had promised amazing advances in videogame features such as in game physics, graphics and enemy and cooperative AI (artificial intelligence). Having played Half-Life 2 multiple times and continue to jump on and play almost two years after its release, I can honestly say it is still the best FPS I have ever played.You again assume the role as Dr. Gordon Freeman. After having accepted the G-man's proposal to work for him at the end of Half-Life, the introduction to Half-Life 2 has Gordon once again arriving on a train to work to City 17; a city that resembles a rundown poor neighborhood that is well guarded by soldiers known as the Combine. As you walk through the streets and notice the fortress walls and strict enforced laws, you begin to see a few familiar faces such as Barney, the security guard from Half-Life and Half-Life: Blue Shift, Dr. Kleiner and Dr. Mossman. A new character, Alyx is introduced as Mossman’s daughter. Alyx brings Gordon to a secret lab where the Dr. Mossman has been working on a teleportation device that would transfer Gordon to Black Mesa East - another lab a considerable distance outside of City 17. You also receive another familiar item and as well as some comforting familiar music. As you can imagine, something goes wrong during the teleportation process and Gordon is teleported outside of the lab where the Combine discovers him. Gordon must now once again fight his way through enemies to save the planet from the invading army.Gameplay:It is virtually impossible to create a non-linear FPS single player game. Games need to be scripted and one directional for the player to receive objectives on how to proceed to the next level. It is the brilliant writing and level design in what makes Half-Life 2 give players a sense of freedom. Half-Life 2 continues right where Half-Life left off in terms of gameplay. You continue your story from Gordon's perspective, there are no cut scenes or narration moments that interrupt the game. Levels are still in episode form, allowing short loading times and weapons and health upgrades are not glowing, spinning or floating in mid air, but yet realistically places on tables, cabinets, or mounted on walls.Instead of inserting a FMV directly into the game, Half-Life 2 uses its own cinematic vision by just creating fully interactive events directly into the game; Missiles launched at a towering smokestack that crumbles at the base and begins to topple over onto a river, Strider's demolish a building or alien monsters crashing through walls and up from the ground. HL2's style of gameplay changes as you progress. For example, Doom 3's gameplay is same: walk cautiously through each hallway in fear of a demon hiding in a shadow or Painkiller's gameplay is run around shooting stuff for all eternity. HL2 actually takes a considerable amount of time for Gordon to actually start blasting away the Combine, and even when you finally receive weapons, you are running through the sewer system trying to keep a low profile. Gordon finally gets help from some fellow rebel soldiers and is given a hovercraft that he uses to travel future outside of City 17 but continuing to solve puzzles to advance over obstacles and Combine controlled checkpoints. Gordon does experience some fierce resistance during his time on the hovercraft, but if successful you will reach a point where Gordon can take a break from fighting. The point: HL2 shadows the timeline of a real movie, starting off slow while rising to a pinnacle fight scenes while every once in a while changing the style of the game to give the player a psychological break. This is a HUGE subliminal feature that causes players to become so attached to the stories in the game, instead of turning into a mindless shooter like so many other games.Gordon's arsenal of weaponry is similar from the first game. You start off once again with only a crow bar, which is satire in itself as Barney drops the crowbar off the roof of a building claiming ""hey Gordon, I think you left something back at Black Mesa."" You eventually go through the standard weapon progression, gaining a handgun, machine gun, an advanced Combine assault gun, crossbow- which shoots hot metal rods at enemies allowing you to staple them to the side of walls as their bodies hang limp.Graphics and Sounds:We now can now check off 'exciting unique story' on our ""What makes an Amazing Game?"" list and proceed to the most impressive feature of HL2. If you were keeping track of HL2 since its proposed development, you may remember a demonstration video that outlines what the engine in HL2 is capable of. The demo featured the Source engine and walked through some of the more common elements that would be present in the game: fire looks like fire, water refracts light, wood breaks like wood and the overall life like adjustments of things falling caused by gravity. The demo was just the beginning.Half-Life 2's level (or chapter) design is so life like (even today), you forget the game is as linear as any other FPS; that there really is only one path to take but the levels fools players into thinking there are hundreds. Wide-open courtyards, rivers, fields really help players sink into the gaming environment. Gordon's journey takes him through the daylight, dusk, night, dawn, underground tunnels, sewers, abandoned houses, coastlines, and the infamous Citadel. There is no other single player game that changes surroundings as much as Half-Life 2. Doom 3 will always be on Mars and F.E.A.R. will always be played at night.Smaller graphical features are also impressive like the refraction of light through water, the colors of the sky reflecting on top of water, life like facial movements, explosions, it will all make you stop and admire. To coincide with the strong visuals are impressive audio effects. The sharks puncture of gunshots is excepted in most games that contains weapons, but actually simulating the ricochet of guns and bombs is phenomenal. Bombs dropped by helicopters will explode with a sharp explosion and seconds later you will hear the delayed echo of the bomb. The same idea happens over the course of the game and as the scenery changes so does the effects of the sound. Inside canals, sewers or traveling over a river or inside a building and hearing the same explosions is defined as adjusting your home stereo to “hall” or “Cathedral”. If you happen to purchase the complete package through steam, you are sent a copy of the Half-Life 2 soundtrack, which has lived up to its own name from the first game. Usually the game is played in silence, but certain chapters will open with a theme that is appropriate with the environment.Muliplayer:Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is exactly how it sounds. Pick your character and run around several different multiplayer maps killed each other with different weapons that can be found in HL2 the game. What makes the game fun and interesting is you also come equipped with the gravity gun, which you can use to throw couches, and rocks at opposing players.Pros: life like physics engine, nexgen graphics, multiple multiplayer mods,Cons: mediocre AI not as impressive as hyped to be, a lot of material cut out of final releaseBottom Line: A MUST play for all gamers. Half-Life 2 continues to impress players as the game progresses showing off its unprecedented physics and graphics engine. This story will hook you in, the graphics will make your eyes water and the overall game will completely blow you away.			",519,76,8,42,34,3,71

												You know, there's a reason this game won 39 Game of the Year awards, and Game of the Decade.It's GOOD. No wait, it isn't. It's not great either.It's an absolute masterpiece. It's got great and exciting gameplay, an engrossing storyline, characters you'll come to love, graphics that still look great to this day (to me at least, I've always liked the Source Engine), physics that are fun to mess around with, AI that would make GLaDOS cringe (okay, not really), an awesome soundtrack, developer commentary for those of you who like to listen to it....And a Gravity Gun.That, combined with the nostalgic value this game has to me, is why this game will always remain in my heart as my favorite video game of all time. Very highly recommended.			",99,6,5,13,4,2,6

It continues everything what original Half-Life started and does it perfectly. The mysterious and interesting world and characters are what makes this game so good. If you haven't played Half-Life series before now is the time. I recommend starting with the original or the remake, Black Mesa, which is awesome as well, even tho it is missing final levels.

Certainly has that retro game mechanic feel.   Great game, pick it up on a sale.  Typically a ~14 hour game.Now I need to play episodes one and two			",272,84,13,40,25,5,58

												Welp... Half Life 2. We meet again. What could you say about this gem that hasn't been said before? OH WeL Of corsE YOu neEd iT FUR GmoD!!11!!No... I didn't mean that... I'm talking about Half Life 2 here... not Source.Half Life 2 is, simply put, top notch. Seriously, if you haven't played Half Life 2 at least until Ravenholm (Grrrrrrrrrrr) SHAME ON YOU! I don't wanna spoil the story or the famous characters to those Steam newbies out there who were told to get Half Life 2 just for Gmod, so I'll say... PLEASE play Half Life 1 before playing Half Life 2. Half Life 2 is THE BEST Half Life game. I'm sorry, but the episodes, even with being fantastic, I couldn't help but feel REALLY empty at the intro of Episode One. Oh wait... Sorry, wrong game... AAaanyway, Even if it's not on Steam, even if it's pirated, just play it. It'll bring a lot of nostalgia (and by nostalgia I mean 3 days ago when you FINISHED Half Life 1) with the occasional funny joke, famous boss fight, and that stuffs. Me being a personal die-hard Half Life fan (profile pic), I'd recommend Half Life 2 to anyone. I'm proud and not afraid to say that Half Life 2 is one of the best, if not THE best Valve game ever made. Sure, the Source 1 (GoldSource counting as Source 0 as I call it) engine is REALLY coming of age [L4D(2), CS:GO, Portal 2], and SOME of the voice acting could have been better, but for the time... 2004... 10 friggin years ago, this game looked like Battlefield 4 back then! Half Life 2 is a game that may truly make you bow down to the One Free Man forever more. Id recommend Half Life 2 to anyone who is willing to... well... let's say it how Breen would say it...To be wise. Be safe.Be aware.11/10. And proud of it. *Bows down to the One Free GabeN*			",79,5,2,3,4,0,5

												Although Half-Life 2 has somewhat changed from Half-Life 1 when it comes to design, the innovations it brought with the new Source Engine (which is still used up to this day) were amazing for that year. The mimics and so much of possibility that a person even created Garry's Mod for children and adults alike to have fun.The game itself is amazing. - The plot needs to be understood via HL wikipedia, not only by the game itself. Once you understand the plot, you realize how realistic an alien invasion can get and how it might look like.- The graphics were great for that year, you cannot compare them with the new games now as the engine is outdated.- The gameplay is very Quake-ish, which does break the immersion, but mods can somehow add the 'realistic combat' feel. This quake-ish gameplay is positive on one hand and negative on the other. You have to see it for yourself.- Voice acting is amazing and professional.- The physics are amazing when it comes to the Source engine usage of Havok.- The leveldesign is made in a way that it will never frustrate you, nor bore you, which feels like a genius made it, sometimes you have to use logic in order to advance.Overall score in the year 2004: 10/10 Overall score in the year 2016: 10/10I have this fetish of realistic gameplay ever since I played games like Red Orchestra 2, so I do hope that Half-Life 2 will get remastered and designed in a way that would allow us to play it not in a Quake style, but rather in 'realistic shooter' style, in order to give it the true feel of fighting off the enslaving alien regime throughout the blocs and apartments.

												My favourite game of all time, an absolute steam essential, with a solid 12 hours of gameplay and an amazing story that will keep you hooked for the entire game. It is also a type of game that has you thinking after the credits have rolled. 10/10 Best $10 I have ever spent			",146,12,1,5,6,2,2

												Half-Life 2 is a game that, once you play, you will never forget.i can say wholeheartedly that this game is one of the best, if not THE best, i have ever played in my entire life.why?lets take it from the top.the game begins with a short cutscene, a monolouge by a man in the suit (dubbed, the Gman), which at the begining of the game doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but the farther you go into it, the more it will make sense to you. i should state here that knowledge of the previous game in the series (Half-life) is not required, but i will say that it is reccomended, as this games story will make more sense, as well as some of the throwbacks this game gives to its predecessor. as the Gman speaks, different locations flash on the screen, that add to the mysterious nature of this intro. Who is the Gman? Where are these places? What is he talking about? before you have time to ponder these questions, a loud horn interrupts you, as you are thrown straight into the game. you take a short monorail ride into City 17, and the game exhibits its art direction very well in this first section taking place in City 17. After events transpire, you are thrown into the action yet again, this time by yourself and only a crowbar to defend yourself. this is where the game introduces its combat system, and let me take this moment to say that this is one of the reasons i love this game. instead of showing you annoying tooltips that pop onto the screen, obscuring your vision, the game instead has you learn from experience how to use weapons. this game has a very old school feel to its combat system, and i really cant stress enough how good the combat feels and how precise it can be at times. over time, the story has you travelling to many different, beautiful looking locations (for a game from 2004, the graphical fidelity stands up surpisingly well, and at times looks better than many games being released nowadays) battling more intimidating foes as you go on. this can create some truly amazing moments in the story, such as when you battle a helicopter using an airboat with a machine gun mounted on the top of it. the sound design is good too, the music is never annoying, and the gun sounds never get on your nerves after hearing them thousands of times. in wanting to not spoil the game for those who have not played it, let me say that there are some truly emotional moments in the game, as well as some clever twists and turns placed here and there.let me end this review off with saying that, if you have not played Half-Life 2 yet, please do yourself a huge favor and purchase this game. you will not regret your decision one bit. it has truly changed the way i view games.

												This game is an icon for it's time and with it's highly modding capabilities still being used even to this day which the original set off the first person persective through out the whole game including cutscenes. Half-Life 2 took what Half-Life had that and put at the time better awesome physics, graphics, lighting, advent of Steam and birth of Valve's Source Engine.			",174,29,4,4,5,2,7

												Welp... Half Life 2. We meet again. What could you say about this gem that hasn't been said before? OH WeL Of corsE YOu neEd iT FUR GmoD!!11!!No... I didn't mean that... I'm talking about Half Life 2 here... not Source.Half Life 2 is, simply put, top notch. Seriously, if you haven't played Half Life 2 at least until Ravenholm (Grrrrrrrrrrr) SHAME ON YOU! I don't wanna spoil the story or the famous characters to those Steam newbies out there who were told to get Half Life 2 just for Gmod, so I'll say... PLEASE play Half Life 1 before playing Half Life 2. Half Life 2 is THE BEST Half Life game. I'm sorry, but the episodes, even with being fantastic, I couldn't help but feel REALLY empty at the intro of Episode One. Oh wait... Sorry, wrong game... AAaanyway, Even if it's not on Steam, even if it's pirated, just play it. It'll bring a lot of nostalgia (and by nostalgia I mean 3 days ago when you FINISHED Half Life 1) with the occasional funny joke, famous boss fight, and that stuffs. Me being a personal die-hard Half Life fan (profile pic), I'd recommend Half Life 2 to anyone. I'm proud and not afraid to say that Half Life 2 is one of the best, if not THE best Valve game ever made. Sure, the Source 1 (GoldSource counting as Source 0 as I call it) engine is REALLY coming of age [L4D(2), CS:GO, Portal 2], and SOME of the voice acting could have been better, but for the time... 2004... 10 friggin years ago, this game looked like Battlefield 4 back then! Half Life 2 is a game that may truly make you bow down to the One Free Man forever more. Id recommend Half Life 2 to anyone who is willing to... well... let's say it how Breen would say it...To be wise. Be safe.Be aware.11/10. And proud of it. *Bows down to the One Free GabeN*			",79,5,2,3,4,0,5

												This is what happens when a perfect combination of narrative, level design, gameplay and interactivity meet. Not to mention the (at the time) mind blowing graphics. This is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of all of Valve's work and truly one of the greatest games I've played as of yet. It simply does everything right- the story keeps you immersed and the characters are all memorable, with dialogue and cinematics being one of the most interesting parts of the game, other than being just a break from combat (which happens all too often nowadays). The gunplay feels just right, and every weapon in your ever-increasing arsenal is great in its own way- different situations will call for different weapons. The gravity gun deserves mentioning though, as it is just pure awesome and allows you to truly use your environment to your advantage (hurling explosive barrels, slicing through enemies with sawlades, throwing enemy grenades back, etc.). There are also no cutscenes- every single event takes place through the eyes of Mr. Freeman, which is an approach that Valve absolutely nailed. As I mentioned before, the game continuously encourages environment interaction, and not just with the gravity gun. The clever puzzles throughout the game are an example of this. The enemy variety and artificial intelligence is also incredible. All in all, an amazing game. And, as a side note, WE WANT A SEQUEL ALREADY!!!!			",77,7,0,3,2,0,2

												If you could only play one game in your entire existence on this Earth then play this game. It is a work of pure perfection and I believe you have not lived if you haven't played it. Half-Life 2 is a signal player, FPS, action, sci-fi game. It came out in 2004 yet is still an experience no other video game developer has been able to replicate. I find it amazing how this game doesn't have cutscenes or tells you what to do next. I strongly urge anyone who has not played this to buy it right now and play it immediantely. Then buy episodes 1 and 2. Then cry over the non-existence of Half-Life 3.Warning: Watch out for those head-humpers.			",108,24,1,18,2,0,3

												Well...The graphics are pretty good for a game that was made in 2004. And the updated has even better graphics. The story line,Characters and their storyline,Our storyline are all good, So in this game you are playing as Gordan Freeman a scentist from Black Mesa Facality. He made a test but failed and got all Xen Monsters to the real world (Xen is another dimension full of ohter creatures...Most are dangerous) So as gordan tries to escape by finding weapons from people who died. He later on met a mysterious character reffered to (Gman) Some say he is god while ohters say he is A goverment. But who knows. So Gordan meets this character and this character wants Gordan to be his (Employee) Oh and here is some information about him (Gman is neither a bad or good character. Sometimes he helps you while ohetr times he makes it harder for you he is a mysterious character and no one actually knows his actual name its just because in the files gmans files is  called ""G_Man"") So Gman leaves and Gordan gets teleported to where he was. I dont remember mutch more. But this is just a feedback not an entire story. So i rate 10/10 Because the storyline and characters and weapons are all just perfect im sure you should igve this game a try. But i suggest trying playing the demo. If you like the demo you should buy the game :) It is worth the money. There is a mod too called ""Synergy"" This mod lets you play Half life online..Any kinda half life game and is 100% free as long as you have atleats one hl game..You will only be able to play the HL Games in synergy you ahve already bought You need Atleast one of the HL Games from the series to actually play Synergy You can chose from Half life 2, Half Life 2 ep 1, Half Life 2 ep 2 Thats all i know you can use but yeah i suggest you play this game. I really enjoyed this game. And im sure you're gonna enjoy it too! Here is the link for synergy download  rememebr it is absolutely free as long as you have bought atleats one of these games Half Life 2, Half life 2 ep 1, Half Life 2 ep 2 if you havent you will not be able to play Half Life 2 online			",32,3,0,4,3,1,0

												My favorite game. There's not enough space for me to adequately describe how I feel about this game. Revolutionary for it's time and still one of the best fps/adventure/action/horror games that I could ever play. I always come back to it and always will. The gravity gun.

												Half-Life 2 is one, if not the best, first person shooter to hit the market. The only game to could top this is the first Half-Life, for reason you should know. This game has changed the way I look at games from now 'till the end of times. • The storyline is really good and makes me want to keep playing so I could see what crazy things Gordon has to do.• The soundtrack is a really good addition to this game. It just makes the entire game seem more whole. Without it I dont know how I would have been able to tell what pace the game was going in.• The graphics are really good because it marked the path for future Valve games like: Portal, Life 4 Dead, and Team Fortress 2. All of those games have been ground breakers themsleves.Over all I would highly recommend that you get this game I know you wont regret it.			",111,5,2,14,11,1,7

												Sequel of one of the highest acclaimed games of all time. Half-Life continues the story of Gordon Freeman as he is woken up only to find that Earth has been taken over by an alien empire - the Combine. Throughout the game, he gets help from human resistance and former allies from Black Mesa. Puzzles are pretty much kept at the first installation's style, though I found them to be way easier. In Half-Life 2, there are more vehicles - an airboat and a buggy are added and they provide some more refreshing gameplay where you drive with them and ocassionally have to stop in order to solve a puzzle, because the path is blocked.Game features more weapons, most importantly - the gravity gun. I guess it shows the psychics of the source engine, but its a pretty fun weapon to use, some areas can be cleared without using any firearms. Near the end of the game it becomes even better and more powerful.Obviously, it has better graphics than Half-Life 1.For those that liked the first game - this is a must buy. I guess you can still play it as your first game from the franchise, but it just isn't the same in my opinion. ",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												THIS IS MY OPINION IF YOU DO NOT AGREE THAT IS OK!!!!half life 2 has some of the best reviews I have seen. I am fairly new to pc gaming therefore I never played this game when it was new so there is no nostalgia in here. The first thing i thought when i started playing this game was: wow these graphics are good for a game that's like, 10 years old!! my second impression was: man those combine dudes are jerks. That is one of the coolest things about half life 2. from the very starting  of the game it builds up your resentment for the combine, your main enemies throughout the game unlike some other shooter which just throw you in and say: shoot these guys. The biggest low point in the game is the vehicle sections. at first it's kinda like wupeee!! im in a boat or a car or whatever but the vehicle levels for me were long and boring.another thing about half life 2 that really is cool is the gravity gun. and while i wont spoil anthing i will tell you it is fun to use against some particular enemies. despite how old the engine is the physics are actually not that bad althougth it does sometimes glitch out when you use vehicles. (I once sent a car flying across the map when i dropped it wth a crane.) One thing that is especially amusing to watch is the combine's bodies crumple when thay are shot with a shotgun or magnum. the games music is very very bad. it sounds sci fi and techno sort of which ruins the atmosphere. the other sound however are superb.the story is pretty hard to understand if you havent played the original by the way. you may want to read something online if you absolutely must understand it.one of the high points in half life 2 is the puzzles. you don't see many shooters that use puzzles in them which is strange considering how good of reviews this game got. one example is stacking blocks on the end of a wooden plank to be able to jump to a ledge.  Bet you have never seen that in a call of duty game! here are my reviews overall. graded out of 10graphics:  8.0Story: 7.0gameplay: 8.5Level design: 9.0music: 6.5this is a superb sci fi shooter dampened only by tedious vehicle levels and a bad soundtrack                                                                      OVERALL 9.0			",203,25,2,21,14,2,13

												Starting off a game like Half-Life 2 is the beginning to an adventure -and most importantly, to one of the best experiences that anyone will ever have when playing a Valve game. HL2 is the immaculate embodiment of what Valve is and stands for; it's the quintessential staple to the constituents of a modern First Person Shooter.However, parts of this game have not aged well to this day - it makes things rather difficult and odd. But, that doesn't worsen the experience by one bit - so long as you appreciate this game for what it is.[10/10]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm suprised I haven't reviewed Half Life 2 before, so here goes.I've never seen a game that's perfect, no game can be perfect. But the Half Life series comes darn close to it, the only reasons why they aren't perfect is due to the AI and ocasional physics bugs. But I lose sight of those when I play it, as it has a wonderful feel to it, the world feels alive, which a lot of games seem to miss. Characters are fantasticly designed, and the voice acting was excellent for its time and still is.In all, Half Life 2 and the series are wonderfully developed, memorable shooters that have a special place in my heart.

For better or worse, HL1 and HL2 popularised linear, guided FPS games. HL2 also popularised physics as a gameplay element.I've played through this game so many times now, but I'll try to remember my first impressions from back when it came out.What I enjoyedBeing very impressed at the facial animations when Alyx leans over you that first time.Spending hours messing around with the console, spawning enemies and making them fight each other, and throwing rollermines at them with the gravity gun.Replaying Ravenholm over and over because it's like a physics playground with all the zombies and circular saws and explosive barrels... and the gravity gun.Did I mention how mind-blowing the gravity gun was that first time I used it?Loving the cast of characters. Alyx, Isaac Kleiner, Eli, Dr Breen...Approaching the Citadel little by little, that looming towering structure, until you finally reach it and enter it, genuinely unsettling... and appreciating the design decisions all the while.The music, sparingly used, perfectly setting the mood. Some of the tracks are etched in my mind, like the one at the end of Ravenholm.Playing this game again and again.What I didn't likeI miss the Black Mesa setting, and didn't really like how the story just jumped ahead in time. (I'm still hoping for a game that tells more about the events in between HL1 and HL2.)How messianic and famous and revered Gordon is in HL2. I liked it much better in HL1 when you were just some guy trying to survive. It's especially annoying how your resistance fighter allies treat you.I miss the outlandish weapons from HL1 and Opposing Force.Enemies, too. I miss the alien and varied enemies of HL1. In HL2 you're mostly fighting humans.All those loading screens. Gosh, so many loading screens. And you see a long corridor with a bend at the end and you just *know* there's a loading screen coming.That ending sucked. It worked in HL1 because it was the first time. But HL2 also ending with you being ""shelved""? Not cool. (All was forgiven with the beginning scene of HL2 episode 1.)I remember playing through this on New Year's eve. Fun times. Oh and, if you're getting this, get Episode 1 and 2 also. HL2 Episode 2 is my favourite of the entire series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												15 years later and this game is still better than most of the games coming out today.  This is my first time playing through this and it is one of the most brutal and completely rewarding games I have ever played.  The whole game just plays through start to finish.  No cutscenes or out of game sequences.  Everything happens in the game as you play.  There are no arrows, button prompts, lines to follow or help of any kind as how to proceed, I love it.  This game demands that you think about how you will get through every test of your skill.  This is what games need to be like.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely phenomenal game. After hearing all the hype about the Half-Life series, I had to give it a try. As you'd probably guess, I was very impressed with it. The story of Gordon Freeman is strange yet intriguing. The implication of the Gman in this part of the series was well-placed. Honestly, this IS the best FPS I've ever played. Bottom line; if you haven't played Half-Life, do it. You will enjoy it. I cannot wait for Valve to begin developing Half-Life 3 (or HL2: Episode 3).			",64,5,1,7,3,0,1

												Half-Life 2 is a great game to continue the story that left us in Half-Life 1. The plot of this sequal will not drag on (most of the time) and the ever changing enviroments and atmospheres will keep you immersed in the gameplay until you see credits moving across your screen.

												The Orange Box, or perhaps Half Life 2 itself, is the greatest value in all of gaming history. Why? Because with just HL2 you unlock the ability to literally play thousands of free mods, some of which are of higher quality or more fun than HL2 itself, as well as the tools to make your own mods and maps. If you haven't played HL1 and are worried about HL2, Don't. The story is just as bizarre as ever and the token ""unexplainable ending"" of all Half Life games has returned yet again.

Может казаться, что надо быть поехавшим чтобы игру, рассчитанную на 12-13 часов прохождения, играть вот уже 10 год подряд оставляя за собой море времени, тысячи часов прохождения первой части, различных дополнений официальных и не только, 2-ой части, эпизодов и т.д. - но это единственная игра, которая уводит тебя под саунды Келли Бэйли в мир Half-Life, в мир где ""он — словно озарение, после него понимаешь, какой гадостью тебя кормили последние годы"". Мир, который как бриллиант, который навсегда. Который при каждом новом запуске оного открывается по разному. Закончу цитатой известного издательства: ""Если вы видели Half-Life 2, то считайте, что видели лучшую компьютерную игру на этой планете"". О да! О да!! ДА!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

			Views: 40		

			This is the first time I've done anything like this and I spent a while getting the audio to a suitable level. however if you think it's off or you have any other criticism, let me know.		

This is the follow up to the masterpiece that was the original Half-Life.This game has a beautiful story, amazing graphics, great A.I. which is still rare to see in games even today.You'll have a vast array of weapons that you'll pick up throughout the game, each of them feeling unique with, damage, range, effects and occasionally secondary fire.Driving sequences are fun and smooth to play.The game is full of memorable characters. Both good and evil.Synopsis: You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist that worked at the Black Mesa Research Facility, You've just been awoken from stasis by the G-man, after the 7 hour war between the human resistance and the Combine. You'll meet up with new and old characters alike and try to take the earth back from the Combine.If you still haven't played this game, I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is very nice to play. It's a wonderful trip with Gordon Freeman, across a weird and ""dark"" world. It's never boring, the story and the universe of the game are very good. The graphics are pretty fine too! However there is no multiplayer mode. Anyway you still have fun while playing this game, even if you are alone. Each chapter is very different. I really recomend you to try Half-Life 2 if you've never played it! Valve made, once again, an amazing game.78 / 100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is in my top 3 games of all time. For me, everything just clicks in this game, but most notably the atmosphere and characters. First off, you do not need to have played the first half life to appreatate this one, and in fact the first time I played HL2, I barely even knew what the first one was about. The dystopian setting has always been one of my favorites, and this game protrays this perfectly. Everything in the game seems as if it is barely working and is about to fall apart. Although the game is now nearly 10 years old, its graphics still look pleasing, and the art style is as amazing as always. The level variety is stunning, and thoughout the ten hour campagin, it never begins to become boring. The characters feel like people, and you begin to genuinely care about them. Each weapon feels unique, and I ended up using almost all of them at one point or another. (Something I think they improved over Half Life 1) This game is basically created Steam, so please buy this wonderful game! And if this game doesnt sound interesting to you, there are litterally hundreads of mods, so almost as great as the orginal game. There is no reason not to buy this game, though if you have the money, get the Orange Box for sure, as it has much more value. Pros:+Story+Gameplay+Characters+Physics+Litterally everythingNeutral:*No multiplayer (But it doesnt need it)Overall: 10/10 I love this game, and have played though it about four times. I can find nearly no flaws, please buy this game, you have no idea what you are missing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman. The sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.A diverse set of enemies are present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; some use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. At one point in the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers, and can send his team further from him or call them back; however, they can still die easily due to lack of damage protection. Squad members are indicated on the HUD (squad member icons with a cross sign are field medics).Many of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall.Part-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as to manipulate larger and heavier objects than he is able to alone. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).The game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.Source; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_life_2 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half Life is one of the first PC games I owned.  I had it when I plugged a power cable into a lan card and fried it.  Oh young dumb PC accidents.  Half Life 2 is a build upon an already amazing franchise.  One that spawned Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat from free Half Life mods to actual stand alone games that were sold in stores.  Half Life 2 is an incredible game with stunning graphics and great AI - for its time.  The gameplay is fun and with the use of Developer Mode, players that are playing the game through for a second, third, or fourth time can enable fun gravity settings or thousands of other commands.  The story line in the game itself is the classic FPS Hero vs The World.  I would rate this game a 9.2/10 because it is still a classic, a benchmark to gaming, a sequel to one of the best games ever made and still one of the highest META rated games in the world.  Half Life 2 is worth the few dollars to purchase - as well as all of the other Valve titles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nothing goes past it! I got this as part of the Orange Box, and do not regret the measley $20 that this timeless work of art was a part of.10/10. BRING ON HALF LIFE 3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman. The sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.A diverse set of enemies are present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; some use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. At one point in the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers, and can send his team further from him or call them back; however, they can still die easily due to lack of damage protection. Squad members are indicated on the HUD (squad member icons with a cross sign are field medics).Many of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall.Part-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as to manipulate larger and heavier objects than he is able to alone.

												An excellent continuation in the Half-Life series.  I definitely recommend this game if you haven't played it already.The graphics are still pretty good by today's standards.The story is pretty good and the puzzles are slightly challenging if not repetitive at times.The only drawback is that Valve hasn't released a third episode.

												Having recently replayed this due to the added achievements, it has made me realise yet again just how wonderfully made this game is. It flows seemlessly from one location to another and in doing so the story and setting are pretty much nailed. The only real annoyance I came across was with a few NPCs blocking paths. However,  It has aged really well and I always seem to find something new!Play it again if you have it in your library, It's fantastic. Just play it to experience Ravenholm!

												Half-Life 2: Deathmatch brings back the adrenaline pumped feeling from old Deathmatch classics such as Unreal tournament and Quake. With improved graphics, physics and a combination of the half-life 2 story this game is filled with rush. Equip your gravity gun and throw a toilet at the enemy, the amount of props will get annoying though since they are in your way. A *FANTASTIC* multiplayer experience, that is if you have the skill. If not, it gets incredibly annoying and frustrating. Even if so, getting this along with the regular HL2, is definitively worth it, I never really knew why they released the two games separately.

 ""A right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world."" TL;DR: ...why don't you have this in your Steam liabry if you're a Steam user?Half-Life 2 is the sequel to the smash-hit debut title for Valve. Half-Life had revolutionary graphics engine, amazing A.I, logical puzzles and an engaging story- nothing like other FPS games that came out before Half-Life. Half-Life won over 50 awards, and is to this date announced as the 'best FPS game ever made'. And Half-Life 2 is the direct sequel to this masterpiece, so it has to live up to its expectations, though cliches with sequels are that they are only made to milk money. THAT is not true with Half-LIfe 2.Not only Half-Life 2 also had a ground-breaking physics engine called Source, it leaved the 'closed enviorment' atmosphere behind, but used it to make a even better written storyline.Now, keep in mind that Half-Life 2 was made in 2004. I will be reviewing this game like it came out in 2004, but also as if it came out in modern times.The Source engine is still a pretty good engine now, but back then, it was amazing. The signature weapon of the game, the Gravity Gun, was made specifically to show out this new physics. You can't play the original Source engine from 2004 because they updated all games that used the engine to have the updated version from Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so you mostly won't suffer from the engines cons, but back then, the sound engine was terrible for the Source.The story continues right where you left off. You were hired by the 'G-Man' because he was impressed at your skills, and put you into stasis untill the time came. Now, it's time to smell the ashes, and Gordon Freeman, the physicist you're contolling, has to join up with the Rebels to fight off the alien 'Combine' forces. The Combine are this galactic federation that enslaves every alien species come by, and puts them as the member of their 'union'. The humans had a 7-hour long war with them, until the UN HQ burnt down and Earth surrendered.In Half-Life, the first bit of the game was you trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of Black Mesa, the research facility you were working. Then your mission was to save the world from suffering the same misery Black Mesa suffered by killing the invaders' master and ending the invasion. But Gordon was a bit too late, and the invaders found a way out of Black Mesa(which was just teleporting there) before Gordon did. But since Gordon did kill their master, they stopped fighting the humans(except for the non-inteligent ones). Then the Combine came, and this is where you start.As the story goes along, the level change drastically. You start at a big city, goes to a canal, a dead town, a coast, a desert, a prison, then back to the city to finally blow up the Citadel, the Combine's base of operations for Earth. While the gameplay doesn't change a lot thoughout the game, the atmosphere do.Now, the gameplay is nothing special in my book- it's pretty good(or above average depending on your look). You shoot guns to kill people. Though you can use physics against your enemies with your special 'Gravity Gun'. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up heavy objects and just throw them wherever you wish it to. This can definetely result in some funny moments, and can vary up the gameplay.The playtime for Half-Life is much longer then any other FPS games that came out around 2004(Halo 3, Doom 3, Modern Warfare, etc). The average playtime for those games were about 6~8 hours, while Half-Life's playtime is around 8~10 hours. Nothing special compared to modern games(well, actually maybe it is), but still pretty good for a 2004 game.The puzzles are back from Half-Life, though this time, a lot of the puzzles are about physics(not because the protagonist is a physicist, but to show off the engine). It involves simple tasks such as moving things to point A to point B, to puzzles like throwing barrels so it makes a bridge(a bit similiar puzzle is from Half-Life: Blue Shift).Let's talk about some miscellaneous stuff. The graphics were good at the time, but by today standards, it's average(even below avarage). The soundtrack is more of the same with Half-Life 1 actually, with some remixes and a few new tracks. It still takes advantage of the ambient themes.I probably don't even need to make this review any longer- as you may already have noticed, Half-Life 2 is an amazing game. But many people don't go over the cons for the game, and some of them are blantly obvious.The A.I. Jesus Christ, the A.I. It's not terrible, but considering Half-Life 1 was revolutionary in its A.I. programming, it was very dissapointing. A good game to compare this is Halo: Combat Evolved. In that game, the enemies flanked you, took defensive positions, etc. While Half-Life 1's A.I. was fantastic at the time, if you compare 1998 with 2004, it's not very different. And Half-Life 2 didn't have much better A.I. then its prequel.(the companions A.I. is a bit improved though)The game is really really easy. Really really really. I mean, Half-Life 1 was easy, but this game is just out there. I highly suggest not even touching the 'easy difficulty', A.K.A 'you can't ♥♥♥♥ing die difficulty'. There are also vehicles in the game, and while it's pretty fun, some parts are just fillers. Oh, and the ending is not that good. I also suggest buying the 'Orange Box', which includes Half-Life 2, its episodic sequels(that fills up the dissapointing ending), and a few other really great games.So we come down to the verdict. I give Half-Life 2 a solid(not really) 7.7/10. It's a great game, for reals. If Half-Life 1 was what every FPS should aim to be, Half-Life 2 is a bit more meh. While the Source engine is an amazing engine, Half-Life 2 doesn't do enough to really stand out on its own currently in 2015. But eleven years earlier, it was amazing.Once again, I highly suggest you to buy the Orange Box, and perhaps Half-Life 1 as well(it's a better game overall except for the story and the graphics). Them, Counter-Strike: Source, and Garry's Mod are a must buy if you're a Steam user.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh boy, Half-Life 2. The sequel to one of the greatest single player first-person shooters ever made. Unlike with that game, I wouldn't say that this game hasn't aged well, but rather other games have done what this game did better since this game came out. Although this is an FPS, you aren't just killing things then entire time. Sometimes you have to drive a vehicle and sometimes you have to solve a puzzle. One of the most prominent features of this game is the Gravity Gun. You can use it as a means of simply moving something somewhere else, or use it as a weapon by launching it at your enemies. This game graphically set the standard for what a 7th generation game should look like, and I still think this game is worth playing for the unique experience it offers. Highly recommended for fans of first person shooters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game with CAUTION. From what I've played this game supports only one playstyle. If you're not running around constantly dodging bullets and getting up in peoples' faces (aliens, whatever), you're DEAD. I appreciate the lack of regenerating health, though. Half-Life 2 features some of the most annoying enemies ever. They have no personality whatsoever (unlike Wheatley from Portal 2 or the enemies in Halo). Game options could have a ""very low to ultra"" option to save time. There is little variety in the 3 hours I've played.The story is all right. I'm neither utterly bored by it or blown away. Aliens, resistance, the usual.Puzzles are all right. Navigation, though, is another story. In the beginning of the game, there is a canal you have to walk through. The way to continue is on the SIDE of a box, and the game doesn't give a hint where you're supposed to go. Batman gave subtle hints to the player through his inner thoughts in the Arkham games. Gordon Freeman didn't have to speak, but seriously, the exploration system definitely detracted from the experience.Gun variety is HORRIBLE. You have to play with the same gun until you reach a certain point in which you can pick up a new gun. Rinse and repeat. Now, I know the generic alien army Combines are supposed to carry the same weapons, but couldn't the resistance give/modify cool weapons like in any good resistance story?Conclusion: If you are willing to run around like Duke Nukem most of the game guns blazing, then spend your money on this. If you are willing to do puzzles, spend your money on this. If you are willing to wait a couple of levels to get a new gun, spend your money on this. I can barely recommend this game, because the playstyle it forced me to use made me more alert and fast. I can't say that I had a lot of fun, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HL2 is a classic for it's at-the-time innovative first presentation of the Source engine and it's physics, facial animations of npcs, and having a decent looking game at the time run good even on some low end PC hardware back in '04. The story can be appealing to some and the game has a unique atomsphere. If you are a fan of FPS games, considering picking it up and giving it a try			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 is one of the most deserving works of any vested gamer's attention. It is a classic masterpiece of design and story-telling; the yard-stick of excellence for a first-person shooter.Coupled with Halo, its release has brought about the most dramatic changes to the way games are made, presented, and judged over the past 10 years. It is for that reason that it loses little to none of it's deep, enjoyable experience when played today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an awesome game! Story line, voice acting, gameplay, everything is super amazing! There is not easy to find bad things about this game, but here are some bad things, if you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me: 1. The parts when you are alone. I don't like that. Nobody to show the way, or to protect you. 2. The barnacles. Eugh! They are disgusting.3. Ravenholm. Too many damn zombies. A creepy part of the game, but still amazing. I know it's wierd how I think zombies are creepy, when I have killed thousands of them in L4D2, but these zombies are different. They got more health, and they got the 4th bad point too.4. Headcrabs. Why? Because they remind me of spiders, and I hate spiders. I don't like the headcrabs' legs, sounds, and worst of all, their mouths.5. Jumpscares. If you want all the achievemnts, I can garantie you atleast one or ten jumpscares.To sum up: Buy this game! Give GabeN money! And buy it again, because this game is a must			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 is undoubtedly my favorite game of all time. Valve managed to create lovable and relatable characters, while keeping a strong story at the game's core. I find myself replaying this game constantly. Whether it's to test some glitch out, try my hand at speedrunning, or for nostalgia's sake, every time I launch the game for a playthrough, it feels just as good as my first time ever launching it. This game, without a doubt, will stand the test of time for years to come. In the unlikely event that you've never heard of or seen gameplay of Half-Life 2, this game is a must-play for any story-driven gaming enthusiast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Word of advice: Download the demo first and check how you FEEL.I recently started playing Half-Life 2 and even though it's a great game, with nice graphics, interesting story and speech it makes me so NAUSEOUS, LIGHT-HEADED and WEAK (like 15 to 20 minutes after I started playing). I did some research about it and it turns out it's quite common with some HL players, for this reason I urge you to try it before buying it!I have tried the game on 3 different occasions and I always get the same results, I will try and change the settings to see if I can fix this issue or make it so that I won't feel as bad as I do now. If everything fails, I will probably stop playing it, which is a shame. Regardless of playing only 2.8hrs over 2 days I can say that this game has a very well written narrative, the gameplay is quite nice as well, considering the age of this game. I know that for some people the art work could be better but I don't mind it at all. I rather have an interesting game with poor art work than the opposite.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 You are living half a life if you haven't played this yet. - Not Actually Madlabba Welcome to Half-Life 2, truly a masterpiece. This game was really ahead of it's time, setting an example for future videogame titles, like Duke Nukem Forever, or Limbo of the Lost.The story revolves around the protagonist - a survivor of the Black Mesa incident from the first game. This time he is in some post-soviet country, rallying up a rebellion to stop the alien rule over human race. He is quite charismatic it seems, because everyone is ready to die in order to keep him alive. And his name was.. ELI VANCE That's right. Your favourite videogame character is back to kick some♥♥♥♥♥ Or be taken hostage for half of the game. Either work for him, because he is so badass.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When it comes Half Life, Valve doesnt disappoint. Awesome Game wirh a Briliant Story line. Was sceptical when it was no longer taking place within the Black Mesa facility where it all started as i felt it was that enviroment that was a huge aspect to the game but HL2 setting in City 17 was very well done . Story was just as good and its just a really fun game. If you havent played it i recommend getting HL2 and Episode 1 + 2. You will love it if you love FPS.Updating this review as for the badge and still i stand by my point. Half Life is amazing and will be apart of me till the day i die.WE WANT HL3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												I do recommed this game and anyone that dosent is more than likely a Call of duty fan boy.PROS:1. Gravity Gun: One of the most orignial and fun guns ever in history.2. Physics: Still some of the best Physics of any game ever, you can pick up almost anything with gravity gun and use it.3. Story: Hands down Valve if you always get something down its story they never directly tell whats  happening but you  find out over time and paying attion to the game.4. Atmosphere: The world itself is like nothing you have ever seen 5. Graphics: Even after so long is still holds up to alot of shooters.CONS: 1. Graphics: Even tho it dose hold up to alot of shooters its still a older game and it can show at times.2. Gameplay: Now i was debating to put this in pros or cons and tbh unless you are useing the gravity gun all the time imo the guns are a drag for this day in age, but back in the day they where the best. The first Act is good for story but is boring for gameplay tell you get the grav gun.But it dose get alot more fun with the more options of guns later on.3. My only other con is why havent played this yet  Its hands down the best FPS ever and anyone thats played the whole game would agree10/10 hands down ive replayed this game more than any other single player game.

												Now, before I get started, I just want to get one thing straight: This is not at all a bad game! That being said, I don't see what all of the hype is about. First of all, if you have no idea what this game is, don't worry, nobody who's played this game does either. Half Life 2 is incredibly confusing, albeit only storywise: the actual gameplay mechanics are fairly simple. My main problem with this game is that at some points, it just gets repetitive. However, most of the time it's fairly amusing and I thoroughly enjoyed it. All in all, a solid 7 / 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2. Valve seems to know how to make great sequels. [Portal 2, Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2] Yeah, I've already said it. This is a great game. For the graphics, they have certainly aged well. This does not look like a game from 2004 which, for an almost 10 year old game, is great. The story is well written, as well. I found the game kinda difficult (on Normal mode) but the difficulty amps up quite a bit in Ravenholm. If you need more convincing (Remember! the game isn't for everyone.) then check out Nerdcubed's Half-Life 2 video here:

In my honest opinion, I give this game 9.5 stars out of 10. It is very rare for a game to be absolutely flawless and perfect. Again this isn't for everyone and I wrote this review from my own opinion, so you may think it's the worst game in existence. I don't care, because this review is over. *mic drop*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 is a brilliant combination of good story telling and extrodinary gameplay. Easily one of the best games I have ever played. Delivered with an emotional and immersive story, with some of the most memorable characters I've ever encountered in a video game. The gameplay is a nod to getting rid of all of the fancy, confusing gunplay of most modern shooters. Leaving it with a simple but, in no doubt memorable adventure through the ever so immersing world. I had no complaints at all when I was playing, and enjoyed every moment I spent in this game. Easily one of if not the best first person shooter to this date. I am still patiently waiting for the sequel (If it's ever even released) and reccomend everyone play this game, espessially if you are new to PC gaming, this is a great place to start.10/10Best game of all time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Ten years ago... I haven't made a review of this game. Purely because I could not put words in to describe it. You can't describe it. It is just emotion and... really I have no idea what to say. If you do not own it, get it. Honestly. Even if you know nothing about it. It's just being someone who was as a kid there at the start. Amazed with the graphics and gameplay. It is just so much emotion. There really is no way to let you feel this. I can only reccomend... I think you may understand if you play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superb game, part of my favorite overall series.Pros:*Characters are consisted in an array of quirkiness, relatability, good AI, and helpfulness (albeit frustrating in the occasional tight rooms).*Great for fans of science fiction (teleportation, aliens that aren't just humans with green skin) as well as liking the occasional science reference thrown in.*World is bleak, but not crushingly so, and full of dystopian fantasies that are implemented without too much hammering in. *Gameplay is without traditional cutscenes, very few mobility obstacles, fast at a reasonable pace, and is broken off by story scenes to prevent action fatigue.*Soundtrack presents a nice blend of futuristic techno with eerie ambience.*Not every alien is a jerk. NPCs are likewise generally good and not macho/overly cynical.*The settings range from urban areas, to mines, to abandoned towns, to coastlines, and radioactive wastelands.*Great facial animations.Cons:*The protagonist never speaks, which can put off some.*While there is some exploration, it is mostly a very linear game.*Driving sections usually are longer than they have to be.

												The greatest FPS fps of all time. It may not be some heavily gameplay design focused super polished masterpiece like Doom. However the atmosphere, the characters, the physics and environment interaction that still hold up, every big to subtle tid bit of detail where you can tell they poured every ounce of talent and soul into, it all just comes together to make one of the most profound video games ever made. Not to say the gameplay isn't special, for being the game series that sort of set off the whole trend of a more linear focused level design punctuated by amazing scripted events, the gameplay is still miles ahead of most modern FPS games today that do the same thing. One of the things that captures me the most about this game is the absolute sheer amount of variation of different situations this game throws at you. The game absolutely never gets repetitive at all, the game always tosses situations at you that you never really have done beforehand in the game. The fact that the game still captures that feeling of immersion without ever having to sacrifice that feeling in order to make the level design gameplay oriented is just amazing.I could go on but I don't really think too many people would read this, and everyone already knows how good this game is. All I can say is that it gives off that feeling of wonder and detail, of a full emotional yet functional and fun experience, like no other game before or after yet. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are a lot of video games out there. From shooters, to racers, to RPG's to RTS's... It has never been a better time to be a gamer nowadays. The choice we have as gamers is overwhelming, and even though there are a lot of flawed products out there, a lot of great titles make their way into our libraries on an yearly basis. As I see it, video games are divided into three categories: Bad, Decent, and Great, from worse to best. But some games are so unique, different and so many light years ahead of everything else, they don't quite fall under any kind of category. I know a few of these games myself. Half Life 2 is also light years ahead of those games.Half Life 2 is an experience. It's almost movie like in it's immersion. I found myself caring about the protagonist, Gordon Freeman, my allies Alyx and Eli Vance, Dr Mossman and Dr K, in the fight against the fascist alien race known as the combine. I found myself caring about every little detail of what happened to them, and to my surprise, I have never felt this happy, sad and angry while playing a video game. It truly is an experience.I won't spoil the story to anyone, but it is by far, and in my opinion, the best story ever put into the video game form, for what it tells you, for what you have to figure out for yourself, and for the most intriguing and misterious character to ever grace a PC game (or any game for that matter): The G-man. When you play this game, you will know exactly what I am talking about. Gameplay is varied, and the controls are close to perfection. You will walk and shoot like an FPS, drive a boat and buggy. The common link between them is the fact they are seamless and feel like you are on a true quest, no section is out of place and they are all extremely well done. The concept of levels isn't quite present, as the game world feels like a whole.Half life 2 is an amazing accomplishment. It is the proof that games can be art, and can rival Hollywood in story telling. Make no mistake, Half Life 2 is in my opinion, the best game ever made, and worth every penny and minute you put into it. It is a rewarding experience like no other, and there are almost no games who can even compare to it. A timeless masterpiece.The GoodExtremely fun to playGroundbreaking storyEnemy AIShooting mechanicsVaried gameplay The BadNothing I can think of, it really is that good, and as close to perfection as you will ever get.10/10 - Legendary			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily one of the the best shooters I've ever played, with one of the best storylines. Most of the characters are lovable (DOG in particular) and make you feel like you're actually in the game. It has a sense of mysteriousness, mainly because of the G-Man, and also the decaying urban towns & cities that look distinctly like rough & worn down parts of industrial major-cities we inhabit today. I wouldn't even call it a shooter, as it varies between genres. It gives you a strong sense of adventure and suspense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh, good old Half-Life series. While gamers are still waiting for Half-Life 3, they can just complete the second part over and over again, and every time they do that, they'll discover something new. Half-Life 2 is a game full of secrets, surprises, and great level design features. I wouldn't say it's better than Half-Life 1 but that's only because they are so different that they can't actually be compared.So, what does this game have to offer? For me, it is the following:1. A great storyline.Not that Half-Life 1, the origin of the series, had a worse one, no. But now Half-Life 2 has a lot more dialogues than the first game, and they are a lot more detailed. The story is no longer a ""human vs. alien"" cliché, Valve turned it into a very original, very clever ""human AND aliens vs. mutated humans controlled by a man controlled by a mysterious thing previously controlled by Nihilanth"". Sounds good.2. Great graphics.I have no desire to know what Call of Duty fans would say about the graphics in Half-Life 2. For me, they will always stay as awesome as I thought when I first saw them. Seriously, look at this game. It came from 2004 (11 years ago). Now, check other games from 2004 and look at them. Half-Life 2 is the obvious winner. In 2015, it still looks pretty. At least, for me.3. Physics.Physics! Boxes breaking into really small parts! Carry boxes with yourself! What else could you dream of in 2004? In Half-Life 2, physics are just awesome, without exaggeration.4. Alyx.A woman companion. I wouldn't say she looks as nice yet having a woman accompanying you is a great feature. Especially if she can shoot at enemies and even kill them sometimes. What else do you need?5. Puzzles.The campaign of Half-Life 2 is not linear. That's what makes it beautiful: lots of puzzling elements (I keep getting stuck at some levels if I don't play this game, say, for a month or two). Totally not like Call of Duty, the best shooting range game of all times. In this game, you don't simply go from point A to point B, you discover secrets, solve puzzles, escape from a hunter chopper, and only meanwhile, fight enemies.These are only 5 features I'd most like to point out. There are always much more but to discover them, you have to play the game yourself. I totally recommend this game, it deserves ten stars out of five but I can't rate it this way, unfortunately. But keep in mind that you still have to play Half-Life 1 to get into the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing this game for a good amount of time i can write a honest review about it:For one most of the later missions were incredibly easy when some of the earlier missions were Rage-Inducingly difficult.I found the game to be a bit too short for the amount of content it has, I half expected the game to go on for 20+ Chapters when it only went on for afew chapters.Also i was surprised when i fired this up that i didn't get an incredibly low Frame Rate seeing as my Computer isn't built  for gaming but i sort of expected it seeing as the game is from 2004.Do i recommend this game? Yes. I think the game is incredibly fun and challenging. The only thing to do now is to buy all it's Content and play through those, I will make reviews for each and Recommendation or not this game will still be one of my favourites.P.S: Fkin Valve. Release HL3 already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half Life 2 is the game that made me fall in love with Valve and Steam. It opened up a whole new world to me. The incredible programming in this game really shows you the dedication the team had in making a sequal that could surpass the awe of the original. This game set the bar for other developers when it was released and the gaming industry owes a lot to the phyisics engine that was originally in it, Source. Definietely one of my personal favorites.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is in my top 3 games of all time. For me, everything just clicks in this game, but most notably the atmosphere and characters. First off, you do not need to have played the first half life to appreatate this one, and in fact the first time I played HL2, I barely even knew what the first one was about. The dystopian setting has always been one of my favorites, and this game protrays this perfectly. Everything in the game seems as if it is barely working and is about to fall apart. Although the game is now nearly 10 years old, its graphics still look pleasing, and the art style is as amazing as always. The level variety is stunning, and thoughout the ten hour campagin, it never begins to become boring. The characters feel like people, and you begin to genuinely care about them. Each weapon feels unique, and I ended up using almost all of them at one point or another. (Something I think they improved over Half Life 1) This game is basically created Steam, so please buy this wonderful game! And if this game doesnt sound interesting to you, there are litterally hundreads of mods, so almost as great as the orginal game. There is no reason not to buy this game, though if you have the money, get the Orange Box for sure, as it has much more value. Pros:+Story+Gameplay+Characters+Physics+Litterally everythingNeutral:*No multiplayer (But it doesnt need it)Overall: 10/10 I love this game, and have played though it about four times. I can find nearly no flaws, please buy this game, you have no idea what you are missing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												half life 2 one of the most scariest 1st person shooters of the decade with alot of creepy enemies ranging from small terrifying zombie heads to freakin tall tripods not only that half life 2 also has two mini chapters half life 2 episode 1 and 2 and even minier chapters like lost coast and deathmatch i dont own death match but i do own lost coast and both episodes and even the original half life 2 believe it or not i have a brother who was scared of the zombies but has overcame his fear of the zombies and now he is brave enough to hit them with the crowbar now half life2 also introduces the characters gordon freeman and alyx and the creepy white-faced G-man dont get me wrong even i am scared of things in half life 2 as well i think the scariest thing is when those guards invade the apartment and you are woken up by alyx you know the place where the power suit is i always finding books and putting them into a pile			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played the first game when I was 6. Not really sure what was going on back then when I played it. Played this at my cousin's house when it came out and wasn't sure what was going on then either, but it was totally a brand new experience. Gonna be honest, I never got around to playing the first game again, so I still have no idea what this game is about other than that you're some important famous dude that kills and destroys stuff somehow with a manky old crowbar. If you have Steam, you're kinda obligated to have a Valve game, so just get this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A shooter that never gets old! Gravity-gun is always fun and the adventure changes all the time, letting you think in different ways.The first Half Life game was awesome in its time.It still is fun. But Half Life 2, thats the game that has aged in a good way. It still delivers massive amounts of fun! Todays fps game still would do good if they look at Half Life 2 for inspiration. From the start, the intro-part to the end of the game, its great story-telling and still alot of variation in the gameplay and the enviroment changes it makes. Mayby the water-vehicle part was a little long, but most of the time, every time they add new stuff, enemys or weapons in the game, they dont over-use it in the sense that you get bored.Gordon Freeman is a man with few words, but still Valve can make great characters in this game. Valve are just that good. I dont want them ever to change Gordons lack of words, he dont need them. Its one of the things that makes the Half Life saga great. And G-Man. He pays me to write this review. Valve, take you time doing Half Life 3. We dont want it to be anything lesser than the greatest fps of its time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In some ways, this is a very old-fashioned FPS.  You have a variety of weapons, but can only hold so much ammo.   When you pick up stuff (by touching it), it adds those bullets/health to your supplies if you have any missing, and any excess is lost.  Carrying around health packs/extra ammo is impossible.  You still progress through a bunch of areas, needing to press the right button or trigger the right event to proceed.What sets it apart is the obvious polish, quality design, and good story.  The game uses only in-engine cinematics, and never takes over the player's camera.  It counts on you to observe the world around you, take an interest in the environment, and solve the various physics puzzles.  Instead of just a bunch of corridors and enemies (though it has those, too), it focuses on small engagements, then big set-piece battles.  You'll play for a while in one setting on foot, then switch to a more vehicle-oriented bit, then a new mechanic is introduced, then it kind of repeats those 3, etc.  This varies up the gameplay and keeps introducing fresh concepts through little in-game tutorials.About the only complaint I had is that the game wants you to be immersed in its world, and use their impressive physics engine to solve puzzles.  It wants you to approach the obstacles as if you were actually there, making use of the objects around you to get past them.  This is great when it works, like making use of plastic barrels' buoyancy to get past one spot, but then you get to points where you try out a solution over and over, convinced it should be working, and it won't.  Oh, it should work, because it seems obvious, and because it totally would work in the real world, but in the game they want you to do something else pre-scripted, and until you figure out what that thing is, you're not going anywhere.  They make you stack boxes & crates in several spots to climb up/over things, but try it in the wrong place and you'll hit an invisible wall.  There's one area where you have to get past an electric fence and can see the power cable running above you.  Even though you've got a way to hurl nice big, sharp, wide saw blades with great speed and accuracy, you can't sever that cable.  No amount of shooting will help, either.  That cable's not a solid object, it's just there to let you know where to go to hit the switch that you need to find in order to turn off the fence.Despite a few tired elements and some minor breaks in the immersion, this is one hell of a game.

												One of the greatest story driven FPS ever made. You don't need to play the first game to appreciate this one, but there are a lot of references to the first game that you will only understand if you played it. Every detail of this game is very highly polished. All the characters act in a way that is very realistic and you can tell a lot of work went into making them. There are a few unique weapons to this game. The Gravity Gun, Antlion summoning ball, and the crossbow with a scope that can attach enemies to walls were all amazing weapons. The town of Ravenholm looks like it was made for all the zombie lovers out there. After all this time, the game still doesn't look dated that much. Most of the graphics looks pretty decent and the mechanics are still solid. The game will last around 12 hours, depending on how much you explore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10This game is definitely one of the best on Steam. I've had so much fun playing through it. The world is well developed, immersive, and interactable. You can shoot sawblades into wooden objects to keep them there while you perform another task. You can shoot paint cans at objects, and it will turn them white. You can crouch behind a crashed car and push it up towards baddies until you run them over. You can get in a crane and drop shipping containers on people. Most of the challenge comes from just finding your way around. Despite the fact that a simple scientist is capable of killing so many people, the story is unique and captivating. The gameplay is diverse, challenging, and fun. The environment is lovely, which is typical of all the production aspects of this game. In my opinion every gamer should experience this game.10/10 would get jumpscared by an antlion again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 is widely known as one of the greatest games of all time, and for good reason. Almost everything about this game is perfect. The pacing is great, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the moment you step out of the train in City 17 right up until the epic conclusion. The guns are punchy, not to mention the Gravity Gun's awesome power. The story is immersive and fantastic, and the entire game feels like a journey, partly due to the fact that there is never a cutscene that you have to sit through. Valve's Source Engine has put so much life into this game, especially the characters. The facial animations are believeable, to the point where I would feel empathy for the characters, the physics are good (Yet sometimes laughable) and the gameplay is fantastic. You are immersed in a living, breathing world right from the get-go. Half-Life 2 is an incredible game that demands to be played by everyone who has any interest in  the shooter genre  video games at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Half-Life 2 is a First Person Shooter developed by Valve and released late 2004. This is actually the first game I owned and played on my steam account, I cannot speak highly enough of the whole Half-Life series.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Half-Life 2 starts on a train arriving at City 17, you play as the protagonist “Gordon Freeman”, get used to that name, because everyone knows it and exclaims it when they see you. (Well, everyone but the “Combine” police force, when they first see you in the introduction level at City 17.)Not long after getting off the train, you come across old acquaintances Dr. Kleiner and Barney Calhoun, they send Gordon on his way to join up with an underground group known as the ""Lambda Resistance"".I won't risk saying and spoiling anything about the rest of story; this is one of the games that I contrast against many other story telling narratives – because it's so well done. Even replaying the game after so many years, Half-Life 2 is still a very enjoyable game and I believe the series will survive the test of time to become a staple in video game history. (At LEAST Steam history)

Gameplay: As you progress through the game you unlock new weapons, and explore new area's, you can switch between your weapons with the scroll wheel or number keys, sometimes you double up on the same weapon categories (for example, you might have two pistols, or two rifles so you'll need to scroll through both of those, or hit the key twice to rotate between them)All of your standard FPS's are in the game, your basic “go to” (Bread-and-butter, Rice-and-beans, defaulted-to, basic, etc) weapons are: The crowbar, pistol, and Submachine Gun.The weapons you unlock are: Crowbar, Gravity Gun, Bugbait, 9mm pistol, .357 Magnum, SMG, AR2 Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, Crossbow, Grenade, and RPG.

Achievements: About half of the achievements in Half-Life 2 are unlocked on your first play through, the other half are Easter eggs, or various objectives challanges.The hardest/longest achievement is Lambda Locator, which requires you to find each Lambda Cache. (The Greek letter “L” is known as Lambda “λ”) As you play through the game you will sometimes come across a “λ” Lambda, that means there's a Lambda Resistance weapons cache nearby.

Price: The standalone price for Half-Life 2 is $9.99 you will probably come close to nine hours of gameplay within this game. I've personally replayed the story several times so for me it was a great value.However, I have a better recommendation; if you are thinking about getting Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and/or Portal, you should purchase The Orange Box for $19.99, you will get all of the afore mentioned game titles.Conclusion: Story: Excellent, a personal all-time favorite of mine. Gameplay: Solid controls, solid physics, solid, solid solid. Even after all these years the game is still very good. Achievements: Fairly doable 100% completed game. Price: Fair, but I suggest getting the Orange Box deal.I recommend this game to people who enjoy darker serious stories, FPS's, or don't swear by the latest game releases (Translation: you as a gamer are backwards compatible with older games/graphics/engines).Thanks for reading my review! I have a couple great stories of my first experience in Ravenholm when I was younger, if you'd like to hear them drop me a message.Related reviewsHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode OneHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode TwoHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(All you hear is muffled crying) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Superb game, part of my favorite overall series.Pros:*Characters are consisted in an array of quirkiness, relatability, good AI, and helpfulness (albeit frustrating in the occasional tight rooms).*Great for fans of science fiction (teleportation, aliens that aren't just humans with green skin) as well as liking the occasional science reference thrown in.*World is bleak, but not crushingly so, and full of dystopian fantasies that are implemented without too much hammering in. *Gameplay is without traditional cutscenes, very few mobility obstacles, fast at a reasonable pace, and is broken off by story scenes to prevent action fatigue.*Soundtrack presents a nice blend of futuristic techno with eerie ambience.*Not every alien is a jerk. NPCs are likewise generally good and not macho/overly cynical.*The settings range from urban areas, to mines, to abandoned towns, to coastlines, and radioactive wastelands.*Great facial animations.Cons:*The protagonist never speaks, which can put off some.*While there is some exploration, it is mostly a very linear game.*Driving sections usually are longer than they have to be.

												The greatest FPS fps of all time. It may not be some heavily gameplay design focused super polished masterpiece like Doom. However the atmosphere, the characters, the physics and environment interaction that still hold up, every big to subtle tid bit of detail where you can tell they poured every ounce of talent and soul into, it all just comes together to make one of the most profound video games ever made. Not to say the gameplay isn't special, for being the game series that sort of set off the whole trend of a more linear focused level design punctuated by amazing scripted events, the gameplay is still miles ahead of most modern FPS games today that do the same thing. One of the things that captures me the most about this game is the absolute sheer amount of variation of different situations this game throws at you. The game absolutely never gets repetitive at all, the game always tosses situations at you that you never really have done beforehand in the game. The fact that the game still captures that feeling of immersion without ever having to sacrifice that feeling in order to make the level design gameplay oriented is just amazing.I could go on but I don't really think too many people would read this, and everyone already knows how good this game is. All I can say is that it gives off that feeling of wonder and detail, of a full emotional yet functional and fun experience, like no other game before or after yet. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is something very special about this game, and that would be that it is flat out creepy. There were many times where I would get very stressed out, but it was because there were many dangerous situations, like carefully shuffling along the bottom support beams of a large bridge while being shot at. Of course this was my second FPS experience after Portal so having an actual gun this time around was new for me.I could go on for hours about how wonderful this game is. It's got humour, excitment, danger, freaky monster zombie crabs and holy cow those things sound awful. Helpful tip: Don't play Ravenholm at 4AM.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The incredible programming in this game really shows you the dedication the team had in making a sequal that could surpass the awe of the original. This game set the bar for other developers when it was released and the gaming industry owes a lot to the phyisics engine that was originally in it, Source. Definietely one of my personal favorites.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an awesome game! Story line, voice acting, gameplay, everything is super amazing! There is not easy to find bad things about this game, but here are some bad things, if you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me: 1. The parts when you are alone. I don't like that. Nobody to show the way, or to protect you. 2. The barnacles. Eugh! They are disgusting.3. Ravenholm. Too many damn zombies. A creepy part of the game, but still amazing. I know it's wierd how I think zombies are creepy, when I have killed thousands of them in L4D2, but these zombies are different. They got more health, and they got the 4th bad point too.4. Headcrabs. Why? Because they remind me of spiders, and I hate spiders. I don't like the headcrabs' legs, sounds, and worst of all, their mouths.5. Jumpscares. If you want all the achievemnts, I can garantie you atleast one or ten jumpscares.To sum up: Buy this game! Give GabeN money! And buy it again, because this game is a must			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 is a brilliant combination of good story telling and extrodinary gameplay. Easily one of the best games I have ever played. Delivered with an emotional and immersive story, with some of the most memorable characters I've ever encountered in a video game. The gameplay is a nod to getting rid of all of the fancy, confusing gunplay of most modern shooters. Leaving it with a simple but, in no doubt memorable adventure through the ever so immersing world. I had no complaints at all when I was playing, and enjoyed every moment I spent in this game. Easily one of if not the best first person shooter to this date. I am still patiently waiting for the sequel (If it's ever even released) and reccomend everyone play this game, espessially if you are new to PC gaming, this is a great place to start.10/10Best game of all time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of the best shooters you could ever find on the face of the earth. It's worth every penny. The graphics are beautiful, even by today's standards, the story and gameplay are amazing, it's actually hard, even on easy mode, and it's extremely moddable. The source engine is extremely versitile, and this game only has 1 cutscene in it, the beginning cutscene, or two if you count the end to be a cutscene.So in other words, 10 / 10, best f**king game ever.

All of the main elements are there, the game play is very smooth and enjoyable, there are plenty of mods to either enhace, or change, the looks and feels of things, and for people with a low performance computer, it's possible to still play this game.  Playing this reminds me of how young I was when games like these started to come out and its neat to see how times have changed.   Still, it's ahrd to beat a classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game changer. The bar to which all other FPS's should judge themselves and be judged by.Upon it's release Half Life 2 was cutting edge, not just for a follow up FPS, but for games in general.Graphics and set peices that hold up even now, 8 years on from it's release.Gravity effects, AI that flanks, nades, covers and changes their behavior seeds with every load and save made.Topped off with totally immersive story and charcters, a must for any dystopian/ Orwellian fan. After opening a portal to another world at the Black Mesa research facility in Half Life, the Earth came to the attention of an all powerful Alien force, who after brushing aside all of the worlds defences in the '7 hour war' have now enslaved humanity and are slowy draining the planet of all its' natural resorces.Order is maintainted via a 'combine' military force of half alien half human hybrids that have grouped up the remaining human kind into large rundown numbered Citys.""Wake up and smell the ashes""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ""A right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world."" TL;DR: ...why don't you have this in your Steam liabry if you're a Steam user?Half-Life 2 is the sequel to the smash-hit debut title for Valve. Half-Life had revolutionary graphics engine, amazing A.I, logical puzzles and an engaging story- nothing like other FPS games that came out before Half-Life. Half-Life won over 50 awards, and is to this date announced as the 'best FPS game ever made'. And Half-Life 2 is the direct sequel to this masterpiece, so it has to live up to its expectations, though cliches with sequels are that they are only made to milk money. THAT is not true with Half-LIfe 2.Not only Half-Life 2 also had a ground-breaking physics engine called Source, it leaved the 'closed enviorment' atmosphere behind, but used it to make a even better written storyline.Now, keep in mind that Half-Life 2 was made in 2004. I will be reviewing this game like it came out in 2004, but also as if it came out in modern times.The Source engine is still a pretty good engine now, but back then, it was amazing. The signature weapon of the game, the Gravity Gun, was made specifically to show out this new physics. You can't play the original Source engine from 2004 because they updated all games that used the engine to have the updated version from Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so you mostly won't suffer from the engines cons, but back then, the sound engine was terrible for the Source.The story continues right where you left off. You were hired by the 'G-Man' because he was impressed at your skills, and put you into stasis untill the time came. Now, it's time to smell the ashes, and Gordon Freeman, the physicist you're contolling, has to join up with the Rebels to fight off the alien 'Combine' forces. The Combine are this galactic federation that enslaves every alien species come by, and puts them as the member of their 'union'. The humans had a 7-hour long war with them, until the UN HQ burnt down and Earth surrendered.In Half-Life, the first bit of the game was you trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of Black Mesa, the research facility you were working. Then your mission was to save the world from suffering the same misery Black Mesa suffered by killing the invaders' master and ending the invasion. But Gordon was a bit too late, and the invaders found a way out of Black Mesa(which was just teleporting there) before Gordon did. But since Gordon did kill their master, they stopped fighting the humans(except for the non-inteligent ones). Then the Combine came, and this is where you start.As the story goes along, the level change drastically. You start at a big city, goes to a canal, a dead town, a coast, a desert, a prison, then back to the city to finally blow up the Citadel, the Combine's base of operations for Earth. While the gameplay doesn't change a lot thoughout the game, the atmosphere do.Now, the gameplay is nothing special in my book- it's pretty good(or above average depending on your look). You shoot guns to kill people. Though you can use physics against your enemies with your special 'Gravity Gun'. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up heavy objects and just throw them wherever you wish it to. This can definetely result in some funny moments, and can vary up the gameplay.The playtime for Half-Life is much longer then any other FPS games that came out around 2004(Halo 3, Doom 3, Modern Warfare, etc). The average playtime for those games were about 6~8 hours, while Half-Life's playtime is around 8~10 hours. Nothing special compared to modern games(well, actually maybe it is), but still pretty good for a 2004 game.The puzzles are back from Half-Life, though this time, a lot of the puzzles are about physics(not because the protagonist is a physicist, but to show off the engine). It involves simple tasks such as moving things to point A to point B, to puzzles like throwing barrels so it makes a bridge(a bit similiar puzzle is from Half-Life: Blue Shift).Let's talk about some miscellaneous stuff. The graphics were good at the time, but by today standards, it's average(even below avarage). The soundtrack is more of the same with Half-Life 1 actually, with some remixes and a few new tracks. It still takes advantage of the ambient themes.I probably don't even need to make this review any longer- as you may already have noticed, Half-Life 2 is an amazing game. But many people don't go over the cons for the game, and some of them are blantly obvious.The A.I. Jesus Christ, the A.I. It's not terrible, but considering Half-Life 1 was revolutionary in its A.I. programming, it was very dissapointing. A good game to compare this is Halo: Combat Evolved. In that game, the enemies flanked you, took defensive positions, etc. While Half-Life 1's A.I. was fantastic at the time, if you compare 1998 with 2004, it's not very different. And Half-Life 2 didn't have much better A.I. then its prequel.(the companions A.I. is a bit improved though)The game is really really easy. Really really really. I mean, Half-Life 1 was easy, but this game is just out there. I highly suggest not even touching the 'easy difficulty', A.K.A 'you can't ♥♥♥♥ing die difficulty'. There are also vehicles in the game, and while it's pretty fun, some parts are just fillers. Oh, and the ending is not that good. I also suggest buying the 'Orange Box', which includes Half-Life 2, its episodic sequels(that fills up the dissapointing ending), and a few other really great games.So we come down to the verdict. I give Half-Life 2 a solid(not really) 7.7/10. It's a great game, for reals. If Half-Life 1 was what every FPS should aim to be, Half-Life 2 is a bit more meh. While the Source engine is an amazing engine, Half-Life 2 doesn't do enough to really stand out on its own currently in 2015. But eleven years earlier, it was amazing.Once again, I highly suggest you to buy the Orange Box, and perhaps Half-Life 1 as well(it's a better game overall except for the story and the graphics). Them, Counter-Strike: Source, and Garry's Mod are a must buy if you're a Steam user.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Half-Life, changed the way people play First-Person Shooters, and overall... video games in general. It's very rare when the sequel can not only do the exact same thing, but OUTDO it's predesessor. Half-Life 2 is one of (if not the) best game ever made. Half-Life 1, made Valve known. Half-Life 2 permanently made Vavle Software a Legend.			",82,2,0,2,2,2,3

												One of my all time favorite games. The graphics may not be really good by today standards, but the gameplay revolving arround puzzles and straight action sequences are amazing. The level design is really well thought and the story is great! 10/10 - Masterpiece :')			",86,9,4,10,2,3,4

												This is an awesome game! Story line, voice acting, gameplay, everything is super amazing! There is not easy to find bad things about this game, but here are some bad things, if you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me: 1. The parts when you are alone. I don't like that. Nobody to show the way, or to protect you. 2. The barnacles. Eugh! They are disgusting.3. Ravenholm. Too many damn zombies. A creepy part of the game, but still amazing. I know it's wierd how I think zombies are creepy, when I have killed thousands of them in L4D2, but these zombies are different. They got more health, and they got the 4th bad point too.4. Headcrabs. Why? Because they remind me of spiders, and I hate spiders. I don't like the headcrabs' legs, sounds, and worst of all, their mouths.5. Jumpscares. If you want all the achievemnts, I can garantie you atleast one or ten jumpscares.To sum up: Buy this game! Give GabeN money! And buy it again, because this game is a must			",59,0,0,1,1,0,1

												Half life 2 had  alot of expectations for me in my book. It was a long time since I played Half-Life, but still vaguely remember  from 1999 how tricky, difficult and fun it was.  SO as I begna to play this I was in the mind set that the game would be excellent, which it WAS!  Half life 2  I think brings a hold another whole  prepective to Half-Life in that it in coporates the fundametals of the first game, but allows it to expand greatly to another realms and new exiciting maps.   What I was really impressed with is that the games 's story doesn't get corny like most video game storyies line do. This game is well sought out and hopefully they will release a third. Well like to tell more but you have to play and see!~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ""A right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world."" TL;DR: ...why don't you have this in your Steam liabry if you're a Steam user?Half-Life 2 is the sequel to the smash-hit debut title for Valve. Half-Life had revolutionary graphics engine, amazing A.I, logical puzzles and an engaging story- nothing like other FPS games that came out before Half-Life. Half-Life won over 50 awards, and is to this date announced as the 'best FPS game ever made'. And Half-Life 2 is the direct sequel to this masterpiece, so it has to live up to its expectations, though cliches with sequels are that they are only made to milk money. THAT is not true with Half-LIfe 2.Not only Half-Life 2 also had a ground-breaking physics engine called Source, it leaved the 'closed enviorment' atmosphere behind, but used it to make a even better written storyline.Now, keep in mind that Half-Life 2 was made in 2004. I will be reviewing this game like it came out in 2004, but also as if it came out in modern times.The Source engine is still a pretty good engine now, but back then, it was amazing. The signature weapon of the game, the Gravity Gun, was made specifically to show out this new physics. You can't play the original Source engine from 2004 because they updated all games that used the engine to have the updated version from Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so you mostly won't suffer from the engines cons, but back then, the sound engine was terrible for the Source.The story continues right where you left off. You were hired by the 'G-Man' because he was impressed at your skills, and put you into stasis untill the time came. Now, it's time to smell the ashes, and Gordon Freeman, the physicist you're contolling, has to join up with the Rebels to fight off the alien 'Combine' forces. The Combine are this galactic federation that enslaves every alien species come by, and puts them as the member of their 'union'. The humans had a 7-hour long war with them, until the UN HQ burnt down and Earth surrendered.In Half-Life, the first bit of the game was you trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of Black Mesa, the research facility you were working. Then your mission was to save the world from suffering the same misery Black Mesa suffered by killing the invaders' master and ending the invasion. But Gordon was a bit too late, and the invaders found a way out of Black Mesa(which was just teleporting there) before Gordon did. But since Gordon did kill their master, they stopped fighting the humans(except for the non-inteligent ones). Then the Combine came, and this is where you start.As the story goes along, the level change drastically. You start at a big city, goes to a canal, a dead town, a coast, a desert, a prison, then back to the city to finally blow up the Citadel, the Combine's base of operations for Earth. While the gameplay doesn't change a lot thoughout the game, the atmosphere do.Now, the gameplay is nothing special in my book- it's pretty good(or above average depending on your look). You shoot guns to kill people. Though you can use physics against your enemies with your special 'Gravity Gun'. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up heavy objects and just throw them wherever you wish it to. This can definetely result in some funny moments, and can vary up the gameplay.The playtime for Half-Life is much longer then any other FPS games that came out around 2004(Halo 3, Doom 3, Modern Warfare, etc). The average playtime for those games were about 6~8 hours, while Half-Life's playtime is around 8~10 hours. Nothing special compared to modern games(well, actually maybe it is), but still pretty good for a 2004 game.The puzzles are back from Half-Life, though this time, a lot of the puzzles are about physics(not because the protagonist is a physicist, but to show off the engine). It involves simple tasks such as moving things to point A to point B, to puzzles like throwing barrels so it makes a bridge(a bit similiar puzzle is from Half-Life: Blue Shift).Let's talk about some miscellaneous stuff. The graphics were good at the time, but by today standards, it's average(even below avarage). The soundtrack is more of the same with Half-Life 1 actually, with some remixes and a few new tracks. It still takes advantage of the ambient themes.I probably don't even need to make this review any longer- as you may already have noticed, Half-Life 2 is an amazing game. But many people don't go over the cons for the game, and some of them are blantly obvious.The A.I. Jesus Christ, the A.I. It's not terrible, but considering Half-Life 1 was revolutionary in its A.I. programming, it was very dissapointing. A good game to compare this is Halo: Combat Evolved. In that game, the enemies flanked you, took defensive positions, etc. While Half-Life 1's A.I. was fantastic at the time, if you compare 1998 with 2004, it's not very different. And Half-Life 2 didn't have much better A.I. then its prequel.(the companions A.I. is a bit improved though)The game is really really easy. Really really really. I mean, Half-Life 1 was easy, but this game is just out there. I highly suggest not even touching the 'easy difficulty', A.K.A 'you can't ♥♥♥♥ing die difficulty'. There are also vehicles in the game, and while it's pretty fun, some parts are just fillers. Oh, and the ending is not that good. I also suggest buying the 'Orange Box', which includes Half-Life 2, its episodic sequels(that fills up the dissapointing ending), and a few other really great games.So we come down to the verdict. I give Half-Life 2 a solid(not really) 7.7/10. It's a great game, for reals. If Half-Life 1 was what every FPS should aim to be, Half-Life 2 is a bit more meh. While the Source engine is an amazing engine, Half-Life 2 doesn't do enough to really stand out on its own currently in 2015. But eleven years earlier, it was amazing.Once again, I highly suggest you to buy the Orange Box, and perhaps Half-Life 1 as well(it's a better game overall except for the story and the graphics). Them, Counter-Strike: Source, and Garry's Mod are a must buy if you're a Steam user.			",80,9,2,4,4,2,2

												Oh boy, Half-Life 2. The sequel to one of the greatest single player first-person shooters ever made. Unlike with that game, I wouldn't say that this game hasn't aged well, but rather other games have done what this game did better since this game came out. Although this is an FPS, you aren't just killing things then entire time. Sometimes you have to drive a vehicle and sometimes you have to solve a puzzle. One of the most prominent features of this game is the Gravity Gun. You can use it as a means of simply moving something somewhere else, or use it as a weapon by launching it at your enemies. This game graphically set the standard for what a 7th generation game should look like, and I still think this game is worth playing for the unique experience it offers. Highly recommended for fans of first person shooters.			",100,31,2,3,4,2,5

												Best Game of 2004. Even better than the first HL, wow I didn't think it was possible. While it is a shooter, it involves a lot more gameplay types, it allows you to drive through to point A-B with intense action, areas where you need to sneak past, you get to control troops of rebels (and even antlions at one point). And the regular shooting is great, it's also a true sequel meaning it's just a bunch of higher tech HL. (with the same physics puzzles and similar gameplay) It also has one of the best sci-fi storyline's of the century, including characters, dialog, and of course just story in general. It introduces a new gun that is just OMG, try launching a paint can at something, see how much damage that will cause. Just amazing, like HL1, I really have NOTHING negative to say.Rated: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You have no idea how hard it is for me to take a break from it.EDIT: Yes the episodes are just as fun.			",89,6,0,7,2,0,9

												To start off this review, BUY THIS GAME NOW! I don't care if you have no money just get a job and buy this game. I honestly recommend this as one of the best FPS's out there and possibly one of the all time greatest games ever. This game was pretty ahead of it's time (it came out in 2004) with it's superior graphics and physics engine that contribute to some of the puzzles in the game.The game features a variety of weapons like the Gravity Gun (ftw) and Crossbow (also ftw) and Enemies like the Combine and the Headcrab Zombies (a definite pain in Ravenholme). The game introduces new story ideas and makes use of classic ones. I won't spoil the plot too much but the basic idea is an interdiemensional alien empire known as the combine have taken over Earth and forced the planet into a totalitarien state. You play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist who used to work at Black Mesa and must foil the combines plans to destroy/further takeover the Earth. I recommend that you have at least read a plot synopsis of the original Half-Life before going into Half-Life 2. To summarise, Half-Life 2 is the best Valve game out there and I recommend that you buy this game through The Orange Box to get HL2 episode 1 and 2. Now for Valve to hurry up with HL3.....

												10/10This game is definitely one of the best on Steam. I've had so much fun playing through it. The world is well developed, immersive, and interactable. You can shoot sawblades into wooden objects to keep them there while you perform another task. You can shoot paint cans at objects, and it will turn them white. You can crouch behind a crashed car and push it up towards baddies until you run them over. You can get in a crane and drop shipping containers on people. Most of the challenge comes from just finding your way around. Despite the fact that a simple scientist is capable of killing so many people, the story is unique and captivating. The gameplay is diverse, challenging, and fun. The environment is lovely, which is typical of all the production aspects of this game. In my opinion every gamer should experience this game.10/10 would get jumpscared by an antlion again.			",96,14,0,6,4,1,15

												I finally began to play Half-life 2 after it sat in my steam library for around 2 years. I finally decided to start playing because I was intrigued. I wanted to see what made this game so highly acclaimed. So much of my game time was spent trying to find the answer to a single question: ""Why is Half-life 2 so great?"" For a majority of the game I struggled to find the answer. It wasn't that I didn't like the game, it was just I couldn't understand why it was considered to be so amazing. I considered the possibility that the game may have had a different charm back in 2004 when it was released, but the more I played, the more I realized there was much more to the greatness of this game. Onward I struggled with this question and continued to ask myself about what elements made this game so heralded.Was it because of the beloved source engine?Was it because of the quirky and stereotypical FPS story?Was it because of the amazing powers of the gravity gun?Was it because of how well the graphics held up to this day?Was it because of the unique characters?Was it because of the excellent shooting mechanics?Or was it because of the absence of any cutscenes in the game?No, all of these things were good, but they weren't the elements that made Half-life 2 great.The more I searched, the more I realized I was overlooking the one single determining factor in the ability of a game to please its audience. Enjoyment. So I asked myself the question: ""Is Half-life 2 fun?"" In asking this I realized that what Half-life 2 does so well is the fundamental goal of all games.This is to provide its audience with enjoyment. Half-life 2 does this as well as any game I've ever played. Throughout the game there was never a dull moment. And while all of the elements of this game I mentioned before are great, the game truly excells at making sure you have a good time.			",84,26,2,10,12,1,9

												Half-Life 2. A great followup to Half-Life. In this game, you play as Gordon Freeman through City 17, an urban area controlled by the Combine forces- a new force who have taken over the Earth. You'll meet some old friends, though, so don't worry! The headcrabs still make up for a great part of the game- and who could forget the crowbar? Meet the guy who offered you a beer twenty years ago and maybe make some new, unexpected friends in Half-Life 2!			",80,8,0,10,15,0,5

												Let me try to tell you exactly what you're in for, should you decide to purchase Half-Life 2 and attempt to play through it fully.From the very first moment, you will find yourself in a hostile world, where a sense of urgency never leaves you, never lets go; where you can feel the gaze of some almighty force at all times, watching you, regarding you, pursuing you; where you feel almost totally alone, like everything is a hazard, and every force you face is insurmountable.Yet you are Gordon Freeman, theoretical physicist, and that hostile world will be overcome; the gaze of that almighty force will be outrun, averted; and that lonesome road, strewn with hazards, all insurmountable, will be surmounted.You're the right man in the wrong place—and that can make all the difference in the world.

												Half-Life 2 lives up to its name by providing an endearing story with likable characters and an overlooming threat that our favourite silent hero from the first HL game, Gordon Freeman, must rise up and defeat. It remains entertaining even all the way through to Episode 1 and 2, contains unique weapons, great graphics that stand out even today, and an excellent game engine that is still being used by Valve and indie game devs in this day and age. While there are some weapons that just don't feel right in this game whether it's how they feel when firing them or simply holding them and the game has a bad habit of repeating itself in certain instances, I felt HL2 is an excellent game that got's flaws, but that can forgiven for what it delivers in its 15-hour journey.

												Having recently replayed this due to the added achievements, it has made me realise yet again just how wonderfully made this game is. It flows seemlessly from one location to another and in doing so the story and setting are pretty much nailed. The only real annoyance I came across was with a few NPCs blocking paths. However,  It has aged really well and I always seem to find something new!Play it again if you have it in your library, It's fantastic. Just play it to experience Ravenholm!

Though the graphics are outdated, the gameplay is superb. After all, it's the gameplay that sticks around. Which it has. I went on to play the episodes after this one, and I was left speechless. It's one of those incredibly rare games that leave you wanting more. I have yet to meet a person who's played the Half Life 2 series and not liked it. As I said before, buy it.

												Half-Life is one of Valve's main franchises, the first game was a huge success, and its long awaited sequel, Half-Life 2, did not disappoint. At its core it's just like your everyday FPS, you go through places, kill some dudes, same old action. However, it's a special game. But why, you ask?When you talk about this game to people who've never played it, they often wonder why does everyone hail it as an amazing masterpiece. Here's the thing. You can't grasp the reason why Half-Life 2 is what it is. I mean, you could try, but it's really one of those games you simply need to experience.Everyone who wants to know how a good FPS is made should play this game. First, its story. It has a surprisingly deep plot that doesn't quite fully show itself to you straight away, and requires attention to detail to understand, though playing the first game will obviously help in this regard.The plot doesn't get too convoluted to the point of not making sense, or too simple to not make you care. That's not to say there won't be moments where you will be wondering what is even going on, but they don't happen out of thin air, and have an explanation, or will have in the future I'm certain, once Valve gets around to continuing the franchise.Yes, it's true, Gordon Freeman doesn't talk, but when you think about it, he doesn't need to. The game does an outstanding job in showing you everything that's happening without Freeman needing to utter a word. He doesn't need to have a preset personality that may conflict with yours and ultimately diminish your enjoyment of the game. What you do, he does. Who you are, he is.Just like the first game, it heavily uses its visuals to tell the story, rather than a static wall of text. This only helps keep it its excellent fluid pacing, feeding you pieces of information as you go along, but not keeping you too much in one place before the action resumes. Having been the first game released with the Source engine, along with Troika's amazing RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, this game looked great, and still does to this day.But just like I already mentioned in this review, only by playing through Half-Life 2 can you see why it's gathered the amazing fanbase it has, and why it's such a great singleplayer experience. What are you waiting for!? It's super cheap. Go get it and play it now! And Episode 1 and 2 right after, because I bet after completing HL2 you'll want to go through those as well. And then you may join the legion of gamers anxiously waiting for Episode 3.			",858,258,31,163,96,14,179

												So my first play through of this game was nearly 12 years after it was initally released, I can gladly say that it was a great expereince all round. Most games of similar age don't quite hold up these days, but this game still looks gorgeous, handles exceptionally and has a great yarn to it.My only complaint would be that Gordon being an amazing scientist surely would've been able to create some form of longer lasting flash light.All in all great experience, will recommend to anyone that has never played before.

												Ok so lets say you find a resturaunt that makes a dish so unbelieveably devine that it escapes description. So you go there for the first time with a friend and find out the hype is all true, you wish you could live there it's so good. A week later you go back with a date to find out that they not only upgraded the tables and chairs of the resturaunt they also upgraded the menu as well. After dinner you and your date talk about your amazing experience for weeks and suggest all your friends and family eat there.A week later when you go back again they say that things have changed. Instead of being a sit down and order your meal resturaunt they just do deserts to go now. Which isn't the end of the world you grab a slice of chocolate cake and when you take it home and eat it you are reminded why you keep on going there even if the feeling is short lived.3 weeks later when you go back they say they are renovating and you will be able to get a slice of cake soon but wont tell you when and all the cooks went to work at different resturaunts.You go to visit these resturaunts every so often and you can taste their contribution to the meal and it tastes good but it isn't the otherworldly decidence provided by the original meals you enjoyed.Then it happens, after years of renovation signs and promises from the owners and chefs, they finally announce they will never open their doors again...You know that if they ever did open up again it might fall short of your expectations, but that haunting memory of that excuisite cake keeps you up at night. You continue living going from bakery to sweet shop trying to find it's equal or even something to put your mind at ease to know that that level of quality can be matched. Instead the truth is that every single sweet treat you put on your tongue brings your closer and closer to the realization that nothing will ever measure up and you are doomed to an eternity of trying to find anything to measure up but you know you never will.THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ME VALVE!!!! I HATE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU!!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's not much that can be said about this game that hasn't been already shouted out a thousand times. All in all the game and it's engine have aged beautifully. I still think the game looks perfect in comparison with the most recent releases. And the story; it's a seller - it grasps you like no other. But the best part about this game is the solid, easy, fun and addicting gameplay.And what about the replay value, you might ask? Well the game is filled with easter eggs and secrets for you to find if you're into digging around a bit. I sure am since I've collected all the Steam achievements this game had to offer.

												Half-Life 2 lives up to its name by providing an endearing story with likable characters and an overlooming threat that our favourite silent hero from the first HL game, Gordon Freeman, must rise up and defeat. It remains entertaining even all the way through to Episode 1 and 2, contains unique weapons, great graphics that stand out even today, and an excellent game engine that is still being used by Valve and indie game devs in this day and age. While there are some weapons that just don't feel right in this game whether it's how they feel when firing them or simply holding them and the game has a bad habit of repeating itself in certain instances, I felt HL2 is an excellent game that got's flaws, but that can forgiven for what it delivers in its 15-hour journey.

												Experience on Linux so far:- Mouse sensitivity issues, may have been resolved now.The game:You know what it is! Half-life was and still is epic, although I think it's time for Gordon to rest and let Valve focus on entirely new games. Not everyone agrees and I know a large crowd of people are feverishly waiting for HL3. Hopefully, it will have a Linux port on the same release date as the other versions and I will happily preorder to make that happen.By current standards, this is an old game and comparing it to newer titles it does show. Still a ""need to own"" title.I still think HL1 was better and more groundbreaking back in it's day, but hey, HL is HL.The score:3/5			",50,10,1,3,8,0,1

												I finally began to play Half-life 2 after it sat in my steam library for around 2 years. I finally decided to start playing because I was intrigued. I wanted to see what made this game so highly acclaimed. So much of my game time was spent trying to find the answer to a single question: ""Why is Half-life 2 so great?"" For a majority of the game I struggled to find the answer. It wasn't that I didn't like the game, it was just I couldn't understand why it was considered to be so amazing. I considered the possibility that the game may have had a different charm back in 2004 when it was released, but the more I played, the more I realized there was much more to the greatness of this game. Onward I struggled with this question and continued to ask myself about what elements made this game so heralded.Was it because of the beloved source engine?Was it because of the quirky and stereotypical FPS story?Was it because of the amazing powers of the gravity gun?Was it because of how well the graphics held up to this day?Was it because of the unique characters?Was it because of the excellent shooting mechanics?Or was it because of the absence of any cutscenes in the game?No, all of these things were good, but they weren't the elements that made Half-life 2 great.The more I searched, the more I realized I was overlooking the one single determining factor in the ability of a game to please its audience. Enjoyment. So I asked myself the question: ""Is Half-life 2 fun?"" In asking this I realized that what Half-life 2 does so well is the fundamental goal of all games.This is to provide its audience with enjoyment. Half-life 2 does this as well as any game I've ever played. Throughout the game there was never a dull moment. And while all of the elements of this game I mentioned before are great, the game truly excells at making sure you have a good time.			",84,26,2,10,12,1,9

												This game in outstanding. I played through it twice I think and I have to say I think it is my favourite game ever made. The story telling is just brilliant and the mood it sets all through the game dynamically changes depending on where you are, but they do it perfect every time.Half-Life 2 is a labour of love, delicately created by the master craftsmen that are valve. I have to say I think it is one of the - if not the - finest game ever made.--MAY CONTAIN SOME THINGS YOU MAY CONSIDER SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT--You play as Gorden Freeman, in a world after his escape of the black mesa reseatrch facility in half-life 1, overthrown by an intergalactic race known as the combine. These creatures want to take over the galaxy and use earth as their main base. They enslaved xen creatures and now they're enslaving the human race. The combine put up an oppression field so that the human race cannot re-produce. Gordon Freeman adventures through city 17 and beyond to beat the combine in this thrilling, beautiful game.

												This game doesn't need an introduction. Being one of the best single player adventures, hopefully with a long awaited (do not count on it though....) second sequal (HL3), this game is a flagship game, and a signature mark of Valve. Whilst the multiplayer version of the game isn't all that solid (not very balanced imo), the game on it's own is something of legendary value. The campaign itself is something that must be experienced, that's how good it is. You can't miss it if you adore FPS shooters at any rate. At all. No words.			",39,3,1,0,1,0,3

												 It was all in that moment when I just sat back and laughed. I couldn't believe it was quite this good. I chuckled in muddled disbelief, expectations utterly defied. My nervous fingers reloaded the level, knowing that I had to see that breathtaking sequence one more time. It was then that I knew for certain: Valve had surpassed not only themselves, but everyone else too. Half-Life 2 is an astounding accomplishment. It is the definitive statement of the last five years of first-person shooters. Everything else was just a stopgap.Half-Life 2 is a near perfect sequel. It takes almost everything that worked from Half-Life and either improves on it, or keeps it much the same. But that simple summation undersells how the Valve team have approached this task. Half-Life 2 is a linear shooter with most of the refinements one would expect from years of work, but it is also a game of a higher order of magnitude than any of the previous pretenders to the throne. The polish and the stratospheric height of the production values mean that Half-Life 2 is a magnificent, dramatic experience that has few peers.It would be madness for me to spoil this game by talking about the specific turn of events, so spoilers are going to be kept to a minimum. We're going to talk about general processes and the elements of style and design that make Half-Life 2 such an energising experience. Key to this is the way in which Gordon's tale is told. Once again we never leave his perspective. There are no cutscenes, no moment in which you are anything but utterly embedded in Gordon's view of the world. Everything is told through his eyes. And what a story it is. Gordon arrives at the central station at City 17—a disruptive and chilling dystopia. And from there? Well, that would be telling. This is not the contemporary America that Gordon seemed to be living in during the original Half-Life. The events of Black Mesa have affected the whole world. The crossover with Xen has meant that things have altered radically, with hyper-technology existing alongside eastern bloc dereliction.			",16,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Half Life 2 is one of the greatest games I have ever played, ever.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to those who, like myself, love a good story to a video game. This game is not for players who play a game only to shoot and hack and slash their enemies. To them, I recommend that you stay far away from this game.This is a great game, made by the best.

												Half-Life 2. A great followup to Half-Life. In this game, you play as Gordon Freeman through City 17, an urban area controlled by the Combine forces- a new force who have taken over the Earth. You'll meet some old friends, though, so don't worry! The headcrabs still make up for a great part of the game- and who could forget the crowbar? Meet the guy who offered you a beer twenty years ago and maybe make some new, unexpected friends in Half-Life 2!			",80,8,0,10,15,0,5

												Half Life 2 really is one of those games, even all these years later, that I keep coming back to. Though there are games that do a few of the things better HL2 did back then, it's exceedingly hard to find a game that attempted everything it did, let alone came close to the level of quality HL2 had all around. In general the Half Life series is a set of games that every gamer should look into to gain a deeper appreciation of the progress the industry has made.			",129,24,1,25,25,0,44

												Without question one of the finest games (if not the finest) available on Steam!I'll keep this review short and to the point as many, many others have already shared similar experiences to mine with Valve's masterpiece.Pros:Brilliant story driven plot with great music, script, sound effects and atmosphereExcellent intuitive menu system - easy to useGameplay is fabulous with a single player AI that is a cut above lots of other games out thereAmazing graphics and physics engine (even to this day over 11 years after the game was released)Cons:None i can think of, apart from some problems getting one or two achievements - very minor though!

												This game is amazing, and the Source engine has aged well. Half Life 2 is visually pleasing and holds up to most AAA realeases today. Having updated to a more recent version of the Source engine, since Half Life 2's release back in 2004, the game feels more refined and responsive. From controls to the environment and everything in between.The Story, whilst not being a masterpeice, is top notch. It doesn't require any knowledge from Half Life, so if you're new to the franchise your not questioning back story.Gordon's travels take you across multiple environments requiring different tactics and gorgeous aesthetics.10/10			",394,45,9,22,57,2,59

												In this sci-if action adventure game, you get to play the silent Gordon freeman who has to find his way to beat the combine and Wallace Breen, you have help from alyx Vance, barny Calhoun, Isaac kleiner, and Eli Vance. You gather your weapons and supplies to survive the combine hoard and aliens. The new H.E.V suit adds as armour in order to absorb more damage, but the best part is the gravity gun, which you can pick up stuff easier than having to carry it,  but when it is upgraded you can lift heavy stuff and launch them into the air. This mysterious Gman follows everywhere, but why? Was it just to see what you were doing so he could plan ahead? Was he supervising you? Is he a stalker?

												Ten years and this game is still one of the best Adventure First Person Shooters I've played.But why is this game such a good one, you ask? Well, if you've already played the first Half-LIfe, this is basically the same except a hundred times better in every field. More immersive story, new weapons, new minor and major characters, and HUUUGE graphic improvements with bugs and glitches few and far between. My only problem is that the lighting tends to glitch out at random intervals and requires you to restart the game to maybe fix it.If you haven't? Well, I guess you'll have to trust me that you're in for one hell of a story for this one. Even (mostly) during the cinematic parts, you still have minor control over the game. Practically everything else is left for you to do.The story starts with Gordon Freeman, a Theoretical Physicist and former Black Mesa employee, newly arriving in a mysterious place called City Seventeen. Eventually after wandering around in the train station you meet an old friend Barney Calhoun, also a former Black Mesa Employee. Before you know it, you're running around in an apartment building being chased by the police.The rest of the story is for you to experience.Trust me, this game is worth your ten bucks.

Con's: Story contains several unnecessary plot pointsLacks missing content""Full Game"" requires the purchase of 2 other 'Episodes'Lacks a large diversity when it comes to enemy choicesGraphics arn't quality for it's time of release (2004)----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pro's: The Revolutionary Source Engine was improved durastically for this titleMany modifications to try out (Aside from the base game)Game lasts a good 7-11 hoursPhysics were very intricate for it's time (2004)For the story it did have, it executed itself wellSound design was exceptionally decentOverall atmosphere compliments gameplayGood character developmentSilent protaganist adds to story's tensionsGame led to various iconic moments and things in gaming history-----------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, I feel that although the game isn't perfect, I'd still HIGHLY reccomend getting this game!

												Who wouldn't know Half-Life 2? At least here on Steam, Valve's online distribution platform? The game that brought fame and the main reason for people actually installing Steam (at first at least)?No introductions are necessary, Half-Life 2 is the perfect first-person shooter that introduced a revolutionary engine, that still looks very good even by today's standards (just take a look at the water or the shiny tip of the crowbar) with excellent physics (introduced in Jurassic Park Tresspasser) and had memorable action scenes (not really something first-person shooters were known for at that time, except the original Unreal, Deus-Ex and maybe Far Cry).And of course who wouldn't remember the fast paced chase sequence with the airboat trying to the shake off the helicopter behind us? Or the first time we grabbed the gravity gun either in it's ""normal"" or overcharged state? The spooky zombie infested old town section? The prison assault commandeering the giant insects, the antlions?Valve successfully managed to create from Half-Life's silent protagonist a (still silent) superhero for Half-Life 2, who can turn the tide and fight off the puppets of an unknown invading alien species: Gordon Freeman. The secret is that it's completely from his (or rather your) perspective with no interruption of cutscenes and no third-person camera view. Also after loading screens there are no breaks between the sections so you really get the illusion of having travelled a long way.What I loved the most is the atmosphere and the semi-post-apocalyptic urban setting. The ravaged blocks of flats or the ruined houses along the (still) beautiful coastline and the police state controlled society reminiscent of Orwell's 1984, are the greatest strength of the game in my opinion. It's really immersive.Half-Life 2 has its flaws however. We get no explanation whatsoever regarding most things (why is the mysterious man with the suitcase called G man and who is he anyway - a constant riddle left over from the original Half-Life) leaving us only guessing and the further episodes (which are also very good) can't really shed more light on the plot, leading us to believe that the creators didn't really focus on the storyline and were thinking 'aah, we're going to figure out something later on'. Too bad, because with a decent story Half-Life 2 could have been the GAME.Still it is one of the best games in gaming history and everyone who has a registered steam account should give it a try. It is a very memorable experience (along with its sequels, Episode 1 & 2) and maybe Valve should make its playthrough obligatory for new users in their subscriber agreement (for free of course :))PROS+ amazing graphics, water effects, even on weaker systems+ excellent engine with great physics+ good sound effects and voice acting+ high-speed chase sequences+ beautiful, diverse scenery and great overall atmosphereCONS- story is functional- due to scripting some enemies are impossible to kill early onRATING9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is so ridiculously good in every aspect that it’s hard to stay objective while writing about it. If you like shooters at all I highly recommend trying Half-Life 2. Even for it’s age it looks good and there is a ton of reasons why to pick it:1.	The story is captivating and original2.	Designwise a very clean representation of a dystopian/ post-soviet community 3.	Fluent natural controls. There’s a lot of precision-jumping, climbing and moving on narrow edges in the game and the controls are there to help you. Half-Life 2 has found just the right balance to make you forget about controls in the whole.4.	To date I haven’t encountered a bug that would have broke the gameplay5.	The game is humorous where appropriate6.	Some of the most memorable characters of my entire gaming history7.	Levels are very different, never repetitive.8.	Cool weapons/ large variety of enemies9.	Atmospheric music/ sound effects10.	Immense replay value11.	Challenging puzzles. Puzzles play an important role in Half-Life 212.	A good dose of horror. Though there are some scary sequences your character is just the kind of tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to deal with them.My only problem is that in between gameplay, the story sequences are not the shortest and there’s no way to skip them which can become tedious on the 5th playthrough. But through years I’ve always come back to it, that’s how good it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 is a First-Person shooter developed by Valve, and is considered one of the greatest games of all time... with good reason. Half-Life 2 has some of the coolest elements I have ever seen in a game.Pros:-Great Narrative is continued through a total FP perspective like Half-Life-Well designed characters -Fun weapons, even cooler than Half-Life-REALLY GOOD GRAPHICS (When I first played this game I thought it was a recently made game, but NOPE this game was made in 2004... 2004!!!)-Variety of scenarios (You will be doing different things throughout the game and not just killing anything that moves)Cons:-At times some of the levels can be long and barren especially in the Highway 17 section-Physics engine can be a pain sometimes especially in the Water Hazard  chapter where your air boat can be flipped over and you can't easily put it back up-No Half-Life 3Overall, (9.7/10) Half-Life 2 is a MUST HAVE for any steam user, despite minimal flaws this game is almost perfect. Now go get The Orange Box or GabeN will find you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Starting off - if you haven't read about this game nor played the previous games, you're getting into a whole new level of story telling and awesomeness.Half-Life 2 is arguably one of the best games I've ever played not only due to the game play and the graphics that seem to keep up with even today's standards, but the pure story-telling through a first person perspective and the mysterious story and characters behind it. Half-Life 2 is an adventure game where you take the role as the main protagonist, himself being a theoretical physicist forced to fight against what seems like the entire world. Couldn't be arsed finishing the review. IGN 10/10This game is brilliant.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Half-Life 2 - Pro's & Con's Before I begin my review, I'd wish to pronounce a disclaimer: A majority of what I'll claim within this review consists of facts based upon that of amoderate computer system Now that everything has been exclaimed, we shall begin the review. Con's: Story contains several unnecessary plot pointsLacks missing content""Full Game"" requires the purchase of 2 other 'Episodes'Lacks a large diversity when it comes to enemy choicesGraphics arn't quality for it's time of release (2004)----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pro's: The Revolutionary Source Engine was improved durastically for this titleMany modifications to try out (Aside from the base game)Game lasts a good 7-11 hoursPhysics were very intricate for it's time (2004)For the story it did have, it executed itself wellSound design was exceptionally decentOverall atmosphere compliments gameplayGood character developmentSilent protaganist adds to story's tensionsGame led to various iconic moments and things in gaming history-----------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, I feel that although the game isn't perfect, I'd still HIGHLY reccomend getting this game!

												This game is amazing. For a game from 2004 it's a masterpiece. A lot of games try to replicate what was good about it: 1) No Cutscenes, 2) Brilliant AI, 3)Awesome Arsenal of Weapons, 4) A terrific story, 5)Revolutionary for video games in general, 6) Good environments, 7) Flawless controls, 8) The characters, 9) The physics, 10) Its replayability and so much more. If you don't like this game, you don't like video games. If you don't understand the ""Half-Life 3"" play this game and you will. I hope this review makes you want to buy the game so you can see how joyuous I was when I played it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life is one of Valve's main franchises, the first game was a huge success, and its long awaited sequel, Half-Life 2, did not disappoint. At its core it's just like your everyday FPS, you go through places, kill some dudes, same old action. However, it's a special game. But why, you ask?When you talk about this game to people who've never played it, they often wonder why does everyone hail it as an amazing masterpiece. Here's the thing. You can't grasp the reason why Half-Life 2 is what it is. I mean, you could try, but it's really one of those games you simply need to experience.Everyone who wants to know how a good FPS is made should play this game. First, its story. It has a surprisingly deep plot that doesn't quite fully show itself to you straight away, and requires attention to detail to understand, though playing the first game will obviously help in this regard.The plot doesn't get too convoluted to the point of not making sense, or too simple to not make you care. That's not to say there won't be moments where you will be wondering what is even going on, but they don't happen out of thin air, and have an explanation, or will have in the future I'm certain, once Valve gets around to continuing the franchise.Yes, it's true, Gordon Freeman doesn't talk, but when you think about it, he doesn't need to. The game does an outstanding job in showing you everything that's happening without Freeman needing to utter a word. He doesn't need to have a preset personality that may conflict with yours and ultimately diminish your enjoyment of the game. What you do, he does. Who you are, he is.Just like the first game, it heavily uses its visuals to tell the story, rather than a static wall of text. This only helps keep it its excellent fluid pacing, feeding you pieces of information as you go along, but not keeping you too much in one place before the action resumes. Having been the first game released with the Source engine, along with Troika's amazing RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, this game looked great, and still does to this day.But just like I already mentioned in this review, only by playing through Half-Life 2 can you see why it's gathered the amazing fanbase it has, and why it's such a great singleplayer experience. What are you waiting for!? It's super cheap. Go get it and play it now! And Episode 1 and 2 right after, because I bet after completing HL2 you'll want to go through those as well. And then you may join the legion of gamers anxiously waiting for Episode 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So my first play through of this game was nearly 12 years after it was initally released, I can gladly say that it was a great expereince all round. Most games of similar age don't quite hold up these days, but this game still looks gorgeous, handles exceptionally and has a great yarn to it.My only complaint would be that Gordon being an amazing scientist surely would've been able to create some form of longer lasting flash light.All in all great experience, will recommend to anyone that has never played before.

												This game is no doubt a masterpiece. When I initially played this game a long time ago, I didn't like it. I thought it was just a generic sci fi FPS with a mediocre story. After giving this game another go years later, I finally understand this game. There is far more to Half-Life 2 if you're willing to dig a little deeper. The entire game manages to create this very surreal and mysterious atmosphere that really creates a very unique tone. The level design is fantastic. It manages to guide you through nonlinear areas without giving you a map or checkpoints. The characters are all very distinct and interesting. Each character contributes to the game in very idiosyncratic ways. Every aspect of this game seems to come together to create a very peculiar effect that matches nothing I've ever seen before. Half-Life 2 is a very fine example as to how video games are an art and have the ability to evoke meaningful and thought provoking feelings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't think anyone really needs to read my drip of a review in the already thriving ocean of love that Half-Life is swimming in, but I'm bored, and you're here.Half-Life 2 improves upon Valve's amazing storytelling sans-cutscenes and through environmental cues and wonderful voice acting in its NPCs. You are still Gordon Freeman and still as silent as ever, soaking it all in. Some say that he is an empty husk devoid of character, while others treat his silence as an opportunity to let themselves react to the events in the world around them rather than being told how Gordon feels; YOU are Gordon Freeman.The Source engine was debuted in HL2 and there are many little physics 'puzzles', to use the word generously, that show off the engine's bells and whistles. The gravity gun is really where it shines though.The AI is competent (any veteran FPS player will have to play on the hardest difficulty setting), and there are many wonderful action set-pieces in well-fleshed out locales.That's about all I can say here; I may share my thoughts on Episodes 1 and 2 at a later date.Until then, happy headcrab hunting.

												I consider Half-Life 2 to be one of the best single player first person shooters ever created.  At the time of release it was groundbreaking and almost a decade later there are still few FPS out there that can stand up to it.  The level design, the immersive atmosphere, the innovative use of physics, the graphics (which still hold up), the structure, the pacing, the characters, the story, the weapons...all are exceptional.  It's a game that can be played over and over.  One negative would be the AI which was decent at the time but feels a little dated now.  That's a minor gripe.  An almost perfect game.

												I remember when this game came out in 2004 and playing it for the first time. The graphics and the quality blew my mind. Replaying it in 2013 and it still blows my mind how well it has aged and plays. The graphics are dated but the art design is fantastic. The game play is solid and runs buttery smooth making for great plays. If you own a PC I'd say it's a must for all who love gaming to try it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cool weapons (gravity gun), epic characters (DOG), possibilities with diferent rides and story line... purfect! After main game, there are two more episodes to play through, making it more than 20 hours for story line alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I threw a can away and got an acheivement. Valve-Encouraging recyling before global warming really mattered to anyone. But seriously. This game is the same length as Half-Life, has amazing graphics for the time and up to par graphics today. This classic is a masterpiece that will never die as long as Half-Life 3 is a myth. Before you buy, wait for a sale and buy the Valve Complete Pack, so you get HL1, HL Opposing Force, HL Blue Shift, HL2, and  HL2 Ep. 1&2, all for the price of CS:GO.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is this one of the greatest games of all time like people say it is? I would have to agree with them i cant fault anything with the game apart from the dated mechiancs which is not the games fault that is due to the age of the game.

												Some people want to kill me for this, but I am gonna say it anyways. This game, is a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece, BUT, the beggining chapters, where you are escaping choppers and going through sewers....It was pretty damn boring for me. I played this game around June of 2013, and there was a point where i just couldn't take it anymore, I was bored out of my mind, and uninstalled it.I picked up the game yet again, on December, just before the chapter ""We don't go to Ravenholm"".....And...Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ after that chapter, the game was filled with intense action, scary moments thanks to the well known headcrab zombies, intense fights from the rebels against the combine, driving scenes (Pretty meh, but they aren't bad at all, just....Not really into my taste). After that chapter, I couldn't stop playing the game, and I finished it in about 2 days, It was DEFINITELY worth it.Aside from the slow start, this game doesn't fail to dissapoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I highly recommend this game if you don't already have it.  Seriously.  This game is different from other games.  It just felt right when I played this.  Ok so I have over 100 games in my Steam library and I play like a third to a forth of all of them.  I've played the campaigns of Tomb Raider, Saints Row, Far Cry 3, GTA V, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Skyrim, Fallout, Mirrors Edge and Borderlands and yet, I haven't beaten a single one yet, some of them i've had for years.  This game tho and any other Valve game is different.  I've beaten, Portal, Portal 2, Half Life 2 and The Stanley Parable.  You know what they all have in common? They all run on the Source Engine.  Seriously it's one of the best game engines out there, my freaking laptop can play any Source game at 60FPS and my laptop is TERRIBLE. So back to Half life.  This game just felt right, it got me hooked so to say, at least this time around.  I've tried to play it years before and I always got lost or bored, this time around I couldn't stop, I really couldn't.  I would go through school the next day just wanting to come home and play this game. It's just seriously a masterpeice and thats all I can really say.  Just please, if oyu haven't already, don't hesitate to buy this.TL;DR: no, read it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 is put simply one of the best First-Person shooters ever! The story is epic and has you cross the acid canals of City 17, the brutal shores of the coast and the horrible...Nova Prospect. The friendly characters are great and helpful even if they can get in your way. And the evil characters like Dr.Breen I hate with a passion! If you complete the game then It can get dull. To fix this try and get all the achievements! I played HL2 from the start trying to get all the achievements and It made the game so much more fun! A lot of people are like me, they see the achievements and think ""I'm NOT getting those"" but it is fun! Anyway, just play it. You'll love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great prequel to the new hit shooter, Garry's Mod. Though it may not have as big of an audience, it is still a huge contender to the recently successful ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"" series. The story follows two loveable main characters: Dr. Kleiner and his dog, Dog. They struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic New York amongst the horrifying mutated life caused by the nuclear apocalypse. With a page-turning storyline and its library of amazingly-developed characters, this game amazed even the most experienced of gamers. 4/10 - One of the best games of the decade			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some people want to kill me for this, but I am gonna say it anyways. This game, is a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece, BUT, the beggining chapters, where you are escaping choppers and going through sewers....It was pretty damn boring for me. I played this game around June of 2013, and there was a point where i just couldn't take it anymore, I was bored out of my mind, and uninstalled it.I picked up the game yet again, on December, just before the chapter ""We don't go to Ravenholm"".....And...Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ after that chapter, the game was filled with intense action, scary moments thanks to the well known headcrab zombies, intense fights from the rebels against the combine, driving scenes (Pretty meh, but they aren't bad at all, just....Not really into my taste). After that chapter, I couldn't stop playing the game, and I finished it in about 2 days, It was DEFINITELY worth it.Aside from the slow start, this game doesn't fail to dissapoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty awesome game. It's top notch both in gameplay and in story. The graphics and physics are very impressive for a 2004 game. Just by looking at it you'd think the ealiest date it could've been released was 2006. I know it's a very late time for someone to be making a review but I just fell in love with it when I recently started playing the series.

												The combine harvester, or simply combine, is a machine that harvests grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate operations comprising harvesting—reaping, threshing, and winnowing—into a single process. Among the crops harvested with a combine are wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), soybeans and flax (linseed). The waste straw left behind on the field is the remaining dried stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either chopped and spread on the field or baled for feed and bedding for livestock.Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important labor saving inventions, enabling a small fraction of the population to be engaged in agriculture.HistoryScottish inventor Patrick Bell invented the Reaper in 1826. The combine was invented in the United States by Hiram Moore in 1834, and early versions were pulled by horse or mule teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version and by 1839, over 50 acres of crops were harvested. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting width of several metres were used on American farms. In 1882, the Australian Hugh Victor McKay had a similar idea and developed the first commercial combine harvester in 1885, the Sunshine Harvester.Combines, some of them quite large, were drawn by mule or horse teams and used a bullwheel to provide power. Later, steam power was used, and George Stockton Berry integrated the combine with a steam engine using straw to heat the boiler. Tractor-drawn, combines became common after World War II as many farms began to use tractors. These combines used a shaker to separate the grain from the chaff and straw-walkers (grates with small teeth on an eccentric shaft) to eject the straw while retaining the grain. Early tractor-drawn combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred to a truck or wagon with an auger.In the U.S., Allis-Chalmers, Massey-Harris, International Harvester, Gleaner Manufacturing Company, John Deere, and Minneapolis Moline are past or present major combine producers.In 1911, the Holt Manufacturing Company of California produced a self-propelled harvester. In Australia in 1923, the patented Sunshine Auto Header was one of the first center-feeding self-propelled harvesters.[8] In 1923 in Kansas, the Curtis brothers and their Gleaner Manufacturing Company patented a self-propelled harvester which included several other modern improvements in grain handling.[9] Both the Gleaner and the Sunshine used Fordson engines. In 1929 Alfredo Rotania of Argentina patented a self-propelled harvester.[10] In 1937, the Australian-born Thomas Carroll, working for Massey-Harris in Canada, perfected a self-propelled model and in 1940 a lighter-weight model began to be marketed widely by the company.[11] Lyle Yost invented an auger that would lift grain out of a combine in 1947, making unloading grain much easier.[12]In 1952 Claeys launched the first self- propelled combine harvester in Europe;[13] in 1953, the European manufacturer CLAAS developed a self-propelled combine harvester named 'Herkules', it could harvest up to 5 tons of wheat a day.[14] This newer kind of combine is still in use and is powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Until the self-cleaning rotary screen was invented in the mid-1960s combine engines suffered from overheating as the chaff spewed out when harvesting small grains would clog radiators, blocking the airflow needed for cooling.A significant advance in the design of combines was the rotary design. The grain is initially stripped from the stalk by passing along a helical rotor instead of passing between rasp bars on the outside of a cylinder and a concave. Rotary combines were first introduced by Sperry-New Holland in 1975.[15]In about the 1980s on-board electronics were introduced to measure threshing efficiency. This new instrumentation allowed operators to get better grain yields by optimizing ground speed and other operating parameters.A John Deere 9410 Combine with grain platform attached.A John Deere Titan series combine unloading corn.Combine heads[edit]Combines are equipped with removable heads that are designed for particular crops. The standard header, sometimes called a grain platform, is equipped with a reciprocating knife cutter bar, and features a revolving reel with metal or plastic teeth to cause the cut crop to fall into the auger once it is cut. A variation of the platform, a ""flex"" platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.Some wheat headers, called ""draper"" headers, hi use a fabric or rubber apron instead of a cross auger. Draper headers allow faster feeding than cross augers, leading to higher throughputs due to lower power requirements. On many farms, platform headers are used to cut wheat, instead of separate wheat headers, so as to reduce overall costs.Dummy heads or pick-up headers feature spring-tined pickups, usually attached to a heavy rubber belt. They are used for crops that have already been cut and placed in windrows or swaths. This is particularly useful in northern climates such as western Canada where swathing kills weeds resulting in a faster dry down.While a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.Occasionally rowcrop heads are seen that function like a grain platform, but have points between rows like a corn head. These are used to reduce the amount of weed seed picked up when harvesting small grains.Self-propelled Gleaner combines could be fitted with special tracks instead of tires or tires with tread measuring almost 10in deep to assist in harvesting rice. Some combines, particularly pull type, have tires with a diamond tread which prevents sinking in mud. These tracks can fit other combines by having adapter plates made.The cut crop is carried up the feeder throat (commonly called the ""feederhouse"") by a chain and flight elevator, then fed into the threshing mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating threshing drum (commonly called the ""cylinder""), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through the action of the cylinder against the concave, a shaped ""half drum"", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed due to the fact that the grain is heavier than the straw, which causes it to fall rather than ""float"" across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half Life.Garry's Mod.Team Fortress.Counter Strike.Garry's Mod.Overwatch.Left Four Dead.Portal.Portal 2.Warcraft 3.Half Life 2.Fallout.Dota 2.Hillary Clinton.Dictatorship.You know what all of the games listed above have in common? They all were developed by Valve, led by famous sportsman Gabriel Newell and they all stand for a world that went through a lot of pain, massive destruction, dictatorship and censorship. Valve is probably the most sinister company on the planet. Led by a well-known Russian communist spy that infiltrates our free and democratic society in order to establish a world government and take away everyone's freedom forever and ever.This game as well as all other games are nothing but smart propaganda artworks. Is Gordon Ramsay, the main character of the Half-Life series, a dangerous Russian terrorist? Probably not, but how can you know? We all heard him talk and that G-Man (which obviously stands for Globalist-Mankind) that keeps on showing up to tell you something you already knew just so you then go forth and develope mods for Half-Life that then suddenly become stand-alone games? We can ignore it, but we can't let it be without any interruption.Every Valve game ever has nothing but the goal to destroy our free and democratic American world society. It is their goal to demolish our elected government, to burn down what we like the most about our country and replace it all with communist evilness.What can you, dear reader, do to prevent this nightmare from happening?Easy: Go out and do something against them. Buy those games and take away their income. Play the games and show them that you do not fear them or their products and spend hundreds of hours in all of them while having massive fun to show that you are immune against their propaganda that is meant to make you unhappy and sad.Be part of the resistance, fight the good fight and help us win it.God Bless America.

												The combine harvester, or simply combine, is a machine that harvests grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate operations comprising harvesting—reaping, threshing, and winnowing—into a single process. Among the crops harvested with a combine are wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), soybeans and flax (linseed). The waste straw left behind on the field is the remaining dried stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either chopped and spread on the field or baled for feed and bedding for livestock.Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important labor saving inventions, enabling a small fraction of the population to be engaged in agriculture.HistoryScottish inventor Patrick Bell invented the Reaper in 1826. The combine was invented in the United States by Hiram Moore in 1834, and early versions were pulled by horse or mule teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version and by 1839, over 50 acres of crops were harvested. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting width of several metres were used on American farms.

Early tractor-drawn combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred to a truck or wagon with an auger.In the U.S., Allis-Chalmers, Massey-Harris, International Harvester, Gleaner Manufacturing Company, John Deere, and Minneapolis Moline are past or present major combine producers.In 1911, the Holt Manufacturing Company of California produced a self-propelled harvester.

In 1929 Alfredo Rotania of Argentina patented a self-propelled harvester.[10] In 1937, the Australian-born Thomas Carroll, working for Massey-Harris in Canada, perfected a self-propelled model and in 1940 a lighter-weight model began to be marketed widely by the company.[11] Lyle Yost invented an auger that would lift grain out of a combine in 1947, making unloading grain much easier.[12]In 1952 Claeys launched the first self- propelled combine harvester in Europe;[13] in 1953, the European manufacturer CLAAS developed a self-propelled combine harvester named 'Herkules', it could harvest up to 5 tons of wheat a day.[14] This newer kind of combine is still in use and is powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Until the self-cleaning rotary screen was invented in the mid-1960s combine engines suffered from overheating as the chaff spewed out when harvesting small grains would clog radiators, blocking the airflow needed for cooling.A significant advance in the design of combines was the rotary design. The grain is initially stripped from the stalk by passing along a helical rotor instead of passing between rasp bars on the outside of a cylinder and a concave. Rotary combines were first introduced by Sperry-New Holland in 1975.[15]In about the 1980s on-board electronics were introduced to measure threshing efficiency. This new instrumentation allowed operators to get better grain yields by optimizing ground speed and other operating parameters.A John Deere 9410 Combine with grain platform attached.A John Deere Titan series combine unloading corn.Combine heads[edit]Combines are equipped with removable heads that are designed for particular crops. The standard header, sometimes called a grain platform, is equipped with a reciprocating knife cutter bar, and features a revolving reel with metal or plastic teeth to cause the cut crop to fall into the auger once it is cut. A variation of the platform, a ""flex"" platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.Some wheat headers, called ""draper"" headers, hi use a fabric or rubber apron instead of a cross auger. Draper headers allow faster feeding than cross augers, leading to higher throughputs due to lower power requirements. On many farms, platform headers are used to cut wheat, instead of separate wheat headers, so as to reduce overall costs.Dummy heads or pick-up headers feature spring-tined pickups, usually attached to a heavy rubber belt. They are used for crops that have already been cut and placed in windrows or swaths. This is particularly useful in northern climates such as western Canada where swathing kills weeds resulting in a faster dry down.While a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.Occasionally rowcrop heads are seen that function like a grain platform, but have points between rows like a corn head. These are used to reduce the amount of weed seed picked up when harvesting small grains.Self-propelled Gleaner combines could be fitted with special tracks instead of tires or tires with tread measuring almost 10in deep to assist in harvesting rice. Some combines, particularly pull type, have tires with a diamond tread which prevents sinking in mud. These tracks can fit other combines by having adapter plates made.The cut crop is carried up the feeder throat (commonly called the ""feederhouse"") by a chain and flight elevator, then fed into the threshing mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating threshing drum (commonly called the ""cylinder""), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through the action of the cylinder against the concave, a shaped ""half drum"", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed due to the fact that the grain is heavier than the straw, which causes it to fall rather than ""float"" across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
