												Rochard is very nice logic game with lovely soundtrack. <3 At the beginning game is very easy but more you play - more difficult are levels. Player can't be bored there. If you're loking for a game where you can shoot enemies and do logic puzzles in every level, then this game is for you.			",240,53,12,28,14,7,21

												Rochard is a sci-fi platform game which was initially released on the PlayStation 3 network in 2011, but was eventually ported to he PC later in that year.  The game  revolves around taking control of gravity, and using the gravity gun called the G-Lifter. This is used to manipulate objects around the levels.  This game has it all, increasingly challenging environmental puzzles, action, a rich story line and plenty of humor. The game play is a two dimensional side scrolling platformer that takes place in three dimensional scenes. You work your way through the environments completing a series of puzzles and combat encounters.  You are able to change the gravity in the room very easily at just the press of a button. All of the puzzles are easy enough for you to not get stuck on them for ages, but hard enough so that you can't just stroll into a room and instantly be able to figure it out. It hits the sweet spot just right. The graphical fidelity is very pleasing, it has a nice art style which works well with this type of game. All of the character models look well polished and has brilliant animation. The voice acting is also top notch here too, something a fair few games manage to fall down on. While the single player story mode took me about five hours to complete; I felt as if it managed to fulfill its potential in that time. There is also some DLC available for a very cheap price which includes four new challenging puzzle levels. Granted there is more of an emphasis on the puzzle solving as apposed to the combat, but even for the most experienced puzzle platforming players you'll find them difficult. I did have to check out the walkthrough because I was stumped at times. This is a really well ported game, I didn't have any technical problems, you are able to play in higher resolutions and the game does work with the keyboard and mouse, however it is highly recommended you use a controller with these types of games. I would recommend Rochard to people who really enjoy the puzzle platforming genre, people expecting an action packed side scrolling shooter will probably not find the thrill they are looking for. But if you want a couple hours of figuring out puzzles in a sci-fi environment, you may as well try Rochard If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												PROS:- Great indie game that actually isn't indie quality; level design, art direction, soundtrack, and pretty much everything is high quality.- Clean physics engine integrated with the game mechanics; gravity gun, which must have been inspired by Half-Life 2, but what games aren't influenced by Half-Life and Portal series these days?- Moderately challenging Puzzles; perfect casual genre as stated on Steam Store page.- Awesome music is never overused and it is only played in the very right moments for the best atmospheric experiences.- The game has cartoony graphics and style, and overall lighthearted vibe but there are emotionally touching moments; Zander. D:- The story is clichÃ©d. However, it does not matter because games do not always have to be original and groundbreaking in every aspects to be fun. You have to fight and stop the corrupt corporate mastermind who is trying to take over the universe, or something like that; the story flows and fits just fine with overall tone of the game and the execution is also great.CONS:- I really can't think of any cons.Final Remarks:Even though Rochard is categorized as indie genre, all work is done by professionals and you will know what I mean once you get your hands on this game. You should expect Bastion kind of quality minus a big budget and Warner Bros..DLC Review:Hard TimesSoundtrack and Artbook. RECOMMENDED .			",2748,1124,111,302,384,33,440

												What a fun little game. With it's addictive puzzle/physics gameplay, and awesome soundtrack Rochard is just one of those indie games that needs to be played even if you are not into indie games. Your main use of interacting with the world around you is with the G-Lifter, much like the gravity gun in Half life 2 you can accomplish puzzles and defeat enemies with this neat little tool. The story is also what makes this game immersive, and want you to keep playing. It mixes a blend of puzzle solving with action so you never get bored. You play as John Rochard who is a miner and he and his team of miners are not having much luck when it comes to finding Turbinium a valuable resource in the game that is worth a lot apparently......until one day! Get this game while on a discount so it be worth your while to find out for yourself!			",219,19,1,56,13,3,21

												I took a chance on buying Rochard without really knowing what to expect, and I don't regret it. It's a really fun 3D platformer with physic puzzles, time/gravity manipulation, and a whole lot of action. You play a humble hero with moderate abilities tinkering with gravity-gun-like devices in an outer-space cargo containment center. Playing with the mouse and keyboard is fine but, in my opinion, Rochard plays best with a 360 controller, a beer, a couch, and some friends around. It has a fairly shallow learning curve and anyone can jump into it at any stage. It took me 2 days to beat, we were sad to see it end, but I just recently bought the expansion pack DLC so I cant wait to try that out. I Give Rochard 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rochard is more than your average platform puzzler. It's got beautiful 2.5D graphics, meaning that gameplay is strictly east/west, but the background recedes in beautiful 3D depth and give an illusion of greater space. Sort of like Trine, but deeper and prettier. Rochard also has a good story, told through cutscenes and voiceover.The main gameplay mechanic is a gravity gun; you manipulate the environment around you with this one device to solve puzzles, clear passages and fight bad guys. There are other twists, too, like gravity manipulation.Although I admire Rochard, it wasn't for me. I found that some of the puzzles required more timing finesse than I cared to put up with. Still, I give Rochard a thumbs up, because it's a very good entry in the platformer genre. It's made with great attention to detail, sports a low price tag, and there's a free demo so you can try before you buy. All plusses in my book. ",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												A pretty unique game, you play as John Rochard (voiced by Duke Nukem's John St John), our game's protagonist and a stalwart asteroid miner, whose has dealt with 4 years of bad luck finding ""space diesel"" called Turbinium. After finding something BIG amongst the asteroids, and calling his employer, Maximilian, about the find, the ship and his crew are soon attacked by space bandits, the Wild Boys, and that's only the beginning of Rochard's problems...This game combines the aspects of a tactical action shooter, a ""2D"" 3D scroller, and a puzzle game, and does it all RIGHT; All within a gritty 1980's sci-fi movie feel (and some wonderful spacesynth music added into the atospheric feel of the gameplay). The gameplay is challenging, but fun and not complicated (from grabbing and throwing objects/your enemies, to manipulating the ship's gravity and the machinery, as well). The characters are interesting (and Rochard's one-liners are funny to hear... but you'd expect no less from John St John), and character and background design are fantasically-done.

												Oh man. Indie games have really started to come in masses these days. Some are really cool. Some are really a waste of time (AND money). Not so Rochard. For an indie game, it's really long (6 - 7 hours). The characters, along with the story are funny and interesting. The gameplay itself, is a mixture of a jump n run, and Half-Life 2's awesome gravity gun. Plus low gravitiy as gameplay mechanics, neat little puzzles and of course some laser gun action. All in all I really can't say anything bad about Rochard, except maybe, that it doesn't deliever anything new. But hey, if 6 hours go by and you're still having a lot of fun with a game, who cares? :)			",353,110,8,39,27,1,46

												Probably my favourite 2D puzzle/plattformer on steam. Cool presentation, nice controls and music. I also love the mood and humour of the game, it really sets me in a sci-fi/space scenario. The base mechanic of the game consists in shooting and solving puzzles, with the help of your grav gun, and to a minor extent platforming elements; overall its solid and fun. The dlc is good too, a bit short though			",2258,930,98,295,279,35,400

												I honestly love this game. It's a platformer with logical and action elements, the puzzles usually revolve around shifting gravity or moving the objects. All three gameplay types are perfectly blended together, the game flows very well and you don't get stuck often. Because of that, some people may consider it easy. That's why there's a DLC with higher difficulty. For me, it was very pleasant to be able to play without getting frustrated, which is a downside of many great and challenging games. As for the graphical side, I can't complain. Rochard is somewhat cartoonish, but very pleasant to look at and rich, colorful. Music and sound effect are well-done too. But what I really love is the main character. I grew sick of the manly, model-like and virtuous main characters who lack character that appear in many current games . John Rochard, on the other hand, is a man around 40 whose figure is far from perfect. He is funny, but not in an obtrusive way. His voice acting is great and he's very easy to identify with. Even the other characters are well-done, all are very believable. Even though I think the game is worth the original price, if you are not sure whether to buy it, wait for a sale. But definitely buy it, it's worth it.			",325,161,14,48,9,1,31

												This is a great little platform game. You are a space miner, John Rochard, and have stumbled onto something more. Your mining tool can grab items and hurl them at other objects. It gets upgraded to shoot bullets and explosives and finally lets you grab people and swing through crates.This is an excellent game. The story line, the pacing, the gameplay, the voice acting (sometimes suffers in indie titles). This is a top notch game and worth playing if you like 2D platform games.It is of the right length in my opinion, nearly 7 hours for my first playthrough. I tried to explore and find all the tokens. I think I found most of them, but some are a real bugger to collect. There is a speedrun achievement on steam - finish in less than three hours. Despite not getting all the tokens and the speedrun, re-playability isn't there. At least not for me. The ending hints at a sequel, and here is hoping.			",405,92,1,47,37,3,56

												Rochard is a fun little physics/puzzle based platformer with a decent enough (although rather cliched) storyline to go along with it. - Combat can get a bit boring as you basically have the option of shooting or throwing stuff at the enemies but it's not a major part of the game anyway. - The mechanics of the ""G-Lifter"" and the fact you can manipulate gravity at will (remotely by manipulating ""gravity generator"" on each level) makes each level somewhat challenging to begin with, but once you see the solution you'll kick yourself for not seeing it sooner. - The graphics aren't going to blow anyone away, it is built on a fairly old version of the Unity engine but they're perfectly acceptable and go well with the game.- It has collectibles hidden around each level. Although they all look the same, it adds a degree of replayability to the game for those who like to get every achievement in games.- The soundtrack is very enjoyable and always fits the situation perfectly.- The voice acting is decent, especially that of the main character, John Rochard, voiced by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem himself.Overall, it's worth buying, although wait for a sale. There isn't enough content for Â£8 but there's certainly plenty for Â£2.			",213,31,9,17,19,2,31

												Rochard is a bargain and it offers so much. The combat has a lot of depth to it because there are multiple ways of taking down enemies like reflecting bullets with objects or throwing objects at enemies or you can just use bullets or missiles. No method of combat is overpowered enough to use all the time but I've noticed some methods are better in some situations for example I now know not to use the assualt rifle when surrounded by multiple enemies in multiple spots but to just reflect the bullets with objects until there are a small amount of enemies standing then I can easily kill them by throwing the object at them then throwing a grenade or shooting a missile.The graphic style consists of a nice colour palet of faint blues and greys and strong yellows and oranges, the chatacter models are slightly over exaggerated but hold lots of detail. Textures are for the most part high quality and there are some brilliant lighting effects throughout the game. Rochard also ran at 60 fps at maximum settings on a 650 so optimisation wise the port over from ps3 is good and you're more than capable to play with mouse and keyboard however I preferred to use a 360 pad because I found that it was easier to multi-task moving, firing and appling zero gravity on the 360 controller.The only issues I had with the game are that it should of been about two hours shorter because it became a bit of a chore to play at the end. Also in my opinion the plot is a bit lackluster but in Rochard's defence the platform genre isn't known for their gripping complex plots even the greats like Fez and Rayman Origins barely focused on the plot however Rochard does but the plot just isn't very good. Whatever I have to say about the story I still liked the space mining theme because it reminds me of the show ""Red Dwarf"". Lastly the game brings in new items and abilities often and if you haven't mastered each mechanic in the short amount of time you might fall behind. Sometimes I found myself being overwhelmed with the options I had in combat situations like whether I should throw a grenade, use zero gravity, fire bullets or missiles or block myself with an object, this can be a sign of two many powers and abilities in a short space of time because the player hasn't gathered enough experience with each weaopn or abilty to know when to use each of them at the right time.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase of around Â£3 (I can't really remember the price I paid but it was one sale at the time), anyway I got more enjoyment out of the game than If I had used that money to buy a Mcdonalds burger and coke.

Rochard is an easy yet excellent platformer that completely fulfilled my expectations â a surprising sleeper hit.Its sensationally colorful retro-futuristic and cartoonish art style looks fantastic. The soundtrack in particular is outstanding with its 80's vibe, professional voice acting and good humour. Overall everything is highly pleasant about the game.It also plays very smoothly. New mechanics and variations are steadily introduced up to the end, keeping the gameplay and level design fresh throughout the entire game, with a perfectly balanced and completely accessible difficulty curve.Especially interesting low-gravity mechanics and energy fields that only let certain materials through give way to intelligent puzzles. Minimal combat spices things up a bit without compromising the leisurely pace. The challenges remain fairly effortless with lenient enemies, rapid health regen and regular checkpoints.I only found the aiming controls to be a bit too sensitive with the right stick (playing on an Xbox 360 controller) and the button configuration was a bit unusual at first, but none of this is disconcerting.While the story is rather conventional it provides purpose to each level, and it's good enough except for a disappointing ending that unfortunately sets the game up for a sequel that will likely never happen. It would have been great to play more in the same style, but Rochard nonetheless stands proud on its own.			",37,72,1,0,2,0,0

												Rochard is a physics puzzle platformer, which came out a few years ago, long before the current glut of physics puzzle platformers. In retrospect, Rochard is obviously an older game with many design flaws that were the result of not being able to learn the mistakes of other titles in the genre.First of all, the game's positives: Rochard has fairly good graphics and 90s cartoon art style. The protagonist is not a faceless muscular commando, but a working stiff with a potbelly and some personality. The supporting characters are similarly varied, and the entire cast has decent voice acting. The writing is nothing special, but the style of story does fit well with the cartoony art aesthetic, though any plot twists are obvious from a mile away.The problems with the game are that it focuses on both combat and puzzle solving, but does neither very well. Combat is done using a combination Gravity Gun/Laser Blaster against mercernaries or bots. Enemy AI is simplistic, reminiscent of very early console platformers. There's very little challenge in that area, so you would expect something more from the puzzle department. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as puzzles are equally simplistic, never reaching the level of mind-bending challenge that a dedicated puzzle game like Portal or The Swapper provides. So what's left? Nothing. No high score mechanic, and no exploration. There's a barebones badly executed attempt at Metroidvania elements for collectables which forces some backtracking, but that's not at all enjoyable due to lack of fast movement abilities, and lack of enjoyable combat.All in all, Rochard is simply less than the sum of its parts.

												Rochard is a rare gem of a puzzle/action platformer featuring GIANT DEATH LASERS, gravity control (and often, lack thereof), pretty good graphics and voice acting (by 2011 standards, at least) and moderately challenging puzzles. New mechanics are added as the story progresses and it works well; the difficulty ramps up a bit with each new section. Platformers are not usually 'my thing' but this one is worth a few bucks. Not quite the caliber of Deadlight, Braid, Limbo, Gunpoint, but still damn good fun.8/10			",118,46,8,35,34,1,22

												One of the best unity games I've played, the physics are well done and it is pleasing to play and look!Evironments are well built and enemies get smarter and harder gradually. Few pretty good puzzles but I'd love to see a DLC or extra level where you'd focus mainly on puzzles. Play with the gravity gives you pretty free hands how to get trought the section/level, but its use is built so you can't take too many shortcuts.Found only few bugs and those didn't bother the gameplay. I suggest a controller for the best experience, I played few levels with keyboard/mouse but ended up with ps3 controller.Anyways hats off to people in Recoil games for a awesome game!Well worth my money and I'd buy it again :D but remember ""Gravity is a b....""!

												Awesome game!!!  You play as Rochard, an asteroid miner whose team makes an unusual discovery while digging.  Of course, the bad guys move in and try to claim it for themselves and eliminate you and your pals.  Rochard has to fight back using his G-lifter gun.  Using the G-Lifter (aka gravity gun) takes some practice, but it's actually quite fun once you get the hang of it.  Once the G-Lifter is upgraded to also shoot laser bolts and bombs it's even better!  Also, the game has two gravity settings: regular-G and low-G, and the player can switch between them at will, which is great because it changes the game's physics to your advantage.Navigating the different levels is a challenge.  Sometimes you really need to think to figure out what to do to overcome the obstacles in your way (force fields, laser turrets, environmental hazards, enemies, barriers, etc.).  But even when what you need to do is obvious, the execution is often tough.  Sometimes it requires several tries to get it right...enough to be challenging, but not enough to where the game bogs down and becomes frustrating.Lastly, the game has fun, cartoony graphics with nice visuals and animations.  It's also quite funny at times -- for instance, the Sky Cops are hilarious (""I TOTALLY need a manicure!"" Haha!)  Anyhow, I'm having a great time playing it.  Highly recommended!P.S. The ""Hard Times"" DLC is also great.  Totally worth it...especially considering it's only $2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crates. Since the dawn of the digital age, man has struggled with crates. Inexplicably, video games contain about a hundred times more crates than exist in the known universe, some to be pushed, some to be broken, and some to arbitrarily block your progress. Rochard is, first and foremost, a game of crates. There's shooting, there's some cute writing, but there's mainly a lot of crates.If you're like me and have been wondering what the hell kind of name ""Rochard"" is, it's the name of the pot-bellied protagonist, John Rochard. A blue-collar asteroid miner down on his luck, you control the surprisingly spry fellow on a day when everything goes to hell. Your main tool in this adventure is the G-Lifter, a gravity gun knockoff that can lift crates, drop crates, launch crates, and do some other stuff like double as an assault rifle and grenade launcher. You'll also get control over gravity for much of the game, and the interplay between your crate gun and gravity manipulation is the basis of most of the puzzles.Generally your challenge is getting from point A to point B by stacking crates, swapping fuses, and finding ways around force fields and chasms. The force fields are actually a nice touch, with some blocking organic matter, some inorganic, and some energy like weapon fire. They're color-coded to function, and my favorite puzzles are figuring out how to get yourself and the items you need through networks of force fields. Still, I have to stress that a lot of your puzzling will depend on crates, so if the stacks and see-saws in Half-Life 2 burned you out, you might not last long with Rochard.The other major part of the game is combat. Rochard is way more combat-heavy than I expected, with most puzzles needing to be cleared of enemies and turrets before working out the solution. Your G-Lifter can switch to pew pew mode with the touch of a button, and crates make very deadly weapons here, so combat is at least integrated pretty seamlessly and offers plenty of entertaining options. You'll get weapon and life upgrades as you progress, and there are collectibles to find if you need a little extra puzzling, but most of the game is very linear and offers the same challenges in mounting degrees.Look, do you like crates? That's really all this boils down to. Rochard looks, sounds, and plays really well for a platformer, but everything revolves around crates and what you can accomplish with them, and at this point in our lives I'm not entirely convinced we really need much more of that. It's a solid game that'll last you 3-4 hours (plus some additional challenges) so as long as you know what you're in for, it'll fill your crate quota.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

A very entertaining little platform game that introduces a nice gravity-gun idea that has combines some action and puzzle elements.While the puzzle elements aren't all that complex during the campaign, I still found them very nice.  The gradual enhancements introduced to the gravity gun throughout the game made for some nice pacing and added variety to the puzzles and gameplay.  Early on your gun is only able to lift and move light crates, but later you add the ability to throw crates, then able to affect gravity (strong or weak), then to fire it as a blaster, then to also lob grenades (and later different types of grenades), to later be able to support yourself from a suspended crate or handle, etc.  Very cool!  And they introduced them slow enough you could utilize and enjoy the new skill on a number of levels before introducing something new.The Good:+ Very well done platform game+ Novel idea with the gun to pick up, move and throw objects and affect gravity.+ Nice graphics, animations, and art style+ Entertaining story+ Good number of levels.  To me the campaign lasted just over 6 hours.  (The Hard Times DLC added another ~1.8 hours)The OK:~ Some say the puzzles are on the easy side, but I enjoyed them all the same.  (Go for the Hard Times DLC which are 4 levels that are much more difficult if you like challenges)The Bad:- Nothing comes to mind.Overall:  I thought over this was a very well done platform game, which to me stands out better than most.  8 out of 10.

												Rochard never gained enough traction because of its small marketing efforts and smaller demographic, which is a shame because it's the quintessential small, charming indie puzzle platformer game with personality and care. This was one of the earliest games to utilize the Unity Engine. It benefits from it, and will feel current for many years.HighlightsWithout its charming indie feel and homely 80s personality Rochard would've been just another, slightly above average, platformer. But some really symbiotic design and gameplay elements elevate this to something a little better than the rest.* Great characters that didn't even need to have personality but were given tons* Incredible voice acting for a game of this budget* Above average lighting and background design* Fairly challenging at times, brain required* A good, 80s-feel soundtrackMistakesPlatformers are relatively simple in their design and tend to need combinations of good mechanics, unique or useful collectibles or alternative ways of solving things. Rochard suffers from a lack of these and often feels bland and samey.* Very annoying AI and level manipulation at time, repeating the same mistake a few times is jarring when it's the game engines' fault* Mechanics, despite working well, feel repetitive after so long* Bland and slow paced at timesRecommendationsRochard clocks in at 6 hours play time and doesn't have much re-playability, but it's relatively cheap; Â£7.99/8.99â¬/$9.99 at the time of review and it goes on sale for up to -90% regularly on Steam, so is definitely a buy at less than 1 Buck, Quid or Euro. It's available on mobile and a ton of other platforms and comes up in bundles, so look out for it being cheaper somewhere else if you care about a few cents.* The Hard Times DLC is pretty difficult and challenging, and only adds challenge maps. It's probably only worth considering buying after completing the full game.* The voice of John Rochard is played by Jon St. John ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_St._John ), who also helped voice elements of Duke Nukem, Dota 2, Sonic Adventures, Guild Wars 2 and Amnesia.

												Rochard is a really cool 2.5D sidescrolling-platformer with nifty visuals, great voice acting and an awesome TRON-ish/80's-Discopop-ish soundtrack.The story is fairly generic and basically involves a good old friend who suddenly betrays you and wants you dead. Also he kidnaps a girl, so it's up to you to rescue here, defeat the baddie and save the day.The G-Lifter, an astro-miner's swiss army knife, combines a gravity gun, a laser gun, a grenade/sticky bomb launcher, a comm unit and, of course, a flash light and is used for both the fights and puzzles.The gun fights are pretty generic too, however, the puzzles offer a good amount of variation and constantly add new elements to them over the course of the game.The playtime should be something between 5 and 6 hours for a first playthrough but it also can be beaten in less than 3hrs (there's even an achievement for that).All in all Rochard is a really good, fun and well polished Indie game and well worth it's money. Go get it!			",865,363,47,90,97,13,143

												It's a very good title if you like physics-based mechanics, but the game doesn't exactly involve a lot of physics puzzles. For me, that was a good thing, because I am personally not a huge fan of pure physics puzzles games. They tend to feel kind of shallow.Rochard's two biggest uses of physics are A) Catapaulting heavy objects on top of enemies to kill them, and B) a wide variety of anti-gravity navigation situations.Enemies can be shot directly. Or you can throw heavy crates on top of them. Or---when applicable---you can break/pull the floor out from underneath them so that they fall to their death or land in an electric field. You can hold a crate in front of you at such an angle that enemy laser fire is deflected off the crate and ricochets into other enemies (but this requires a little bit of luck and is hard to execute intentionally). You can use your gravity gun to redirect mounted lasers into enemies to kill them. Later in the game, just like Half-Life 2, you can power up the grav gun to pick up the enemies themselves and throw them. You also receive three grenade types throught the game: a grenade that bounces and has a timed explosion, a grenade that sticks to a surface and has a detonated explosion, and a grenade that sticks to a surface and causes whatever it's touching to float into the air. Experimenting with all the different ways to kill enemies is one of the funnest aspects of the game, and successfully killing them with crates or other environmental hazards does not get old.The game's puzzles often involve ""switch"" puzzles that change the colors of force fields. Blue lets everything pass through except crates/fuses. Red lets everything pass except for Rochard. Orange lets everything pass except for gunfire/explosions. White does not let anything pass. You will often have to exchange fuses and flip switches to create a path for Rochard or other objects through a maze of force fields. Other puzzle elements include gravity reversal switches (i.e. flipping between walking on the floor and ceiling), elevators, and doors. Often you will need to use crates and fuses to complete a puzzle and you'll have to figure out how to make a short supply of these objects go a long way. Suffice to say, the puzzle variation is great. The puzzle difficulty ranges anywhere between cakewalk and moderate. (With the exception of the Hard Times bonus levels. Those get much trickier.)The anti-gravity stuff is pretty fun to play with too. If anti-gravity is on, you can pick up a crate, jump into the air, then launch the crate to send yourself flying through the air in the opposite direction. This includes jumping and firing a crate at the floor to launch yourself higher. One upgrade to the grav gun gives you an ability called ""G-Swing"". If zero G is on, this ability lets you jump into the air, then latch your grav beam onto certain fixed objects and slingshot yourself around the environment.The only complaints I can make about this game are as follows:1) In the very late levels when the difficulty starts to spike, the game starts to periodically break one of the golden rules of game design, which is this: ""Don't subject the player to a challenge that they could not possibly overcome or recognize the solution to without dying first."" The primary way the game does this is through ""think fast"" type situations. There will definitely be times when you'll walk through a door and so much sh*t comes at you all of a sudden that you get boned before you have time to figure out what is even happening.2) Skyler's fake English accent. No offense to Lani Minella. She's worked on a lot of games, and I'm sure she's great to work with. But there are  plenty of real English people in the world, and there is nothing distinctly English about Skyler's character. She could have just as easily been American. The team should have hired someone who actually HAS or can actually DO an English accent or just had Lani use her normal American voice. I hate to be so blunt to nice people doing honest work, but that accent was.... quite bad.3) The grav gun has a tendency to aim-correct toward objects the player is PROBABLY aiming at but are targeting just a little too wide. In a lot of cases, especially early in the game, this is nice and makes the gameplay a lot more slick. However, later in the game the screen gets super cluttered with enemies, turrets, crates, bots, and platforms that you'll find yourself depserately trying to target X with your beam, but you keep latching onto objects A, B, C, D, E, F, and G instead. When this gets paired up with a ""think fast"" type situation, it leads to a certain degree of annoyance. Thankfully, this only happens a few times, and mostly in the late game.A good little title that deserves more respect.			",216,124,3,41,18,0,24

												I really dislike this game and I will try to elaborate as much as I can. I hope that my arguments against this game will be justified and fair.This game is a puzzle-platformer most of the time and this is one of the better elements done in Rochard. Puzzles and mechanics aren't clever or original (main gimmick is a gravity gun and lowering/increasing gravity force), but most of the time they are nonintrusive. I also liked some sections where you are performing Tarzan using mentioned gun. This was pretty fun.Unfortunately, all other important aspects fall flat for me. ESPECIALLY combat. Sometimes you are forced to shoot some dudes. I can understand that it was added to vary the pacing, but at the end it was implemented very badly on many levels. One, ludonarrative dissonance. Your protagonist is presumably a nice and caring guy, yet you gunning down mercenaries like heartless â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Two, gunplay is pretty boring and unsatisfying. You basic gun makes only minor ""pew pew pew"" and most of the time shooting you feel empty. Three, enemies are morons. They literally get crushed by the slow moving elevator without any reaction. ""Moving away from the lowering platform? Nah, I will stay here! Nothing important to consi..."" <Dead>. This is a overall how they function. Expect idiots everywhere.Story is extremely problematic. You can see first plot twist from mile away and game expects you to be shocked. Dramatic scenes are made laughable thanks to poor and repetitive 3D animations. Characters are really bland and except for the main protagonist, they have no personality whatsoever. I'm a person that can ignore story problems if characters are likeable, but this is not the case. Mid-game they are trying to set up the ""big reveal"" at the end. Of course there are no actual hints or information what's going on, game only insist that there is a MASSIVE revelation down the line. After pretty weak bossfight at the end of the game you will learn the truth! SPOILER ALERT You get nothing. To sum up: uninteresting characters, no actual story development, weak villain, no pay-off. Nothing.Graphics look kind of nice, but level design is uninspired (many annoying forcefields of different kinds that block you, block things you carry or block your shots) and art assets are reused very often. best looking locations are to ones that are more unique - Third level for example.  Game has also a VERY bad habit of not telling you important things. Example: ""Great! You found an upgrade station!"", ""What does it do?"", ""I don't know!"". Other example: You are expected to lower gravity in one room to reach higher ledge in one of the early levels. I was stuck there for few minutes, I didn't know that I can do that. No button prompt, no voice information. This could be understandable in more basic game, but in that moment I was thinking that I'm getting a puzzle wrong. Until I checked the control scheme and discovered the button for gravity change (note that effect of button press is not instant), I was painfully stuckOverall, I would call Rochard an unpleasant experience. Puzzles are okayish, but combat, story and questionable omissions in basic game design make this one part boring, second part infuriating and third part plain mediocre. I simply cannot recommend it. People may like this game, I don't know how, but that's good for you.			",168,39,11,6,6,2,16

												3/10. The developers had an interesting idea here, but I'd say they flubbed on its execution. The game tries to be a mix of puzzle game and platformer, but can't end up doing a very good job of either one. The puzzles are too simple and repetitive when they're present, and the platforming is oftentimes thoughtless. It's not necessarily that either element is too easy, but that they used no imagination in their execution, take no imagination to solve, and generally feel the same throughout the entire game. The game would have received maybe a 5.5/10 if not for the story. Aside from a horrible case of purple prose and poor dialogue, it packs more cliches than I thought possible and plays them all straight, without any indication that the writers had any awareness of its laughability. The voice acting also really grated on my ears, and the only reason I finished the game is because I kept telling myself it had to get better eventually.It didn't. I applaud the creators for their work because creating a game is no mean feat, and it took dedication to get this far. But if any of them should happen to read this review, I suggest focusing on one genre and doing it well, rather than trying to combine genres or elements of genres before you've learned what makes either of them work. I will not be recommending this to fans of platformers, puzzle-solvers, or puzzle-solving platformers. If you want a recommendation and don't mind a challenge and antiquated graphics, look up Defy Gravity on Steam instead.			",167,55,3,33,1,1,6

												Pretty good game.You run around from room to room killing enemies and solving puzzles.  Occasional empty rooms provide areas to expand the story or allow dialouge.  Run around manipulating gravity and use a physics based gun to manipulate objects/enemies.  You also get a rock blaster which acts as an overheatable machine gun/ grenade launcher.Puzzles and enemies are easy for the most part.  You'll still die every once and a while as your character can't take many rounds before going down.  There's a checkpoint just outside of pretty much every area where it's possible to die, so it only takes a few seconds to get right back to where you were.  What makes the game enjoyable is that it has a very nice flow to it.  Usually you'll run through 3-5 rooms of enemies/puzzles, go to one empty area with some dialogue or something, then run through another 3-5 rooms of enemies/puzzles.  There're very few instances where you're spending several minutes running through empty meaningless rooms.  This means there's very little downtime where you're being bored because nothing is happening.  It also helps that the game is fairly lighthearted and your main character is an entertaining protagonist, occasionally spouting off some enjoyable lines.  Controls are solid with a controller.  The music is also enjoyable throughout.Only real complaints are the lack of enemy variety and their simplicity.  The final boss is also very easy.  Puzzles could've also been a little more difficult to solve, though there is an occasional one here and there that'll make you think for a minute.  Story could've been better as it's predicatable.  Characters other than John are one dimensional but that's not necessarily a bad thing in a game like this.Provides an enjoyable casual gaming experience.			",177,73,1,18,19,1,19

												Rochard is a pretty good game, I have reviewed this game before straight after I finished it and I thought I would rewrite it seeing as it was a little unfair. (My previous âreviewâ being just âThe ending isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥)Ahemâ¦Yes I was pretty disappointed/angry with the ending, but I thought that I shouldnât let that get in the way of what a great game this actually is.My first glance of this game the first thing I thought was that it looks like itâs trying to be a 2D Portal/Half-Life with the gravity gun and lasers and all. But I kind of regret that now, itâs nowhere near either game. The mechanics and physics of this game is fun to play around with, itâs a great side scrolling platformer with great puzzles to get past and enemies to defeat.The story is not the most riveting in the whole game industry but its griping enough for you to stick around and want to see what happens next. Character and dialog wise there werenât any problems and as far as graphics go I thought they were pretty good. Bright and vibrant, dark and gloomy where needed.This is a good game and I think itâs worth a go for anyone umming and arring about whether or not to buy it.			",414,272,31,20,31,5,36

While it perhaps could be faulted for being somewhat of an easy game (especially when compared to other puzzle platformers like Braid or Limbo), it in no way deters this game's quality. It strikes a really nice balance between puzzles and combat, both which are really well done and quite satisfying. But the best part of Rochard is the amazing physics-based gameplay and how much fun it is to toy with. Being able to manipulate gravity opens up a world of really fun and often hilarious gameplay, especially in combat. The game has a quirky sense of humor that really grew on me, and is right at that sweet 8 hour length that isn't too much yet doesn't feel too short. If you like your puzzle platformers with a healthy dose of action, don't skip Rochard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great platformer with cool design, awesome feeling, catchy soundtrack and the spine shaking voice of Jon St. John. I'm not  a platformer type, but I love that game. If you buy it, make sure you are doin' it with the soundtrack, absolutely worth it.(If you try the demo, maybe you'll experience a stupid and annoying glitch which removes the ""con"" from the controlling: the jump (one of the most important function in a platformer) doesn't work properly. Don't worry, they fixed it in the full version!)			",1198,239,58,94,64,12,87

												Pretty good game.You run around from room to room killing enemies and solving puzzles.  Occasional empty rooms provide areas to expand the story or allow dialouge.  Run around manipulating gravity and use a physics based gun to manipulate objects/enemies.  You also get a rock blaster which acts as an overheatable machine gun/ grenade launcher.Puzzles and enemies are easy for the most part.  You'll still die every once and a while as your character can't take many rounds before going down.  There's a checkpoint just outside of pretty much every area where it's possible to die, so it only takes a few seconds to get right back to where you were.  What makes the game enjoyable is that it has a very nice flow to it.  Usually you'll run through 3-5 rooms of enemies/puzzles, go to one empty area with some dialogue or something, then run through another 3-5 rooms of enemies/puzzles.  There're very few instances where you're spending several minutes running through empty meaningless rooms.  This means there's very little downtime where you're being bored because nothing is happening.  It also helps that the game is fairly lighthearted and your main character is an entertaining protagonist, occasionally spouting off some enjoyable lines.  Controls are solid with a controller.  The music is also enjoyable throughout.Only real complaints are the lack of enemy variety and their simplicity.  The final boss is also very easy.  Puzzles could've also been a little more difficult to solve, though there is an occasional one here and there that'll make you think for a minute.  Story could've been better as it's predicatable.  Characters other than John are one dimensional but that's not necessarily a bad thing in a game like this.Provides an enjoyable casual gaming experience.			",177,73,1,18,19,1,19

												In a nutshell, Rochard is a 2D physics platformer, with great voice acting, fun weapons and puzzles, okay combat, and decent story. Rochard is exactly what you would expect for an indie puzzle game. Don't expect the stunning graphics and immersive gameplay of AAA titles, or you'll be very disappointed. Rochard's graphics are rather cartoonish, but I feel that it fits with the general atmospere of the game. It's defnitely a casual game with little replay value.Personally, I would only pick up Rochard if it were on sale. Watch out of the 80% off sale because this game is a steal at two dollars.~Krystal~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rochard is pretty, it sounds nice and it's full of puzzles I found just hard enough.  While some might deem it a bit short, gathering tokens for achievements seems to have kept me occupied longer than the reviews I've read (and I'm still missing a few).  Rochard also ends on a bit of a cliffhanger which leaves room for DLC and/or sequels, but the game's plot is resolved even if the backstory continues.			",808,175,6,67,43,6,106

												Pleasant little puzzle platformer involving gravity bending crate moving.----+ Charming sound design.+ Clean, intuitive visuals.+ Fun puzzles.+ Moderate amount of combat keeps things mixed up.+/- Short and sweet.+/- Hard Times DLC is a set of very hard challenge levels.- The main story might be a bit on the easier side if you're used to physics puzzle games.----I'm not a fan of most of the 2-D Puzzle Platformers on the market. I just don't find it fun or stimulating when a game relies on repetition and perfect inputs and reflexes. Happily Rochard isn't like that!It's short and a little easy but the puzzles are interestingly cerebral and the game's visuals and soundtrack are quite charming. Warm hearted redneck miners in space!

												Good platformer. Puzzles usually aren't a challenge, but are fun to do. I thought combat was fun, since you could (after a point) either fire your gun or hit enemies with objects you pick up with the G-Lifter. There are hidden collectables for you to go back and find if you miss some, but that's just a staple of these kinds of games. The story is interesting enough; your character, Rochard, is easily the best personality in the game. The visuals and atmosphere are well done. Overall, it's just a really fun platformer, and I hope there's a sequel some day.			",173,47,1,22,7,1,19

												Rochard is a really nice 2.5d sideways scrolling platform action puzzler. It doesn't really add any innovation to the genres, but there is enough diversity in the gameplay mechanics to keep it interesting for the 6 hours the main campaign took me. It's a game that lets you start off with just a fraction of the tools you'll have towards the end, so don't let the shallow gameplay at first put you off. The star of the show is your gravity gun, which after enough upgrades end up being as overpowered as it's supercharged sibling in the end of Half Life 2 which probably inspired it. Toying with gravity is a key component to the gameplay, and you'll be able to turn on low gravity at will. Other sections of the game will have you reverse gravity at certain terminals in order to solve some puzzles etc.I just wish the devs had put more time into coming up with some interesting foes, because all you get to fight is bland braindead humanoids.I played the game with a Xbone controller and the default configuration was nice.The presentation in this 2011 game is where things fall a bit short - the visuals are OK by 2016 standards, but the realtime rendered cutscenes are just soo poorly animated plus the voice acting sounds really forced. (Rochard is played by the dude who does Duke Nukem). Sound effects are mediocre. The story was flat, and the attempts at humor were duds.But who cares when you can have this much solid gamplay for a bargain price. And if you like it, but felt it was a little on the easy side, I can also recommend the ""Hard Times"" DLC which I bought for less than a buck. It's very short, but it's worth the few pennies regardless.75%			",145,19,12,3,9,1,8

A Great GameThis side scrolling puzzler is a very well made game. The idea is to move stuff around to get from one door to another using your laser gun and battling bad guys with physics. That on its own might sound boring, but Rochard has a compelling (if not completely original) storyline which gives the puzzles purpose.The Hard Times DLC was to give some really difficult levels to the game but I think the normal game is balanced very well for diffculty and entertainment.The ending was a bit confusing  They just disappear through a wormhole never to be seen again  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rochard is a somewhat easy but well crafted platformer with some puzzle elements that I would recommend getting at a deep discount for anyone who wants a game that's a little different and off beat.  For people who really love platformers or Portal type games, Rochard's lack of deep story, length, or mechanics may deter you.  The primary mechanics are a gun that can lift & move all sorts of things, grenades, and gravity altering. As for difficulty: In my playthrough of ~6 hours, there were 5-10 of sections where I died multiple times trying to get past certain sections, and a handful of times where a puzzle took more than 5 minutes.  This fit my playstyle, as most puzzle type games tend to frustrate me after a significant amountv of time, with the exception of something really great like Boom Blox.The game looked and sounded good for a platformer in space, but not particularly stellar.  Audio and visual settings are bare bones, but ran smoothly on my GTX680 with only slight far from jarring dips under 60fps @ 1080p x 1.5 DSR. Characters in cutscenes seemed kinda stiff compared to the voice work.  The environments are somewhat varied, but I can't say the same about the enemies.There definitely needs to be more games like this that are affordable, well made, and provide some innovations to familiar genres.

This fit my playstyle, as most puzzle type games tend to frustrate me after a significant amountv of time, with the exception of something really great like Boom Blox.The game looked and sounded good for a platformer in space, but not particularly stellar.  Audio and visual settings are bare bones, but ran smoothly on my GTX680 with only slight far from jarring dips under 60fps @ 1080p x 1.5 DSR. Characters in cutscenes seemed kinda stiff compared to the voice work.  The environments are somewhat varied, but I can't say the same about the enemies.There definitely needs to be more games like this that are affordable, well made, and provide some innovations to familiar genres.

												An awfully fun game.  The physics stuff is just generally fun to play with, and, I think, also contributed to the feeling of having a certain latitude in solving puzzles/problems--which is always nice.It's a pleasing game to look at and listen to, as well; seems pretty polished to me.  Maybe I'm easy to please, but I was also enjoying the story.  I was a little annoyed at the sequel hook--but only after I found out that (for various reasons) no sequel is forthcoming.  Don't let that deter you, though:  it's interesting and fun to play.  The fact that I'm annoyed that I can't buy and play the sequel because, apparently, it doesn't and won't exist ought to speak pretty well for the game.Also, it's one of those Linux ports that runs pretty well without much fuss.  Ran well for me, even on fglrx.			",181,44,1,27,24,1,32

I almost wish there were more!- The gravity controlling was cool- I liked how your weapons slowly improvedCons:- That ending man- Very basic cliched storyI'd say pick it up if you like your average platformer with action.I do not recall any jump scares.

It sounds like the DLC is much harder, but I've yet to play it. The physics feel solid, and controls are never in the way. I haven't been rushing through the game, but it seems to have a fair length and interesting story. Definitely a good game, and a good deal under 50% off.			",430,126,11,41,29,1,58

The physics-driven gameplay is well implemented and makes the game a joy to play; tossing and bouncing things around is fun, and the physics also allow for some emergent gameplay.The visuals are great, the music is stellar, and the characters are memorable.  The story also gets more and more interesting as you progress through the game.  The only real complaint I have is with the ending.  The game ends abrutply, and ties up none of the loose ends uncovered throughout the game, and leaves you with tons of questions.Still, Rochard is a fun, memorable game that I definitely recommend checking out.

												I picked up Rochard during the latest Humble Bundle sale not knowing anything about the game. I don't normally play platformers so I was a little skeptical that I'd enjoy it. After 1-2 minutes I was hooked (hah!) on this game. Firstly, the game looks great, the backgrounds are wonderfully done and the visuals always seem to be exactly right. As far as mechanics go, the gravity mechanics are flawlessly done. The puzzles are intuitive yet challenging. The combat mechanics/gun mechanics are also great. I played with a controller but I imagine that'd it'd be just as easy to use KB/M to play. Lastly, the voice acting and storyline are great. There's something definitely PG about the dialogue and the quests but you don't really care, you laugh along with Rochard's corny jokes and the campy dialogue. The only downside is not really a downside in my opinion; there's no sandbox mode, the zones are a tad short and I doubt the game has much replay value. This is not really a downside in my opinion insofar as not every game has to be an infinite task (Skyrim, Etc). This game starts and ends at just the right time, leaving you satisfied and you always seem to be perfectly frustrated when the game adds a new element to spice things up. This game is a breath of fresh air and likely unlike anything you currently have installed.			",107,25,0,18,5,0,5

The gameplay is pretty fun, how you can change the gravity of any area to help you through a puzzle, and the G-gun is cool to play around with, but the puzzles are very basic and easy and the combat is underdeveloped, for lack of a better word.

												Although the game overstays its welcome imo, it was a highly enjoyable experience from start to finish. What I mean is that when you start to get to the later levels it seems like it's never going to end. It seems like it lasted much longer than the 6 hours it took me to beat it. However I suppose that isn't entirely a bad thing because most games it seems are too short nowadays.Rochard takes a great idea and turns it into a great game. Your beam gun and eventually laser attack gun are a lot of fun to use to figure out puzzles. I never really found the game challenging. Pretty easy actually, but still fun. Most indie game purposely try to be hard it seems nowadays so having a fun casual experience was a welcome change. It isn't too super easy though. Some parts are a little challenging. The music is pretty good and the sound effects are good, and the voice acting is great. The effects are done well and the game looks really nice too. Overall it looks more like a AAA game than a indie game. If you want a real challenge get the hard times dlc. I tried it for a little bit and it has some challenging puzzles and stuff, but I got my fill with the main game and am moving on since I have a ton of other games to play through.Catch this on sale for a really fun time, 8/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												I like this game a whole bunch.  Rochard is a 2D physics-based puzzle-solving and combat game.  Nothing it's doing is entirely novel, but gameplay feels good and does a good job of co-opting Half-Life 2's gravity gun while mixing it with variable environmental gravity levels.  The weapons that you eventually acquire are satisfying, but combat is at its best when you use objects and enemies' weapons against them instead of attacking directly.  Likewise, puzzles are fairly straightforward but will sometimes surprise you.  There are a fair few very memorable moments throughout the game.The whole experience  is imbued with some pretty decent personality and humor; you've seen better characters and more comical narratives, but what's here certainly helps the game to stand out.  It's also filled with beautiful, atmospheric environments and scored with a gorgeous and diverse soundtrack.  Rochard is pretty delightful for its entire 6-odd hours; I definitely recommend it.

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It created little fanfare when it was released, and it hasn't gotten much publicity on Steam since, but it's a solid and entertaining little physics platformer. It starts off a little slow, with Rochard's abilities being quite limited, and the rock blaster barely able to fire 3 bolts in a row. By the end of the game, though, you will be zipping around in low gravity, blasting turrets in mid-air, while launching sticky bombs at enemies, and throwing their corpses at their friends. In the beginning, it might seem like combat is limited, but sweet merciful crap does it get fun by the end or what.The music is very well-done, although unfortunately you rarely ever hear it. The song that plays in the casino is amazing, and it made me glad that I bought the soundtrack version. The graphics are also well done, using the Unity engine, although some of the texture work is a little shoddy. The puzzles are also top-notch. There were only a few that genuinely stumped me for a while, but they all at least require thought and a little bit of planning. Sometimes I evem got the feeling that my solution was not the one the developers intended, and I love when I'm able to do that.Controls on the 360 gamepad are solid as well, for the most part. There were a few tricky sections where I needed to aim the right analog stick to the right while pressing A and holding down LT, though, which required a little digital (get it? fingers) acrobatics. I didn't have any real issues with it, but I could see it being a problem for some others. I imagine keyboard and mouse controls would work just as well, if not better, but this game seemed to scream ""360 CONTOLLER"" to me.The voice acting is really the only sore spot in this game (other than the hilariously flamboyant Skypolice), but as the tone of the game is less-serious, it came across more as funny than anything. Some of the dialog is pretty hilarious as well, but I won't spoil anything.Overall, I rather enjoyed this game. The gameplay didn't devolve into rote pattern memorization, the combat was very fast-paced and fun, the puzzles were clever, and the sound/music added to the whole experience.I recommend picking it up. It's a game that almost anyone can enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a puzzle game with only a handful of puzzles that actually feel like puzzles. Unfortunately, most of the game seems to be solving the simple tasks the game throws at you that require little thought or careful analysis. There are some fun quirks but they never really develop into anything significant. The graphics, like the puzzles, have their charm but don't really go anywhere, and the story is complete garbage.Is it the worst way to spend your time? No, and you might get some enjoyment out of it, but there are better places to spend your money and your time than this game.

												It's actually not bad, but it spends quite a while on a pretty useless story, which is told with quite corny jokes. The gameplay is solid, but not amazing and at times feels clunky. The level design isn't very elegant either, sometimes making you walk in circles as you missed a crate or something. And that's rather annoying, as the guy is walking and climbing rather slowly. There is a great game hidden in there somewhere, it's just a little too rough around the edges for my taste.Graphics and music are very, very nice though! If only the voice actors wouldn't overstress the southern accent that much...For a steam sale it's great and recommendable! Just don't expect wonders.			",259,69,10,31,37,2,40

												A rare game on my list I beat all the way through. It's a funny little adventure game that LOOKS like a metroidvania but is really just a left to right shooter which is sad in a way. Great variety of weapons, the puzzles and the combat and everything was fun, but the AI was so stupid sometimes I just skipped sections where I could have fought them. The story wasn't that good, a cliche mess really, but I enjoyed it if only for the main characters janitor hick voice and acting as if he's a high paid Brad Pitt action star. Not that the cutscenes were too long, if they were even that would have been tiresome before too long. Anyway it's a pretty good game that I beat over the course of a few months while taking some breaks from Dota.			",244,63,6,23,19,4,22

This game is pretty fun, with puzzles, different gadgets upgrades for your gravity controlling device, such as a grenade launcher upgrade, and also the story has a good depth in it and I especially enjoyed the ending of the game.

												I bought this as part of the Humble Bundle, and it is great fun! Highly recommend it. The game play is fun and the dialog between characters is hilarious!The puzzles are (so far) not all that challenging, but I'm sure it'll get more difficult as the game progresses.

												This game is awesome!!! I can't recommend it highly enough. The puzzles are challenging, the physics are fun, and the graphics are great. Rochard is a stupendous platform/puzzler and an all-around well-crafted game. Congrats to the developers!			",669,158,23,80,35,6,86

												It's a nice little physics 2.5D platformer. Not too hard and focused a bit more on action than puzzle-solving. While the character models themselves are nothing to write home about, the art design is competent, textures are clean and the soundtrack is quite cool combining blues and 80s retro sci-fi themes. However, the ending is bad, clearly setting up for a sequel that never materialized.The Hard Times DLC brings 4 harder puzzle oriented levels for those seeking a bit of an extra challenge without enemies.Overall, for me it was a 4/5.

												OK. Now. I have to say, I'm taken by this game. Imagine if you will, a fat, hairy, red neck (no offence meant BTW) trucker/miner, in space, billions of miles from Earth, and people are trying to kill him. This miner though, has brains and brawn, and a gravity gun that can shoot rocks to smithereens and a grenade launch capability. You'll be close to Rochard.I love the fact you have one handheld that not only covers a normal gun, grenade launcher, but also a gravity gun. You can utilise the items around you, using the gravity gun (normally cargo boxes) to either jump on, kill bad guys, duck under.. well, you get the idea?You can also control gravity, once you've located the gravity generators. Which makes for some fun light weight mahem. =) And some very high jumps.The graphics are smooth, bright, cartoony, and enjoyable to watch, the background has a nice movement about it when you're booling about, giving it a sense of depth and even the story line is alright, but definitely not to be taken seriously.The dialogue can be staid at times, and funny at others. Again, just don't take it too seriously.I have to admit, there's been a couple of times when I've had to scratch my head and actually think about how to solve a problem. Moving fuses though certain types of electric fields, or trying to avoid a large laser. Some of the puzzles are time based, like jumping from moving platform to moving platform, and I can imagine some people loosing their rag very easily.I've found, personally, that playing with mouse/keyboard much easier than a gamepad, as I feel I have more control with the mouse to move the gun about, but each player has their preferences overall.Musically, it's nice to listen to. The casino music is brilliant, and I wish I'd splashed out and got the soundtrack too, but, NVM.Overall, I'm glad I bought it, and I'm pretty sure you would too.10/10 in my books.

												So one day, as I was surfing through the store, I stumbled upon a sale on this game which was on sale. So I bought it. And I don't regret it. This game is pretty fun, with puzzles, different gadgets upgrades for your gravity controlling device, such as a grenade launcher upgrade, and also the story has a good depth in it and I especially enjoyed the ending of the game. Made me want to play more. The DLC helps add more hard puzzles to the game which require a lot of strategy and skill. It also has achievements for you to earn.

												This game is a fun little puzzle platformer. The puzzles themselves are on the easier side and once you figure out what you need to do, the platforming is not too difficult either. You will also be fighting enemies as often as you will be doing the former.I've played the game to the end and while the difficulty is rather easy, I still found it to be fun and quite satisfying to play. The Hard Times dlc promises to increase the difficulty and focus more on the puzzles and platforming, but as of this writing I have yet to give it try. Overall, if you're a fan of games like Trine you'll probably find this one enjoyable as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game was in my library for the longest without me having played it. So I did and what a nice delight. It's not a tough game, a relativly simple 2.5D sidescroller. Beat game in under five hours. Puzzles are fairly simple. You have one weapon the whole game which is progressivly upgraded. Story is average but there seems to be much more going on than alluded to. Obvious backstory. Characters are likeable enough. Main character is John Rochard and his two companions of a mining company.Game doesn't have much replayability but would play a sequel.Art style is fine, wish more could have been done with it.6.5/10			",167,42,1,14,9,0,18

												A really cool and fresh adventure where you are in control of John Rochard, the main character in the game, so join him and his crew to go through an interesting story (won't say anything else about the story, don't want to spoil it for you). In this game you will be able experience a few game genres; you have 2D platformer game mixed with action and puzzle solving. Most or some of puzzles require of out of the box thinking (i.e.: timely throwing boxes while there is no target to activate something...) Voice acting is quite descent and the soundtrack too. Controls are simple and you will probably get used to them quite fast. Even the DLC Hard times is really good, if you like puzzles.If you are down to experience something different to what you find the market, this is the game to go. So, what are you waiting for? get your G-Lifter now and help Rochard complete his quest!...			",161,7,1,11,3,0,4

												Great game, with a light but good story that fits the game play - which, by the way, is absolutely fantastic. You get a kind of a gun that allows you to manipulate objects at a distance, and you collect some new functionalities along the way. Puzzles include, but are not restricted to, placing boxes on the right places, using them as shield/cover, activate lasers and point them in the right way, turn on and off special walls that allow only objects or only the character through, fighting some baddies and jumping some platforms. It is a diverse and fun experience and includes serious challenges as extra levels, not for the faint of heart.			",260,126,2,30,28,1,49

												A rare game on my list I beat all the way through. It's a funny little adventure game that LOOKS like a metroidvania but is really just a left to right shooter which is sad in a way. Great variety of weapons, the puzzles and the combat and everything was fun, but the AI was so stupid sometimes I just skipped sections where I could have fought them. The story wasn't that good, a cliche mess really, but I enjoyed it if only for the main characters janitor hick voice and acting as if he's a high paid Brad Pitt action star. Not that the cutscenes were too long, if they were even that would have been tiresome before too long. Anyway it's a pretty good game that I beat over the course of a few months while taking some breaks from Dota.			",244,63,6,23,19,4,22

												A very short review after just over an hour of play. More to follow, but I want players to know about this game while it's still SO cheap.Amazing graphics, pretty good story, great voice acting, stellar music. This is a thinking player's game, heavily involving physics. Gravity, and gravity control is a big part of this game, and so far using gravity to place and throw objects is used instead of traditional weapons. I must say, squashing bad guys with huge, heavy boxes, or grav-throwing explosives at them is FAR more satisfying than just.....""bang"". (Nothing wrong with ""bang"". I LIKE ""bang"".) And to grab an errant robot with a gravity beam, then smash it rapidly against opposing walls is oddly....calming.If you typically avoid platformers, or like me, buy them expecting to fail, ""rochard"" may be your solution. Many, if not most, of the multitudinous puzzles seem to have more than one solution. One, the typical ""brute force"" sort, but also a much easier, more ""scientific"" one. Very good learning curve. Short, reasonable checkpoint intervals. AND a hero who looks and sounds much like so many of us! MOST importantly, this game is really a LOT of fuN!If PORTAL was a platformer, it just might be ""rochard"".At this price, WHILE it's this price, you owe it to yourself to at least take a look at the Store Page. What's to lose? $1.49 is all! ($2.09 with soundtrack & artbook.) At this price I have to give the HIGHEST possible recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a bad game at all, but it's not that good either; actually it's mediocre in every aspects. The graphics, sound design, story, gameplay (puzzles and action platformer), everything in the game is just ok, but nothing more. So it's not recommandable by me and I can say if you want a side scrolling action platformer go for Guacamelee or Rayman. If you want a puzzle platformer go for Braid, Limbo or Swapper. And if you want something completely different, then go for Fez. But if you think you have to try this game for whatever reason then be my guest. Everyone have the rights to try anything!!

Likewise the combat, Though there are a number of ways to dispatch your enemy. The story starts with a good basic premise, But not much is really done with it. And the collectibles are just kind of there.This is a fairly modest game with fairly modest results. It's presented in a ""light"" fashion and every thing is kept at a brisk pace.

												+Assets were good, voice acting was good enough-Made in Unity-Unispired gameplay-Unskipabble cutscenes (some were skippable but most are not)-Game was made for consoles, using mouse for aiming is bad and awkward (made for twinsticks).-I have seen only one enemy type so far, and level design follow a pattern that got me bored.-At one point i got the power node thingy stuck under a door, those physics door that i had to open and throw it through, almost made me quit since it was impossible to get the node back. (i ended up quitting 6 minutes later after rewinding some progress)-(Nitpicking) One of the two main mechanics of the game, changing the gravity is included in most part of the levels, most jumps you will do in the game, you will consistently press space and shift together as if they were a single button, this gets very awkward after a few minutes.-You can jump indefinitely by timing the gravity, jumping and grabbing a box.Conclusion: It is really bad as a game, but good assets and some good mechanics overall, but it just feels a lot unpolished and unispired.

												You play as a man who has to save his team and defeat the bad guy. You do this by solving puzzles and shooting guys.I really enjoyed it, and found it fun from start to end. The graphics are very pretty, the gameplay is wonderful.However, the story is ehh, and writing and VA are terrible, amusing at best. Lots of people may find the game too easy. Though, the developers saw this and made DLC, which is more challenging.If you can look past its flaws, you'll love this game.			",508,242,16,55,74,9,82

												I like the idea of being a space trucker as much as the next guy.  Hell, I even like the idea of flinging heavy crates around with a gravity gun.  Sounds pretty fun!  In Rochard however,  the whole thing just felt a bit flat for me.  Sure, the puzzle platformer idea is good one and Rochard plays with the idea pretty well early on.  It didn't take too long to come across some jumping puzzles that were just way to frustrating.  Though the game looked good and the physics seemed solid, I just didn't anything about it urging me to push on past the frustration. I may go back to it some day; the game wasn't horrible by anymeans.  With a giant summer sale back log though, there's other things to play.			",364,56,12,63,30,5,42

												A perfect game to get on sale. Take the gravity gun, and mix it was some 2D side scroll gameplay, and you get Rochard. It's actually pretty good, using the environment and going through the puzzles in question. While the music is non existant, excellent visual presentation, and a story that does the job is here, but is carried by the solid gameplay that does enough to mix it up. Worth a look.For more information and gameplay footage:

												This game was boring.  The puzzles were repetitive and slow.  The enemies ought to have been a puzzle setpiece, like portal's turrets were, but just ended up forming poorly made shooter segments.  The voice acting was terrible and the lip sync belonged back in the 90s.  Because of that and the terrible writing, none of the characters were the least bit likeable. Don't buy this game.

												A puzzle-platformer based around gravity and throwing boxes around.  It's a perfectly functional game, everything works well and I don't recall any glitches.  Unfortunately, that's as far as I can praise it.The puzzles start out very easy, and for the most part stay there.  There are some interesting mechanics, but they're never taken far enough to actually be interesting.  From beginning to end, you'll pretty much be solving the same few basic puzzles over and over again.  The gravity swinging is the best part of the game, but again it never goes beyond very basic use.  Combat is a chore.  Point at the enemies, hold the attack button.  If you're feeling daring, throw a crate.  It's very easy and serves no purpose other than to pad out the game.  Rochard, the titular character, is a space redneck working for a mining company.  The game tries to present him as some heroic badass, but he's mostly just annoying.  It doesn't help that he has a groupie/love interest following after him, singing his praises.  The villain is a short German guy, and the vast majority of the enemies you'll be slaughtering throughout the game are flamboyant homosexual stereotypes.  I don't consider any of this a spoiler, since from his very first appearance it is blatantly obvious that the German guy will turn out to be evil.  The game is functional.  A completely standard puzzle platformer that does nothing to stand out.  Puzzle-platformers are hardly in short supply these days; in a genre with so many excellent examples I really see no reason to ever play Rochard.The DLC is the best part of the game by far.  The puzzles are actually somewhat tricky.  But again, they never go beyond fairly basic and the whole thing is quite short.  Not worth buying or playing the game for.			",320,87,1,25,21,1,33

												Enjoyable gameplay, a ""story"" that is best just to skip every cut-scene of, and ultimately an experience that once it starts to pickup steam with fulfilling puzzles and somewhat dicy combat ends.

												It was an okay game. The story is a bit cheesy but I quite liked the combat and puzzles. It's a neat game to play every once in a while when you have time. I wouldn't recommend playing it through all at once as the gameplay does get repetitive. I could see people jumping in and spending a half an hour or more dozing off to kill time with it. It took me a total of 3 hours to finish across 3 days.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 3/5Gameplay: 3.5/5Challenge: 3/5Discovery: 2/5Replayability: 3/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 4/5Atmosphere: 2/5Music: -/5 (Don't remember.)

												Ever heard of this game? I hadn't. It was in my Steam list because I apparently got it from Humble Bundle 6. Well it looked like an action-y physics puzzle platformer (think Trine) and I like that kind of thing so I went ahead and launched it.  I'm glad I did!The game was enjoyable, accessible and pretty unique, mostly because there aren't a lot of entries in this genre. Despite the fact that the game flew under my radar, I found the art, effects and voice acting to be pretty top-notch for a game of this type. It's clear that the team loved about this game. It was short-ish, which is expected. About 6 hours. And the story has a fairly unique premise, but it gets kinda mucked up with some really stupid cliches. Despite that, I found Rochard himself to be the game's most lovable character. A rotund, twangy and kind space-miner. The game spends most of its time allowing you to use a Half-Life 2 style Gravity Gun in many of the same ways Half-Life 2 does, but with a few twists, such as pairing that concept with low-gravity, and solving larger-scale platforming puzzles. It's shameless, but still different.There's a lot of things that don't fit together with the game's theme... like how many people you actually end up just gunning down as cartoony cannon fodder... and the stupid native american mysticism subplot. Regardless of my complaints, I have nothing against Rochard and genuinely enjoyed my time with it.			",472,119,8,54,27,1,42

It's a short game, I finished it in a few hours, but it was well worth what I paid for it. There's some DLC available called Hard Time, which is a serious of VERY devious puzzle challenge levels.

I've worked with Unity and I was stunned by what the developers were able to accomplish! The game is fluid, well paced, and innovative in terms of physics and general gameplay. I particularily liked the ability to manipulate gravity whenever you want :PA true gem of a game and all I have left to say is, thanks again Tragikos! :D			",672,117,7,51,43,6,74

												Pretty solid game and good music. the challenges were easy for me but the DLC had a few extra levels which are a bit harder.Note to developers: After making a fair warning to wussies, please release some DLC with levels of punishing difficulty because you underestimate your puzzle-gamer crowd.

												A puzzle-platformer based around gravity and throwing boxes around.  It's a perfectly functional game, everything works well and I don't recall any glitches.  Unfortunately, that's as far as I can praise it.The puzzles start out very easy, and for the most part stay there.  There are some interesting mechanics, but they're never taken far enough to actually be interesting.  From beginning to end, you'll pretty much be solving the same few basic puzzles over and over again.  The gravity swinging is the best part of the game, but again it never goes beyond very basic use.  Combat is a chore.  Point at the enemies, hold the attack button.  If you're feeling daring, throw a crate.  It's very easy and serves no purpose other than to pad out the game.  Rochard, the titular character, is a space redneck working for a mining company.  The game tries to present him as some heroic badass, but he's mostly just annoying.  It doesn't help that he has a groupie/love interest following after him, singing his praises.  The villain is a short German guy, and the vast majority of the enemies you'll be slaughtering throughout the game are flamboyant homosexual stereotypes.  I don't consider any of this a spoiler, since from his very first appearance it is blatantly obvious that the German guy will turn out to be evil.  The game is functional.  A completely standard puzzle platformer that does nothing to stand out.  Puzzle-platformers are hardly in short supply these days; in a genre with so many excellent examples I really see no reason to ever play Rochard.The DLC is the best part of the game by far.  The puzzles are actually somewhat tricky.  But again, they never go beyond fairly basic and the whole thing is quite short.  Not worth buying or playing the game for.			",320,87,1,25,21,1,33

												Good grief, this game is dull.  The ""puzzles"" were easily solved within moments, making the actual execution the longest part.  Combat is easy and the enemy AI is moronic.  The story is dull and you can see the ""twists"" coming from several miles away.  I managed to eke out a little bit of extra entertainment by finishing the puzzles in non-optimal ways, but even that wore thin quite quickly.  Seriously, don't burn your money on this.  There are much better puzzle games out there.			",30,4,0,11,7,0,15

												Wow. I did not expect this game to deliver everything it did. 'Rochard' is a side-scrolling platformer with many neat puzzles and a surprisingly engaging story. It's a 2D game set inside a 3D environment, which looks great. The sound quality is also top notch, with both great tunes and voice acting. You get to grab a toy as cool as a Portal gun, and go on an adventure in space like Ratchet and Clank. However, this remarkable title is also a bit on the short side, and space cowboys should also be aware that the game ends -SPOILER ALERT!!!- on a pretty sudden cliffhanger.			",267,92,12,41,14,3,38

												I was a bot conflicted about whether to give this a positive or negative review, the story, artwork and music were fine without being particularly interesting, the voice acting and writing slightly better than this. The game threatened to introduce meaningful new mechanics but each new mechanic was only required a couple of times and then it was the same enemy, small obstacle, repeat. Not challenging enough in terms of platforming, combat or puzzles.Having said this, I did enjoy the game a bit and jumping on enemies/ crushing them with crates never got old! but by the end I couldn't wait to finish the game.

												I'm being a bit unforgiving here - It's not a BAD game at all and a lot has been done right. Sounds and graphics are nice, controls are sharp, and game itself can be addictive. That being said, the whole game feels extremely formulated and generic. The puzzles are very basic and easy. The plot, as well as the conversations during the game are boring. As an example these are some of the lines heard during the final battle ""You are insignificant"", ""You simply cannot win"", ""What are you doing! The disc is MINE"". A lot SCREAMS cliche about this game.			",99,30,5,8,8,0,15

												MFW this game seems to be awful.... tutorial was amusing, and set me up to realize the extremely twichy gravity controls would be ""fun"" for the rest of the game, when you're trying to bend physics to your will and it's lauging histerically as you try to just PUT A BOX DOWN WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO.  The first real level then sets up a puzzle that is possible to fail where you need to bring boxes up from floor to floor to continue using them to climb to the NEXT floor... However, if you fall, then uh oh, you no longer have access to the boxes you brought up with you to the now unreachable next floor.  When I restarted that level, sections that required low gravity no longer had low gravity, and so the level was unplayable.  FUN.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lags alot; but it seems to be rather interesting.Upd0:  Is there aâ¦ spoon?  You can't see any pointer, although you feel like there is one, invisible to you but it's something you have to take into account when you claim you got eagle's eye. Aiming may seem innatural, unlike the colours and 3D-effects, kinetics and animations. If you play it not with a crap PC, it looks good, and you immerse.  Thinking with Alyx?  Yes, the very old Gravity Gun concept, as seen in HL2+ and Portal. All the same thing plus much more, handy and deadly. Satisfaction guaranteed, your enemy won't tell you Â«I didn't like the box you threw into my head!Â» â all delivered in time, no survival, no complaints!   Nanocosmic?!You think it's like a box of matches in size? Hahah, it loads pretty long, and it's annoying when you die in less than a minute and stare that gun whirling sometimes for even longer period than you played before you failed. Yes, you have to watch out and do your best, but WTF? Are you sure it should take so long to load?But the overall is a rock hard four mark.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything that's initially great about Rochard wears thin surprisingly fast. The mechanics are good, but the puzzles never get terribly complicated - you'll solve them faster than it takes to execute them and the subpar shooting sequences are over-stressed.Rochard's best facet is its humor and ability to lampoon the sci-fi genre. That's why it's so unfortunate when it trades its more heartfelt humor in halfway through. What does it trade it for? A series of racist tropes denigrating Native Americans. The shift makes no sense and it becomes severely uncomfortable very quickly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story-heavy side scrolling box/gravity puzzle game with shooting & platforming elements. Most of the game is pretty easy except for the last 30 mins when it becomes combat heavy. This game might be worth picking up if it weren't for the recycled environments (backtracking to previous locations), ancient aliens, and possibly the worst ending ever. At around 4 hours tops I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you get it in a bundle.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Two fish and a gallon ziplock bag of grapefruit juice out of walking through a fog with a flashlight.Not the greatest game I've ever played. Rochard did bring its own flare to the genre of sidescrollers it wasn't enough to keep it from being a bit of a dull game. I did enjoy playing with the gravity and solving some of the puzzle presented. The puzzles weren't really challenging and in the end forgettable. After one point in the game you are given an item that makes the game entirely too easy that it isn't even a challenge and in result a real bore. The story is alright I guess, but the script was uncomfortable to hear and left me cringing and shaking my head ""why?â.  All in all I don't recommend.			",54,22,0,4,2,0,3

												Fun mechanics, good graphics, good music, good saving saving you the time of redoing challenges. Didn't encounter any bugs either, and the levels were well designed. A bit too easy, though. The DLC Hard Times is a better challenge, requiring more finesse and creative solutions, but still not too difficult. Particularly coming from The Swapper it was very easy.That said, why is the only female character (yet again) a helpless victim that drives the white male protagonist forward? Come on, be a little more creative!			",267,60,7,46,18,1,53

												Really cool and addictive puzzle game. The trailer gives the impression that this is an action platformer but it's more about using the Half Life gravity gun, to solve puzzles, such as stacking boxes and pulling fuses ( that power force fields and lasers ). It's a casual puzzle game, kind of like The Swapper meets Limbo but much easier.			",150,37,1,25,12,0,43

												The gravity mechanics were nothing new, the combat was more frustrating rather than fun against brain-dead baddies, and the non-existent story was trite and predictable. Overall, it turned rather meh after a while, but...considering it was made in 2011, give it a shot if side-scrolling platformers are your thing. I just couldn't be bothered to finish it.

												Rochard makes a great first impression, then completely fails to live up to it. The blues music, gravity-manipulating gameplay, and Metroidvania-esque exploration of the opening quickly give way to a tired plot, repetitive puzzles, and a soundtrack that sounds like it could be pulled from any sci-fi game or movie without having any personality of its own. Worst of all, the game ends its generic, uninspired story with a cliffhanger for a sequel that may never materialize-not that I can say I'd be all that keen to play it if it ever did. There's good stuff in Rochard, and if you don't care about the things I've mentioned, you may like it, but I can't say I enjoyed it enough to recommend it to anyone.			",55,36,2,11,2,0,4

												Rochard isn't worth your time. Not only does the game end on a cliffhanger (in the odd case you actually wanted to know what happens) but the gameplay is ..poor. Its slow paced, with not much action until later when the levels are just filled with respawning enemies and the like. The voice acting is sub-par but its tolerable. The music can be nice and sometimes even the game is interesting...but then you enter areas where you have to do stupid gravity puzzles and such. In the end the game suffers from too many problems with the gameplay to be worth it. Sorry to say, Rochard is a southern space miner you should try to avoid.			",310,54,5,32,26,3,47

												Rochard is a 2.5D side-scrolling action platformer in the same vein as various Metroid games.I honestly don't have a whole lot to say about this game. Its a fun little game with an interesting story, colorful graphics, and good music. The game doesn't have any crippling bugs that I ever noticed, and the upgrade system is similar to Metroid.Definitely worth a buy.If you like this review, please have a look at my other reviews.

Inbetween said jokes, there's rants about how the Illuminati and the Freemasons conspired with the Reptoids to get the flouride in the water so they could orchestrate 9/11 IT'S ALL CONNECTED MAAAAN WAKE UP SHEEPLE. And then there's a funny joke about Twitter and then THE GREYS AND THE NATIVE AMERICANS ARE FROM SPACE MAN DON'T YOU SEE IT'S ALL CONNECTED MAN. What I'm saying is that it's a pleasant game with a CRAZY NONSENSE PLOT.Also the guards in Skyrig all sound like stereotypical effeminate hairdressers. This is the game's best attempt at trying to be HILARIOUS. Every joke in this game falls â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FLAT.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Overall Score: 6/10My advice: If you're new to puzzle platformers, or you're itching for a puzzle fix, get it for around $5.Genre:  Puzzle PlatformerAs creative as this game seems, I wish it had tried to push harder on a few fronts. The story is interesting enough. You're Rochard, a backwater space miner who's down on his luck trying to bring his mining company to new sources of fuel. When they do finally strike the motherlode, Rochard and the crew discovers their find is far more valuable than they anticipated.Unfortunately, from that point, the story is pretty flat and predictable. The mechanics behind moving your 'weapon' are neat, and using anti-gravity in combination with moving heavy objects around is pretty seamless and fluid. Unfortunately, the puzzles are quite easy, but they did rectify some of this with the cheap DLC. Voice acting isn't half bad, nor is the music, but it's still not enough to get me to recommend this game to anyone but true puzzle fans.			",455,127,7,69,23,6,41

												I originally bought this game because I wanted to kill some time and fancied the idea of playing a good old fashioned 2D platformer. What I actually discovered is that there is far more to Rochard  than initially meets the eye. At its core, Rochard is actually a puzzle game. The puzzles centre around John Rochard's unusual weapon the ""G-Lifter"". This gun is capable of some unsual gravity defying abilities that Rochard must utilise in order to save the day. If you are looking for a fun and original platformer with a good sense of humour and some killer physics effects, then look no further!			",68,26,1,4,7,0,9

												I love the visuals on this game, very stylish. That's the best thing about this game though.The story is terrible, terrible, terrible. The characters are likable and you can even get attached to them, which is always good in a story, but the plot seems like it was written by a child or someone on drugs. Makes no sense. You think things will eventually be explained but nope, never happens.The game mechanics is interesting and well implemented. The game managed to be sufficiently entertaining for me to play through the entire thing, but just barely! the combat has some nice depth to it, with several ways to take the enemies out you're always trying new thing. The puzzles are boring. It follows the half life school of puzzle design, where attaching an extension cord to turn a machine on counts as solving a puzzle. There's no real challenge in that department.			",261,47,6,12,14,1,10

												I originally bought this game because I wanted to kill some time and fancied the idea of playing a good old fashioned 2D platformer. What I actually discovered is that there is far more to Rochard  than initially meets the eye. At its core, Rochard is actually a puzzle game. The puzzles centre around John Rochard's unusual weapon the ""G-Lifter"". This gun is capable of some unsual gravity defying abilities that Rochard must utilise in order to save the day. If you are looking for a fun and original platformer with a good sense of humour and some killer physics effects, then look no further!			",68,26,1,4,7,0,9

												An action platformer with the gravity gun and control over gravity. The gameplay is fun, and straightforward with collecting new upgrades to expand your options. The story isn't anything special, just some poor motivations to go from one level to the next, so it's pretty ignorable. The game is actually pretty short, as 3-4 hours is definitely enough to beat it as long as your not going for every collectable doodad, and even then it doesn't anything else going for it to make you want to play it again. Overall it's a well polished game, entertaining for a few hours, and a great example for Unity developers to see a finished commercial game made with the engine.			",264,52,5,16,12,0,20

												This game is kind of like Trine: a platformer with a good amount of fighting and some physics puzzles thrown in. Okay, physics is actually a major gameplay element in fights as well as in puzzle-solving: you get to switch between normal and low gravity, and your main weapon is basically the gravity gun from Half-Life.The visuals and audio aren't as shiny and rich as Trine, instead going (successfully) for a more clean look and feel. Still, the game features Jon St. John (Duke Nukem!) hamming it up as Rochard, and the main theme is done by Poets of the Fall, and everything fits together quite well, with nothing out of place.The story doesn't take itself too seriously - suffice to say it's your traditional sci-fi action movie stuff.And there's just something so satisfying in taking out lots of enemies with what's essentially a power tool while hopping all over the place in low gravity.

												I had fun.The mechanics of the game were nicely taught to the player, given as an upgrade as an aid when it was required.The gameplay was very solid, but also very easy. I had no pressure of losing at any time due to regenitive health and how you can abuse carrying cover with you.I found the story and cinematic to be very subpar. The voice acting was quite a turn off, as the choice of words during cut scenes were weak and unrealistic. I also found the generic Skypolice voice to be strange and somewhat silly in the last half of the game. I'm not sure if it was intentional.The last boss battle/climax of the game was a huge let down. I expected some form of a megaboss puzzle to conclude Rochard, but no. What I got was a simple- shoot grenades here and then shoot grenades at the boss to win.Overall the most important thing was that I had fun. I had honest to god fun playing this game.I recommend to eventually try it out, but don't kill yourself to get it, wait for a sale.			",213,18,0,10,7,0,6

""Maybe I just don't like games anymore"" I thought and then I stumbled upon this game and played it night after night until I had beat it. The story is nothing to write home about but it provides a sense of urgency and purpose all the way through. The voice acting, sound design and art are all top notch but the real star is the level design. I love games that have muliple solutions to puzzles and can be played with many different playing styles. A+			",16,14,0,2,0,0,2

												I can't say I've played many games based entirely on their theme song, but Rochard is one of them. Thankfully I ended up satisfied with my time with the game.

Rochard is a sidescrolling platform, action, and puzzle game. You take control of a miner on a distant asteroid that has had little luck finding resources. Your team stumbles upon an important artifact that your boss hurries to investigate when pirates attack and things go awry.The story is pretty thin, and while they seemed to get the space redneck Rochard just right, some later Native American themes felt pretty out of place. I emphasize the story, setting, and characters so much because that damn theme song sold me so hard. I'm a sucker for space cowboy antics.Rochard, the protagonist and player-controlled character, uses a mining gun to pull objects close to him, shoot them away, and eventually shoot lasers and bombs. Throughout most of the game, Rochard is able to alter the gravity of the level, which becomes second-nature and part of the player's elegant jumps, swings, and attacks. It's fun to take on enemies by dropping boxes on their heads while leaping gracefully over a platform. There are collectibles for people who want to test the limits of their abilities, too. I didn't bother with every one, but I liked the additional challenges.If you're like me, you got this game from a Humble Bundle a while back and never gave it a try. If anything I shared here interests you, load it up! I enjoyed my several hours with the game.			",106,46,0,9,8,3,17

												I don't really know how to make a case for this game, but I don't think it's bad.  You play a redneck asteroid miner with a physgun and solve puzzles in order to save your friends and uncover a native-american-alien-conspiracy whatever along the way.  The plot doesn't really go anywhere and the ending might as well have just said ""Congratulations, you did the thing, the end.""  However, the production values are extremely nice for an indie game.  The voice acting is great, the game opens with an awesome song by Poets of the Fall, and the graphics and art are visually pleasing.  However, I get the feeling that this is probably the reason why the developers have been MIA for about two years (as of late 2015).  The link to the game's official website is dead, as are the social media accounts associated with Recoil Games, and although they talked on Facebook about their desire for a sequel, they said that they didn't have the money to make one.  So you should probably not expect any sort of closure unless they suddenly make a kickstarter.The game itself is an indie puzzle platformer (if those three words in sequence turned you off, this is easily the least pretentious indie game I've ever played) with a focus on gravity, so imagine a 2D version of Half-Life 2's physics puzzles with a button that lowers gravity.  It's pretty fun for what it is and it nicely kept my attention for five hours, so I'd say it's worth saving for a rainy day if you got it in a bundle like I did.			",142,23,1,15,5,1,5

												I got this for $1.50 in the last sale which is a ridiculous price for a great little game. Each area you enter is a little physics puzzle to be sorted out using a combination of your gravity gun/blaster and your brain. There's some kind of story involving a power sauce and ancient native American mumbo jumbo that I barely paid attention to.Game length is just about right. Any game that lets me throw enemies around with a grav gun gets my thumbs up. ",115,20,6,7,11,1,18

												The Good:UpgradesDecent game length given priceFun platformingThe Bad:Silly, cliche storyIf you're using a controller, aiming while jumping will feel unnaturalWould you like to play the role of a fat, gruff space miner in a 2D platformer with an upgradable grapple gun and anti-gravity fun? If you have answered ""yes"" to this, then I recommend this game for you! Rochard (not pronounced ""rock-hard"" to my dismay) is a nice little platformer with multiple ways to deal with enemies/platforming. Throw some hidden collectibles into the mix and you have a pretty decent game. The story is dumb, but dumb-charming at times. Worth a playthrough for Firefly fans, platforming fans, and construction workers.			",254,60,4,39,13,3,29

												Rochard is just about my favorite puzzle-platformer of all time (though now it has to share that honor with The Swapper).  This game pretty much fell through the cracks when it was released, and it's a shame, because it's a delightful pleasure almost all the way through.  The main mechanic is a special gun which gives the hero (John Rochard, a working-class stiff beautifully voice-acted by Jon St. John) the power to grab things at a distance (like the gravity gun from Half Life 2), control gravity, swing himself into the air, toss people around (eventually) and so on.  The gun also can be used as a gun, and the main weakness of the game is an occasional overreliance on straight combat instead of puzzle-solving.  However, eventually you learn to combine both fighting and environment manipulation while playing, and then the game is serious fun.  It's also light enough and short enough for casual gamers (like me). I wish enough people would play this so we could get a sequel.			",67,27,1,2,9,0,21

												I had little interest in this game before its appearance in the Humble Indie Bundle, but much to my surprise it ended up being extremely fun. A combination platformer/puzzle game, it incorporates intuitive physics and gravity mechanics that really raise the gameplay to a new level. The story isn't too impressive, and seems rather stunted, but that's ameliorated some by the setting, which is delighfully reminiscent of the first Starcraft's blue-collar spacefaring culture. Lastly, due mainly to unfortunate timing and the PSN collapse of last year, the company behind this game nearly died, and a game this innovative deserves a purchase if only to keep them afloat.

The puzzles are tricky, but not impossible and how you resolve some certain situations can go any number of ways. The addition of force fields that block certain types of objects (organic (you+enemies), blasts, inanimate objects, really adds to the puzzle appeal. While picking up upgrades later for a blaster of your own and even a grenade launcher add to the smash it up feel.Definitley worth picking up on sale to play on a casual Sunday.

												Overall Score: 6/10My advice: If you're new to puzzle platformers, or you're itching for a puzzle fix, get it for around $5.Genre:  Puzzle PlatformerAs creative as this game seems, I wish it had tried to push harder on a few fronts. The story is interesting enough. You're Rochard, a backwater space miner who's down on his luck trying to bring his mining company to new sources of fuel. When they do finally strike the motherlode, Rochard and the crew discovers their find is far more valuable than they anticipated.Unfortunately, from that point, the story is pretty flat and predictable. The mechanics behind moving your 'weapon' are neat, and using anti-gravity in combination with moving heavy objects around is pretty seamless and fluid. Unfortunately, the puzzles are quite easy, but they did rectify some of this with the cheap DLC. Voice acting isn't half bad, nor is the music, but it's still not enough to get me to recommend this game to anyone but true puzzle fans.			",455,127,7,69,23,6,41

												Great little game that came out of nowhere! Seriously. I didn't even know of it's existence until there was a Steam sale for it! Anyways, Rochard is a side scrolling action/puzzle game with humor, physics, gravity guns, explosives, and a great art style. Imagine Half-Life 2's gravity gun in side scrolling action, that also shoots and launches grenades! My only 2 gripes is that it does not have built in AA (O NOES, JAGGIES!), and it's short. I mean, there's even an achievement to beat it in under 3 hours! But this game is totally worth picking up! Check out the demo!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was the Space Debris music in the trailer that sold this game to me. So having just bought the Soundtrack Edition of the game, I listened through the soundtrack first before playing the game. Yes, Space Debris is such a great track, but the rest of the soundtrack certainly didn't disappoint either; from the '90's 'Independence Day' feel of John's Theme, to the excellent Tangerine Dream techno-ambience of The Fight, the Rochard OST is so enjoyable from start to finish..........so what about the game itself?Rochard is a light-hearted physics-based side scroller set in a future-grunge world of space mining. Playing as John Rochard, you use your grapple gun and anti-grav physics to overcome environmental obstacles and enemies.The production of Rochard is top-notch and the physics superbly done. The game starts off easy enough and the first couple of levels act as tutorials easing the player into the physic-based system of the game. It's too early for me to say how the game pans out, but I think it's hardly going to disappoint from what I've experienced so far. Great characters and enjoyable cut-scenes, I'm genuinely looking forward to spending more time with John Rochard & friends.Edit:As it turned out, Rochard was an immensely enjoyable game from start to finish. The game was lean with no padding. Checkpoints were frequent and positioned so there was rarely any grind to get a previous position after dying. The length of the game was also satisfying, never threatening to outstay its welcome.Playing with a PS3 controller (360 mapped), the controls were very responsive and satisfying. There was also a good balance between combat and physics-based puzzles.There are Gold badges to collect throughout the game. They don't contribute to any weapon upgrades, etc, but are positioned in the levels to add extra challenge for the obsessive collector. After beating the game, I find I can select individual levels to find badges I've missed which adds to the replay value. I'll probably enjoy playing through Rochard a couple of more times whilst patiently waiting for Episode II.Addictive gameplay, tight controls, challenging puzzles (never too hard), varied combat, collectables, cute characters with a great central eponymous hero: 9/10.

												Rochard's a solid game with solid mechanics that are really fun if you enjoy puzzle platformers. The world and characters at first are very fun and engaging, but there's a lot of little things that really bug me about it. The plot is interesting but it's theming through mechanics is really poor and I ended up feeling really bad after killing the 70ish to 89th flamboyant cop or stupid pirate. If it's on sale 2 dollars is really good value for a solid gameplay experience, but the plot is just compelling enough to be really dissapointing and the ending feels like a stupid sequel bait that felt like an insult for playing. I would reccomend trying other puzzle platformers before playing this such as the Trine Series or Thomas Was Alone.			",197,56,1,29,9,2,20

												Rochard is a simple, yet different kind of puzzle platformer. The twist is, that the main character wields a neat gravity gun, which (besides shooting stuff) allows him to control gravity and lift distant objects.Each room has a small puzzle or challenge, which needs to be solved before advancing. The puzzles are not very difficult, but are never so patronisingly easy that they ruin the game. Additionally, even if the core concept is simple, they manage to keep it interesting by changing the setting, adding different puzzles (a variety of force fields, low gravity, reverse gravity, electric fields, shielded enemies, improving weaponry with new features etc.).Speaking of enemies, they can be taken out in a variety of ways, such as dropping heavy stuff on them, pushing them into electric surfaces, manipulating giant mining lasers to cut them into pieces, throwing malfunctioning robots at them, or just plain shooting holes in them.The story is simple, but the nature of the boisterous main character makes it interesting and fun.

												As side scrollers go I really enjoy this game.  It is nothing ground breaking, but it does have some fun brain teasers.  It seems to me that the game is designed just to be a fun side scroller, nothing more, nothing less.  The story line is actually pretty decent for a game like this and with some major voice talant (Jon St. John aka Mr. Duke Nukem!) as the main character.  A game well worth buying and as I mentioned in my previous review the sound track in this game is AMAZING.  Buy this game, but when you do buy it with the sound track too!			",628,135,22,96,75,4,168

												Rochard is a puzzle game with shooting elements. You have a gun that has a functions like: move crates, other objects with  the gravity ray, shoot stuff with the laser gun and later on you get different sorts of explosives. The graphics and sound effect are nice. The game never gets frustrating = the solution to each level is doable.The game play reminds me of Trine but then with one character and in a science fiction setting.So I recommend it but for me it has little replay value.

												This game is under rated. And really fun. Its a 2D puzzle platformer with a little combat. But its so much more. The puzzle dynamic isn't very hard core like Braid, and is not at all frustrating. The combat at times is challenging, however the checkpoint system will allow you to experiment. The story is a little weak (especially with the way the game concludes teasing a Rochard 2) but the voice acting is really good and makes you care about the world. The soundtrack is stunning both in game and out, and the sound design is pretty decent with its audio ques. I played this game with an PS4 pad and it is probably the most responsive game i have played using a controller. I highly recomend this game to anyone looking to play a platformer that isn't too long.Note - If you are visually impared, you can play this game. There is a bit of text when identifying interactable objects within each level, but it really isn't important. There is also a color dynamic which may be a little tricky, but not tricky enough for you to just figure out. Also in a couple of levels the camera zooms out a little too much, so playing this on a small screen may bbe a little tricky. The art style provides plenty of contrast for you to distinguish your position in each level, and the audio ques are good.			",265,65,5,28,12,1,28

												I had little interest in this game before its appearance in the Humble Indie Bundle, but much to my surprise it ended up being extremely fun. A combination platformer/puzzle game, it incorporates intuitive physics and gravity mechanics that really raise the gameplay to a new level. The story isn't too impressive, and seems rather stunted, but that's ameliorated some by the setting, which is delighfully reminiscent of the first Starcraft's blue-collar spacefaring culture. Lastly, due mainly to unfortunate timing and the PSN collapse of last year, the company behind this game nearly died, and a game this innovative deserves a purchase if only to keep them afloat.

												Well, to be fair, it has tons of nice puzzles, most needs you to have a sense of physics. But while I had to re-tried some stages many times, I don't find this game's puzzle hard. Luckily, the game has a new mode which offers HELLISH puzzles, and BAM!, this game is nice, you should buy it.Honestly, this game will suck you in with nice atmosphere music for you to enjoy solving puzzle, You could also enjoy the story, if you can. I find the ending suck , waiting for the next game.Meanwhile, you could spend your tons of free times in this game and feel brilliand about it.			",441,166,9,77,61,5,94

To me, this was indeed challenging, and fun/entertaining. And being puzzle game, it has its benefits.What i also liked was Rochards voice, dunno why, it was bit like ''yankee''Also, i highly recommend hard times DLC, even thought it was bit short, and less-than-excpected-challenging. Only con  was found in DLC, and that was shortness/lack of doing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Get this game. I got it in a Humble Bundle, and I found it really enjoyable. Although I was skeptical of it at first, the puzzles were hard enough to be enjoyable, and the gameplay was unique enough to be entertaining. This is one of the few games which I have bothered to beat in its entireity (expect for two achievments, one of which I think I deserve but the game glitched...).In fact, I beat the game, but when the DLC came out I was excited enough that I promptly bought that and beat it despite not having played the game in a while. It may not give you as much replay as some other games, but it is definitely worth playing, esspecially if you can snag it on a sale.			",52,7,0,7,5,0,14

												I was sceptical at first, by the trailers there seemed a lot of fantasy action with lots of flashy explosions - not the kind of believable - but after playing and finishing it i can say it's a very solid world which feels just right, The difficulty gradually rises but you almost never have to think outside of things you're used to in real life. Puzzles don't make you believe something impossible. there's much logic. The storyline is immersive and rewarding if you listen all the dialogue. Lots of humour here.			",83,27,24,3,1,0,1

												Rochard is a very nice platformer game in which you play as John Rochard, a miner. He has a gravity gun that can move objects, and he is also able to manipulate gravity. Through the levels you have to kill some bad guys and use your skill and gun wisely (especially in the Hard Times DLC).For me, Rochard is an interesting and awesome mix of Half Life 2 (because of the gravity gun), Portal and Constant C, all of which I really enjoyed playing.So yeah, I would recommend it to everyone, who loves this genre or the games mentioned above.

												An action platformer with the gravity gun and control over gravity. The gameplay is fun, and straightforward with collecting new upgrades to expand your options. The story isn't anything special, just some poor motivations to go from one level to the next, so it's pretty ignorable. The game is actually pretty short, as 3-4 hours is definitely enough to beat it as long as your not going for every collectable doodad, and even then it doesn't anything else going for it to make you want to play it again. Overall it's a well polished game, entertaining for a few hours, and a great example for Unity developers to see a finished commercial game made with the engine.			",264,52,5,16,12,0,20

												I originally bought this game because I wanted to kill some time and fancied the idea of playing a good old fashioned 2D platformer. What I actually discovered is that there is far more to Rochard  than initially meets the eye. At its core, Rochard is actually a puzzle game. The puzzles centre around John Rochard's unusual weapon the ""G-Lifter"". This gun is capable of some unsual gravity defying abilities that Rochard must utilise in order to save the day. If you are looking for a fun and original platformer with a good sense of humour and some killer physics effects, then look no further!			",68,26,1,4,7,0,9

												Fun game! Action puzzle platformer with gameplay reminiscent of Trine, but in a sci-fi setting, and a weird plot about Native Americans encountering... well, I'll let you find out. But the plot is decidedly secondary to the pretty 2.5 D graphics and solid gameplay, featuring some unique and fun puzzles and decent combat. Not a super long game, but the Hard Times bonus content should help if you need more. I encountered some stability issues, my understanding is Unity and Avast do not always play nice, but for me they were annoying but not a deal breaker. Worth it on sale for sure.			",97,5,0,2,3,1,1

												TLDR - Fun little platformer with an interesting game mechanic.  Definitely worth it when on sale, maybe not quite at regular price.It's not very long, and it generally is pretty easy, but it's well-made, has interesting mechanics, and is overall quite fun.  I found the ""ancient Native American legend"" bit of the storyline a little goofy, but that doesn't detract too much from the enjoyment of the game as a whole.  The look and feel of the design is great, the voice acting is quite good, and the music is enjoyable.Some might find the game too easy, but I like the feeling that I am making progress, so it didn't bother me that much.  It is a little short, but that just means that I enjoyed it enough to want more.  It's short enough that I'm not sure I would have paid full price for it, but on sale it was absolutely worth the money.My biggest complaint actually has to do with the ending - if you die, the game has you restart from the last checkpoint, which works well throughout most of the game.  In the final battle, however, the last checkpoint comes before the fight starts, before the villain does his stereotypical villain monologue in a cut scene.  And there is no way to skip that cut scene.  I died several times before beating the final boss, which means that I had to sit and listen to that monologue over and over, punching buttons and hitting keys in hopes of skipping the damn thing.  Oddly, the same thing happens when the final credits begin to roll.  You had better enjoy that theme song, because you are going to have to listen to the whole thing - I could find no way of skipping the credit sequence.Overall, however, I quite enjoyed Rochard.  If you enjoy a good indie platformer with a heavy dose of puzzle solving, I recommend it, especially on sale.			",91,18,1,11,9,1,8

												This game is kind of like Trine: a platformer with a good amount of fighting and some physics puzzles thrown in. Okay, physics is actually a major gameplay element in fights as well as in puzzle-solving: you get to switch between normal and low gravity, and your main weapon is basically the gravity gun from Half-Life.The visuals and audio aren't as shiny and rich as Trine, instead going (successfully) for a more clean look and feel. Still, the game features Jon St. John (Duke Nukem!) hamming it up as Rochard, and the main theme is done by Poets of the Fall, and everything fits together quite well, with nothing out of place.The story doesn't take itself too seriously - suffice to say it's your traditional sci-fi action movie stuff.And there's just something so satisfying in taking out lots of enemies with what's essentially a power tool while hopping all over the place in low gravity.

												Steam is full of indie puzzle platformers, and this is one of the best.  The primary gameplay is mixing gravity manipulation with shooting, and it works very well.  The production values on this game are very high.  It's fully voiced, has a polished artistic style, was completely bug free for me and the physics engine worked very smoothly.  However, there are some negatives.  First, the game ends on a cliffhanger.  The developer has talked about a sequel, but none has been announced.  Second, and more imporant, is the fact that the game utilizes some unfortunate stereotypes.  For example, there is a Native American character - he runs a casino and has feathers in his hair.  Also, some of the bad guys have pronounced lisps, like a stereotypical American gay accent.  This really ruined what I thought was an otherwise perfect game.  The developer is Finnish, so they may not have realized the cultural implications, but that's not much of an excuse.			",986,387,42,147,125,12,216

												An absolute gem of a game, not a perfect gem, a bit chipped but I loved it !PROS:-One of the greatest intro in any indie game i've played.-Grinder's Blues. Go look it up on Youtube. it deserves a place in the PROS.-Awesome Graphics-Great voice acting-Fun and addicting gameplay-Fantastic Atmosphere and Soundtrack-Fun little storyMIDDLE GROUND:-Animations can be a bit weird during the cutscenes and the context of the cutscene. Not enough of a problem for me to put it in the CONS.CONS:-Very short game (took me less than 5 hours to complete)-Not enough complicated puzzles (only one made me scratch my head)-Disappointing endingWould love to see a sequel but sadly... I don't think it'll happen			",110,12,5,17,3,0,7

												I got this game during the last summer sale and am quite glad I did. It's a really fun game with great mechanics.  The gameplay is smooth and the puzzles, while not incredibly difficult, do make you think them through.  I made the mistake of playing with an xbox controller which turned out to be a bad idea.  The aiming controls with it were quite difficult to get precise.  Not a game ender, but more of a frustration.  After I had beat the game I decided to try the keyboard and mouse.  MUCH easier to aim with and I'd recommend using them instead of a controller.  All in all, this game was worth the money I spent on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rochard is fun and I do recommend it. It's a physics-gravity-puzzler with some action mixed in. The game takes about 5 hours to finish. The gravity gun mechanics are fun to use. The environmental puzzles aren't that difficult. They're easy enough that the games keeps moving along, but do require some actual thinking. My only one gripe with the game was that the ending is the hardest part and each time trying it, there's an unskippable cut scene that plays first. â¥â¥â¥â¥, I hate that!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rochard is a simple, yet different kind of puzzle platformer. The twist is, that the main character wields a neat gravity gun, which (besides shooting stuff) allows him to control gravity and lift distant objects.Each room has a small puzzle or challenge, which needs to be solved before advancing. The puzzles are not very difficult, but are never so patronisingly easy that they ruin the game. Additionally, even if the core concept is simple, they manage to keep it interesting by changing the setting, adding different puzzles (a variety of force fields, low gravity, reverse gravity, electric fields, shielded enemies, improving weaponry with new features etc.).Speaking of enemies, they can be taken out in a variety of ways, such as dropping heavy stuff on them, pushing them into electric surfaces, manipulating giant mining lasers to cut them into pieces, throwing malfunctioning robots at them, or just plain shooting holes in them.The story is simple, but the nature of the boisterous main character makes it interesting and fun.

												TLDR - Fun little platformer with an interesting game mechanic.  Definitely worth it when on sale, maybe not quite at regular price.It's not very long, and it generally is pretty easy, but it's well-made, has interesting mechanics, and is overall quite fun.  I found the ""ancient Native American legend"" bit of the storyline a little goofy, but that doesn't detract too much from the enjoyment of the game as a whole.  The look and feel of the design is great, the voice acting is quite good, and the music is enjoyable.Some might find the game too easy, but I like the feeling that I am making progress, so it didn't bother me that much.  It is a little short, but that just means that I enjoyed it enough to want more.  It's short enough that I'm not sure I would have paid full price for it, but on sale it was absolutely worth the money.My biggest complaint actually has to do with the ending - if you die, the game has you restart from the last checkpoint, which works well throughout most of the game.  In the final battle, however, the last checkpoint comes before the fight starts, before the villain does his stereotypical villain monologue in a cut scene.  And there is no way to skip that cut scene.  I died several times before beating the final boss, which means that I had to sit and listen to that monologue over and over, punching buttons and hitting keys in hopes of skipping the damn thing.  Oddly, the same thing happens when the final credits begin to roll.  You had better enjoy that theme song, because you are going to have to listen to the whole thing - I could find no way of skipping the credit sequence.Overall, however, I quite enjoyed Rochard.  If you enjoy a good indie platformer with a heavy dose of puzzle solving, I recommend it, especially on sale.			",91,18,1,11,9,1,8

												Get this game. I got it in a Humble Bundle, and I found it really enjoyable. Although I was skeptical of it at first, the puzzles were hard enough to be enjoyable, and the gameplay was unique enough to be entertaining. This is one of the few games which I have bothered to beat in its entireity (expect for two achievments, one of which I think I deserve but the game glitched...).In fact, I beat the game, but when the DLC came out I was excited enough that I promptly bought that and beat it despite not having played the game in a while. It may not give you as much replay as some other games, but it is definitely worth playing, esspecially if you can snag it on a sale.			",52,7,0,7,5,0,14

To me, this was indeed challenging, and fun/entertaining. And being puzzle game, it has its benefits.What i also liked was Rochards voice, dunno why, it was bit like ''yankee''Also, i highly recommend hard times DLC, even thought it was bit short, and less-than-excpected-challenging. Only con  was found in DLC, and that was shortness/lack of doing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playtime: 4 hoursGameplay: 7 / 10Graphics: 9 / 10Overall: 7 / 10Rochard is a charmingly styled and thoroughly enjoyable to play, even if the storyline can seem a little obvious at first. The run and jump gameplay is bolstered by a low-gravity function that can be easily toggled at almost any time, and a steady, slow flow of weapon upgrades or modifications keep things relatively interesting. Don't expect too many options though, health stations increase maximum health but there are no shields or recharge changes. Weapon modifications can be found but only installed or not, and with no maximum to the collection you'll find the changes very linear.The game offers a little replayability with golden icons to collect, upgrades to find all of, and a speed run achievement to hit. Ultimately, however, not something that will be replayed often, with most users clocking in around 10 hours of gameplay.A reasonable enough deal, with some super-cheap DLC for 4 ""Challenge Mode"" levels if you found the main game a little easy.

												Another platformer which gives the character abilities to manipulate physics. In the same time a game with a great story about a space miner (not a marine :) ).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game during the last summer sale and am quite glad I did. It's a really fun game with great mechanics.  The gameplay is smooth and the puzzles, while not incredibly difficult, do make you think them through.  I made the mistake of playing with an xbox controller which turned out to be a bad idea.  The aiming controls with it were quite difficult to get precise.  Not a game ender, but more of a frustration.  After I had beat the game I decided to try the keyboard and mouse.  MUCH easier to aim with and I'd recommend using them instead of a controller.  All in all, this game was worth the money I spent on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rochard puts you in the role of John Rochard, an astro-miner who works for a megalithic company known as Skyrig. John's job on behalf of Skyrig is to mine valuable spaceborne minerals, but after four years, his team hasn't made any new discoveries. On the verge of being fired, John suddenly stumbles upon the precious ore he's been in search of, but doing so catalyzes a series of events in which John and his squad are betrayed and sent on a wild goose chase. Not for the rogue minerals he initially found, but a far more important secret that unfolds as you play.			",323,80,6,63,25,1,33

												The good:Almost everything in the game: gameplay, story*, voice acting, gameplay mechanic, very good puzzle, challenge, very minimal bug, soundtrack, great performance.The bad:The ending, it's so bad and I hate it. Great story, but the ending is ffffdThe worse:Sequel is halted, so you don't know what will happen after the ending.How much I like this game score: 5.5/10 - If they can either change the ending or release the sequel, I'll give 8/10How much I want to recommend this game score: 5.5/10 - you will like this game, but hate to finish it. If it matter to you, don't buy this.			",71,19,2,4,4,0,3

												Playtime: 4 hoursGameplay: 7 / 10Graphics: 9 / 10Overall: 7 / 10Rochard is a charmingly styled and thoroughly enjoyable to play, even if the storyline can seem a little obvious at first. The run and jump gameplay is bolstered by a low-gravity function that can be easily toggled at almost any time, and a steady, slow flow of weapon upgrades or modifications keep things relatively interesting. Don't expect too many options though, health stations increase maximum health but there are no shields or recharge changes. Weapon modifications can be found but only installed or not, and with no maximum to the collection you'll find the changes very linear.The game offers a little replayability with golden icons to collect, upgrades to find all of, and a speed run achievement to hit. Ultimately, however, not something that will be replayed often, with most users clocking in around 10 hours of gameplay.A reasonable enough deal, with some super-cheap DLC for 4 ""Challenge Mode"" levels if you found the main game a little easy.

												This game was amazing. I didn't have any high expectations from this game but I was blown away by the detailed story, controls, character and voice work, and scenery.  The game could be described as mix between the origianl SNES metroid with portal like puzzles. I hope this the company continues with a sequel as this a great game. I am ashamed now that I bought this on sale. I would have paid full price and more.  Don't miss this one.			",154,76,1,26,10,4,5

												This is pretty close to a perfect game. Right length, right price, great controls and physics, great characters and story, great learning curve, save points well positioned, leaves you wanting the sequel to hurry up. Just buy it already.			",1196,592,29,142,107,11,170

												Good game overall.Puzzles are logical and easy, still satisfying.Most of th etime you will be killing enemies with your gun or physics.A simple but enjoyable story with nice characters.Some good humour.Nice music (specially the credits song)Short, good for a break between more complex/long games. (about 5+ hours without counting the DLC)Worth it? Sure, go buy it now on or a sale!			",353,77,15,32,25,2,41

												I really liked Rochard.  Good combat, puzzles, characters, story.  I finished it quickly and then tried the DLC, which was a complete bust.  There were puzzles that were harder, but it wasn't that I couldn't figure them out, they just didn't work.  Like, I'm sure I have to make this jump, but the game won't allow it.  So buy Rochard for less than 5 bucks and not the expansion.			",261,111,4,35,15,1,54

												Linux ""Get the Wildboys out"" display problems.Hi, while entering the section ""Get the Wildboys out"" the laser beam, the transparent color walls and the grabbing trajectory will not display anymore. I think the problem starts while entering the negativ force corridor befor the room where you can repair the transmitter. Really I like that there is a willingness to support my main OS Linux, but does that mean that I have to write bug reports for every title? And yep after writing this I am dead because I cannot see the electro floor anymore.			",94,9,1,7,4,0,6

												What a rip-off. Ten bucks for this piece of garbage? For one thing, it is only in 2-D. You can only face one direction, and basically the whole game is moving boxes and stacking them so you can finish levels. I wouldn't pay ANYTHING for this, if I had known what it was like. I'll write a memo never to get anything by these developers ever again.EDIT: Sorry, I was on a bit of a rage there, and had only played for ~10 minutes. After playing for longer, I realised that this is, behind the camoflage, a great game. Scrap what I said before. This game is fun, has nice, simple controls, good graphics, and fun gameplay. I will, however, keep my old review there, to prove the point that you canât judge a book by its cover. Or in this case, a game by the first 5 minutes.Definitely get this game. Although, probably on a sale, as you can get AC:B for the same price.7.5/10			",69,18,2,17,5,0,6
