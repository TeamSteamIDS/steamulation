Half-Life 2: Episode One 1 was released a bit over 8 years ago, as the even then long-awaited expansion of the original, critically widely acclaimed game. Since it is part of the Orange Box, the Half-Life 2 Complete Edition and the Valve Complete Edition, chances are great you already own and have played the original Half-Life 2.The good news: Episode 1 continues on the high level of level design and gameplay the original had set. There is however an important shift in focus, as the greater part of the game is played alongside Alyx, Gordon's female companion-in-arms. Alyx happily stands her own against the enemy hordes and doesn't need any sort of ""babysitting"" games wtih less well developed AI sometimes call for. She's been updated graphically as well (looking even better ;-)) since Episode 1 makes use of the High Dynamic Range lighting effects first tried out by Valve in Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. However, compared to that playable tech-demo, environments in Episode 1 are a bit disappointing and don't always offer the best opportunities for the upgraded engine to shine. There are no wide-open vistas, and although the opening level in the Citadel is impressive, it also has a sort of repetitiveness that comes to the fore now and then.On the other hand, gameplay-wise everything is as top-notch as it was in the original game, and the fact that you play alongside Alyx offers some interesting opportunities. There's even a Steam Achievement called ""One Bullet"" which gets unlocked by playing through the entire game (!!) using one single bullet. The rest of the kills/actions has to be made by using the Gravity Gun, which gets an upgrade during the early part of the game. This calls for clever thinking, and I tried to get it, only to find myself missing the shooting action after a couple of hours ;-).All in all, Episode 1 is a good to very good expansion, continuing the story of the original game in a logical and interesting way. There's no reason at all not to give it a shot (...) when you've played the original Half-Life 2.Overall rating: 8/10			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												Episode One picks up the story right around where Half-Life 2 ended.  Alyx and Dog are looking for you, and your job is to get the hell out of City 17 before it blows up.  There are a few enhancements to the gameplay, some new enemies, and a superb storyline that continues to expand the Half-Life universe.  A must play if you are a fan of the series, or if you're looking for a quick shooter.  The game itself is not long, but packs a punch in the short campaign that you play.

												In one way this is the worst of the Half Life franchise, but that said the Half Life series is one of my favourite ones and I still highly recommend this Episode.You got nothing new from the moment you left your Buggy until the end of HL2 in this Episode, so a bit of ""platform strategy"" or vulgo ""recycling"" as we sadly know to well from other sequels, but still enjoyable.There are not many novelties, but the ones like the ""Zombines"" and flares are welcome and add well to the existing HL2 world.Graphics are defo a step forward compared to HL2. As far as the story goes, this is really just a connection between HL2 and Episode 2 and nothing terribly new or exciting will be revealed, but by no means boring.You got a bit of citadel and super gravity gun action, combined with a hint of Ravenholm in the dark, Sandtraps w/o pheromones and lots of City 17. Buy it.			",45,2,0,0,0,0,1

												Half Life 2: Episode One is the direct sequel to Half Life 2, but is it worth the name ?Half Life 2: Episode One begins as soon as Half Life 2 ends. We find ourselves in a bad place as the citadel is about to be destroyed and it's gonna take the entire city with it, so you need to escape before the city is destroyed. This review will be incredibly short since this is pretty much Half Life 2, I'll just cover the cons and pros of the game.I want to say this was a bit disappointing playing this episode. Apart from the final mission, the entire game is kind of boring. The gameplay is the same thing as in Half Life 2. There's no change whatsoever. There's nothing really new here it's basically the same game as Half Life 2.The story is still great. But I think the events leading into what is Episode Two are far more interesting than the entire story of episode one.My biggest problem with this game is probably the story. The game is kind of slow in pacing and it's a drag and not to mention it's also incredibly short. It took me 2 hours to finish the entire game. There's pretty much no replay value after that. Overall my feelings towards this episode are still positive. This is as good as the previous Half Life titles, just the story is kind of boring, but apart from that it's a great game.Final Rating:7/10 - Play itIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked the review post in the comments on what you disliked.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												If you enjoyed half life 2 you will enjoy this. While the first, second and fifth final chapters are abit lackluster and shallow the game is essentially more half life 2. Its enjoyabile, its cheap its short and continues the half life 2 story. While not as good as half life 2 it has all the action, variety and cleverness of the original.			",71,9,0,13,6,0,6

												Half Life 2: Episode One continues after the events of Half Life 2. While no doubt it is fun and immersive, and let's be honest Co-oping along side Alex.....finally is out right fun. There is nothing really all that new from the first. It is shorter obviously than Half Life 2 and even Half life 2: Episode 2. In my opinion is the weakest of the series so far. It has the same enviroment only this time after the events of the destruction of the Citadel and how the city is hoping with the aftermath. If your a Half Life fan, you need to get this! I had so much fun tagging along side Alex through the entirety of the game. The only real negative I would give is that it's much shorter than Half Life 2 and Episode 2. Don't let that though be the deciding factor of whether or not you make the purchase. Trust me, it's very much worth it!			",219,19,1,56,13,3,21

												Well, First of all, I am very surprised that you are  actually  going to read a review to buy this awesome Game. I bet you already know this is an installement for the Ledgendary game 'Half Life 2' So why bother reading a review? But if you still want to continue reading, Then be my guest. Back to the review. This is an AWESOME Game for a Game that has been released in the Year 2006 (June 1, 2006 to be precise, Oh, And By The Way, My Birthday is on June 29th!)  And yet, It still is. If you have Half Life 2 and dont have EP1, Trust me you are missing alot then.  It is a hard Game, Especially because of the dark areas which happened to be filled with Zombies and God, (Or should I say Gordon? :P) knows what else.  There are no new Weapons, But hey now, Who needs new Weapons when there are already plenty to choose from? The Game is a bit short, But reasonable, But the Story is mind blowing. I wont tell what happens in the story, As I might accidently tell something that I'm not supposed to. Overall, I highly recommend this Game, Infact, The whole series to any Gamer. It doesnt matter whether you are a Beginner, Intermediate or an Advanced Player, You will find this game very interesting to Play.			",247,60,8,22,20,3,19

												This is a good game for those looking for an extension to the Half Life 2 franchise. It doesn't feel like a crap dlc that's been rushed to simply bring the company in some extra cash. The game has had a considerable amount of thought put into it and it still feels like Half Life. It took me roughly 4 hours to complete this as there are some very challenging parts to this game and sometimes you just don't see what's in plain sight. Would recommend this game and looking forward to playing Episode 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Первый эпизод Half-Life 2 это практически идеальный аддон для шедевральной игры, в котором минимум инноваций соседничает со все тем же восхитительным геймплеем. Не зря многие считают первый эпизод отдельной игрой. Усилий разработчики вложили по максимуму и у них снова, в 2006 году получилось навести улыбку на лица всех фанатов серии. Всего один новый враг и одна новая технология HDR в первом эпизоде послужили отличным примером того, что когда талантливые люди делают с душой свое дело, у них все получается на все 100!

In this episode Gordon and Alyx are running away and try to find a way to escape from City 17. There is no new equipment or new weapon. Also in this episode we will see Gordon and Alyx more close together. If you finished Half Life 2 already, you need to buy and play this game definitely.			",66,4,3,4,1,0,0

-Quick Review-Half-Life 2: Episode One was Developed by Valve Corporation and released 2006. Not much changed from Half-Life 2, this game is a continuation and starts right after the events of Half-Life 2.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: After the events that took place in Half-Life 2, Gordon and Alyx Vance are reunited and need to escape City 17. Unfortunately, they cannot escape before the Citadel's core detonates. So Alex and Gordon are forced to enter the Citadel to stabilize the core long enough for them to safely escape.


Story Sample - Uploaded for the review 
A Screenshot of Half-Life 2: Episode One
By: Atratzu




Gameplay: There are only two changes to the core game: First, Alex's AI has been dramatically improved, so she is more helpful and not nearly as annoying as most NPC's that simply repeat the same phrases and actions. Second, you start the game with the Gravity Gun, which is utilized both in combat and puzzle solutions.

Achievements: There are 13 achievements in Half-Life 2: Episode One. Five achievements are unlocked by just completing the game, the rest are achieved by special circumstances. (like... “beating the game firing exactly one bullet”, “not killing any stalkers”, or “killing an elite soldier with his own energy ball”)To be honest, these achievements aren't very bad, this was a relatively easy 100% completed game, compared to others games.Price: Half-Life 2: Episode One, is priced at $7.99, unfortunately the game is very short, and this price is a bit high for the amount of time it will take to play through the game. (You will probably spend about 5 or 6 hours to beat it)A far better alternative, is to purchase The Orange Box for $19.99, you will purchase: Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode one, Half Life 2: Episode Two, and Portal.Conclusion: Story: Still very good, but unfortunately much shorter then Half-Life 2. Gameplay: Pretty much the same as Half-Life 2, the only difference is you use the Gravity gun much more, and much sooner. Achievements: Straightforward, fairly obtainable 100% completed game. Price: Over priced, wait for a sale, or purchase the Orange Box for the best value.I recommend this game to anyone who played Half-Life 2 and wants to continue the story of the Freeman...Related reviewsHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2Here's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode TwoHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(...is what I would say if it was released yet *sob*) ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												The Half-Life Series has left a legacy for a reason. Enough said. If you're planning on buying the games individually, dont. Search the ""Orange Box"" on steam and buy it instead. You get the entire series plus Portal 1, and it comes out cheaper. The Orange Bundle was on sale yesterday for $5 on greenmangaming. Its normally 20 dollars however, which is still a pretty good deal. I think i bought it for $10. so yeah, the bundle can save you some money if you place it on your wishlist and buy it on sale.

												Half-Life 2: Episode One begine right where Half-Life 2 ended, and continues the story of Dr.Gordon Freeman in City 17, however, this time, the priority remains to escape the city following the events of Half-Life 2.With updated lighting and AI for deuteragonist Alyx Vance, and expanded usage for the Gravity Gun, Half-Life 2: Episode One continues Half-Life 2's usage of advanced graphics, physics, music and writing to create a game that is both rich in gameplay, plot, and emotion. Like its predecessor, it uses training techniques to allow for a more fluid experience, and utilizes the game's physics engine to a full. With excellent performances by its cast, it's able to greatly explain the story of Gordon and Alyx escaping City 17.With an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game becomes even more action packed, and the act of blasting zombies in an infected hospital with a shotgun becomes far more enjoyable, and the scene of fighting infected Combine soldiers in the underground becomes more threatening.The game also includes Developer commentary in the form of a commentary mode that allows the players to listen to the developers' thoughts on everything from map design to character and scene writing, and includes all variant of Valve Employee sharing their thoughts on the game.If I had to say I had any issues with the game, I'd have to say that it's fairly short, while Half-Life 2 is around 12-15 hours long, Episode One is around 5 hours long. That's not to say it's a bad game for that, though, as the story and game runs at a certain pace that allows for it to be enjoyed to the fullest; Replaying the game with the knowledge of how short it is doesn't damage or reduce the enjoyment of playing it, as Valve injects a great deal of fun into the game so there aren't many moments or time that is wasted, and every minute is used to its fullest.If you enjoyed Half-Life 2, and want more, I greatly suggest you buy the Half-Life Complete Steam bundle, preferably during a Steam Seasonal Sale. The bundle consists of this game and every other Valve-released Half-Life title, and is an essential for a fan of Half-Life.			",65,10,0,6,15,3,15

Milestones In Gaming Never Get OldThere is not a lot left to say about HL2. We all agree that it lifted the genre to the next the level. I have to confess however that I haven't played HL2 Episode One at all during the last 9 years and that I did not even touch it during the last 4 years that I have it in my library.  THIS WAS A GREAT MISTAKE AND I REGRET ITThis 9 year old Stand-Alone Expansion of HL2 is perfect: story, characters, puzzles, innovation, action, design and even the graphics are still on a very high level and way ahead of some newer games. And it runs like butter...New features like VR or 3D Vision lift HL2 in general into the new age of virtual reality, of gaming. I played it with 3D vision and had a great blast wandering through City 17, the Citadel. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! If you have it in your library since a long time, but never touched it, never installed it - like I did. Do not wait any longer. 9 years have been enough. GREAT GAME. ",1024,208,30,60,71,3,60

												Continuation of the epic series by valve.You start off from where half life 2 ended and make your way through the scariest set of levels in the new trilogy(HL2 trilogy) so far.Definitely a must play for all half-life and fps lovers. You just cant skip this game or any games in the half life series for that matter. Get them all and immerse yourself in the complex yet great plot!10/10			",293,73,4,42,16,2,48

												its a good but short (around 4 to 5h to complet) sequel to the previous hl 2, the story takes off after you blow up the citadel and your main objective is to escape city 17 and this time you will get a closer look at the stalkers and the strange alien like creature that you see in hl 2 and of cours it will leaves you with more unanswered questions .the graphics, sound effect and the gameplay are just like in hl 2 nothing has changed except for the source engin i think ( it looks a bit better visually then hl2) + there is 13 easy achievements8/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life 2.Half-Life 2: Episode One continues Gordon Freeman story from Half-Life 2 following the destruction of the Combine Citadel Dark Fusion reactor. In this episode you have to buy the resistance and yourself more time to escape City 17 and then escape with them, but it's not going to be a short one. I recommend this.Half-Life 2: Episode One also focuses on AI companion. Alyx will accompany you 80% of the time and she is very helpful. But you also need to help her help you in some level.Rating 10/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Gameplay wise - it has some great moments; including a standout section in which the player directs Alyx Vance's fire via a flashlight.Unfortunately Valve  became sloppy with this expansion pack - opening with a deus ex machina in the lazyest manner poosible. The scripted sequences become contrived ""look at this"" moments with Alyx Vance spelling everything out for the player or repeating ""oh my god""  or in general, gasping at anything and everything to give a foiced sense of drama. Basically - it's more Halflife 2, but not as good. It's still a great - great game. Better than 90% of shooters out there, but pales in comparison to the main game. Would still recommend it.

												This is the continuation of the story from the end of Half-Life 2.This is the classic Valve first person shooter single person campaign. If you buy one game on Steam, this and the Half Life 2 episodes should be it.The classic story of Gordon Freeman. Exploreable environments and useable / moveable objects, voiceover actors with alternate conversations. Is linear but you can explore alittle of each map. Autosave works good.  Has a great story.

+ This is essentially a stand-alone expansion to Half-Life 2 that starts off at the same moment that Half-Life 2 ended. This is great for those who have already finished Half-Life 2 and want more content.+ Same great gameplay as Half-Life 2, same weapons, nothing dramatically new + Expands on the story, answers some questions, while leaving you still wanting more by the end.+ You get to get closer to Stalkers (the creepy looking abominations that you see working at the end of Half-Life 2), and find out what they actually are.- Fairly short in length. Roughly 2.5 to 3 hours long~ If you have NOT played Half-Life 2, do NOT play this game first. I'm not really sure why this is a stand-alone game			",2907,1027,99,266,347,21,392

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is science fiction first person shooter game developed by Valve Software on the Source Engine. It tells the continued story of physicist-gone-action-hero Gordon Freeman as he and action-hero-gone-love-interest Alyx Vance escape from the physically unstable City 17 before it blows up I think.In my review of Half-Life 2 I definitely wasn't very nice to the game. I said the game was unfocused and average, with interesting ideas and clever storytelling but drawn-out setpeices and a largely uninteresting plot if you remove all that glittery facial animation. Some of that, I think, is still justified but one thing I forgot to mention was how much I actually really like Half-Life 2.One thing the HL franchise enjoys doing is pulling the rug out from under the player and then throwing a bunch of enemies at them. That's pretty cool but it's also sort of troubling, considering that most of Half-Life 2 feels very aimless as if Gordon is just drunkenly stumbling between ambushes and set-peices. Episode 1 seemingly tries to fix that by making whatever the current goal is very obvious, either with some kind of environmental clue or with Alyx directly telling you what the objective is:Escape the towerGet to the train stationThe story is more grounded and because of that the gameplay can throw you into as many accidental circumstances and detours as it wants because you always end up back on track. I also appreciate how the stakes are a lot higher feeling in this game. It isn't just a vague intergalactic business proposition between Breen and some alien terrorist people, the actual city feels like it's about to blow up and if you keep getting interrupted by the combine than everybody involved will actually die. And it isn't just your life that's at stake here, you spend the entire game fighting alongside Alyx Vance, which sounds like a bad idea but this game manages a sidekick-idea very well.Anybody who played the first game remembers the third act where you command a squad consisting of that guy who sounds like everyone else and a girl who only occasionally dreams of cheese(?) but nobody WANTS to remember that part because not only is it sandwiched between the two best parts of the game but it also is un-doubtably the worst. The AI blocks the player at every turn and is super reliant on Gordon; they will not go anywhere unless you ask them too and they die as quickly as your enemies do so they may as well not be there--heck the game is more fun when they AREN'T there.The squad idea comes back in Episode 1 but not only are they more resistant, they seemingly abandon the whole ""Targeting"" thing--they seem to go wherever they want until you start to progress, and most importantly they stay out of the players way. All of this culminates into Alyx who not only follows the player from the very start but is INVULNERABLE to damage. This could make her too powerful but the devs fix that only giving her a pistol until about halfway through, and even before that she's a very good aim. Most of the opening is spent with the player under a variety of handicaps such as only having a gravity gun or not having a ton of ammo and the devs cleverly use Alyx as your second half, which not only ties their mostly plot-based comradery into the gameplay but also makes you feel like a real team by the end.Ultimately I think Episode 1 expands on HL2 and makes the game better. There's only one new enemy and a smaller arsenal than before but the gameplay is tightened and the story in more investing. I'll be the first to admit that my review of HL2 was a bit hyperbolic but I still recommended that game and I absolutely recommend Episode 1 as well			",34,4,0,1,0,0,0

												The aftermath of Half Life 2. This game is well worth $8, although there isn’t much replay value and it’s not very long, the game play itself is amazing enough. Fight the newly introduced combine zombies as well as old enemies from Half Life 2 such as stalkers and gunships. Amazing storyline the only downside to this game is that it’s too short but it’s still worth the moneys. Buy it on sale or in the Orange box which includes other Valve favourites 8.5/10 too short for a stand alone but amazing all together			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												This game is AWESOME!!! It has AMAZING graphics, NEW ENEMIES for you to kill and the classic ones of course, it's a VALVE game which makes it a OUTSTANDING game, it has NEW ENVIRONMENTS (kinda) and last but not least Alyx is helpful for the first time in a Half-Life game as she helps you to destroy tons of enemies, even though she can die now(in a mission or in one chapter at least) apart from opening doors, keeping you company and talking to you all the time. In my opinion this is an AMAZING expansion to the Half-Life 2 game and if you own Half-Life 2 then you must play it!! P.S Alyx may be sarcastic during the game and a bit annoying when she's standing in front of you but hey she's a programmed NPC and I like her anyway.			",78,7,0,0,2,1,3

												Half-Life 2: Episode One continues the story of Half-Life 2 with another adventure of Gordon Freeman and Alyx. The story picks up right away after the original game and offers more of the same as the original. There's nothing really new to note here besides some new enemies and a level that puts good use of the flashlight; you also have Alyx by your side the entire time - which allows for some unique gameplay, such as not firing any bullets and only using the gravity gun. Episode One is somewhat short, I was able to complete the game in ~3 hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would call this game descent. It's great to see the story carry on, but there is not much new additions to this game except for the zombines. If you're a fan of Half-Life, you'll love this game, like me. For me this game is just an adventure going all the way back through everywhere again to get to the train station. It just feels like I'm going around the otherside of the buildings from Half-Life 2 and after a while that would start to get repetetive. But the reason why some people like me like this game is because it's like you're still not finished with Half-Life 2 and you want to how the story unfolds. I totally understand why people don't like this game in the Half-Life series. I think that the true fans of Half-Life will enjoy this game. Personally I recommend it.

												A nice continuation of the Half-Life series and introductions of new gameplay and content. You spend more time with Alyx, whether that's a good thing or not is subjective, but I personally like how they built her character. It also includes the commentary system Valve has been putting in their games ever since Lost Coast which gives cool insights in the development of the game. It gives more than just the satisfaction of knowing what happens after Half-Life 2, it really is worth buying just for the new gameplay as well.			",46,2,0,1,1,0,2

												Hello Fellow Physicists,I strongly recommend Half-Life 2: Episode One! It's a great episode addition to the Half-Life series! A cliff-hanger from the Half-Life 2 leads perfectly into Episode One! How could you not purchase it? The game dives more into your connection with Alyx Vance and several other characters that you didn't see all that much in Half-Life 2, and, not to mention, it adds more aliens into the mix! Great game, definitely worth every penny in order to continue the outstanding series!-Kyle James			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Episode One is a good expansion that gives direct continuity to the events at the end of the second game.The gameplay is basically the same, but I would say that it's more focused on the puzzles. It's notorious the evolution of the Source Engine in all areas, graphics, physics, AI, etc.As for the plot, the focus is turned to the posterior events after the end of the second title, there is a good plot development as well as in the base game and a positive point is that Alyx is at your side almost from beginning to end, helping you overcome obstacles and consequently there is a deepening of the link between you two.Lastly, I would say that is a good sequel and if you liked the base game, no doubt will like this expansion.8/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Half-Life 2 Episode One is the continuation of the Half-Life saga or rather the story of how Gordon Freeman saved the world. While I was a big fan of the single-player campaign in the original Half-Life these new stories that have been unveiling beginning with with Half-Life 2 just haven't been quite as impressive and Episode One feels much the same way.The story picks up shortly after the end of Half-Life 2 proper. Through the power of being the protagonist you have somehow manged to survive and must now fight your way out of the city before it implodes on you. There is not much new to the storyline or gameplay and the areas feel like they could have been ripped straight out of the regular Half-Life 2 campaign.Of course there is a certain bias from me because I never bought Half-Life 2 to play Half-Life 2, that was just a nice little bonus, I bought it for the mods and as such I am not nearly as invested as others in the lives of Alyx and her boytoy Gordon.Get it if you liked the single-player campaign in Half-Life 2 and want a few more hours of it. Otherwise you can safely ignore it as it's an entirely forgettable expansion.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Very much like Half Life 2. Which is a positive. Yet it did little to expand on its previous iteration. Most of the places you visit are places that look exactly like Half Life 2. It was fun but I would expect more since it was released seperate from HL2. It feels more like this was apart of the original game and it was chopped from it to make its own episode. There is nothing wrong with any of this and it is fun in its own right. I was just hoping for a little bit more. 7.5/10			",425,96,6,66,39,2,64

												Those darn headcrabs!EPISODE 1 starts immediately where Half-Life 2 ended. Basically it’s more of the same, and that’s more than welcome to a fan like me. If you want to know what I thought of HL2 I refer the reader to that review. Suffice it to say I loved it and Episode 1, although not as memorable as its predecessor, is still enormous fun to play. The only criticism I have of this episode is that Valve haven’t given the narrative development as much thought as they did in HL2 and will do again in HL2 Episode 2. Still great fun though.4/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

Rank: 8/10Recommendation(s): Play the Half Life series in order.Major Theme: A logical part of the Half Life series.Bought at Price: $50 – Valve Complete PackWhile I have my own thoughts about Half Life Episode Two, Episode One is a very logical part of the story. Sure, it’s slightly in a tight spot as it takes place right (immediately) after Half Life 2 ends or leaves players on a cliff hanger.There wasn’t anything “life changing”, or significant for me to take screenshots of, which shows how much Episode One was a tie in. This doesn’t mean that the title is less deserving of its rating, it is just short.If you are not interested in Half Life, this is not the game to play. Most of the plot will be confusing, and the characters will not be relatable.			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												The story of Half-Life continues in Episode 1, right after Half-Life 2. Gordon and Alyx have to escape City 17, but not before containing the Citadel Core.The game is a lot shorter and doesn't have as much content. Over the course of it, you acquire all needed weapons to complete it. You will still fight ships and striders though. Puzzles are pretty much what you would expect from a Half-Life installation. Whole game can be completed using only the gravity gun, because you are always with Alyx and she's able to do the shooting instead of you.Nothing new is added, except maybe a new zombie, no weapons, no vehicles, but it doesn't really matter, because continuing the story is more important. If you liked Half-Life 2, then you should also probably buy Episode 1.			",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												The Half-Life 2 episodes were meant to be a foray into a new method of game development. Instead of spending several more years making Half-Life 3, Valve would release smaller iterations over shorter spans of time, which would also let them refine their work as they went. Coming out two years after HL2, Episode One was a relatively understated success, with improvements made in AI and the Source engine taking the technical spotlight.It's not nearly as long, dealing primarily with the aftermath of HL2's finale, but in the process avoids the drag that game sometimes suffered from. There's a decent variety here: the first third of the game only gives you one weapon to work with (albeit a powerful one), the second third is almost survival horror, and the final third is a roaring return to Combine-destroying action.You're partnered the entire time with Alyx Vance, who is thankfully more helpful and humorous here than annoying, and it's with that you realize that Valve also meant Episode One to be an exercise in character development that did more than just have you stand around for 5 minutes every time an NPC opens their mouth. The game is largely a success in that department too, and Valve's signature stealth brilliance in writing manages to make her not only cool, but human.If you're reading this, you probably already own it, but if you don't (or do and haven't played it for some reason) and were a fan of Half-Life 2, I'd say go for it. At the very least, it's a good bookend between its predecessor and its more outstanding sequel, Episode Two.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

Half-Life 2: Episode OnePositives• Beautifully put together story• Story progression is well paced and exciting• Characters do not feel static• Graphics are still good even for today's standards• Organized and reasonable achievements for the most part• Simplistic and engaging combat• Well put together environment and futuristic theme• Music fits right into the storyNegatives• AI is a little outdated • Many times I did not know where to go or what to do• Quite a few times the game left me stuck where I had to restart a segment• Story still has holes by the end hopefully filled in by Episode 2• The ""One Free Bullet"" achievement is very frustrating where I had to replay half the game to get• Puzzles can be annoying at times• Physics are inconsistent sometimes• Ends in yet another cliff hangerFinal Thoughts: Episode One wraps up quite similar to the previous game with a cliff hanger where you do not know if Gordon survived or not. It also starts with holes not filled and hopefully is filled in by Episode 2. The story is very well crafted but this episode does not do much in the way of the story it just continues the last game. Although there was a few problems with segments not working and the ""One Free Bullet"" achievement being a hassle, the game is definitely worth your time.Rating: 8.0/10-Penta ",26,5,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game years ago simply to see the ending to the cliffhanger that Half Life 2 provided. And I utterly hated this game, at the time I thought everything was poorly designed with my main complaint being the lack of ammo and weapons for the amount of enemies you have to kill. I considered it one of the worst game I ever played and it turned me off of Half life so much that I didn't bother buying the 2nd episode. I still haven't played it and I'm planning on buying it tomorrow during the Holiday Sale.But after completing Half life 2 with some mods I decided to install episode one again and take it for a spin, fully expecting to hate it again. I was pleasantly surprised though Episode one is still the weakest game in the Half Life Franchise. First off my initial complaint of the lack of ammo for your weapons just... isn't a thing anymore. Maybe I just sucked and wasted too much ammo but I never had a problem. Though I wish that the crowbar was given to the player in the beginning of the game, instead of the half-way point where you no longer need it. Having a viable melee weapon early on in the game against the headcrab zombies would have been really nice instead of having to constantly run around the map looking for cement blocks to shoot at them with your Grav Gun.Also the game is really dark, this in of itself isn't an issue but due to the fact that your flashlight uses energy you basically have to stop and stand still in the dark for a few moments while your flashlight charges, which really kills the game flow for me. I wish they just made the Flashlight not use your suit's battery so it could stay on indefinitely.I also really liked the Zombine enemy. They become a priority when dealing with hordes of Zombies and they can be actually quite helpful for you when they pull out a grenade and go kamikaze. If you're quick enough to get away they can  usually kill the horde of zombies for you. You can also shoot the grenade out of their hand or snatch it from them with the Grav Gun. It's all these things that makes them a fun dynamic new enemy which makes up for the lack of new weapons or features.There are also a lot of great gunfights with the Combine and the firefight in the Hospital is definitely the best part of Episode one. Also Alyx is a treat too though I found her animation to be a little stiff and lifeless at times. Beat the game and when you're on the train, just look at Alyx and you'll see what I mean. She looks like a Mannequin at points and for a game whose main selling point is having Alyx fighting with you it seems like a big oversight, especially since the source engine has proven before that its quite good at making life-like animations. But the biggest problem I have with the game is that it is waaay too short. I have around 6.9 hours clocked in and thats after 2 playthroughs. I believe my first playthrough took me about four hours and my last playthough just shy of three. Even in a market in which single player campaigns are getting increasingly short, there is no excuse for Episode one to be this short and it is simply not worth the asking price of $8, even when you take mods like MINERVA into consideration.Ultimately I would recommend Episode One but with a big asterisk: Do not pay full price for it and understand that it is the weakest game in the Half Life Series, even a game like Blue Shift I feel is better than Episode one. But it has some cool gunfights and helps to continue the story and transition into Episode two. Pay at most $4 and make sure you play the Minerva mod at some point to get your full money's worth.

 Half-Life 2: Episode 1 After the success of HL2, Valve made the design decision to release its sequels as episodic titles. This allowed them to capitalise more efficiently on rapidly improving graphical technology and dispense their content a lot faster. Released in 2006, Episode 1 is the direct continuation of HL2 which charts Gordon and Alyx’s treacherous escape from City 17. Technically, it attempts to improve and advance every aspect that its predecessor established.The gameplay of Episode 1 is based almost entirely around the concept of you working in partnership with your AI companion, Alyx. This mainly involves Alyx following your lead and helping you during combat, but there are also several innovative sections which reinforce the idea of teamwork. These include a dimly lit area where you need to use your flashlight to illuminate enemies for Alyx to shoot; and a section where you need to clear Alyx’s line of sight while she supports you from afar with a sniper rifle.She has been programmed to act as a support role, remaining reticent during puzzle sections and hanging back during ‘boss’ encounters. This feels like a well-balanced design choice as it allows the player the freedom to advance at their own pace and feel more of a sense of accomplishment at overcoming challenges.The AI has seen significant improvements, especially in path finding abilities. Alyx in particular has had a substantial upgrade, giving her new animations for crouching and synchronised kill moves for a lot of enemy types. Enemy AI has also seen developments as Combine soldiers can now crouch and take cover more effectively. They have also been given a rope repelling animation which always looks visually engaging. The only new enemy type introduced is the Combine zombie, or ‘zombine’. They are an entertaining addition that adds a new threat to the undead portions of the game.The puzzle sections are still relatively easy and should not take anyone too long to solve. Despite this, they are slightly more diverse than the simple physics based puzzles of the original game and still serve as an effective diversion from the combat scenes.Graphically, Episode 1 has seen some major upgrades. Valve has adapted their Source engine to include new developments in HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting, which was originally showcased in their Lost Coast tech demo. This really helps to elevate the presentation to a high standard; for example the shader effects used around the Citadel core still manage to impress me today. There have also been further advancements in facial expression modelling which helps bring some more personality to the main characters.Overall, Episode 1 is a solid entry into the HL2 series. The main criticism that can be presented is its length; it is only five chapters long and can be comfortably completed in less than 10 hours. However, it is worth mentioning that there is also a developer commentary mode which provides some insightful observations if you are at all interested in the design process, or if you simply want to get a little more replay value.Personally I feel that Episode 1 provides the least story enhancement of the series, which can make it feel more inconsequential. However, from a technical stand point it does improve on almost every aspect in terms of gameplay and graphical experience, and is a well-polished presentation that serves as a good stepping stone into Episode 2.

												This is the epilogue to Half-Life 2, and it plays well.  You can see the Portal-like thinking in the design, especially at the beginning areas, which are a bit puzzle-based rather than combat heavy.  The difference is rather than using a portal device, you are using the gravity gun.  You don't even start with a crowbar.  Of course, this is just while the game prepares to return to form.  By the time it's over, you'll be back with crowbar in hand and a full array of weapons.  As well as the return of Gordon's followers.The game emphasizes the follower/NPC mechanics, as not only will Gordon have NPC followers helping him through parts of the game, but Alyx follows him for most of the game.  Rather than being a burden to be protected like too many escorts, however, Alyx is an active combatant, and more than holds her own.  You'll be glad she's there to draw fire and take down enemies at your side, and you'll notice the few times when she's pulled away to perform a background task and you have to go it solo.  It is a little abrupt, but it is worthy appendix to Half-Life 2's gameplay and storyline.			",173,41,6,32,22,4,50

												Even though it is a great addition to Half-Life 2, this is the only title of the three Half-Life 2 chapters that falls a bit short, mostly because the game is very short itself, in terms of value, the smart thing to do would be to pick Episode One up with a Half-Life bundle or in the sales.Disregarding it's length, it is just another brilliant addition and a must-have for Half-Life fans, it continues the story and has great game play just like Half-Life 2 itself. You can't have Half-Life 2 without episodes 1 & 2. Period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not my favorite episode but still, getting the Gravity Gun in the Citadel is still worthy and because you're a lucky dog with Alyx next to you.In reality, the ending of Half-Life 2 is kinda tweaked. G-Man was putting you back to your lethargy when Vortigaunts appeared and saved you from this fate. Now in a City 17 in ruins, you have to go back inside the Citadel to buy time for the evacuation of civilians, though Combines are still fighting till the end.It's not my favorite episode because there is nothing new and that we already saw City 17 or the Citadel. It's just that I wanted a change of scenery, like Episode 2 proposed. But Alyx is now really at your side every step of the way, which is also a good change.The new enemy here is the Zombine: a soldier from the Combine being affected by an Headcrab and which often is carrying a grenade. I don't count Stalkers here as they're victims first and that they're not trying to kill you, they're just following a pattern with the laser.Also, the real intense moment is probably the train station: whether it's escorting civilians to safety or deal with the Striders to make sure the last train can depart (and it's yours, so...).The real challenge was added in 2010, with the achievement asking you for using only one bullet (and that bullet is necessary because without it, you can't advance in the game).In other words, missing Episode 1 can't be possible for the sake of the story and the plot, otherwise, for me, it's not a memorable one. Episode 2 was better as Half-Life 2.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												I can now understand why Alyx Vance has been hyped up as a great partner over the years. I didn't get the feeling of her having much of an influence in the base game of Half-Life 2, but in Episode One she really shined while saving Gordon's bacon repeatedly. The entire game sends dedicated to showcasing her as a strong partner, the likes of which has only really been rivaled by Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite in recent years.The gameplay continues to be innovative, mostly by expanding what the NPCs can do, like having Alyx gun down everything in sight with a pistol, sniper rifle, or shotgun. It's a fun little continuation of the main game, although I can't say that it adds much to the story, which will hopefully be revealed in the second episode.			",88,15,0,21,9,0,9

												As the sequel to Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 comes back to life in a totally apocalyptic world after the Combine's Citadel being attacked. The Combine purposely try to blow up the Citadel to destroy any info to prevent the Resistance to get their greasy hands on it of course because it's the linchpin of all their plans.Gameplay:The gameplay is pretty short comparing to the first Half-Life 2 because it's a episode I guess, I don't know why ask Valve, but the gameplay really doesn't differ in Episode One, but you are fighting you way away from the Citadel this time due to the Transmission failing in the Citadel.Graphics:Graphics don't really vary because it's the same source engine, but what changes is there's rocks everywhere because of the Combine's Strider keep blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up!The rating I give this is 9.2/10 because It could be a little bit longer. Background music is good too, but they stuck to the same ones.Up next in reviews by Dead Kitty: Left4Dead 2			",36,0,0,0,2,0,0

												This is the epilogue to Half-Life 2, and it plays well.  You can see the Portal-like thinking in the design, especially at the beginning areas, which are a bit puzzle-based rather than combat heavy.  The difference is rather than using a portal device, you are using the gravity gun.  You don't even start with a crowbar.  Of course, this is just while the game prepares to return to form.  By the time it's over, you'll be back with crowbar in hand and a full array of weapons.  As well as the return of Gordon's followers.The game emphasizes the follower/NPC mechanics, as not only will Gordon have NPC followers helping him through parts of the game, but Alyx follows him for most of the game.  Rather than being a burden to be protected like too many escorts, however, Alyx is an active combatant, and more than holds her own.  You'll be glad she's there to draw fire and take down enemies at your side, and you'll notice the few times when she's pulled away to perform a background task and you have to go it solo.  It is a little abrupt, but it is worthy appendix to Half-Life 2's gameplay and storyline.			",173,41,6,32,22,4,50

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 3.2 hoursTIME TO COMPLETE ACHIEVEMENTS: 4.3 hoursI've just finished my 2nd playthrough so the average gametime you might squeeze out of this will be slightly longer, somewhere around 5 hours. Episode One is the ""odd"" Half-Life game, I have to admit. While the gameplay is balanced and the game is of the same difficulty as Half-Life 2 it's not my time of game. I frankly don't find Antlions that interesting, but the Zombines and Stalkers were a fun addition (it's the first time the Stalkers have an actual purpose and gameplay mechanics). It's a fun addition to the Half-Life series, but don't get yourself stressed over it. I find Episode Two to be a much better sequel.			",41,4,0,0,1,0,1

OverviewAfter the major success that Half-Life 2 was, many fans of the series were left wondering when the next installment of the Half-Life franchise would come out. It came as a shock when Valve announced that they would begin releasing episodic installments in their best selling franchise.Half-Life 2 Episode 1 is a continuation of Half-Life 2, picking up right where the last game ended instead of starting somewhere completely new. This may confuse many new players who haven't played the original hl2, but overall episode 1 is a nice bridge between Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode 2.Pros Picks up right where hl2 left off, no time jumps Alyx's ai is very good for a game that is 9 years old, still works almost flawlessly. Game runs very well, very little lag and no crashes Game looks great, a few graphical updates from hl2 The soundtrack is very well done, the tracks flow very well with the gameplay.Cons The only setting in the game is City 17/the Citadel. Nothing we haven't already seen in hl2. The only new enemies are the Zombines and Stalkers.  The zombines are plentiful in numbers and are fun to mess around with, but the Stalkers don't even fight back and serve little to no purpose in the game. The game is quite short, even if it is supposed to be just an episode. You might finish it in an afternoon or two. Rating There is no denying that this is a good game. However compared to Half-Life 2 and Episode 2 this installment seems to be missing what made those 2 games masterpieces. You should definetely buy this game, and it is definetely worth 8 bucks. Just keep in mind that it doesn't bring a whole lot of new things to the table like the other ones did.8/10			",27,6,0,2,1,0,11

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is a pretty good continuation of Half-Life 2. The game picks up the story from the point where Half-Life 2 ended: Gordon and Alyx are saved by the mysterious alien creatures (who are our allies here, altough we battled them - among other things - in the first game) both from the explosion and from the unpleasant guy in suit. What we get from here is an action packed escape, much like before, but this time with more zombies and almost completely set in the well known city environment. The finale may not seem as grandiose this time, but the final train ride is amazing.In addition to improved lighting, I noticed the particle effects (almost as good as in F.E.A.R.) looking better than the ones in the original game. It's visually striking how the light shines through the grains of dust.Gordon is accompanied by Alyx throughout the entire game and it is quite refreshing (the dialogues are pretty one-sided though, because Gordon still remains silent and fails to react to anything she says :)) to have her around, after the solitude of the original game. Alyx can still die if we don't pay attention, but this time she's more capable of defending herself.We have the same enemies (expect more zombies, antlions and striders) and weapons as usual (for me it wasn't an issue since I think the weapons are versatile enough), altough we can use the gravity gun more often - the environment is full of heavy, usable objects. As a matter of fact there is an achievement called 'The One Free Bullet' for which you can fire your gun only once throughout the whole game (the rocket launcher does not count as one, but the pistol, shotgun and machine guns do), that one time being crucial (you have to shoot a padlock to advance further). Attaining it may seem hindering, but it's quite fun and not as hard as it sounds.The main problem however arises from Half-Life 2: the story, or rather the lack of it. You still won't be able to find out anything about what's going on, moreover there are new mysteries as well, for example the huge, amorphous creature we meet at the beginning (seemingly using some sort of psionic attacks). For someone who values storyline above almost anything else in a single player game, this counts as quite a big mistake.After all the game is still great, but Valve should have given at least a bit more answers instead of extending the core Half-Life 2 getaway gameplay with a few more hours. Talking about hours, the game is also pretty short and can be finished in about 6 hours (took me less than 13 hours with all achievements attained). I don't think that it's such a big problem however, since it wasn't priced as a full game at it's release. It feels a bit like a link between the original Half-Life 2 and Episode 2, but I'm not saying it should be given a miss. On the contrary, you should definitely play it as it's still a great game and has some memorable moments (make sure to listen to Dr. Kleiner's speech on the menu or ingame via the city screens :))PROS+ improved lighting and particle effects+ having Alyx as a sidekick is fun+ combat is still great, fighting striders is thrilling+ some very creative achievementsCONS- story is still functional, no explanations- setting is motonous- a bit too shortRATING7.5/10			",88,73,0,10,4,0,8

												The shortest, and arguably the weakest entry in the Half-Life Saga.It's... okay.

												This and Episode 2 are two ""expansions"", I guess you would say, for Half-Life 2. I honestly do not really like this one, atleast not as much as Episode 2 or the other Half-Life games. This starts off right where HL2 ended, Gordon and Alyx must go inside the citadel again, and I'm not going to say anymore about the story. This is for people who played HL2, and want more, I reccomend this for anyone who had played both games.			",14,7,0,4,7,0,0

This review is not necessarily what I would call completely finished, but here is what I have thus far:Half-Life 2: Episode One continues more or less directly from where the remarkable masterpiece known as Half-Life 2 left off.  Needless to say, those who played and enjoyed Half-Life 2 will probably enjoy Episode One, as it continues the captivating storyline of Half-Life 2 over into a new phase following the events of the previous game.

												As Crab said in his recommendation: ""Nothing happens in this game... I mean really you can skip it."" Of course there is a grain of truth in that statement, when held in the light of Episode 2 or even Half-Life 2, Episode One leaves much to be admired. This can be attributed to the games eco-centric location throughout the ruins of City 17 and the Citadel and the lack of varying companions throughout the game. While doing an excellent job making Alyx seem like a more believable character with well scripted combat sequences and animations you can't help but feel that she's holding your hand through it all. Personally I loved EP1 because the raw urban combat of the final levels of Half-Life 2 were my favorite levels, and Episode One extended on that making for an entire game focused on the best part of HL2. All that being said it's not imperative that you play it, and you can go from HL2 straight to EP2 without worry about missing on vital story points.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

												Despite what most people think, i think i may prefer this over episode two. This is due to the fact that it includes a lot of close quarters combat which i enjoy. Anyway, this game is essentially a continuation of Half-Life 2 without too much new to comment on (one or two new enemies are about it.) If you really enjoyed the City 17 levels of Half-Life 2, then get it. If you didn't, you should get it anyway because its frickin' Half-Life!			",111,10,0,2,4,1,4

												The sequal to what I consider to be the greatest game of all time, and it is still pretty good. I liked to think of Episode One as the middle child of the Half Life 2 trilogy. It doesnt really do anything that unique, but is still a very interesting and able game. Most of the enviroments are tight, so its a lot less open world compared to Half Life 2. The absolute best part of this game is the realtionship between Gordan and Alyx. Watching her interact with you is simply amazing. Valve actually made me genuinly care about a character, something very few have. This game only lasted about six or seven hours, but is still a worthwhile experience. Pros:+Everything Half Life+Lighting+Character connectednessNeutral: *Narrow enviroments*The ""Middle Child"" syndromeOverall: 9/10 If anything, you basically need to play this just to get the amazing Episode Two. Its still good in its own respect, but forgetable overall comparted to the other parts. Do not buy this on its own, get it bundled in the Orange Box.			",249,33,2,33,17,3,36

												I know that a lot of people were disappointed by this installment, but I had a hoot playing it. It's been a secret fantasy of mine to be part of a mass exodus out of a doomed city my whole life. I think my secret desire to make such an escape started with a Fourth of July celebration my parents took me to when I was three. These visions of hundreds of people and shimmering explosions in an unfamiliar urban setting stuck in my tiny baby brain and have been with me my whole life. So you can imagine my surprise when over a decade later I'm reliving these memories as I flee City 17 in much the same way I imagined myself all those years ago.This has left me to assume Valve has access to the Jungian archetypes of my mind.

												Another amazing game from Gabe Newell,this started the new and immersive world of lore such as vortigaunts using a vort-howl thing showing that vortigaunts have strong voice-boxes... It's also an introduction to the advisors and the Hunters.I give this game a 10/10.			",36,2,0,0,4,0,1

Half-Life 2: Episode One is a first-person shooter video game, the first in a series of episodes that serve as the sequel for the 2004 Half-Life 2.The game stars immediately after Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman wakes up near the Citadel after Alyx Vance and Dog find him. Gordon and Alyx travel through the City 17 to find train to escape city...VERDICTPros:- Great story.- Excellent voice acting.- Great characters.- Awesome musicCons:- Game has 5 chapters, it is too short.8.5/10 ",85,6,0,13,3,0,2

												In an attempt to reduce production time (that apparently didn't work :P), the rest of the story for Half-Life 2 was broken into an episodic structure. This is episode one. It is shorter, but still just as sweet.This continuation of the FPS Half-Life 2 is just as well done. The same interesting characters, shocking events and horror atmosphere pervade. The same enemies and variety of tools are there. It's just more of Half-Life 2, and, like before, it ends with unanswered questions and begs for more.			",817,309,8,169,83,10,197

A shame that Valve has a phobia of 3's, otherwise Half Life 3 would've been released a few years ago. Varied enviroments to shoots things in, amusing dialogue from the characters and has moments worthy of a 1980's / 1990's action movie...except it doesn't overdo the comedy.			",57,9,0,10,0,0,3

												If you finished Half-Life 2 and wanted some more, then this is the game for you.  Episode One kicks off directly after the events of Half-Life 2 and despite being just a little bit short, the excellent story, game play, audio and visuals continue as well as some small improvements that can be seen if you are paying attention.  It belongs to Half-Life 2 and this should be played as soon as that title has been completed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2: Episone One adds some hours of fun to the Half-Life franchise. This game starts where Half-Life 2 ends and keeps the essence of Half-Life. You will be challenged with a bit more difficult puzzles but nothing extraordinary. Don't expect more than 6 hours to end the game and unlock all achievements. Overall, it's just more Half-Life with nothing new. If you liked Half-Life 2, you will like this new episode.			",145,34,0,19,3,0,24

												The first episode of Half Life 2 is pretty much just like the original. However, this time the game seemed to be repetitive and unfair at times. For instance, there is a part that requires you to navigate through explosive barrels and lasers, all while not getting hit. If you do, then KABOOM. I died several times on these parts, even on easy. The last mission is also extremely repetitive. Overall, it was really good.

												I know that a lot of people were disappointed by this installment, but I had a hoot playing it. It's been a secret fantasy of mine to be part of a mass exodus out of a doomed city my whole life. I think my secret desire to make such an escape started with a Fourth of July celebration my parents took me to when I was three. These visions of hundreds of people and shimmering explosions in an unfamiliar urban setting stuck in my tiny baby brain and have been with me my whole life. So you can imagine my surprise when over a decade later I'm reliving these memories as I flee City 17 in much the same way I imagined myself all those years ago.This has left me to assume Valve has access to the Jungian archetypes of my mind.

												Another amazing game from Gabe Newell,this started the new and immersive world of lore such as vortigaunts using a vort-howl thing showing that vortigaunts have strong voice-boxes... It's also an introduction to the advisors and the Hunters.I give this game a 10/10.			",36,2,0,0,4,0,1

												Despite what most people think, i think i may prefer this over episode two. This is due to the fact that it includes a lot of close quarters combat which i enjoy. Anyway, this game is essentially a continuation of Half-Life 2 without too much new to comment on (one or two new enemies are about it.) If you really enjoyed the City 17 levels of Half-Life 2, then get it. If you didn't, you should get it anyway because its frickin' Half-Life!			",111,10,0,2,4,1,4

												Half Life 2.... did you like the story, and gameplay to Half Life 2, you will like Episode 1. It is a continuation to the epic story from Half Life 2, and Half Life 2 Episode 1.Pros.-Great graphics considering its age (over 10 years old)-runs great even on low end machines.-epic story-good weapon selection-good AIcons:my main gripes about Episode 2 is the same as Episode 1, do not take this as a do not buy this however. I bought this game again even though I own it already on XBox 360 and played through it again here. I love this game :).-In Episode 1 there are no new weapons.-In Episode 1 the story length feels short (the episodes are however cheaper than the base game)-No full controller support (This game does not work with a controller like with the 360.) It is not a big deal, but to say partial controller support is spinning the truth. You cannot celect all of your weapons with a controller. This seems like something that could have been fixed with a patch.All said and done I did play this with a keyboard and mouse. IT was a blast, and the computer version was converted to use a controller (even if with poor support,) so playing with a keyboard and mouse like old school games is no big deal. If you do not already own this game BUY IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.			",94,8,0,13,7,1,10

												Half life 2 was a great game. one of the best i played. Episode 1 is a great game too.in this one, we're accompanied by Alyx Vance the whole time which is very cool and i like her presence so much.i think Alyx Vance and Gordon makes a great team. I like Alyx character she's badass, she's funny at times and ver much helpful. Great voice acting too for all the characters. and there's a new enemiy - the Zombine - which is cool.I like the dark places too, it makes the game more fun and challenging. It's a great game to continue half life 2.i can the valve upgraded the visual a little bit from half life 2.And i like it more with the addition of developer commentary from half life 2 lost coast.i highly recommend this game for everybody. And i pray that someday valve will make episode 3 or Half life 3.10/10 for me for sure			",65,13,0,1,3,0,0

												Half-Life 2: Episone One adds some hours of fun to the Half-Life franchise. This game starts where Half-Life 2 ends and keeps the essence of Half-Life. You will be challenged with a bit more difficult puzzles but nothing extraordinary. Don't expect more than 6 hours to end the game and unlock all achievements. Overall, it's just more Half-Life with nothing new. If you liked Half-Life 2, you will like this new episode.			",145,34,0,19,3,0,24

												Half-ife 2: Episode One is an Action, FPS, Singleplayer game that is a great add on to the rest of Half-Life 2's story, for all you Half-Life 2 fans.All though Half-Life 2, Ep.1 is a short game, it really builds on the story of Half-Life 2, by telling what happened after the defeat of Dr. Breen. The game adds some new features, like flares and and using cars to stop Antlions from spawning in, while retaining all of the machanics from Half-Life 2. Because this game is still made by Valve, the game can be difficult at times, and you might need to take a step back, and try the area a few times, before getting it right, just like games such as the Portal franchise, and, of course, Half-Life 2.Overall, this game is a great game. I really had fun playing it, and recommend to every Half-Life 2 fan out there, who wants that extra amount of gameplay from the franchise.			",117,11,2,11,9,1,12

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is the first story-driven expansion for the original Half-Life 2 by Valve. Taking play mere minutes after the end of the first game's campaign, it follows the effort of both Gordon and Alyx as they try to escape City 17, where the collapse of the Combine Citadel is about to set off a huge explosion.As far as gameplay goes, nothing really changes from the main game, aside for new situations you have to face with the instruments you are given (one sequence, for instance, requires you to shine your flashlight on enemies to help Alyx killing them while you don't have weapons to speak of). Alyx will accompany you for the whole episode and fight alongside you.As a downside, this time around Gordon isn't as effective as in the original Half-Life 2: you spend the first half of the game armed with your gravity gun only and generally you unlock other weapons at a slow pace. While this forces you to relay on the environment and your creativity more, it can get annoying during particularly hard sequences.Half-Life 2: Episode One is roughly three or four hours long and takes places in environments you already got yourself familiar with, but still it expands nicely on the original story and keeps the gameplay fresh enough			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												5/5 starsA mighty fine game if I do say.Well written and complex storyline (be sure to play HalfLife2 first!). Not particularly difficult, but not easy either, so its not like you'll get bored, but at the same time its unlikely you will get stuck for a long time (and if you do theres always the developer console cheat window).I've heard some people say the gore bothers them at points, personally I didn't have this issue but I suppose the corpses lying around and the zombies can be disturbing at points for some people.You will be greatly dissapointed in yourself when you finish the game if you didn't think to buy the HalfLife2 saga as a pack, since its nearly inevitable you'll be drawn to finish the game.

												Half Life 2: Episode One is short, sweet and very enjoyable.Despite the age of the title, the graphics are still attractive by today’s standards, gameplay is great and the story paves the way for the next chapter and leaves you eager to play episode 2.The game does not take more than a couple of hours to complete, but it is time well spent. If you enjoy games not just for the story but also are an achievement hunter, then you can gain 100% of the in-game achievements with relative ease in a single play through. If you own Half Life 2 I recommend adding this to your steam list.			",352,22,11,21,20,4,39

												Just in case anyone is wondering this is not the first installment of the Half-Life 2 series. Episode 1 and 2 are both sequels of the game titled only 'Half-Life 2.' They're actually more-so as an add-on really that expands on the first game in the series. It's just as good as the first one though this time you have an escort throughout most of the game and it's much shorter. Of course it's just as good as the first, it's just an add-on of the first! Though it's almost the same price as the full game when it's not even half as long...Now on to Episode 2!9/10			",914,392,15,94,73,11,147

												Half Life 2: Episode One is short, sweet and very enjoyable.Despite the age of the title, the graphics are still attractive by today’s standards, gameplay is great and the story paves the way for the next chapter and leaves you eager to play episode 2.The game does not take more than a couple of hours to complete, but it is time well spent. If you enjoy games not just for the story but also are an achievement hunter, then you can gain 100% of the in-game achievements with relative ease in a single play through. If you own Half Life 2 I recommend adding this to your steam list.			",352,22,11,21,20,4,39

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is in essence, more Half-Life 2.The only issue I had with Episode One was it's short length, lasting maybe 3 hours at best. Time to get all the achievements should be around 3 hours if you do them all in one playthrough, or 6 if you do it twice.In conclusion, you should buy it just for that reason. For more details, see my Half-Life 2 review.			",121,44,3,6,5,1,10

												Half-Life 2: Episode One is the first of the two episodes that take place after the end of Half-Life 2.After an ending oddly reminiscent of the first game, we are once again left on a cliffhanger after the events of Half-Life 2. This game is the continuation of Half-Life 2, and once again we take control of Gordon Freeman on his unstoppable killing spree.While Episode One is very short in comparison to Half-Life 2, it still holds the same level of quality in terms of gameplay. The same characters are there, and a few new enemies and mechanics are introduced. None of this is exactly game-changing, yet it does keep it fresh. The story lacks a little, which is mainly due to the lenght of the game.There isn't much to say for Episode One that hasn't already been said for Half-Life 2. While it is fun to fight alongside Alyx, it doesn't quite make up for the length of it. If purchased through the Orange Box, it isn't much of a problem.Overall, definitely worth playing, but only as part of the series, and not on its own.			",103,17,0,20,7,0,18

												This game is a direct sequel to Half-Life 2, starting exactly where Half-Life 2 left off. To avoid spoilers, I'll say this. After the first hour or so of gameplay it shifts genres from an action game to a full-on survival horror. If you're trying to get the One Free Bullet achievement it's a terrifying experience as for the most part you're relying on Alyx to shoot anything, and she isn't exactly a powerhouse. All in all, it's great. Terribly short though.			",133,19,3,4,10,3,4

												This game is of course a follow-up on the Half-Life 2 adventures, and what exactly happened after the tower ending in which there was no conclusion to in the main installment. This exact episode will take you through the story about the escape from the great area (and tower) before it explodes completely, which would mean the death of Freeman, Alyx, and pretty much everyone in a great scale area, so it is about escaping ASAP. Afterwards it will take you through the pressing task of saving as many remaining citizens as possible from City 17 before the - again - explosion. Essentially, it is all about escaping City 17. A must if you´re a fan of the series. This episode in particular is only really challenging in the end when it starts firing all sorts of enemies at your face, but is fairly casual-friendly up until the ending chapters - at least on normal and ""expert"". Well, not so much on expert. ;)Have fun!			",39,3,1,0,1,0,3

												Sadly, a very short expansion pack to perhaps one of the greatest FPS games of all time. It is somewhat of an aftermath game as it picks up Gordon's story immediately after the ending of Half Life 2. Gordon and Alyx are separated and in the first part of the game your job will be to find Alyx again then the two of you can continue your journey and fight against the Combine.Other than the usual high production value you can expect from a Valve game there's no new asset here. There are no new enemy types, no new weapons, no new characters introduced. It is not necessarily a problem if you loved HL 2, however, later on they released Episode Two with enhanced graphics, new enemy types and some really good new ideas.Anyway, I am biased here as I love everything that's Half-Life. I hate Valve for not releasing the final episode as with Episode 2 they could not conclude Freeman's story. If you loved Half Life you can pick the two expansion packs labelled as episodes when they are discounted.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												not gonna lie; this is THE WORST hl2 episode. there's only two, so i'm not worried about this being an insult. although, if you didn't know that there's not a third episode, then you probobly have bigger problems. Compared to half life 2 and hl2;ep2, this game isn't quite up to standered. The game's pacing isn't too good, there are a few intresting mechanics, but as valve admits, they didn't have enough time to do what they wanted with said ideas, and it shows. The good news is; if this is what happens when valve is rushed, then that's pretty good. it's hard to get all the plot, (more of a pacing issue) but i deffinatly enjoy the more plot-dense story, and other adjustments an episodic format brings. Being half-life, this is a must-play, and a promising expansion of half-life 2, even if the much-awaited sequal is... well, AWAITED. 9/10			",45,8,0,1,3,0,3

												Half-Life 2: Episode One was exactly what I expected, having the same great gameplay and atmosphere from Half-Life 2. It is basically a continuation of the story from exactly where Half-Life 2 left off so I felt it could have been included in the original game. However, the ending would've been slightly less dramatic that way and splitting the game up was good for pacing. Likes: Same as Half-Life 2, minus the vehicles because there were none. Dislikes: Once again the ending felt a bit rushed, but should probably connect will with Episode 2.Solid canon ""DLC"", good pacing.  9/10			",271,76,12,32,32,2,37

												After Half-Life 2, this ""game"" isn't exactly masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I'm still recommending it - especially is you like Half-Life 2 as much as I did - but the games main problems come in the fact that this feels like it's trying to get you hyped for a potential Half-Life 3. Nothing really happens in the game, it's basically just about Gordon and Alyx escaping the Citidal, and it doesn't add much to the gameplay or the mechanics. Still, it's definitely worth a play just because it's loads of fun, I just wish there was more lore and story. Could be a little more interesting.			",55,1,0,5,1,0,1

												Half Life 2: Episode One while a very short game it is still a great 'short game' to be played. If you want more juicy details check out my Half Life 2 review for more information. Anywho. Let us get the elephant out of the room. This particular episode tries a little bit too hard at what it wants to be. Is this still an action adventure game? Is it a science-fiction horror FPS? The reason why I say this is because unlike in Half Life 2 where the sections are spread out. The ""chapters"" jump from one genre to the next with really no breather for the player. And I guess you can say it's because of the ""intense"" circumstances of the story. But still, Episode One could've used more chapters to spread things out rather than just cramming it all in.The story obviously takes places just hours after the events of Half Life 2. The overall goal is to get out of City 17. That's basically it. You get some ""new"" 'plot questions' in this particular game. But these 'plot questions' won't be explained until Episode 2. And even then, the new plot questions you encountered in this game and in the next episode won't be REALLY answered until (Half Life 3) <- Lol. I recommend this game. But! And this might be a hard pill to swallow. But, I think Episode One and Two should've just been in the ACTUAL Half Life 2 game rather than spacing the game out. It might've been because of budget or giving players a breather. If that's the case then they should've made Ep 1 and Ep 2 into purchasable expansions rather than actual 'full games'. I recommend buying the Orange Box rather than the games seperately btw.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												I always thought ""Half-Life 2: Episode 1"" was a strange name for the continuation of the plot of Half Life 2 and a little undeserving in my opinion. After the hanging thread in Half Life 2, you progress the plot as Gordon Freeman once more to escape City 17 with Alyx Vance before it's reactor goes critical. The game itself can be beat in a little under 2 hours, but it's a DLC so I'll let it slide. Oh yeah: Cliffhanger ending- Check.Pretty short review; not much to say here.I rate Half-Life 2: Episode 1 with a 7/10Wait for it to go on sale before you buy it; I don't think it's worth $8, but the choice is yours.

												It's rather funny that I replayed this game after years, and felt that it still stood up. Everyone is worried that linear FPS story driven games are out and everyone wants BIG SANDBOXES AND TONS OF SIDEQUESTS. This is not the case, if a new game was released, within the same style of ALL THE OTHER HALF LIFE GAMES, it honestly could go either way.I feel like as a huge fan since the 99' title, that I can safely say that's what most of us want. More of the same gameplay, but more to the story. That's what makes half life great y'know?I digress, great game, great series. If you haven't played it what the hell is wrong with you?

												The second installation of the seemingly never-ending Half Life saga is an interesting one. Half Life 2: Episode One is by far the weakest of the series, but the game is required for the complete narrative. The game is awfully slow paced, and it really does nothing to advance the story. Since these episodic installments were supposedly to be released every 3 months, a slower first episode would be resonable, but since the saga is taking its time, its a bit of a dissapointment.8/10. Any Half Life game is great, this one just lags behind a bit.			",113,22,4,15,5,1,5

												The second installation of the seemingly never-ending Half Life saga is an interesting one. Half Life 2: Episode One is by far the weakest of the series, but the game is required for the complete narrative. The game is awfully slow paced, and it really does nothing to advance the story. Since these episodic installments were supposedly to be released every 3 months, a slower first episode would be resonable, but since the saga is taking its time, its a bit of a dissapointment.8/10. Any Half Life game is great, this one just lags behind a bit.			",113,22,4,15,5,1,5

												I just beat it for the second time. I had beaten Half-life 2 again yesterday (I don't ever replay games) and I thought I was going to leave it at that. But no; I still wanted more Half-life greatness. So I moved onto Episode One, and now I expect myself to be replaying Episode Two as well.Episode One starts minutes after the ending of Half-life 2 and Gordon Freeman continues on his journey to fight the powah, with Alyx along with him/you. This is much shorter than Half-life 2, being an ""episode"", but there is a lot more Alyx time in this one, which is a good thing since she has a very good AI and makes for a great partner in the game. So many awesome setpieces thoughout Episode One, but that is to be expected from this consistently-amazing series. If you liked Half-life 2, don't stop there!			",1322,459,34,180,136,12,186

												FOLLOW ME. SET ME FREE. FOLLOW ME AND WE WILL ESCAPE FROM THE CI-TY. Seriously though, this is amazing. It might not change the gameplay, nor the graphics. But the story, the music, and the feel is all more hectic and chaotic than the cold, lonesome, and dark feel of Half LIfe 2. It feels different, but just as good, continuing an already amazing game. It is amazing in it's own right, and is one of the few times that a DLC feels like an actual continuation of the story, and a great one at that. Altough Episode 2 is honestly ""better"". I love this series and you should too. Buy the game, buy the episodes. Just do it. Free humanity.			",137,35,0,21,8,1,8

												Played many years ago, and started again only to be disappointed that the Alyx Vance AI seems to stall the game, its frustraiting waiting for her to constantly finish what she has to say / do to progress the game.I just stopped playing, the AI in the full HL2 game wasnt like this.Seeriosuly AI shut up			",48,10,3,10,8,0,31

												Half-life 2 Episode One, the continue of Half-life 2.. Now you will know what happen next right? Now let's review it!The Gameplay:It's still very fun, you can't go serious at this in anyway... if you're a tryhard player you will. The weapons are still the same but they're so fun messing with it.. The Gravity Gun is the most fun weapon in the game.. so please try to enjoy the game instead of being a 100% tryhard.The Graphics:It improved the graphics than Half-life 2, at least.. playing in 720p won't take it's full effect.. so I highly suggest play this on 1080p and you will see it's texture improvement.The AI's *Artifical Intelligence*:Same as Half-life 2 but the AI's are now good.Rating: 9/10Why not 10/10?, Cause I can't give a game that is 10/10..I highly suggest people buy this only for Half-life Series Fan or a FPS Shooter Fan.

												Half-Life Episode One is a blast to play. I really enjoyed it.It's as epic as Half-Life 2 is, but what bothers me is that the length is VERY short, for an explorer like me you finish this game in max 6 hours.Beside this fact i still think this is a very, very good episode. Continuing directly where Half-Life 2 left off and i think the interactions and releations with Alyx and the other charachters seems to be stronger and better then in 2.It got as usual, great levels, graphichs and more. And one hell of a cliffhanger at the end.9/10 would defenitly reccomend to play (make sure you played Half-Life 2 before playing this) ",770,207,34,101,64,5,118

												A great game that didn't take long at all to beat. The only thing that made it harder for me was that I tried for all the achievements the first time and couldn't use a gun the whole time because I was going for the ""The One Free Bullet"" achievement were you don't use a gun the whole time except for one time to open a gate for Alyx. The story just added onto the Original Half Life 2. You must play Half Life 2 to fully understand what is going on in this game. The graphics are great, the gameplay was smooth and very well done. I highly recommend getting this game to any Half Life fan.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												comparing this to Half life 1, Half life 2, and Half life2 episode 2 is one of the worst in my opinion doesnt making it bad just last one i play out of the rest. The map design is good imernsing you in your hand in the destruction of the citdal causing City 17 and all the innocent lives that cant making it out to get decemated in the blast. After sometime you enter one of my favorite parts the dark level. Where you need to conserve your light and use it wisly like your ammo agiants the zombies and new enemy the zombine which use grenades which kills most of the slow zombies basicly splitting your zombies in a tight area in half.But sprinting and flashlight power should have been seperated also the game is to short i would have love if it was longer being close in dark areas with a lack of ammo. Getting to see more of the destroyed city and the collaspe of the combine interio. Overall is not bad or good depending how you see it but it not for me personlly so it netural.			",63,3,0,1,2,0,2

												Existing as a sort of ""Half-Life 2"" in miniature, ""Episode One"" is another brilliant example of gaming craftsmanship. The amount of effort put into creating relatable characters, a deep universe, and gameplay almost without peer is clearly evident......and then you switch on the commentary, and get an even deeper look at just how much care went into the making of the experience.

												Existing as a sort of ""Half-Life 2"" in miniature, ""Episode One"" is another brilliant example of gaming craftsmanship. The amount of effort put into creating relatable characters, a deep universe, and gameplay almost without peer is clearly evident......and then you switch on the commentary, and get an even deeper look at just how much care went into the making of the experience.

												It is a continuation of Half Life 2. Alyx teams up with you throughout the entire game, being a great companion and an efficient fighter. She will help is dispatching enemies too, though her default weapon is weak until she finds a shotgun later on. Either way, she is a great addition to the game.The game is relatively short, only lasting 6-8 hours. The achievements encourage multiple playthroughs , especially going for the near impossible One Free Bullet (finish the game firing one bullet, which has to be used to break a lock at the start of the game. You can use the crowbar, grenades, mounted guns, rockets, and of course the iconic gravity gun, one of the best weapons in any video game. Ever).Overall, while it may be shorter by  15 or so hours when compared to Half life 2, the quality is still there. You have the linear formula that made the previous game great, along with more challenge in the form of dark underground sections and strider runs.  A brilliant game from beginning to end. Like Half Life 2, I recommend this to Half Life fans and the general First person shooter community alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing sequel to Half Life 2. It is a bit shorter though, but the experience was as great if not greater. I loved the new HDR feature, the new mechanics of Alyx's combat, animations, how the things worked, the developer's commentary, 10/10 game. I have been once again amazed with the beauty of half life works. I definitely recommend this game. It's really nice! But I recommend playing the half life series all the way from half life 1 up to half life 2 episode 2, that's the best way.The gameplay is good, as always, not some simple shooter that you would find in some forsaken company.The graphics are too good to be explained with our human dictionary.The bugs... well, I have found one bug, although I am not sure if that's even a bug. So basically at the last chapter (Spoiler alert) I was taking the citizens to the trains, everything was good until one of them was stuck somewhere beside the stairs, he could move but he was killed instantly, what I mean is that he could have ran to the trains and would have got me an achievement, but he wasted it and died.Anyways, the game is just perfect. Played on the same breath.			",49,6,0,1,5,0,1

												This is an amazing sequel to Half Life 2. It is a bit shorter though, but the experience was as great if not greater. I loved the new HDR feature, the new mechanics of Alyx's combat, animations, how the things worked, the developer's commentary, 10/10 game. I have been once again amazed with the beauty of half life works. I definitely recommend this game. It's really nice! But I recommend playing the half life series all the way from half life 1 up to half life 2 episode 2, that's the best way.The gameplay is good, as always, not some simple shooter that you would find in some forsaken company.The graphics are too good to be explained with our human dictionary.The bugs... well, I have found one bug, although I am not sure if that's even a bug. So basically at the last chapter (Spoiler alert) I was taking the citizens to the trains, everything was good until one of them was stuck somewhere beside the stairs, he could move but he was killed instantly, what I mean is that he could have ran to the trains and would have got me an achievement, but he wasted it and died.Anyways, the game is just perfect. Played on the same breath.			",49,6,0,1,5,0,1

												Episode 1 is really just more of the same. It continues on from the very moment the original game finished and the player will find themselves in the thick of the action right from the start. I must admit that I thought there would be more new guns, enemies and locations in this expansion. But it appears that Valve made a decision to concentrate solely on storytelling and leading the player through a constant flow of thrilling and challenging scenarios.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

												My review for Half-Life 2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/220It's good, damn good but it's not as good as Half-Life 2 or Episode 2. This has got some damn good atmosphere and combat sequnces and while short stands tall as an excellent adventure amongst FPS titles and expansions. That said it really is the middle child of the Half-Life 2 family. From replaying I've come to think it's real weaknesses come from it's exposition heavy,slow start and opening Citadel chapters. Especially when  all combined. It has you teamed up with Alyx for the entire episode and thankfully she is well written, helpful and interesting and a damn impressive showcase of AI unlike a certain Sheva. At the same time though you'll often be locked into what I call little ""cutscene"" rooms. YES you can move around freely as control is never taken away from the player in the Half-Life games but while these ""cutscenes"" as well written and interesting as they are are also unskipable and if it's not your first time playing all you can do is leap around like a fussy cat and make people look like an idiot as you attempt to jump on their head or find something to throw. The tunnels, and ESPECIALLY the remains of City 17 are when it's best. The Citadel isn't bad, FAR FROM IT, but it wasn't my favorite part on repeat playthroughs and it keeps me from speedily progressing to my favorite parts faster if I don't skip massive chunks of the gamet via chapter select that is.Episode 1 does a lot of things scripting and scenario wise that I've never seen all together in one single FPS game before especially in terms of it's design and layout but then it will repeat some of these good parts a little too much and as a cherry on top will have a character openly say ""oh god no"", ""not again"" and ""here we go again"" winkingly as you do a reocurring scripted sequence involving Combine, explosives and doors. Having a character remark at how over used a gimmick in game is and then DOING the gimmick anyway does not then excuse or fix the gimmick. It sticks out like a sore thumb as this sort of thing is uncommon in the game prior. It's like when Duke in Duke Nukem Forever sighed in disgust at a literal pipe puzzle and said ""I hate Valve puzzles."" and then proceeding to do it anyway. (And no I am not saying anything in this game is as bad as any part of the Duke Nukem Forever.)It's short (real short) but sweet and unless you don't wan't to wait forever for a conclusion after you play Episode 2 I highly reccomend you play Episode 1.

												[SPOILER REVIEW]This game is pretty boring to be honest. They should've had more to offer, as there was no more than 7 chapters, and they are not very fun. It would've been fine if they didn't make this game only 3 hours long, and added a decent storyline. There wasn't much of an atmosphere that you got from the first game, which was escaping from Black Mesa, but that was worked out really good, and I thought it was better than Half Life 2, but this tries to have you escaping City 17, and it isn't very tension building or fun.This game does not deserve it's $8 price tag, you should just search up the storyline to Episode 1 and go straight to episode 2.

												The equivalent of a filler episode. You could probably go right from HL2 into episode 2 because of how little happens in this episode. It's still a Valve game and has it's moments but it's plot is stretched thin between predictable puzzles and fights. Worth playing if you get it in a bundle but I wouldn't recommending purchasing it on it's own.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												I was mixed about the original Half-Life 2, so what can I say about Episode One?  Well, it's merely more of the same...just shorter.  I bet some of you are rolling your eyes and going, ""Well, DUH, that's why it's called Half-Life 2: Episode ONE!""  Well, it certainly feels as if I played the game already...which I did...and Episode One is merely the equivalent of a DLC add-on...which, given the title, it certainly is.  The game doesn't really add anything new apart from a new area to trudge through, continuing from the previous game obviously, and about one to three new enemies to shoot at for the entire game.  This is the same FPS-platforming-puzzle story I've played already, only this time it felt as if the whole thing was going in reverse.  An example would be how in the original game, the gravity gun got upgraded at the end, whereas in Episode One, it gets upgraded at the very beginning...and then it's suddenly downgraded to its usual status during the rest of the game.  I was hoping I would be able to lift and throw enemy bosses with the thing had the upgrade stayed on, but the game said no, which is still a very major flaw with this game.  Getting through Episode One literally got me through half the time it took to get through the orignal game, and that's including getting almost every Achievement.  All in all, what can I really say that hasn't been said before?			",26,1,0,5,3,0,5

												Again for the ""half"" sequel to half life 2, valve brings you HALF LIFE 2 EPISODE 1 BABEH! :D 1 thing im already gonna say about this one is just to me i think, the graphics look a tad bit better, along with the controls feel a bit more smoother. For some reason i think that. Impressive sequel, (as we all know was gonna have to happen if you have seen the end of the first half life 2) that blew my mind to find out that they made a sequel. Up next, Episode 2! :D9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not gonna say, what this is bad game, but it could be better, though. It feels like, you are doing it for achievements only, not for the game itself. I did only 1 run, you can ""Catch them all"", if you will constantly save and won't screw in some places. But it's a bit boring, to be honest. But it's also a only a half of this. Maybe it will interesting, if you do episode 2 right after you did this episode.My advice is grab this game only in discount (and maybe even in a pack, if you want to. It's not worth 8$ (According to SteamDB) for a half of the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's hard to judge this game, because it may be considered both a part of the larger HL2 story, or a standalone game, but I'll consider only the second case - players falling in the first, surely know what/why they want to play.Well, HL2E1 didn't age well at all. I've played HL2 10+ years ago, then bought the Orange box this year following the glowing reviews, but it's been a big disappointment.In order to give perspective, it's important to consider that Bioshock - which aged really good instead, was released only one year after (same as HL2E2).The story arc is trivial and short.The physics-based puzzles are boring by today's standards - pick the ball, and put it into the container, wash, rinse and repeat.The sidekick just can't stop talking.The environments are banal.If you want to play a standalone game from the past, there is much much better.

												I give this game a mild thumbs down. It’s sort of fun, but it’s by far the weakest game in the series. There are too many poorly designed missions and not enough variety in the scenery/activities.There is one overtly tedious mission near the start when you are trying to shoot the reactor with lasers that is just mind numbing. Also, towards the end of the game there is an escort mission that’s a candidate for worst escort mission ever. It’s bad enough, you have to ferry survivors to safety once, but for this mission you have to lead multiple groups over the same territory a half a dozen times.If you are a fan of the series, you will probably get enjoyment out of this game, I’m just disappointed that it wasn’t anywhere near as good as Half Life 2.6 /10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm between Yes and No for recommending this game. Althought this episode was a little chaotic and objectives were not very fun, I still think it is a crucial episode in the Half Life franchise.The game is good but worse than Half Life 2 in few ways. The storytelling is a little rubbish and it was more like I was watching a really long cutscene with mediocore objectives such as escorting civilians four times in a row, it felt more like a ""transition"" from HL2 to Episode Two. The only unique thing about fighting in this game is that it made good use of the flashlights. Lots of dark areas in this game, almost horror considering I'm arachnophobic and headcrabs scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me.On the bright side, I think what this episode had done well is the relationship between Gordon and Alyx. There were many suggestive scenes and dialogues that made us feel like Alyx did have some sort of a school girl crush on Gordon since HL2. I thought this episode really gave us a chance to let Alyx blend into the story much more so her existence is a little more obvious and valuable. I really thought everything was natural and it wasn't forced, they did well on this part. So kudos to them.BUT THEN AGAINWHERE IS HALF LIFE 3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent continuation, of one of the best FPS games around. Damn well worth it if you enjoyed HL1 & or 2(Although if you skip 2 you'll be missing out on a lot).Pros: Successfully builds upon an already fantastic story. The gameplay is just as good as HL2.Cons: Very short. Alyx & the citizens you escort are dumb as bricks & will get you killed at times. No cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game... Before the review of this game I will say my opinion about the sagaI had some fun while playing Half Life 2 and it's episodes but... People say that is one of the best games ever, Half Life 1 is a good game, also a revolutionary game, and even one of my favorite games, but Half Life 2 and it's episodes aren't that great, the source engine created an overated game, because the only jump between Half Life and Half Life 2 was the look and the enviroment, but if you want a super especial history or gameplay like people say then you probably will get a disapointment, is a good game but nothing especial or extraordinary...With my opinion of the whole saga out of the way my opinion about this episode is just that is like a short DLC, not too short but not as long as I spected, I already completed the 100% and dind't got anything different from Half Life 2, same weapons, same enemies, literaly same enviroment. The only changes were the maps and... That's about it, the game is really a regular campaign DLC so for the recent market of the AAA games this is a jew... So yeah you decide if you want it.

												Please bare in mind I literally played this for the first time today (Nov 2016).I remember everyone saying that this was the game that sculpted modern day games. Particularly FPS games. Now I understand why so many of those tedious stand and waste time moments exist in games. Half Life 2.So many times in this very short episode do you stand there watching a wheel go round slowly while you open a shutter. For no other reason than to waste our time.I enjoy the physics puzzles still. They should be used more in gaming.The AI drove me insane though! Several times I got trapped in a doorway with Alex stood behind me not moving. Where I had to load or kill myself to get free.I have no real care for anything in this world. To be honest I have almost no idea what the f*** I just did for the last couple of hours. Why does this episode even exist?You wake up. Lurch from area to area doing ""stuff"" and then the credits roll. That's pretty much it. The slimsy bit of story that exists kind of gets forgotten until the last scene.Maybe back in the day this was excellent but honestly this gameplay no longer stands up. The last few years we've seen the resurfacing of open world games. That is for the best. Linear♥♥♥♥♥ time wasting shooters are no longer entertaining for me.Plus since the whole ""Chapter 3"" has yet to emerge in any form I guess the second chapter is going to be just as pointless story wise.Yes I apreciate this is an old game but honestly I'm feeling like you had to be there nearer to its release to understand the appeal. Glad I waited for a sale to play this now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My old review was too long, so let's clean it up.  Overall, 6 or 7 out of 10.  Not a definite recommendation.  Only play it if you don't mind slogging through the middle of the game where it's absolutely no fun at all.This game was decent.  It's a linear shooter.  It's the low point of the Half-Life series, but it still was fun until you got to the ""Low Lifes"" chapter.  Then, we get to fight the real enemies, not this underground-low light crap with antlion spam.  We get combines and more zombies, with Alyx usually either sniping or in the middle of a battle with you, which means no more cheesy lines from her that irritate the hell out of you.  The hospital level was perfect for getting you out of the underground crap, taking you right into where the game belongs... something reflected in Episode 2, where we didn't have that downtime where antlions are everywhere and we can't see anything.As for storyline, maybe it felt different as what ""re-opened the HL series and made something out of that unresolved ending from HL2,"" but for me, it felt like that explanation between HL2 and Episode 2.  It would be fine as a 3-minute recap (which is in there for Episode 2, if you just want to skip over this).  It's okay.  The storyline itself is just continuing HL2 straight from the ending, where (NOT SPOILING IT) and you wake up in a junkyard where D0G uncovers you.  You go back to (NOT SPOILING IT) via junkyard car now powered by D0G's incredible hulk powers and (NOT SPOILING IT).  You end up... look, I can't tell you, it's all just spoilers.  It was okay for storyline, while adding more space for time-consuming lore that I'll never even bother to google because of my social life conflicting with spending all my time pondering the mysteries of the Half-Life franchise.Either get this game and force yourself through the middle part where the game sucks, or just skip to Episode 2, a game without any sort of ""crappy section,"" and watch the 3 minute recap of Episode 1 complete with post processing as soon as you click new game.  The choice is yours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holy crap! Is all i can say. There is only one complaint that i have and its the AI! Oh lord! She is only good for opening doors and killing. Which in Half Life you would think is enough. But this is the first Half Life, and Valve game, where i was frustrated by the difficulty. A challenge is one thing, but this is on a whole nother level. Alyx will literally not go where i want her to go, and for some reason this game has two(maybe more) instances where you are basically at the mercy of how good and how fast she can kill things. The scenes i am talking about are the ones where you turn the wheel to open the gate. And it would not be a problem if there were not so many antlions poking you causing the gate to close.I would have thought that having someone follow you around would make the game a little bit easier, and she is pretty handy, but having her around is just a nuisance. In Half Life 2 there was a part where you ""command"" soldiers to navigate the streets to get to the Citadel. And just keeping them alive was a pain because they went where the pleased most of the time. But at least for them you had some sort of control. Ive found myself having to push her to go where i want her to.The good things i have to say about this game were the graphics and story. I played Half Life 2 on Xbox and on my Xbox 360.  And that game came out a while ago, so the graphics werent as sharp or at least from my experience. But wow! The graphics were amazing! This is a beautiful game.The story is great. I am already hooked and it is only the beginning stages of the game. Valve does a good job at making people want to continue the game just to find out what happens next in the story. In Half Life 2: episode one I am trying to bear the headache of having Alx join me because ever since i finished Half Life 2 many years ago I was left wanting more, especially with that ending!Overall i do recommend this game but buyer beware that it will take a whole lot of patience and a whole lot of time to get used to her. The main reason i think buyers would like this game is for the story. If you care more about the story then this game satisfies that. It is definitely a game that gamers should play at least once in their life just to experience Alyx AI			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Valve made a gigantic mistake with their episodic release concept. It tried to deliver content faster and it failed immensely, giving chunks that just weren't enough to please fans at the time. The cliffhanger ending didn't help either, a cheap way to end any game. Then if that wasn't enough, they stuck Alyx at the side of the player throughout the game. She becomes more of a nuisance than a welcome partner, mainly with her intimate remarks towards the player. Her nonstop presence is in stark contrast to previous titles, where the player's quest was mostly a lonely ride with only short periods where characters followed. This sense of isolation really improved the previous titles, and here I feel it was a bad design choice to stick Alyx to the player for all of the ride. I think the main reason why Alyx doesn't work, is because she ends up trying to be romantic with the player and not Gordon, as Gordon doesn't talk or have any personality, he's just a suit for the player to wear. This ends up being incredibly awkward.All in all the episodic content idea was bad, even Valve knows this. It delivered an underwhelming chunk of a game that didn't provide enough, and it was also marred by the continous presence of a character whose remarks towards the player were more cringe inducing than story-building.

												I like Half-Life cause you can play it in your own flow, just a few stops here and there to tell the story throughout the game, but this one got me frustrated so much right at the start that i stopped playing.I really don't need a door opener...Alyx was more of a pain then a help, constantly ruining the motion of the game and her AI is as dumb as a sack of potatoes.

												It took me ten years to finally play this and wow is is brutally terrible. Half-life and Half-life 2 are two of my favorite games ever, and Episode 2 is more nuanced in its extension of the story if still kind of mediocore, but this game.....this game is so frustrating, terribly paced, terribly difficult and overall such a mess that it made me angry. Don't buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best sequel a game could ever had: Valve once again proved that despite the long waiting time they do make sure that once they put up a game, its a quality work and its indeed true for the Half Life series. Very good continuation of the original story, Episode One takes the player and doesnt let down until the end, with its fantastic, adrenalin-pumping story and for the first time featuring Alyx too among Gordon Freeman and how their relationship evolves during the game, thanks to the absolutly well done character rag-doll animating.This game is a must buy for all the Half Life series fan. Despite being quite short, it stands up quite well for what it is and absolutly worth its price			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2: Episode One. I guess you can say....It's a HALF-Sequal. Admit it...you smiled a little....Smile for Gaben's sake you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So this sort of half sequal to the game is very short game. It's five bucks right now, but I say it's worth it. Kind-of. I am in the middle between Yes and No to recommending this. It's short and it's not as hard as I expected. Or maybe that's just the love of Half Life 2 talking. Gameplay: Same as the old one. Graphics: Better than Half Life 2. When I first entered the game and saw Alyx's face. I was smiling because it was more HD than HL2. But those effects start wearing off after I started focusing on the gameplay. But I have to admit I did was in awe here and there after the effects seemed to have rolled off.Music: Great as always in my opinion.Why should I not buy this game?It's very short. So you have TWO (bad joke) options if you like HL2. Get the game or watch a guy complete it on youtube. If you dont mind watching it on Youtube. Watch it on Youtube! If you mind, you should get the game.Ending statements:It's up to you. I am in the middle of this so I cant really say what you should pick. Watch it on Youtube or get the game. *Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am kinda glad I bought this episode as part of a winter sale.  Half LIfe 1 and 2 are amazing games.  Episode 1 so far is really boring.  I am already tired of having to figure out problems while being attacked constantly.  Oh and yes most of this episode is in the dark, I guess they thought the flashlight was being under used.  I can't recommend this because it truely is a weak update that isn't worth $8.79.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now... This game... By no means is good. I'd say it is slightly below mediocre (Probably didn't spell that right) First of all, you should only play this is you have beaten Half-Life 2. Second of all, it's just not very good. It's short, and un-interesting. It's all repeated gameplay from the last game. The only reason you should get this is if you really, really enjoyed Half-Life 2, and are wanting to play Episode 2. Episode 2 is so much better than this. So, if you can power through this game you will not be as disapointed in the next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't have much to say on this one. Unlike Blue Shift or Opposing Force, Episode One just feels like ""More HL2"" as opposed to a fresh expansion. It's much shorter than the main game, which makes it less tedious as you feel like actual forward progress is made, but other than that all I can say is I probably would've had more fun if I weren't going for that ""use no bullets"" achievement.

												Short and boring but you gotta get over it to play very well made Episode 2Half of episode is just running with alyx through the tunells, it gets little better when you finally get out but like you see, my playtime for this game is pretty short. Cant recommend it, its almost as unnecessary as Barneys expansion in first Half-Life.

												its a pretty good game but it does have its downsides. for example, there isnt alot of battles and most of the time you just walk around. another reason is that it isnt realy expanding the story(isnt realy changing alot of the storyline), and the last thing is that its actually realy short for other half life 2 games.,     basiclly its a good game but it could have been better			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only play this for the storyline or if you're a hardcore HL fan. There's only a couple chapters (the last one is just a teaser for HL2: ep.2), the order in which you aquire guns is way outa' whack (you only get the crowbar towards the end of the game), and the ""Lowlife"" (third chapter) levels are more of an annoyance than a theme. There's only one gunship and strider in this game that you get to fight and in terms of new enemies, all you get is the zombine. Going back to the lack of chapters, I'd like to point out that even if you're not speedrunning, you can beat this game in about three hours.Why this gets an 80+ MetaCritic rating I have no idea. I'd give it a 6/10; VALVE really messed this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life was a real good game and Half-Life 2 improved on it so much.But this Episode didn't even try to 'revolutionize' the Half-Life franchise.I love Half-Life but this Episode's gameplay felt like a direct copy-paste of Half-Life 2...The story was fine I actually felt like that was the cake but for a franchise built up around revolution it didn't fill the gap between Half-Life 2 and the game I am currently playing (guess what it is) which I am particularly enjoying so i'd say if you are playing the games from Half-Life to Blue Shift to Opposing Force to Half-Life 2 etc you would have to play it but if your playing Half-Life not for the story than it's worth passing over.Post-Script: if my time spent in this game seems a little off it is because I played it offline.

												I have recently played HL2 for the first time and I hated it. I heard so many good things about it, but couldn't like it at all. Of course, the game is dated. I've got HL ep. 1 & 2  at the same time and now I'm playing this game and I hate it again. I want to play it because I don't like having games on my steam that I haven't touched, but this game frustrates me. I'm only at the beginning, but the girl (whatever her name is) is so annoying. She's comepletely useless and stands always in the way and takes to long to open a door. With only the gravity gun (first part of game) to kill the enemies, the game is slow and not fun for me. I hope the game changes this up a lot, because if this keeps on going like it does now, I won't finish this game and never start ep. 2. The game takes a lot (almost everything) from HL2, so if you liked that game, I guess you'll like this one as well. I know the half life franchise is a fan-favorite of many gamers, but for me, it's not good. There are way better shooters out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really was wainting a better game. it pains me talk like that of a Half Life game, but that is the truth. This game 2 hours playing and all I can say is, the plot is boring, you just run through a ruined factory, or whatever, using only the gravity gun. For God sake, why you need to pass more than one hour using only the gravity gun, what sucks as a weapon, when every enemy is using a machine gun?!! Their weapons simple vanish preventing you from getting it. The gravity gun should be like the kinetic in Dead Space, a bad and slow weapon used only you are out of ammo, just like the classic crowbar. If you only will give me only the bad weapon, give me my crowbar! And when you finally get you gun, the alien zombie enemies, that don't shoot you, begins to appears. It means, the game can have you using the gravity gun against armed soldiers, but you need a gun to fight unarmed aliens. Very logical!Half Life 1 is one of the best games I ever played, I really though that Half Life 2 was inferior into everything, with exception of graphics, than the first one, but still playable, beatable and funny. But this third one, is too weak, it is boring, have parts the that♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. For exemple, the part of elevator that wreckage falls from the ceiling, and you are supose to shoot that before it falls, but they end uo falling and breaking the elevator too fast for you to get a shock orb (or whatever that is) and shoot them in the falling wreckage, and the gravity gun has too little range to shoot them directly in time. I needed to repeat that many time until I finally got the way, and the next part, you are supose to grab a computer out of the way with the gravity and shoot a shock orb, but there is no indication that you can grab that, and that is a major flaw of the gravity gun, you never know when you can shoot the gravity repeller, or grab any thing, and when it decides you can shoot, doesn't mean you can grab, this takes me to other part of the game that sucks, when the train crashes. There you can shoot anywhere, but can grab nothing, I needed a walkthrough to figure out that I needed to grab the soldier that was attacking the girl, and drag him out for she to escape, until there I was only shooting him, what more should I think? The gun shoots, the thing is attacking, so shoot him.Anyway, being Half Life doesn't make a good game, the Valve should had it tested to the end before launching, and correcting this problems, and rethink the idea.

												You would think that a game of this age would be nearly bug free, however not even 20 minutes into the game a player can experiance a game breaking glitch which can ruin the entire experiance. Valve has known this glitch exists(as its all over the web) yet they have elected to do absolutely nothing regarding it. So overall, you might not get past the first 20 minutes without resetting, reinstalling, and reconfiguring the game... Good job Valve.However, having 100 percented the game I can offer a more in depth look into the game, while always offering the classical challenge of the Half-Life series, this game seems to ease the burdon on the challenge as the first whole level of the game you have the one shot grav gun, after that there isnt much a challenge with te shotgun.A third aspect is that the game was overall short, it took me four hours for the storyline but after that with the action moments of the game, it just feels like there wasnt a long in-depth playthrough but rather a 30 minute short film... Overall, I would say wait for Half-Life 3, but since that will never exist you should buy this anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not like the half life series. The npc (Alyx) has unlimited ammo and you usually have hardly any. You have to just stand there pointing your flashlight at monsters so that Alyx can shoot them. The routes you have to walk are often ridiculous and conveniently inconvenient.

												The story of Half-Life gets even deeper with this part 1 mini-series, or episode 1 (Or, you know, not HL3).  This game takes place literally seconds after where we're left off in HL2.  The game feels like Half-Life 2, which feels good to begin with.  Valve offers yet another great sub-story to support the main Black Mesa story.  The objective?  To escape the quickly dying City 17.  The final boss just makes it feel like another enemy in the game who you're defeating to advance to your next challenge.  Except, your next challenge doesn't take place until the next episode (or HL3, Pt. 2, except not HL3 because Gabe Newell doens't know how to please an audience).  So, as you look back at the crumbling Citadel, just remember that (insert another overused HL3 joke here).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review contains spoilers regarding Half-Life 2.Riding on the high octane ending of Half-Life 2 and acting as a direct continuation, Half-Life 2: Episode One manages to be a safe, if not fulfilling, addition to the Half-Life series.Sticking with the known working formula, in Half-Life 2: Episode One you resume control of Gordon Freeman. Throwing the ending of that game to one side, Gordon finds himself back in City 17 with Alyx and a Citadel on the verge of leveling the entire city. Throughout this episode you venture back into the Citadel to contain the core and then proceed to try and escape City 17 before its destruction.The issue with this game is it brings very little new to the table. The environments are all rehashes of what was seen in HL2 - the Citadel, the streets and buildings of City 17. The only original feeling portion of the game is where you have to fight through a hospital, constantly being assaulted by Combine and Zombies, with an assault ship opening fire through any window you pass by. Amongst the zombie horde is a new creature: the Zombine. This headcrabbed Combine soldier is stronger and faster than the other zombies, possessing the ability to pull grenades out in a kamikaze run. It spices up the variety little, but only a little, for the most aprt they still act like everything else you've encountered so far. The sections with the Citadel are interesting; now a degenerating and highly unstable building that the Combine are fleeing, but ultimately it's not too indifferent from the final stages of HL2.The final, and largest, criticism is the length. This game can be completed in roughly five hours. For a game that offers little advancement in plot, instead focusing mainly on combat, there's not a lot here to make it an essential play. Don't get me wrong, it's worth playing if not just to have an excuse to dip back into the HL2 world, but this game struggles to have any sort of re-playability value when HL2 does everything this game does - only better.

You still get to use the Gravity Gun and you still get to ride some cars, but it all seems much lazier than the second episode or the original Half-Life 2. I don't know why, but it just feels there's not enough action, and even though Half-Life as a whole is a linear shooter, Episode One feels like one maybe a bit too much. But it still is a great game, just not as good as the previous or the next installment...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now that’s what I like to see a proper story expansion where you play was the same character from the first 2 games. Even though it uses the same game engine as Half-Life 2, I would have to say that’s what I find appealing about this add-on. No over the top graphics no stupid fancy weapons a gripping story line and unique game in general, Vale have their customers at the forefront of their priorities list making sure they have the best gaming experience possible. Vale keep up the good work I rate this game 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												a bit of a step down but still a good shooter that keeps the story going from part 2. you can say you spend the first half of this game in the dark, which isnt really fun but gets better when you are finally out of it and start shooting up the city again. this time alyx is always by your side which is pretty welcoming and does some serious damage and also gets out of your way when under heavy fire. so yeah, its still good.

												I would like to say that HL2:Ep1 is such extraordinary as his precursor: i can't. Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing game by all means, but it lacks in innovation. It feels like only more HL2 (what is not bad) and i was expecting something fresh.Despite this, HL2:Ep1 is a great game and has so much quality as HL2. It is more story driven and does a really good job in this field.Positives:+ More history development;+ The characters are well developed.+ Pretty much so awesome as HL2.Negatives:- It's a little too short;- Lacks in innovation;9.5/10 - It's great and a deserved sequel!

												For who played the first two Half Life games, I think this is the ♥♥♥♥♥iest Half Life 2 game. The game works only to continue the story of Half Life two, with a 3-5 hours gameplay. This isn't a bad game, but Valve didn't had the work it had with the other HL games. I think the next episode continues with the same storytelling but with some work on the gameplay (I haven't played HL2 - EP2 yet). My advice? If you play this amazing series for the fun gameplay, the kickass soundtrack and the AMAZING story, you have to play this one. If you play it just for fun and don't even know what you are playing, go back to other FPS games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game but even after playing Half-Life 2 i was confused as to what was going on. The game was surprisingly short and didn't end very either. If you're planning on playing Episode Two, buy and play this gamem but beware its a boring part.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whilst being a confusing and wordy title, It's fortunate that Valve decided to name their sequel 'Episode One' because its obvious that HL2Ep1 isn't a full-blown sequel the same way Half Life 2 was. Half Life 2 was a gamechanger the same way Half Life 1 was. It further pushed the almagamation of gameplay and storytelling whilst expanding even more on the open-ended, dynamic gameplay system HL1 introduced. The Source Engine was unlike anything ever seen before, and to this day no game has toyed with physics like HL2. Obviously HL2Ep1 couldn't do this all again after just one year. But, whilst the game is still very much worth your time, it's lacking and could have been so much better. Alarm bells ring from the start as you find yourself back in the Citadel with an overcharged Gravity Gun throwing Combine around. Didn't we do this in the last game? Then we lead a group of resistance fighters around City 17 as war breaks out, then we battle a single gunship, and for an encore we fight a solitary Strider as the final boss. (Remember in HL2 when we battled over three Striders at once?)There are some notable stabs of inspiration, however. Whilst the third chapter in the abandoned subway is a glorified sewer level, the last section where Alyx and Gordon must fight a large wave of zombies in the pitch black is sufficiently claustrophobic and tense. The part in the hospital is also fun for the same reasons. Where the game really shines is with Alyx. There's a reason why she's on the cover of this game, and that's because its really her game. We see her go through a variety of emotions throughout, all of which builds her as a likeable and necessary character. Along with Elizabeth from 'Bioshock Infinite', she's one of the most useful and unobtrusive companions in gaming. I think the reason why I like the part in the hospital is because of the strange thrill I got pumping shotgun shells into zombies whilst Alyx stood beside me doing the same. Also, I highly reccomend going for the 'One Free Bullet' achievement. Valve originally didn't want to give the player weapons until the third act of the game, hence the amount of throwable objects lying around levels (free tip: Radiators are the best weapon in the game. Always have a radiator to hand). They decided this was too limiting for the player, so after the first hour you immediately trip over a gun and cannot proceed until you've shot the lock off a door. But, of course, this doesn't stop the player from using the Gravity gun all the time anyway - and this self-imposed restriction is emergent gaming heaven. Fights turn from fast-paced if repetitive skirmishes into frantic, tactical puzzle solving....except the puzzle is always 'should I throw the computer monitor or the radiator?' This is also when Alyx shines, because often you need to rely on her to pick away at enemies whilst you distract them by tossing furniture. As you can imagine, this method of gameplay also creates many unintentional moments of comedy as you stack all the radiators and computer monitors in a pile ready for the next wave of enemies whilst Alyx looks on, quietly judging. Of course, you still need to use your rocket launcher....I found out the hard way that radiators don't work on Striders...Unlike Episode 2, which despite a slow start morphed into an excellent game that felt like the sequel we'd been waiting for (remember that final battle? And the moment right after?) this game feels much more like an expansion pack. Not in an 'Opposing Force' way, but in a 'Blue Shift' way. It's fun, but only because its more of the same.

												Half-Life 2: Episode One. This game is certainly the weakest part of the Half-Life series. I personally enjoyed my time with it as it gave a better conclusion to Half-Life 2, this episode doesn't add  much when it comes to storyline or gameplay but I feel like anyone that is playing through the Half-Life games needs to play this game to experiance the Half-Life series as a whole. As you can see from my hours played it is a very short game but It was enjoyable none the less. If you are only playing through one Half-Life game I wouldn't recommend this one due to its length. In comparison to Episode 2 and the original Half-Life 2 this game just lacks something. But like I said if you are playing through the Half-Life series give it a shot and enjoy the horrible wait for Half-Life 3/Episode 3 like the rest of us!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be perfectly honest, I was very dissapointed with this game. It seemed like nothing more than a quickly thrown together DLC addon. Now, for the much lower price point from Half-Life 2, I don't know what I was expecting, but after finishing it, I wasn't left with the feeling of satisfaction I had after playing HL1, HL2, and HL2: E2(which I actually bought before this because I wanted to use it for Nightmare House 2, which didn't work out anyway because of the change they made to the way Steam stored the game files). I was very dissapointed with this Valve title, considering all of their other games were so well made, and they always left me wanting more. This game really broke that. Oh well, I've still got Left 4 Dead 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alyx and D0g and that's all you really need to know.  A continuation of the original it takes the franchise forward in a way no DLC pack could ever accomplish.  The graphics are slightly better than HL2 which is expected for a title released 2 years after it but none of the action or charm has been lost.  There are puzzles to be solved throughout and any Portal player will recognize the tech.  Sometimes challenging, sometimes maddening until a quick trip to YouTube gives you that a-ha! moment.  You can't call yourself a Half Life fan unless you play this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Donning the EV suit once more, Mr Freeman takes on the Combine again and kicks plenty of♥♥♥♥♥along the way. The puzzles are fun and using the DEFiM to obliterate your enemies is just bloody awesome! Shame it reverts to the ZePEFiM..I found the train station level suitably challenging, and had me going back for a few rounds to see if I could do things any faster.The game ends where HL2:EP2 kicks off, and why shouldn't it?

												I played Episode One for the first time last month for like an hour and forgot about it till I completed it in a single playthrough yesterday. All I can say is, and I don't want to get slaughtered for this, I was pretty underwhelmed. Maybe it's the short campaign with very little significance to the storyline. Yeah, well you got some data you weren't supposed to see and now you need to hoof till the train station battling hoards of enemies. That's the plot in one sentence. Not much happened here, but the only reason I am underwhelmed is because I expected much more reading other reviews. It was a decent additional content to the main game, and Episode Two is supposed to be way better, so looking forward to it.Gameplay wise, if you liked Half-Life 2, you won't find any difference here. Graphics are marginally better with HDR, I guess. We've come too far to even notice the difference anyway. But we don't play Half-Life games for the graphics, do we?Overall, I'd recommend it for maintaining the continuity and for storyline reasons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Like half-life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One is a physics puzzle story based action shooter involving aliens and zombies.  How can you mess that up? Well my friend, prepare to be baffled about how bad this game is compared to half life two! Im not the person to say that sequels suck, but I would think It would be hard to screw up a simple puzzle shooter using the same exact engine. This game does not feature hints on what to do on most of the missions like half life two does. The game knows it is short and it makes every mission drawn out so bad that the missions are not enjoyable. The difficulty settings do little to no difference on difficulty. All it does is weaken you and strengthen the enemy. That itself is a great way for diffculty but no matter what difficulty you are on the drawn out missions will kill you due to infinately spawning enemies (Not all the time but alot of the time) And striders. Striders..... No matter what difficulty the don't miss. Also the common talk the citizens make are just plain not needed or needs to be toned down. Every 30 seconds they say something. You stuck? TOO BAD! This game unlike half like two gives little to no hints! Yup, No enviromental hints, nobody saying anything. If you are stuck you need a walkthrough! Who likes going to a video sharing sight and listening to a young kid talk about a generic game that mainly uses blocks while doing a walkthrough on Half-Life 2: Episode one? But i digress...

The fact that this  First Person Shooter  has platforming and physics puzzles (which were present but nowwhere near as bad in Half Life 2) comepletely ruin the game. I was able to get to the level ""Exit 17"" before I had had enough of it. The gunplay is well done, but that hardly makes up for the levels and boring story			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Episode 1 continues the Half-Life saga where Half-Life 2 left off, and is perhaps one of the tightest corridor shooter experiences available. Intense from start to finish, this game is frantic without ever being overwhelming. Put aside enough time to complete it in one sitting, because it's hard to put down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Going into Half-Life 2: Episode 1, I was very enthusiastic to learn what happens after the ending of Half-Life 2. The beginning really showed a realistic starting point after the ending of Half-Life 2. The gameplay, to my opinion, was more fun in Episode 1 than in the first game, Half-Life 2. The storyline was very entertaining, and it's pretty fun to play as an illegal immigrant...sort of...escaping from the place you were to stay. Think of it like leaving North Korea. The ending (no spoilers ahead, read on) wasn't an ending I expected. But I guess we learn what happens next in Episode 2. If you played Half-Life 2 and are considered purchasing the episodes, you really should. The storyline is great, and remember how good these games are. This is the reason Valve games are amazing. You will enjoy this game and the rest of the Series.			",129,6,1,5,9,4,14

												Any followup to Half-Life 2 would have some pretty high expectations but fortunately most of them were met with Episode One which is short but extremely sweet. We get to see more of City 17, an unstable Citadel and Alyx, whose roll has been greatly expanded. She's completely believable and playing alongside her is fantastic. The animation and HDR visual effects are also very well done and an impressive step up from the original game.Valve had a great idea. Instead of making us wait for one big game to be finished they came up with doing episodic installments. More content more often. Unfortunately they stopped after two episodes and we've been on hold for 8 years but that's another story.			",52,4,4,0,1,0,2

												really good episode, not as good as episode 2, but i kinda like to play it, the only disapointment was to not be able to play as alyx. the reason i hate that is because you keep seeing her in the trailer videos, in the screenshots and even in the game cover and yet youre still gordon freeman and alyx is still a secondary character following you, theres no special gameplay, new features such as opening combine doors or hacking computers like alyx usually do but instead all she has is new animation when shes attacked by zombies. i dont hate this episode, in fact i like it, but really it could be better and if anyone read this, i would really be happy to have a modder among them on which i gave him an idea to make some kind of mod on which youre playing episode 1 as alyx, that would be awesome			",97,13,0,2,3,1,2

												It's alright. It certainly felt like a Half-Life game, but at the same time it just felt a bit lacking. There was practically nothing new added in this expansion, and in turn ended up feeling like a story expansion rather than a gameplay expansion. Practically half of the game felt boring to me, and that's really disappointing considering how the first two games had me in a constant state of wonder and amusement throughout their entire durations. However, the good parts were great; and the final boss, as brief as it was, felt like a throwback to how Half-Life 1's style of boss fights and was enjoyable. Only get this if you've played the other Half-Life games. This is not for newcomers as it will leave you feeling like you were missing out on a lot. On the other hand, if you are a fan of Half-Life. chances are you've already played this expansion.			",176,34,2,21,10,1,12

The controls are as always classically easy to get used to and adapt for your own comfort. The game keeps taking you through the story of Half Life world and its inhabitans.. I would suggest playing the original games first as to catch up with the story :)			",90,8,2,6,4,0,7

												91/100 To say the least, and not reveal any spoilers, this is a must buy for any fan of Half Life (especially if you've played Half Life 2). Though this particular game is short & sweet in length and content it's still worth playing nonetheless (if only to prepare you for HL2 Episode 2).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now that’s what I like to see a proper story expansion where you play was the same character from the first 2 games. Even though it uses the same game engine as Half-Life 2, I would have to say that’s what I find appealing about this add-on. No over the top graphics no stupid fancy weapons a gripping story line and unique game in general, Vale have their customers at the forefront of their priorities list making sure they have the best gaming experience possible. Vale keep up the good work I rate this game 8/10.			",51,1,0,3,2,1,5

												a bit of a step down but still a good shooter that keeps the story going from part 2. you can say you spend the first half of this game in the dark, which isnt really fun but gets better when you are finally out of it and start shooting up the city again. this time alyx is always by your side which is pretty welcoming and does some serious damage and also gets out of your way when under heavy fire. so yeah, its still good.

												Score: 10/10If you are a fan of the Half Life series and bought HL2 (Half Life 2) then you will enjoy HL2 Episode 1. In this episode we see the continuation of the story of Gordon Freeman from the end of HL2. Without spoiling any thing I’ll say that this episode takes the ideas from HL2 and turns them up to 11.There are one or two new tweaks to weapons from HL2. There are some new threats and new scripted events. The overall story is Alyx and Gordon have to stop another catastrophe and escape. They meet rebel groups along the way. They have to fight familiar foes in a new context and in new puzzles. The story here is very intriguing. I won’t say more so as not to spoil the surprises but I will say be ready for the giant bugs and be aggressive.-	Enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												so far, there are THREE parts to half life 2. That tells us nothing. BUT, there is some evidence for those like me. Half Life 2 episode 2 had an ending that was awful. Well, not awful, but it seems like a cliff hanger. That means there should be a Half Life 3 or Half life 2 episode 3. So as everybody says, HALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												Half-Life 2: Episode One takes place right after Half-Life 2, and was a begining of an experiment of getting out the Half Life 2 continuations faster... which ended up falling on it's♥♥♥♥♥when Valve realised that after Portal and TF2, no one cared about Half Life anymore, the final nail on the coffin being when valve discovered they could make more money off of selling virtual items for F2P games and promoting e-sports crap than Half Life could ever hope of doing.Anyways, Episode One is a huge graphical leap from Half Life 2, adding in pretty HDR effects (even though you're going to see a lot of warm colors in this game) and exploring more of the physics based gameplay. One complaint is that it feels pretty short and does feel like you're essentially doing more of the same you did in the last parts of Half Life 2, only in reverse.  You also get commentary, which always a great thing to listen to.Overall, get this game if you played/own Half Life 2 and haven't played Episode one yet			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much Half-Life 2, with more of the story to follow up on. While this game is a tad easier than Half-Life 2 (but not by much), it seems a little less in my eyes than Half-Life 2 itself. Does it follow up well? Sure. Does it continue the story well? I think so. So what do I think is lesser? Probably the amount of time you play this installment. I onky got in three square hours, but I'm sure other people have gotten in an hour and a half. I know the title says ""Episode One"" (implying that it would be shorter), but I just wanted the keep playing, especially after the ending I got in this episode. I could see it more of a continuation for people who just finished Half-Life 2. I only finished it about a month ago, and coming back to it for only three hours, while enjoyable, still left me wanting more. I still recommend it to anyone who wants good story and good gameplay combined to make a trule unique, and enjoyable experience- like the other two Half-Life games.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												Great continuation of the amazing Half Life 2 story, now with ""zombines"" (the name was Alyx's idea.)Seriously, a fun continuation of Half-Life 2, though I'm not quite sure episodes 1 and 2 weren't just one decent sized game. This episode is really short and just barely leaves you satisfied with Half-Life 2 content. But it does its job: Giving you more story and fun gameplay while giving you that Half-Life fix you need before you go into Half-Withdrawl.+ Still Half-Life+ Still great soundtrack+ More Alyx+ More crowbar and gravity gun+ Zombines+ Still satisfying+ More puzzles- Too many zombies- Too short- Why end THERE of all places?

												Flawless game design that has barely aged from when it was released more than ten years ago. Be warned though, the pacing starts slow but heats up later in the game. The game starts with a focus on puzzle solving before you get to the more traditional shooting everything in the face. Graphics still look good, textures still look clean and you will likely get ridiculously high frame rates on any modern computer, which makes it a perfect candidate for playing in 3d where it looks amazing. It is a short game at about 4 hours long, but those hours are packed with some of the finest gameplay and atmosphere that many newer games could only wish for. The only negative about the Half Life series is that it makes me want Half Life 3.			",72,4,0,9,3,0,11

												For who played the first two Half Life games, I think this is the ♥♥♥♥♥iest Half Life 2 game. The game works only to continue the story of Half Life two, with a 3-5 hours gameplay. This isn't a bad game, but Valve didn't had the work it had with the other HL games. I think the next episode continues with the same storytelling but with some work on the gameplay (I haven't played HL2 - EP2 yet). My advice? If you play this amazing series for the fun gameplay, the kickass soundtrack and the AMAZING story, you have to play this one. If you play it just for fun and don't even know what you are playing, go back to other FPS games.			",66,7,0,3,1,0,4

												The story was great and the gameplay was pretty insense. It really felt like a good half life 2. But for 3 hours playtime and 7€ price it wasn't worth it. Buy the Orange Box or the Valve Complete Pack. But it wasn't really worth it due to short gameplay and Alyx trying to be funny.Overall: 7/10			",95,5,1,3,3,0,1

												Yeah. So this game is great. Valve always does good work. They take their time with things. I really liked the first bit where you're in the factory and collect the energy efficient light bulbs and recycle them. It makes you think about the future of our planet. good work, Valve. But, I played this game once where you play this guy that works for the post office or something and he wears these sun glasses. There was a button to kick things. I think the next Episode of half life 2 should have a key configuration option to kick doors open and zombie people. Like, just press k and a foot pops out of your wiener for a second yo!

												This game gives me a headache. I loved all the half life games from the original, opposing force, blue shift and HL2 and Episode 2. But holy hell does episode one suck. I Would probably say this is my least favorite game ever. Just because it dares to be a ""Half Life"" game. I love episode 2 becuase its the most refreshing enviroment. Your in a forest. Not city 17, or some other bland place. Episode one however does nothing new. you go to the ugly♥♥♥♥♥city 17 again to turn off the combine portal, but it just turns back on anyway at the end so you might as well have not done it at all and just said ""The citidel explosion blasted them into the forest! What are the chances?"" I guess it kind of had a point because alxy took ""that thing"" from the citidel and it was important to closing the portal. How about they get ""The thing"" then gordon uses that long jump thing from the first game and jumps all the way to episode 2. They say ""The thing"" is why the combine want to catch Gordon and Alxy, but you could just say its because gordon has killed thousands of combine in the span of a week or two. I don't like this game. 5/10			",52,4,1,3,3,0,0

												Half-life 2 episode 1 is a sequal for Half-life 2, which tells the player how Gordon escapes City 17 with Alyx.Here are the pros and cons :Pros :-A sequel-Not too much puzzle to solve-Nice graphics, always-Nice effects-Good supporting characters (e.x. Alyx)-Good and simple storyline-Intense endingCons :-Story too short (although I just bought episode 2)-Not that scary compare with Half Life 1-Not too much scientific weapon compare with Half Life 1Overall :A perfect game for those FPS gamers, ""best game of the world"" 10/10Good luck for the upcoming Half-Life 2 Episode 3 (or Half-Life 3), I don't care if the game needs money.""Whew, good thing I just bought it before the end of exploration sale...""

												Eh, it's not as fun as Half-Life 2 or Episode Two, but it's still a fun game at the end of the day. I consider this Half-Life 2 entry the ""Blue Shift"" of the Half-Life 2 series.The reason why I am so iffy on this one is because 70% of the time you're in a constant gun-fest with Combine Soldiers in City 17. You get to explore the Citadel a lot more than HL2, which is more detailed here than the previous entry.Again, not a bad game, but one of the more less important ones IMHO.			",118,7,1,9,3,2,4

Was a fun playthrough to extend on the story to end on yet another cliffhanger. Thankfully I have episode two installing as I write this review because I need to play it and see what happens. That is what makes playing Half Life 2 so much fun, the ending and not knowing.
