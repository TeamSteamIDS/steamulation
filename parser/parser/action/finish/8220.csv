												First off, if you have windows 10 then you will have problems running the game.This game is the best of series one so far. All the games seem to follow the same basic format. There were little things that made the game slightly better, but overall it follows the first two nicely in a pretty dull game.Pros:Soda Poppers are not in this one!Cons:Short Game, very linearTerrible Storyline (but the best we have had so far)Limited Area of Travel, with not really any new areasNot FunnyI've decided to play through the whole series (once) out of protest to having bought all three games before playing this garbage and writing a review for each. Here is to hoping that Season 2 and 3 are better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While some of the set ups and situations are undoubtedly quirky and amusing, thereâ€™s nothing this time around to compare to the idiosyncratic psychoanalysis dream-sequence or the sitcom filming from the first and second instalments respectively. And in a game so straightforward, this is a problem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in their own new adventure.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they go as far as they go in the comic (and further). If you love the Sam and Max type of humor, you will love this series.If I'm going to mark points off for anything, its that the voices of Sam and Max have changed from the original LucasArts version, but after awhile they really start to own it and become the definitive Sam and Max voices.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
