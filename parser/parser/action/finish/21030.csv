												Watchmen Part 1 was repetitive, but had a decent enough storyline and combat to justify playing for Watchmen fans. Part 2 has the same basic Beat-Em-Up gameplay, but manages to be more repetitive and overall worse. Just like in Part 1, the storyline itself is actually a strong point. It's a separate storyline from part 1, and shows a possible explanation for why Rorschach and Nite Owl Split. It touches upon some interesting themes such as the difference between what is legal and what is ethical, and has an interesting gameplay twist at the very end, so the plotline is decent. What isn't so good is the gameplay. In part 1, you could unlock new moves, which kept the gameplay from getting completely stale. In part 2, you start off with all of the moves from part 1 unlocked, which makes sense, but you don't unlock anything more. You end the game with the same skills you started with, meaning there is no progression and the difficulty curve is more of a difficulty flatline. Furthermore, part 2 is the same length as part one (about three hours), but has half as many levels (a total of 3), meaning you're stuck in the same area for twice as long and fighting the same enemies for twice as long (and just like part 1, there's really only two or three enemy types, just having different models on each level). The effect that all of this has is that every fight in the game is essentially identical, and since the game is almost nonstop fighting, you're going to have a bland time. Furthermore, the final level is just annoying, as it consists of you chasing the villain through a mansion. Everytime you catch up to said villain, she says something essentially boiling down to ""HAHA YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME WATCHMEN"" and then runs off to another room. This repeats several times in a row and just felt like a lame way to keep you moving through the level.Overall, can't reccomend this one, even though the story is decent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the second part and like the first it was short even shorter than the first part with only 3 chapters. Also if you read my review of the first part its pretty much the same with this one. So Beat em Up Fans if this game is in sale its worth it if not then let your hands of it. The combos are also the same as in the first part maybe some small changes you dont notice really much of it. My total playtime for both parts if you play one character to the end was 10 hours and also tested the other character so the maximum to play with both would be between 18 - 20 hours not more.Thumbs up if this game is in sale.

												The second part a little bit shorter with only 3 chapters but still very enjoyable and the chance for Rorschach and Nite Owl to battle at the end thumbs up from me. I bought them both for a couple of pounds in the sale well worth the money i've had great fun playing theses 2 games. What i like most about these games is you can jump in and out when you want classic Beat 'em up game not loads to learn easy to get to grips with. A word on saving, The game auto saves a certain points where you can restart from when you die, but if you exit the game you have to start from the beggining of that chapter it keeps you hooked. Ignore the thumbs down people will moan about anything for the sake of moaning.			",311,268,36,24,31,5,32

												Man. This is probably my lightest recommendation ever. Let's start with this. Watchmen: The End is Nigh 2 has a completely different storyline than part 1. I enjoyed that part as you're trying to solve the mystery of trying to find a girl who is posiibaly involved in an illegal porn ring. The level design I thought was actually pretty cool. Very detailed and I loved hearing Rorashach and Nite Owl voiced by Jackie Haley & Patrick Wilson respectively. But FFS the one note gameplay and enemy ""variety"" was a joke. This game pretty much goes beat up anywhere from four to ten of 2-4 different enemy types per level, then open a door. I am absolutely not kidding you. Maybe once in a while you'll solve a door puzzle or pick a lock but for the majority of this game you'll be fighting generic enemies. This is where playing an unbelievable game like Sleeping Dogs (seriously, go buy that NOW if you don't have it) helps as you'll be button mashing with the help of some countering. I'll admit though. I enjoyed myself during the two hours I put into this.  I ended up blowing through both games in a toal of about five hours. Absolutely do not buy this at full price. Sale though? If you liked the Watchmen movies and beat em up with nice looking levels and good atmosphere you could do way worse. 6/10 recommendation for me.			",509,215,8,51,24,6,63

												Ok this one is shorter than the first part but it still shines a bit as it does one thing and does that one thing well. First, do not buy this unless you can get it for 1-2 bucks. Second, I have no idea why but I had to sit and play both games through to the end despite the repetitive gameplay and dated graphics. It has the same strengths and weaknesses of the first one except this one inexplicably has a tutorial. Same controller bug too. Other than that, if you like Final Fight, Double Dragon, and games of that sort, you will find this a decent button mashing brawler. The theme is a bit more adult than the last one and seeing Rorschach's brutal moves used against the female baddies...well, it was brutal, lol. Here is my review for the first one. Like I said, pick it up on sale and you get a decent brawler that tries hard and manages to miss the mark yet is still strangely fun. ""4.9 hours in aaaannnd, we've beaten this beatemup! I do recommend it, conditionally. It has its good points and bad but for the most part it delivers an entertaining few hours of smash and well, more smash. The Good: The moves are pretty smooth and easy to pull off. The story fits the mood of the comics/movie well. It's not bad if you get it on sale for 1-3 bucks. It's like a modern Double Dragon or Final Fight. The Bad: The graphics are dated. They do the job though, barely. No replayability really. Repetitive. You fight. It's a modern Final Fight. The combos are ok but you mainly end up doing the dodge/counteratttack move. The Ugly:Don't pay full price for it. It's short. I logged the 4.9 hours and I napped in between a couple of levels with the game open, lol.The options are abysmal. Need more playable characters. The gore looks cheesy.Bottom line is this. If you can get it on sale and enjoy a button mashing fight fest with a gritty undertone and slick moves then this game is for you. Just be aware going in about exactly what it is you are buying here. NOTE: If you use an XBOX 360 controller (wireless) be sure to change the setting to use the wired version. Otherwise you get a stuck camera angle and non-responsive controls. The wireless mapping is hosed. Anyway, just my opinion here but I didn't hate it, didn't love it, got it on sale and don't regret the time spent with it"" ",987,185,23,167,78,2,118

												I had to say this was a real let down because of how fricken short it was, litterally an hour long. I hate short games although this sequal had a satisfying last level at least. It's pretty cut and dry though and they really should have produced both games as one. It's not the greatest two games in the world but worth a day's worth of fun I suppose. Still, they could have done better. I'm just glad that WB got their A game with how they did the batman series. Oh well, I guess I'll just stick with batman then. Still, its a fun albeit short game for a buck.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 2 is the sequel to the horrible first game, but will the sequel fix the first ones mistakes ?Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 2 takes place right after the events of The End is Nigh. Rorschach get's a video film a girl so he and Nite Owl team up to get her back from her captives.Gameplay wise the game is the same thing as part 1, nothing is changed. There's nothing new to change up the gameplay. Graphics are the same. Very bad textures and nice comic style cut scenes. The levels do look nicer this time since they added more colors to the game. Audio design is still as bad, the games audio cuts out and only comes back a few moments later, and the soundtrack is reused from the first part.The game is way harder than the first part. They added new female enemies and they spam attacks that take away your health incredibly fast and the checkpoint system is messed up, the checkpoints are very far between which means dying is not an option. So your best chance of survival is to let the AI partner go in the battle head first while he takes out everyone and you just run around trying to avoid taking damage.Level design this time is abysmal. The final level by itself is a confusing mess, really sloppy level design and everything pretty much looks the same.Game is even shorter than part 1, only three chapters. all about 30 minutes long except for the final chapter which is about 45 minutes long. This is a tip for people who will have to play this game later on. Complete the level before exiting the game cause when you quit and return it's back to the start of the chapter. You can also play through the game twice trying out different characters. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT. There is a battle between two main characters giving the game two different outcomes. The game is also not buggy, apart from a few texture pop ins and character models spazing out and not to mention the  incredibly stupid partner AI.The game is even worse than Part 1, This is not worth your time or money. Skip this no matter what. There is nothing good about part 2, awful level design, garbage combat and insane difficulty spike at the final chapter. Not worth the money. I give Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 2 a 2/10			",904,350,32,94,59,7,85

												This is a really terrible game. You might be nodding along now, your finger reaching for the purchase button since this is on sale, echoing my own thoughts at the time ""of course I'm not expecting a *great* game - just a forgettable brawler"". Well, allow me to reiterate with a bit of emphasis - this is not a forgettable game, this is not an average game, this is not a mediocre game. This is a REALLY TERRIBLE game.Both parts took me about 6 hours to complete. It felt way, waaaaaay longer than that. And not in a good way. The game is padded to hell and back with really terrible content. Let's break it down, in no particular order:The combat consists of Light blows, Heavy Blows, Block and Throw (you can't throw most of the tougher enemies), and some combos of the above. Also, you get the occasional QTE to finish an enemy. You can't jump. Night Owl can't even pick up weapons from the environment.There are regular enemies, fast enemies and strong enemies. Each has 4-5 different models throughout the game, but they all fight exactly alike. Sometimes they carry melee weapons.There's no online co-op. I'm not sure how local co-op works on steam. I suspect it doesn't. The result is a fighting game where the fighting less diverse and interesting than the original Streets of Rage / Final Fight, 20 years later. Since fights aren't very fun, the game obviously has... wait, it doesn't really have anything else. You trudge through encounter after encounter, in the exact same poorly designed and aesthetically unengaging alleways, fighting the same 4-5 enemy models. Every so often you have to tap F to open a door. There's an arbitrary lockpicking minigame that - as far as I can tell - lets you skip some fights. That's it - no bonus abilities, not hidden content, just the chance to fight fewer enemies, because that's something you want less of in a well made fighting game. Don't buy this game. Don't accept it as a gift. Your time is more valuable than that.			",530,249,13,101,25,4,83

												After disappointments from Part 1 (I gave a negative review to) it was awhile before I decided to start up #2 which might have been a mistake.  The follow up certainly makes up for what Watchmen fans were expecting out of the package.Where as Part 1 hardly connected to anything Watchmen related (Before Watchmen, or the original Watchmen graphic novel,) and could be skipped,  Part 2 features a lot more fan service.  Surprisingly we learn a lot about the nature of Rorschach and Nite Owl's relationship not yet explored in any other Watchmen media, uncovering what led to their long hiatus as partners.Part 2 is tied in just before some flashback events in the original comic.  [Part 1 takes place 1973.  Comedian is murdered Oct 12, 1985 (Watchmen starts).  The Keene Act is signed August 3, 1977 (flashbacks of riots). January or February 1977 Part 2 begins ending just as Keene Act is signed.]Surprisingly the game fits perfectly into the story line.  Before Watchmen came out 3 years after the game yet it offers a great resolution to the Nite Owl's comics (which followed a 15 yaer old Nite Owl II) while leading right into the main story.

												If I just copied and pasted my review of Part 1 onto here, all criticism would still apply. This second installment of Watchmen plays, without exaggeration, exactly like its predecessor.The stylish combat I enjoyed so much in the first game returns but tires quick. Right from the get-go, every attack is unlocked. Consequently, you'll find yourself settling on one combo for the rest of this two hour game. There's no sense of character progression as present before.""New"" enemies feel identical to the old ones but with a makeover. The new settings look nice, but are not much different from the first game's. The plot is boring and weak. There's simply no good reason as to why Watchmen was split into two parts when they are so similar.The only positive is that Part 2 fleshes out the relationship between Rorschach and Nite Owl, explaining why they separated. But if you aren’t a Watchmen fan, would you care? If you don't, save your money and just stick with the first game.Grade: D+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129
