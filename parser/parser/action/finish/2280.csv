												Ahhh DOOM... Talk to any gamer who grew up in the 90's and they will surely recount fond memories of all the good times they had playing id Software's original magnum opus. Wolfenstein 3D may have pioneered the First-Person Shooter genre, however it was DOOM that really brought it into the spotlight. Originally released in December of '93, DOOM would later be re-released with an extra episode, re-labled as The Ultimate DOOM. At first glance The Ultimate DOOM may seem a simple affair by today's standards, what with it's deceptively simple gameplay. However looks can be deceiving, as the DOOM series is know for it's twisted mazelike corridors. Gamers who are used to the linear games of today could find themselves lost for hours in a level, searching for the next keycard. In the era that DOOM was released the length of a game was provided by actual gameplay, and not by artificially padding the experience with cutscenes every 3 seconds.The gameplay in DOOM is a satisfying affair in which players must dispatch hoards of hell's minions while searching out colored keycards to unlock the various doors that block their path, all the while searching out the games myriad secrets, which usually results in a serious upgrade of firepower. And you'll need that firepower, as the baddies keep getting bigger and more badass as you go. The best gun in the game, which can be seen below as the player faces off against the Spider Mastermind, is the BFG 9000, AKA the Big Freakin' Gun. It launches a big green ball of energy that will frag the living hell out of anything in it's path.Another thing DOOM popularized was the fine art of Deathmatch. Players could use their brand new dialup modems to engage each other in bloody warfare, where victory was determined by how many times you could reduce your foes to a pile of chunky kibble. Since DOOM's inception of Deathmatch it has become a staple of nearly every game in the FPS genre since. The Ultimate DOOM is truely a genre-defining game, and if you have never tried it you owe it to yourself as an FPS fan to give it a try.			",2214,824,67,269,240,21,271

												Best anger management therapy that you will find.10/10 Will play forever.All right, since some people found this review 'helpful' I'll try to make it a decent one.Doom is, as you may already know, a very fast-paced FPS with not much story to tell, but with a lot of other things that can, and will appeal people looking for simple but by no means easy gameplay. I recomend this game to any person who likes FPS games. I'll try to cover some points of interest:Graphics: Of course, being this game 22 years old (as of this review) the graphics are really dated for a PC game; having a resolution of 320x200 (IIRC), and 256 colors, you can clearly see 'big' pixels. Even then, the game keeps a good atmosphere for the most part. So if you're picky about graphics, maybe the atmosphere created by the game will keep you sane while playing.Sound: The same as the last point; it's old. Even then, the sounds fit, so enemies growls and scratches evoke a sense of danger around the corner. And the music... oh man, the music fits so well in the game. Fast action along with metal (for the most part) music is a good combination!Gameplay: Now this is the core of this game. This is the reason why I keep coming back to it. Just like the basics of any FPS game, you get a set of weapons, a bunch of enemies and then you empty your shells, cells, batteries, etc. upon them. Doom is just this. There's only you and demons. You have 8 (9 in Doom II) weapons to kill them, and the action is faster than most FPS out there. Walk, strafe, fire, dodge. Of course it's not only a corridor or halls full of enemies you have to dispatch, there are puzzles, with keys (or skulls) and switches or trap floors. It's not only just killing, mind you!Story: The only story you get is the one that came in the manual, but you can find it easily online. But in short; you're a (unnamed) marine, working at the Union Aerospace Corporation in mars, when portals bring out demons from hell and the rest of the people get slaughtered, so it's up to you to stop the demon invasion. How the story is coming along is told in short 'intermision' screens at the end of every chapter.Replay Value: Yes. Just yes. Why else would I keep on coming back to doom if this game didn't have any sort of replay value? And if the game bores you, you have the mods. You won't have enough time in your life to play all the community content that has been created for this game. So look for them! There are a lot of websites with links to these mods!Controls: Now, the native controls of Doom will probably feel uncomfortable for most people nowadays. You can only walk, turn, strafe, use and shoot (and of course run). Strafe is kind of tricky the first time, and you can even move with the mouse (not turn). You can only look to the sides, and shooting an enemy above you is done by autoaim.Try this game with another sourceport that is not Dosbox if you want full support for mods and/or want to change many more options for graphics, sound, and controls (most sourceports makes doom controls more akin to today FPS). There are many different ones for each taste, too.TLDR: Game is astounding, simple gameplay, enough challenge, and you have countless of mods to keep on playing forever, like I do.

												20 years later and DOOM is still fun as ♥♥♥♥.You can run real fast unlike in borderlands.Graphics have aged pretty well considering its using an engine from like 1992.You can render a LOT of items / enemies and particles.Very challenging, especially on the highest difficulty. Multiplayer is awesome Base game - probably 100+ hours of replay + has one of the oldest surviving modding communitiesSaid community gives you THOUSANDS of FREE modsat least 100+ more hours of playtime $4.99 (5) ----> 100~1,000 hours of gameplay it sells it's selfoh yeah and this game caused columbine too!So yeah this game's violence and gameplay is enough to overload your brain and make you the agent of satan or some bull♥♥♥♥♥♥like that.

												The Ultimate Doom is a re-release of the original Doom and features an entirely new episode on top of the three that were previously available. In addition it know supports modern controls of “wasd” and mouse support, though you are still unable to look vertically like in the original. It is the spiritual successor to Wolfenstein 3D and is credited for popularizing the FPS genre. This time around you'll be facing the forces of hell instead of Nazis and their dogs. The tone for this game is much more morbid and disturbing than it's predecessor's endless blue and gray hallways. You'll often times find your fellow space marines dead or still alive and twitching if they are unlucky. Rooms can now be pitch black and you will have to slowly inch yourself forward, toward your objective in fear of being caught by surprise in what may be lurking in the darkness. Without the awesome metal soundtrack blasting in the background, Doom would be pretty unsettling at times.Unlike Wolf 3D this now has floor and ceiling textures, which make for far more immersive environments. But there is no mistaking that these are indeed graphics from 1993 and what may have seemed impressive back then like vertical environments , flickering lights and gore, are typical these days and will no longer impress anyone. Where Doom stands the test of time is in it's gameplay and level design. It's rapid movement and maze like environments to explore are likely to be strange to those that have not experienced an old school FPS, but they do insure ensure fluid, exciting gameplay and replay value as you seek the hidden goodies like extra levels that you didn't find your first time through. There is no iron-sites or reloading here, instead we have an auto-aim feature that will see to it that you hit an enemy if you are facing it, though it does freak out at times when fighting on a vertical plane.Starting off you will be able to choose any of the four episodes to start off with though I highly recommend starting from the first as to allow the game to introduce weapons, enemies and game mechanics. There is no story to keep track of but if you are to start on the later episodes without a firm understanding of the weapons and how to fight demons, you will surely fail. Then you will chose from five difficulty modes that change the type and amount of enemies you will encounter throughout the level. And as soon as you pick one it's straight to the game. No story and no explanation, just you and a pistol. You will soon come across the body of a deceased marine that is facing the door and you will be able to hear a monstrous gurgle beyond the door. Meeting an enemy for the first time is always an epic encounter and you will not have any time to gawk at it. You just have to try to gun it down and hope that strange creatures goes down before you do. It is scenarios like these, that make me highly advise starting on anything other than episode 1 your first time around.Unlike Wolf 3D most enemies are not hit-scan and usually have projectiles that you can avoid if you react fast enough. It makes it feel like a really deadly match of dodge-ball as you zoom across the levels, avoiding multiple projectiles and gunning down all in your path without a single scratch. If you do get hit your characters face shown in the bottom of the screen will get bloodier and bloodier, until the point that he is near death and in tears. This is one of the small details that frightened me as a child, seeing your badass space marine bloody and in tears is something still not seen in many games and reminds you that our hero is indeed human, even if it has no gameplay effect and he still moves faster than Sonic the Hedgehog. If you are injured you will have to find a medkit to restore your health and if you are lucky you may also find some armor to absorb some damage. There are also power-ups hidden across the level like a Berserk orb that causes your fists to cause much more damage for the entire level. Some are necessary to progress though like the Hazmat suit that allows you to walk on lava and other hazards.Thinking outside the box will sometimes be necessary  in your search of the three keycards you will need to escape the level. Like in E4M6 there is a teleporter that will teleport you to different locations depending on which side you step on it, it may seem like a simple puzzle but you have to run across lava to access that tiny teleporter. If you quick-save in certain locations like that, it is possible that you will doom yourself to death if you already used the hazmat suit and don't have enough health to run across that much lava. In that case hopefully you had another save or you will be put on the start of that level with just a pistol. Most of these instances are found in Episode 4 as they tried their hand at some light “platforming”  but with Doom's inability to look up and down, crumby auto-aiming if you are not on the same plane as enemy and lightning fast movement, tiny platforms that you must traverse are quite an annoyance.  It is also the first Episode in which you ever have to use the run key and it overall felt like the weakest link out of all Episodes.Weapons are usually hidden throughout the levels giving you yet another reason to explore areas carefully. These can range from chainguns, rocket launchers and the legendary BFG-9000. You will have to find ammo for them as well and as you can tell by now scavenging for supplies is very important. Ammo backpacks are very will hidden but if you find one they will allow you to carry more ammo at once. The zombie grunts will drop either pistol or shotgun ammo but neither of these will do you much good against the more powerful demons. Demons are very aggressive and this can be used to your advantage. If a demon accidentally hits another demon they will fight to the death and you can use this distraction to either sneak away or to easily take down the victor of that skirmish. They are quite varied and have different methods of attacking, so dealing with each one is requires different method and learning how to identify your largest threat is a must. Confidence can also lead to your downfall, you may think you have taken care of every enemy in the level and spot a powerful gun in the open, only to be ambushed by demons that were hiding. Be it creepy noises, distant groans or evil looking background, this game does a great job at making sure you rarely feel safe.I did have a problem with the Steam version of this game having distorted colors and flickering. I was  able to fix it by following this guide.  With that said, this game should last you around 6 hours but it does have decent replay value and plenty of secrets to find. After each level it tells you the percent of enemies killed, percent of secrets and the time it took you to complete, which may lead you to want to do better. Most levels before Episode 4 have a unique song that plays throughout that further helps differentiate the levels from one another. The environments are mostly brown and gray, so they start to look the same after a while but thanks to excellent level design, no two levels feel the same. If you ever get lost, there is an in game map for each level, though it can be confusing when levels have some verticality to them. While Doom's graphics are now laughable and can be run on most consoles or even your local ATM, it's now extinct form of gameplay is still as fun as ever.  I wouldn't recommend Doom to those that need a plot to drive them forward or to those that hate exploring. Those that don't mind the lack of narrative and want fast, unrelenting gameplay, are more likely than not going to have a heck of a time with this title. While it is starting to show it's age, good old grandpa Doom still has plenty of fight left in him.			",1881,553,61,204,168,17,226

												Doom is a household name for good reason. It's a game that brought the gaming industry to it's knees and changed the landscape of video games and software forever. Doom resulted in the widespread adoption of the Windows operating system and later the creation of DirectX. Doom popularized the first person shooter, which is now one of the most popular video game genres. It directly lead to custom maps, modifications, source code releases and online multiplayer being a thing.Most importantly, Doom is a symbol. It's a symbol of everything good in video games. It is the product of nights spent computer programming, playing Dungeons and Dragons and wishing fervently to make, ""That game"". That game you fantasize about playing in the back of your mind, that game you think people will judge you for playing, that game that you play 20 years later and find it's still as fresh as the day you bought it.

												Doom: One of the few first person shooters to make you feel smart after mindlessly killing hordes of zombie aliens.When you first start playing doom you are simply given a pistol and a room from which you will start your adventure. Depending on the difficulty you selected, you might face enemies right off the bat, but for the sake of the review I will base my experience on the “I’m too young to die!” difficulty (very-easy in layman’s terms). Playing through the game on such a level allows me to casually stroll through the levels, while appreciating the atmosphere provided.The first level set on Phobos, one of Mars’ moons, where aliens have come through the portals and killed all of your friends. Every single one. You’re the only man left and you’ve made it your duty to take revenge on every last living thing on this moon. You soon find out the scientists working on the moons were working with portals and attempted to link Phobos and Deimos together. One thing lead to another and the events of this game slowly unraveled from there.It’s time to delve into the designs of these levels. These new stages in the game are well thought out, with new weapons before tougher enemies, and secrets that reward you with powerful weapons (Ones that you wouldn’t normally get for a few more levels). Key cards are used to open doors with the corresponding color, and are normally accompanied by health and ammo, because it sure as hell wasn’t easy to get to them. Some maps use dark rooms to set the tone, which work to the games advantage, especially when you’re facing those invisible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s which can take huge chunks of health with one swipe. Some maps use maze like configuration to add a level of difficulty, and you can bet that each dead end is guarded by an enemy. Each level set is finished with a challenging, yet rewarding boss battle. Again, the level design was superb for setting the tone. A long hallway which provided ammo, health, and armor, told me that I was in for a treat when I entered the elevator. For the difficulty I chose, I was given two CyberDemons to face, which were new to me, allowing me to see how they attacked and how much ammo I would be using to kill each one. After defeating the glorified demon at the end of that trek, it truly feels like the levels you played through were just a training match before the final showdown.   To sum it all up, you should really buy this fantastic, innovative game. The enemies are challenging, the boss battles are rewarding, the setting of the game is revolutionary, and the levels are creative and enjoyable. The game has great replay ability, and finding new secrets with each play through enhances the game play even further. For the $5 price tag, you are getting a game that will keep you occupied for hours to come.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PrepositionThere once was a time when my daddy gave me my very first own PC. It was huge, grey with a slight touch of yellow because of the cigarettes my daddy and his friends smoked and it had a big screen on the front showing ""120""; the mysterious turbo-button.Life was simple back then. And I grew up with Monkey Island, Lemmings and ... DOOM! It was scary, big and bold, dark and I was afraid playing it alone, so I always went into our PC room, when daddy was there. But holy hell ... I learned to overcome my fear and half a year later I played it on Nightmare.GraphicsSmooth animations, dark and gritty textures, flickering lights an iconic HUD - this was amazing back then and it's amazing nowadays. The gore effects were over the top and explosions were amazing.SoundEvery monster got its own sound, so opening a door, entering pitch black darkness and hearing the brutal roar of a Hellknight was the ultimate method to let my blood freeze. Screaming, explosions and bullets cracking ... it's pure bliss.MusicE1M1. 'Nuff said.

												Dark Souls fans is a game for only the most hardcore gamers who love getting routinely screwed over and by many is considered the hardest game franchise today. To an extent they're right. Dark Souls is a very difficult game that makes every time you've beaten an enemy feel like a small victory. But they haven't played DOOM on nightmare mode and are  surrounded by enemies firing pistols and shotguns at them while demons fling fireballs at them and you're dodging and firing, painfully aware of the fact that you're down to 4 rounds in your shotguns and 15 in your pistol, and your even more painfully aware of the fact that you only have 6% of health left and enemies are constantly teleporting in not giving you the slightest break. Then your shotgun is out of ammo and you're down to your pistol, and then IT'S out of ammo and you just bum rush the nearest enemy with your fists who blows you away with one shotgun blast, forcing you to replay the entire level because you forgot to make a save file and checkpoints aren't even a concept in this game. But the best, most soul crushing, part?That was level one motherf***er. and you've got over 30 levels of this waiting to bend you over and make you call it daddy.			",37,2,0,17,3,0,13

												Kids, let me tell you about an ego shooter of yesteryear. One of THE ego shooters of yesteryear, to be precise: DOOM!It may not look like much nowadays, but it's still a fantastic, fast-paced shooter with (rather) open maps, great soundtrack (seriously, I love it!) and lots of hellspawn to take apart!And not only is it still a great game, but it still has an active modding community. If that's not amazing, then I don't know what is!I've played through the game with the Brutal Doom mod, btw., which makes the game EVEN better! Seriously, give it a spin! DO IT NOW!

												HOW TO PLAY DOOM ON NEW VERSIONS OF PC JUST ONLY DOWNLOAD ZDOOM GZDOOM : Install your source port of choice into its own folder. Find your DOOM folder in Steam (not sure where it is in Windows 7, but in XP, it would be under Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\common\). Find DOOM.WAD inside the DOOM folder, and copy or move it to the folder your source port is installed in. You should be able to run DOOM just fine with said source port now. CHANGE NAME OF GZDOOM.EXE TO DOSBOX.EXE AND DELETE THAT OLD DOSBOX.EXE LAUNCH YOUR DOOM AND PLAY :)))) like if i help !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi, when this game came out I was just stunned how realistic the graphics are. Well this was back in 1993 when I visited a friend after school and guess what we played DOOM!!! The full registered Version of it ;) *yay* It was just awesome. I guess everyone back in 1993 who had a computer loved that game. The gameplay, the graphics, the monsters, the levels it was just so cool. You really thought hey I am a ""Space Marine"" and I am saving the world up here! :) Nuclear Plant (E1M2) was one of my favorites. Not because John Romero designed it - I played this level over and over again because of the cool soundtrack. Did I mention the sound yet? The sound of the game is just WOW. You never heard such cool music and sound effects in any other game. Never was so scared by these snarling monsters that lurk along the dark corridors where you´ll encounter the remnants of the lost dead space marines that tried to fight these evil forces before... The STEAM Version runs just fine on my system, but I had to edit some files to get it to work properly . If you say yes I wanna give this game a try - just do it it is worth every dollar!! If you need help to get this game working feel free to check out my guide and download my config files @: http://steamcommunity.com/id/crysisheld/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides&appid=2280 ",213,32,18,8,6,0,19

												***My actual playtime is much, MUCH higher. I play through source ports off of steam, and I play DOOM + DOOM 2 all the time******BTW you don't need windows. You only need the wad file then you can copy that into a source port and play on Mac/Linux***When people tell you about how great DOOM was there may of course be a bit of nostalgia (because they grew up with it), and there are some people who would tell you the game hasn't aged well. Well those people are idiots.I never played DOOM back in it's heyday, I wasn't born yet. My first experience was on the xbox with the Doom 3: BFG edition when I was about 12 or so. I wasn't aware of the legacy behind it either, I just remembered seeing an strategy guide for the game in a thrift store and thinkihg that it had the coolest artwork ever and I kept the name in the back of my head until I would be able to play it. I was mildy irritatted that you couldn't look up or down/jump, but it was still awesome, and I played the ever-loving crap out of it until completed. And this was after I played some more ""modern"" shooters like Halo, ETC, but I still preferred DOOM. Halo was slow and I had to be consistently hiding to regenerate shields. DOOM was fast, fun, and had secrets on every level. I could speedrun through a level, or I could take my time and kill every monster, and look for secrets.And I recently have gotten back into it. It really is one of the best video games ever, and I'm telling you this from the perspective of a 20 year old who grew up with shooters like COD, Halo, and Battlefield, It's not just middle aged people looking back with rose tinted glasses. It really is that good. It's even better now that recent games have to try to be the next COD. You should absolutely buy this game unless you are one of those pretentious whiners who complain if there isn't a cutscene in between every shootout. If you want a good narrative, seriously, go read a book. DOOM has what it needs, and honestly the game benefits from it's lack of plot development. I don't want to sit there and watch some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t narrative about the horrors of war before killing a bunch of dudes.When you go back and play DOOM or any of the other retro FPS games you will pretty much see how far backward the First Person Shooter has gone. The devs, give you a cleverly crafted level, the tools to complete it (but you have to find them!), and say have fun. None of that pointless hunting/crafting, no leveling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just you up against the spawn of satan. The sugar-sweet♥♥♥♥♥♥of heavy ordinance and fun are your only incentives to play. Murder is it's own reward.And perhaps best of all, they weren't tailored to 13 year olds who can't take a challenge and will threaten to have you permabanned from xbox live for headshotting them.On a completely different note the game has a large amount of modders that are still active to this day, and I myself enjoy making maps/modding it.There is literally over 23 YEARS worth of fan made content waiting to be playedBut if you do buy this be sure to grab a source port+ ZDL. Source ports will allow the game to run natively on modern systems and give all sorts of  features+ better control options. I I bought them on steam and just copied the wad files into a source port.

												One simple word, one simple game, the absolute best FPS on the planet: DOOMStraight out of 1993, Doom was a game made simply because the group of 20 something year olds wanted to make it. It's a game where design splashes with creativity, something you don't find in almost any modern game today. The game is simple. Get to the end of each stage. That's it. You also need to kill the literal thousands of demon hellspawn along the way so don't forget about them either. The monsters range from simple zombie soldiers to demonic goats that shoot rockets at you. The games monsters all revolve around the notion of avoiding projectiles, or hitscans. The maps are designed with absolute love and attention. Each episode was made usually by one person, and you really can feel that distinction when you play them. Some maps were mazes, some maps were collosiums, some maps used more of a certain ammo type, thus limiting your approach, but most of all, the designs of the maps are interesting and fun to play.Doom is a testament to the 90's, and a bit to the 80's. The loud metal induced music, the overall design, the action and horror of films such as Aliens. Everything is combined in such a perfect, uniform way that nothing feels out of place.Doom is in a nutshell, just a game that feels right to play. Not a single aspect about the game feels wrong at all, and thats something you never see anymore in games. The attention to detail and gameplay is absolutely amazing.There is not one single game I've ever played that did everything as perfect as Doom did. The monsters, the maps, the design, the gameplay, the mechanics, the feel, is all so perfect, that you really need this in your library.Being a game from 1993, the game runs on DOSBOX. If you don't like that, there's plenty of source ports out there, like ZDoom, Zandronum (which focuses on multiplayer as well), and for a faithfull recration of the game, Chocolate Doom. There's also literally millions upon millions of custom content for the game as well. Some wads I could reccomend include classics such as Alien Vendetta, Memento Mori 1 and 2, Hell Revealed and some new ones such as Back to Saturn X, Doom the way id Did, Doom 2 the way id Did, ZDoom community map project 1 and 2, and the PSX Total Conversion, and anything by mapper skillsaw (Ancient Aliens is a blast).Doom is a game I will always see myself coming back to, even when we are in 2047 playing games on a display device in our brains.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Brutal Doom Mention: On the topic of this flamboyent mess of a mod, I'll give my honest opinions on it, because as an avid Doomer from the earliest days, I suppose I should explain my self in detail.Brutal Doom is a mod for Doom that throws in absolute rediculous amounts of gore and changes the enemies behavior entirely. Shots deal damage based on location on the body. For example, shooting an imp in the head kills it instantly. You have iron sights on some weapons and you have to reload your clips (this can be turned off with ""mutators"" that can be downloaded individually)Now all of this sounds like the perfect way to modernize Doom right? Wrong. Brutal Doom completely destroys the balance of the original Doom maps, and many pwads as well. For example. you can kill a Baron of Hell in literally 2 shotgun blasts to the head. This completely destroys Episode 1's finale on the Original Doom. The same thing with the Cyberdemon. What used to take a plethra of Rockets now only takes 16-23 rockets. Many of the sub-boss enemies in Doom 2, such as the Arachnotron, Revenant, and Hell Knight, can literally be one shotted with the super shotgun now, which completely breaks the encounters with them and destroys any sense of ammo conservation. The game is extremely annoying. Everytime you kill a monster they scream in agony, which is extremely loud. Blood and gibs fly everywhere, and I mean everywhere, from something as minimal as a pistol shot. It's an annoying audio-visual experience that gives me one ♥♥♥♥♥ of a headache not 4 mins into the game.All of this wouldn't annoy me if people didn't berate the original vanilla Doom experience. Newcomers to Doom most of the time berate amazingly well done wads, like ZDoom community map project, Samsara, etc, simply because they have no Brutal Doom support. This is infuriating to no end, especially since the creator of Brutal Doom is not only a Neo-Nazi sexist racist, but he's also given instructions on how to commit suicide. This is a Phil Fish scenario, and me hating the guy has nothing to do with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his mod is. If you ever add me to discuss Doom, don't bring up Brutal Doom. It's not something worth mentioning.]			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												If you don't know what the hell Doom is, then you are clearly not very familiar with First Person Shooters, or possibly gaming. Doom wasn't any normal First Person Shooter - it was THE FPS. The FPS that increased the potential of 3D game design, what the genre could do and made the genre popular. Wolvenstein may have given birth to the genre, but the genre wouldn't be as popular as it is now if it wasn't for this legendary game. ... but the question is, does it still hold up? Let's get on with the review!!The story is as simple as early 90s games go but there is also a backstory to the player character as well - after our hero has disobeyed orders from a commanding officer to fire upon civilians and decide to stop him instead, he has been sent to work at a military base on Mars, which behaves as a Security post for a Multi-Planetary Conglomerate called the Union Aerospace Corporation (abbreviated UAC). The UAC itself is currently testing teleportation between Mars and it's two moons Phobos and Deimos in secrecy. Nothing special was really happening there... until one day, all hell quite literally breaks loose. The base on Deimos completely disappears off the face of the moon and a frantic distress signal was sent to Mars from Phobos, stating that something... ""evil"" has poured out of the teleportation gateway. Our hero (called Doomguy by the community, seems like a fitting enough name I guess) and several other Marines set out from Mars to Phobos to sort out this problem, and as they land on the Phobos base, Doomguy gets commanded to guard the perimeter, only equipped with a mere pistol, while the rest of the squad set foot inside the base. As our hero waits, he hears radio chatter followed by gunfire and screams which was eventually followed by an eerie silence. Doomguy is the only man in his squad left alive. He loads his gun, opens the entrance door, and sets on through the darkness and prepares for the worst. He hears inhuman cries and wails from the distance. There is no turning back now. He is Doomed... is he?Just a quick heads up: the Steam version of Doom is a DOSbox emulation, so because of this, there will be some things that fans of Modern shooters may need adjusting to. For instance, the controls will be strange to some, as back then there probably wasn't any real support for the mouse - if you move the mouse forward, you walk forward. If you need help trying to adjust to some of the admittedly dated things in this emulation, try checking out the Discussions in Doom's Community section, They will have a ton of solutions, definitely helped me out. But despite having some dated things, once you get the game running how you want it. it will be worth it. OK, let's get to Gameplay. Despite lacking a lot of things that modern shooters have, it does amazingly well without them and very easily makes up for it. You cannot aim up and down due to the fact that there is no Y axis to aim with, but this is very easily made up for with an auto aim that can help hit enemies a floor above or below. Headshots and stuff like that don't exist at all, but the action is so frantic anyway that it would be unnecessary for such a thing to be useful, and besides, the weapons are deadly enough anyway. Oh, and there is no health regen. We don't like that anyway.The level design was incredible back in the day, and it still is very impressive, personally I still think that this game has some of the most well made levels that have ever been made for a FPS, and it makes the more modern shooters out there look amateurish with their linear corridors. Doom's levels are very labyrinthine and dungeonlike - there are loads of routes to take to get from the start to the finish, as well as coloured keys to look for to help progress through certain levels. What's more if you keep a careful eye out, you will find a secret! With it's complex level design, Doom loves to reward players who explore ... which is something more modern games should do really, it makes the game just that bit more immersive and rewarding. And if you ever happen to get lost, don't worry, check the map.The weapons are limited but still pretty effective and are useful depending on what situation you are in. You start off with a measly pistol, but as you get further into the game you will find more devastating tools, such as a shotgun, Rocket Launcher, the franchise's beloved BFG (Quite literally stands for Big F*cking Gun) and even a kick♥♥♥♥♥Chainsaw! There are powerups as well, such as Invincibility and a Berserk Pack which gives you enhanced unarmed combat. Most of the weapons and powerups are so effective you'd want to save them for when you really need them, sometimes levels require you to use these to progress which makes this game a lot more strategic then some people thought an old shooter could be. Enemy types are varied and hard as nails, and the difficulty curve itself is well paced. They start of simple at first, but as soon as the difficulty curve stars to rise, you will see more threatening types of monsters and more insane situations.  for instance, during the first episode of the game, ""Knee Deep in the Dead"" everything will be very easy for the player. Ammo will be plentiful, enemies will be easy to deal with, facing nothing but zombies, imps and those pink demon things. The end bosses in this episode will be the only possible threat, but other then that, this episode will hold your hand, unless you play carelessly that is. It won't be THAT easy. Beyond the next two episodes, the difficulty will start to pick up, forcing the player to play smart.Then you get to Episode 4, ""Thy Flesh Consumed"".Enemies come in relentless hordes, health and ammo is scarce, there is a threat around every corner, corridors and rooms are incredibly tight, and looking for secrets is vital. This last episode is UNFORGIVING, even on ""Hurt Me Plenty"" difficulty, and it requires the player to put their Doom skills to the test. Either that, or they are doomed.And... if you thought the game was a bit too easy on the last episode on ""Hurt Me Plenty"", then don't worry, Doom has harder difficulty settings, of which will alter the challenge in a couple of ways in the levels, such as harder enemies in certain places.As for Audio, although it uses a dated MIDI format, is really good. The soundtrack ranges from fast paced tracks that suit the fast paced action of the game, and then there are more somber, ominous tracks that suit Doom's gothic style. Weapons sound great, the chainsaw for instance sounds as grisly as a chainsaw should be. Monsters sound excellent and the kind of noises they make differ from each type, which can help the player develop a twitch reaction on how to deal with them if they bump into them (eg: Was that an Imp? I'll get my shotgun out...).Graphics... Ehh. Alright they are horribly dated but there seems to be a gothic style going on here. and not all the levels look the same. Plus each enemy type has a distinct silhouette which can also help develop a twitch reaction on what the player should do to deal with them. Doom isn't an amazing looking game, but it's still not a bad looking one.I think I described enough of Doom now, now to answer the question I said at the start of this review: Does Doom still hold up?In two words: Hell yes. Doom was not only a revolution in the game industry, but it is a achievement in solid game design. while it may have aged poorly in the graphics department and it may lacks some thing most other modern shooters can do, everything else it can do, it does it FLAWLESSLY. The game brought several things to the table back then and it can still do them again and impress. If you haven't played Doom, then for the love of god, DO SO.  Doom is a truly unmissable classic. So, what are you doing? Buy it. Lock, load, rev up that chainsaw, and get ready to rip and tear. Bring on the Ultravionce!!			",87,5,0,1,4,1,2

												Doom is the Tetris of FPS dude. There really isnt much that I can write here. You are doom guy, you kill the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of demons and collect keycards to get further in the level until you reach the exit of that level. Sometimes you fight bosses. You get progressively more awesome and powerful weapons as you progress through the game and face increasingly difficult and awesome enemies as you go on. Its simple, but pure, Again like Tetris. I think this game presents FPS in its PUREST form.Just play the game god damnit.			",779,120,10,39,73,2,79

												I remember vaguely my brother playing this game when I was real young (and by real young around 5-7 years old XD), and that is the majority of the reason I got this game. I wanted to experience what he experienced as a gamer and I always liked watching him playing video games(except I couldn't watch this one because it was so gorey, but managed to peek many times). To me, this is the birth of the FPS genre and it's great to see how much it has evolved over the years. It's also great to be able to go back into the past to play this game. I love how there are a variety of difficulties, from those who are very newbish to the very hardcore gamer. This is an arcade-like game where you just gotta kill everything around you and pass the level. Secrets? Optional. Simplicity? Yes. A gem in time that will always live on? Very, very likely.

												Rip and tear into this action classic that hasn't only just stood the test of time but has surpassed it. With a still active community on the Doomworld forums where mappers to this day continue to develop 32 level megawads for good old fashioned classic vanilla doom. On top of that modern limit removing sourceports allow for doom to be played at 1080P with mouse support and the steam overlay while still tracking hours played on your profile (holy mackerel!). The four original id designed episodes for Ultimate Doom play amazingly well and even better than the campaign that Doom II was released with despite Doom II adding some incredibly fun monsters and the game changing weapon that is the Super Shotgun. Thy Flesh Consumed is in my opinion the best episode and it contains my favorite map: E4M2: Perfect Hatred. After completing the first Doom be sure to run through Doom II!How to run modern sourceports through steam:

												The game is great, without any doubt. The amount of hours I wasted in my childhood playing DOOM games is absolutely insane and would be enough for a second life. So the game is a rock solid 10 out of 10, no questions asked. And if you have not played it yet, DO IT!But not this Steam version, which is kind of unplayable due to bad pre-configuration or the fact that Steam, otherwise than GOG, just throws old games like these barely playable on the market.Tip: Google and install GZDoom, ZDoom or any other source port, copy the *.wad files from your Steam installation to that folder, add some BrutalDoom / Project Brutality mod to it and you're good to go.This way you'll probably waaaay more fun, believe me :)Edit: I've seen that the first two DOOMs are now available on GOG (Good Old Games). I bought them there (because I hate DRM as much as I love GOG) and guess what? They run. I installed the first two DOOMs and they just work like they should. That's the reason why Steam isn't really the best adress for old games like these ones. They don't try to polish them (in terms of ""make them playable"") or try to uphold the functionality like GOG does. Besides that, they are always overpriced. GOG = <3			",224,20,13,20,11,1,19

												Ah, Doom. I'm such a big fan of this Hellish series, I've been playing for years already. And It never gets old. Doom Is one of my most favorite games of all time, I'm not a big fan of Doom 2 though. I'm just too use to this classic here. You play as a Space Marine or Doomguy, as you run and gun your way out of Hellish Demons and Zombies. A classic game from 1993, Doom was one of the goriest games In It's time. And you would headbang to the heavy metal music while gunning down Zombiemen and Imps. This version here Is The Uiltmate Doom, where It Includes a new fourth episode titled Thy Flesh Consumed. Episodes:Knee-Deep In The Dead: This Is my favorite, well. I'm sure It's everybody's favorite. This Is where It all begins, the Hellish rampage starts.The Shores of Hell: My least favorite, this took me a while to complete. But I know my ways through this episode.Inferno: The final episode, and the best out of all the episodes, Is where you finally confront The Spider-Mastermind. And This Is my most favorite episode.Thy Flesh Consumed: I've not played this one yet, but I'll give It a try one of these days.I highly recommend this game to new and old school gamers, or for those who never played FPS before. I completely rate this classic a 10/10. I know It's overated folks, but a game like Doom deserves It. For making the FPS Genre so popular today.			",76,1,0,1,4,0,0

												John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn’t see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad “I want to be on the ships daddy.”Dad said “No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS”There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.“This is Joson” the radio crackered. “You must fight the demons!”So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.“HE GOING TO KILL US” said the demons“I will shoot at him” said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.“No! I must kill the demons” he shoutedThe radio said “No, John.

												As someone who wasn't part of the generation that Doom released in, I am really impressed by it. Fast and satisfying gameplay all wrapped in incredible map design that is just not seen nowadays. This game has mostly aged with grace with an extremely dedicated community to it to this day.Just to warn anyone who wants to enjoy this game, do not play this game directly from your Steam library. The Steam version of the game is the game running on a DOS Box which doesn't work all that well; what you want to do is download a source port to play it properly on a modern computer. You still need to buy the game for some specific files to get the game running though. Here's an article with a list of source ports: http:// http://reddoorbluekey.com/pc-news/hurt-plenty-tour-best-doom-source-ports/ . But seriously, this game is a must play and absolutely worth the trouble of going through all this.			",57,12,0,6,1,0,2

												Surprisingly holds up more than 2 decades later. Sort of. You'll need GZDoom in order to play it, otherwise you're dealing with an old DOS program that runs at 100x100 resolution with no widescreen support and no mouse support. But those are issues with age that are expected of a game rather than outright compatibility issues that modern games suffer from; no one expects a 20 year old DOS game to not be a 20 year old DOS game. GZDoom is so easy to set up that it's no issue at all.Overrated? I think so. Still good? Yes. It's the maps. They're good. They're complex and have a lot of secret areas around, with enemies frequently popping out of corridors and walls. It's part exploration as you traverse the map looking for keycards and exploring the new area you've been plopped into. But it's also done fast as you move at the speed of light, so it doesn't *feel* like a slow trek across a large area checking everything out. and that's it, really. This game's design was such that emphasis was placed on maps and their design. After all, what is Doom and WAD's but just map design, because there's no real story or complicated mechanics to weaponry or boss battles. The lifespan of this game and it's continual development has been based on WAD's and just making more maps, period. Because it's shooting isn't spectacular; the game has auto aim by default and height differences aren't taken into account. The boss battles are meh, and the weapons are nice and all but there's no difference between weapons other than how much damage they inflict. Doom lives on because it's maps were given emphasis and you wind up moving around a lot more than some modern shooters.Period. Some modern titles are so caught up in cinematic experiences, even whilst the player has control, that you wind up going down corridors and down a singular path that progresses the story both during cutscenes and outside of them. And there's nothing wrong with telling a captivating tale, but merely plopping you in a level and spending time designing that level is so simple it's kind of amazing that it isn't done more often. It's simplicity. There's no level between levels in Doom; you're at the Tower of Babel in one level and the next one is in a facility, with no level connecting the two and/or cinematic. It's almost like the old Super Mario Bros titles where you're in a water level here and the next one is a castle with the third one being an air ship.Before playing this I expected an outdated game that would be hard to get into. But no, it's such a simple game and because of that it has little to screw up and key things it can really achieve in. This wasn't the first ever FPS title; it isn't the BEST FPS title; but it's certainly a highly regarded one that miraculously stands the test of time and, amazingly, is still enjoyable and doesn't skip a single beat. Whether 1996 or 2016 it's still a blast to play, as if it never aged. Well, if you apply GZDoom, that is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here's a list of what to expect in this game.  Things to expect:-Demons-Killing Demons-Killing Demons with guns-Killing Demons with chainsaws-Killing Demons with energy weapons-Killing Demons with fists-Killing Demons while wearing power armor-Killing Demons while invincible-Killing Demons with Red Jelly on your face-Killing Demons with Green Jelly on your face-Matt Demon-A Great Story (just kidding, more demon killing)-Fleshed out characters (as in the demons after you shoot them)-Graphics at the highest settings (best for seeing your demon killing)-High Frames Per Second (best for killing demons with)-Big Demons-Little Demons-Ball Demons-Really big Demons-Demon corpses-Demon sounds-Maps containing Demons -Demons rights activists (spoilers: they're the Demons)-Humans possessed by Demons-Demon blood-Demon meatballs-Demon genocide-Demon massacre-Demon bloodblathIt's basically a game about killing demons while trying not to die to demons.  I guess there are some key cards and slight puzzle elements, open ended levels, and level exploration, but all of it ultimately is towards the goal of killing demons.  If you don't like killing demons... this game's about killing demons (TECHNICALLY you could do a pacifist run, but why would you with all these demons).  Demon/10, would exorcize again.

												It's a bit tricky to get this game to actually work in Winows 7/8, but it's worth a bit of trouble to do so. Why? Because it's Doom! THE Doom.It's a classic, it's not easy, and it was the big bad boogeyman of its time. And it actually holds up pretty well today, thanks to its action-packed levels and varied enemies. So if you're in the mood for some old-school action or just want to see what all the hubbub was about, I can easily recommend Doom. It's one of the old greats, and it has aged like a fine wine.And if glorious a 320x240 resolution turns you off, there are compeporary engines that you can use to load the game in, instead of using DOSBox as it comes packed with here. But I kind of prefer the autentic giant pixels for this one.RIP AND TEAR!			",84,16,3,12,6,1,19

Long story short: One of the oldest, yet still engaging, shooters of the '90s. It's not only a graphical spectacle, it's also tightly desgined around skill-based encounters, while offering enough variety for a good six to eight hour game length, plus a butt-load of mods online. For those buying the Steam version, check the community guides to help you set it up for a more optimal introduction to the game.DISCLAIMER: While no demo is available on Steam, Googling Doom Shareware should lead you to the free version of the game, which contains only the first episode to give you a decently lengthed snippet of what the game is like.After the release of this game, every first-person shooter for the next few years were referred to as Doom clones purely because this game right here did everything so well. Simply, Doom is one of the tightest games you'll ever play. Guaranteed. While taking place on abandoned research bases on Mars, and eventually into Hell itself, the game's spooky vibes do not correspond with horror as much as balls-to-the-wall action. However, most of its spectacle is due to the fact that it was the first of its kind: many FPS games thereafter utilised Doom's formula, to varying and even greater degrees of success. To fully enjoy this game, try to forget all that you already know about games and take this game from its rawest form.Let's get it out of the way: Doom had a magnificent engine. It needed a decent rig to get working at the time, but man did it get 3D working so well. The engine allowed floors to be rendered at multiple heights, any angle conceivable, and all textured, allowing for some magnificent looking locales. Lighting also worked to build atmosphere and contrast between levels. And, enemy sprites were very detailed, and allowed them to be animated during attacks and hit animations from all angles. Briefly, it was visuals like no other.The sound is a little bit uninspired however. Some sound effects are public domain (the imp sound in particular), and may sound familiar. The music also takes a few, let's say, subtle hints from metal and grunge music of the '80s and '90s. However, all of it fits towards the demonic tone that the game goes for.The game consists of four episodes, each taking place in different locations. The aesthetics of each place vary a bit too, and the general design changes a bit too. Each episode introduces new things, allowing the player to constantly learn techniques and skills in tackling enemies. Every level also has a bunch of secrets (including some secret levels), which is a great way to give incentives to explore the levels.The highlight of the game in my opinion are the enemies. The weakest enemies, the Former Human and Sergeants, are also the only enemies that hitscan (attack with an instant bullet-like attack). Every other enemy uses projectiles of varying damage, speeds, and colours, and they're all avoidable. Doom's gameplay consists of dodging enemy attacks, prioritising targets, navigating and using the map to your advantage, and conserving ammo and attacking efficiently. It leads you in, gives you enough time to evaluate the threat, and skillfully execute a plan to either avoid or take out hoards of enemies. And it does this organically by not removing control or agency from the player.The weapons also have a huge layer of depth. Besides the slow starting pistol, every weapon you find doesn't out-right replace other weapons you get. Rather, each weapon has its own benefits and weaknesses. For example, the shotgun can deal large chunks of damage in successive blasts, but it's not as efficient or quick as other weapons, whereas the plasma rifle fires huge balls of energy at enemies, but have a delay between shooting and the projectile hitting the target. Each weapon works well against certain enemies, and the player organically learns these as the game goes on, rather than being down-right told about it.The levels are also designed to give varying degrees of challenge between encounters. While enemies are littered around the levels, generally you are presented rooms, and you have to solve problems with them, usually a locked door. This involves crossing the level sometimes, which may also have unlocked a hidden swarm of enemies. Fighting enemies in large open rooms, and fighting in closed in corridors provide different skill-sets.Doom also was pretty revolutionary for its modding system. The main game acts as a base archive, and custom levels or mods (in WAD files) replace or expand this content. It's simple to distribute, and resources such as the Idgames archive are being updated to this day with new and amazing content. I recommend the Brutal Doom mod, which replaces the weapons and enemy behaviors in a...ludicrous manner.Doom is one of the greatest games of all time, not because of its graphical leaps, but because it was also a tight as heck game. If you're going to grab the classic bundle, more mods are created for the sequel, Doom II, which expands on this game with crazier enemies and levels. The Doom 3 BFG Edition also includes this game and the sequel as well (not as Steam products, but within the title itself), and remains the best bundle for this game. The price point is a bit high for the game's age, but it's quality is worth every bit of it.RATING: 3 UP, 0 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.[/table]  0 UPs 1 UPs 2 UPs 3 UPs   Not worth playing, skip it Alright, play it if you're into the genre Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]  0 DOWNs 1 DOWNs 2 DOWNs 3 DOWNs   Nothing detrimental in the game A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do ",622,184,17,64,62,8,69

												Do you remember Doom from 1990s? This is the one. Contains all three original episodes as well as an additional one called Thy Flesh Consumed. This additional episode has an interesting history: it's an episode of Doom I but is also a sequel to Doom II, storywise. It is considered to be created for experienced Doom players, who finished both games already: there is no learning curve, just carnage from start to finish.Thy Flesh Consumed levels were assembled by Kevin Cloud and John Romero and named after Bible passages (but not the secret level, to which an entry is hidden in Level 2).It is not for the weak, but it's a must play - original, brutal Doom.10/10			",513,226,13,80,38,4,64

												Great memorable and revolutionary game. Doom 2 and Final Doom are great too. Must haves for anyone who likes fun.Don't bother with the dosbox setup, as its pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ Get source ports like:-Chocolate DoomHighly Accurate to the original DOS executable (bugs and limits included), while being a windows based port. Great for a more authentic experience without the hassle of Dosbox. -PrBoom+Raises the static limitations of the original, options for Modern screen resolutions/OpenGL, and  includes support for the boom/MBF formats. Most maps for these formats are still generally traditional with the gameplay. Compatibility levels for different versions of doom make it good for demo playback.-ZDoom/GZDoomNumerous advanced features, and supports Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.  Mouselook and Jumping/Crouching are possible in this engine. Most mods for this tend to be less traditional with the gameplay, and often change things up a lot more. Great for those who want to play gameplay mods, and certain partial/total conversions.-Odamex/ZandronumThese are basically multiplayer source ports with online capabilities. Odamex for a more traditional approach, and Zandronum for a more modern approach.			",533,74,15,52,12,3,58

												This is unquestionably one of the most important and influential titles in gaming history. A beyond impressive and brilliant game with sterling level design, massive arsenal at your disposal, boundless amount of destruction and gore, and a lot of adrenaline. Disturbing imagery matched with fierce demons and beasts, paired with some of the catchiest, most memorable, and magnificent soundtracks of all time, fitting for all the action this gem carries. This is the groundbreaking and revolutionary title for first person shooters, and the reason the genre got popular. A must-have for any shooter fan. 9.7/10.0 ",332,52,17,28,17,1,21

												One of the biggest names in gaming. It is credited for kickstarting the FPS genre into mainstream success and pushing mature content into gaming in general. On a less worthy note, it was heavily blamed for failing grades, loss in work production and, much worse, school shooting and mass murders. Thankfully, more recent studies have discredited the more horrendous claims, but is the praise directed towards it justified? The short answer has been an obvious ""Freak yes!!!"" for most people who were at their gaming prime in the era, but what about the younger Milennials like myself and the current generation of teens not fully fitting said title but who are allowed such mature pleasures? Let's take a look.The game has a mian menu where you can simply click ""New game"" and choosing your desired chapter and one of cleverly named difficulties, from ""I'm Too Young to Die!"" all the way to ""Ultra-Violence"" and, what I can only guess as Romero's devious abortion-given-life, ""NIGHTMARE!,"" a difficulty where most of the speed run community has agreed is not required for ""hardest difficulty"" runs, Ultra-Violence the accepted level of challenge for these teeth-gritters. Tangent aside, once you pick your options, the unthinkable for the modern-era happens; you're thrust into the game right at the start. No cuscenes, not even a loading screen. Just you, a gun, and stuff for you to shoot and pick up. the enemies are varied and the number and types depend on your chosen difficulty. The mission is simple: to kill demons andget to the end of the level. Gunplay is simple and there's no looking up or down as per 1993 technology. Instead, it aims up and down for you. the last level of each chapter culminates into a boss figh. The first chapter ""Knee-Deep in the Dead"" simply introduces you to Barons of Hell which becomes regular troops in later chapters, the 2nd Shores of Hell"" pits you against the iconic Cyberdemon, the third ""Inferno"" thrusts you against the Chaingunning Spider Mastermind and the 4th chapter ""Thy Flesh Consumed"" has essentially an extended remake of the third's (which I will delve into soon).The simple and straightfoward gameplay was the joy of many people back in the 90's, and with the releases of hyper-scripted and otherwise sub-par games in recent years, younger players can find refreshing enjoyment too. And there's one aspect of the game that has ensured its continuing relevancy: Mods. A feature that modern companies avoid like the plague since it nullifies their ability to shove broken DLC into the market, mods are custom bits of content made by players for the game to distribute freely on the internet. From simple map-packs to complete souce-ports to bring the game into modern systems, DOOM's modding community has been providing content since the game's release. With more content to download that any game today can provide in DLC, it's always worth going online and seeing what you can pick up and play from the DOOM community.There are a few problems, however. The aforementioned 4th chapter is the biggest, as it has no continuity for the skill romp in the previous chapters, instead just thrusting you into a bunch of insane levels with no regards to actual balance or skill cap, and the last non-secret level simply just gives you another Spider Mastermind as a boss with more enemies to fight in other arenas. The ""Nightmare!"" difficulty which I went on a tangent about is ignored for a reason, as it has all of the monster count of Ultra-Violence, but increases the damage of the monsters by 50% and respawns them after 10-20 seconds, making longer levels almost impossible, even for the nimble speed runners. These problems are avoidable, as Ultra-Violence is the community agreed ""hardest difficulty"" And most people don't bat an eyelash when you say you hate ""Thy Flesh Consumed"". The only other problem I've run across are the Barons being regular troops, as their high health pool simply makes them an ammo-consuming meat-sack as modern WASD controls mean you can easily avoid their slow but damaging main attack.The game holds up through all these years, and despite the flaws, can be enjoyable for anyone of any age. With simple gameplay, and mods and source ports that usher the game into the modern era, you'd be a fool not to pick this game up long with the Sequel, Doom II: Hell on Earth. Heck, even buy the DOOM Classic complete, as you get even more demon-slaying goodness. Happy hunting.			",252,30,0,16,4,3,17

												A lot can be said about Doom. It started a fascination with first-person shooters that still lingers to this day. It spurred a rise in violent video games that eventually necessitated a ratings system. It pushed the limitations of 3D graphics to breathtaking highs in 1993. It revolutionized LAN play and was the catalyst for internet TCP/IP play.But by now, you probably all know that. Doom is such a big name that it was even made into a (rather mediocre) film in 2005. It's become part of pop culture and the media conciousness. To try and sum it up is pointless.What you really want to know is whether or not grabbing the Steam version is worth it. In it's default state, I would say no. The copies on Steam are emulated through DOSBox, which kind of sucks. The games run fine and all, but they have low resolution, choppy sound and some obtuse key bindings.Still, ID Software also pioneered a new file format when they released Doom; the WAD file. Since this version is basically the same one from the 1995 re-release, it has the WAD file that can be extracted to any numerous source ports available. There is even a method of making ZDoom (one of the most popular ports) work with the Steam overlay.For that reason, if you don't already own Doom, then go ahead and grab it on Steam. $15 is a great price for 2 classic games and some expansion packs. It doesn't hurt that the fundamental design of Doom is timeless. Even if you have played it before, it remains addictive and ingenius all these years later.If anything, I think I'll be playing this until I die. I may go years without touching a single WAD, but when the itch comes, I always stick around for a long while. Those source ports can also get you online multiplayer (along with a host of other ""enhancements""), so you really cannot go wrong.As for the game itself, I've always loved the simplicity of Doom's design. The level layouts feel like labyrinths and require some lateral thinking. The enemy design is brilliant; it conveys exactly what you need to know in seconds. Even the sound design helps with it's directional audio and individual sound bytes. This is one of the best examples of retro gaming, bar none.While I may prefer the sequel for it's faster combat, it's hard to deny how well made each episode in Doom is. The first episode, to be specific, is one of the greatest collections of maps you're bound to ever find. Even the pointless fourth episode (that was a bonus to the ""Ultimate"" Doom) can be a bit of fun.The game may not be long, but there is definitely a good reason that it has remained a staple for many PC gamers.10/10			",388,51,7,30,13,4,36

												The best game ever made, perhaps.  Very easy to play it on Steam using whatever sourceport or frontend you might prefer: just throw it in the game's install folder and rename your chosen executable to dosbox.  Using ZDL with gzDoom makes it super easy for me to load up the game with whatever WAD I feel like playing — including Doom II, for example, provided I copy doom2.wad into the same folder (or just direct ZDL to its location).  You can even throw in stuff like pk_anim.wad (look it up) for smoother weapon animations, which is pretty neat.  Some of you might prefer Chocolate Doom over something like gzDoom for a more pixel-accurate early '90s experience: easily done.  Maybe you want to switch over to Zandronum for some deathmatch: you got it.  Anyway, yes.  Lots of FPS games have come and gone, but Doom remains the golden standard for me.  With all the fantastic WADs available out there, it's a gift that keeps on giving.			",367,93,5,45,18,1,47

												A true classic.  There are better fronmtends capable of running DOOM (like ZDoom, GZdoom, etc...) than using DOSBox.  ""Ultimate Doom"" is the final developer's master cut of DooM and whether you are a veteran or newbie to the original DooM series, it is quite enjoyable.I have only one word of warning to the new generation of gamers attempting DooM for the first time, barely anyone who played this back in the eraaly to mid 1990's used a mouse.  Doom was not exactly designed around aiming up or down, so do not be surprised if you use a frontend outside of DOSBox to play it and notice bilboard sprite monsters.			",94,16,6,9,6,0,2

												(as you may have guessed, my Steam playtime do not represent my actual hours in DOOM, which are probably in the thousands)Still one of the best (if not the the best) shooters ever made.Originally released in 1993, DOOM raised the bar and set the standard for the FPS genre.Unlike many shooters of the time, DOOM has aged extremely well thanks to its great design and is still very much playable today if you can look past its dated (but still nice) graphics.DOOM still has a very active community that continues to play the game online and make mods for it, so there's tons of content out there even after you've beat the game.Pros:Smooth gameplay that just feels right, gunning down hordes of demons never gets old.Legendary level design, memorable maps with tons of secrets.Active modding/multiplayer community.Decent graphics (albeit dated), still manages a to build a good atmosphere.Good music, sound design is generally pretty good too.Cons:Lacklustre ""port"", it's just the old v1.9 DOS exec ran under DOSBox. I'd highly recommend downloading a modern ""source port"" such as ZDoom[zdoom.org], GZDoom[forum.drdteam.org](ZDoom with a modern OpenGL renderer), or Zandronum[zandronum.com](GZDoom with client-server multiplayer) for the best DOOM experience.Which raises another issue, this game is designed for keyboard, so playing with WASD + Mouse makes the game a bit easy compared to just arrow keys.Framerate is locked to 35 FPS, which is fixed in aforementioned source ports.The price seems a tiny bit high for such an old game, definitely worth it on sale however.

												FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you are running this on Windows 7 (especially x64):1. Find the game executable. (If you don't know what that is, find a nerd and for the love of all that is holy, don't try this yourself.)2. Right click and then left click on properties.3. In the window that pops up, click the ""compatibility"" tab and then the tick box next to ""run this in compatibility mode."" Or something to that effect.4. Select ""Windows XP Service Pack 2"" in the drop down thingie.5. Try it out.6. If that doesn't allow you to play it, then repeat steps 1 and 2. But also click on the ""compatibility"" tab.7. Tick the ""run in 640 x 480"" box.8. Try it again.9. If that doesn't work, google how to run the game in windowed mode. It's actually easy, just more steps than I can put here.10. Try it one more time..11. If it still doesn't work. Go find a nerd.This is a classic and dare I say iconic piece of gaming history! I bet many of you remember playing one of the versions of doom on either an ancient PC or console. I recall playing the first Doom on SNES, leaving the system on for days at a time so I could sleep and pick up where I left off and finally beat it. Taking shifts with my two best friends.. Good times. Then buying that wonderful little gadget made by Naki or something I think that took some AA batteries and allowed you to save a game that didn't have a save function via some form of wizardry to me at the time.All of the Doom iterations where good. I don't recall a single bomb. This one was super awesome, in particular. Was grateful to see it here on Steam. :D If memory serves, there was a CD that came with some video game magazine back in the day that had 1000+ extra levels that you could install to this game so you could go on playing virtually forever. One of those CDs will eventually be found millions of years in the future by aliens or whomever inherits the earth after we destroy ourselves, but doubtful you're going to find one. I can't really say here, but I would suggest getting on a big wooden boat with a flag that resembles a warning label and sale the 7 seas looking for them in another form.			",151,49,2,55,8,3,32

												I haven't so much memories with Doom. I remember having like ""Minigames 200 in 1"" disk, what contains a small games in it (well, that's obvious). I saw this game, but controlls were awful (not like the original, surprisingly), and I just forgot about it. 7 years later, I saw a discount on a steam, and I'm glad, what I bought the Classic Complete Pack.But back in business. Graphics are pretty good, and will never gets old for this legendary game.Soundtrack is outstanding, and that's why you must like Doom. Even though I prefer FMOD soundfont, the OPL soundtrack is not that bad, and there's couple of them, what I like too.Gameplay is simple - you get guns, you USE guns to get to the end.Mod supporting is making this game playable as hell, because people love it, and mod creators is on top! Tons of them to do your own experience. Without GZDoom, I think my fingers will be tired in a 1 hour. And Brutal Doom, well, I don't need to explain you, the name speaks for itself.If you like to play some old games, it's definitely worth a try.			",84,6,3,9,5,2,3

												Doom is a legendary FPS that came out in 1993 on PC and was ported to many other consoles, with ports of various quality. It was released by shareware model and had 3 episodes if your ordered. Later it was released as Ultimate Doom, adding the 4th episode.Compared to other ports it has full levels and most content. PS1 and Saturn port have it combined with Doom 2 levels and have dark horror atmosphere, with N64 having it's own dark horror atmosphere and was like a new game build from scratch, with it's own levels. The only thing some ports have over PC technically got to be colored lighting. So, you don't miss much, be happy with DOS version.As old game, we should take a look at how Steam version handles Doom. And well, Id Software once again did a horrible job with handling DOSBox.First, it wasn't configured probably, thus it lags amazingly in full-screen mode. To fix that you have to go to game's folder and edit line at ""output"" to ""opengl"" in ""ultimate.conf"" and ""ultimatem.conf"" files.Second, as you launch game you will notice that you get to choose two control methods: with mouse and classic (Like real man, keyboard only!). And it uses Soundblaster device for Music instead of Midi that everybody is used to. You may think that you can use DOSBox, navigate to game's folder and launch ""setup.exe"" to configure stuff for yourself, but too bad! Id Software decided not to put it into Steam's version. Your only way to configure controls and music is editing ""DEFAULT.CFG"" and ""MOUSE.CFG"" files. Where you have to guess which numbers is related to what keyboard button.But once you fixed all those issues you will finally get to play Doom. Ultimate edition, yep. Without any plot or cutscenes... Errr, aside from those at the end of episodes. Without much plot and cutscenes, you are going to be immeditly thrown into levels, each one being a compilated maze and a step over the ealier FPS levels, also having buttons to press which can do something else aside from opening doors and keys to collect. Each of 4 episodes has 8 normal levels and 1 secrets, and I gotta say that the secret level of the third episode is brilliant idea. I also should mention that the first, WHOLE first episode is available for free in demo (shareware) version of a game, and that game is easier than Doom 2 in general. Aside form the 4th episode, which was added with Ultimate Doom version and is even harder than Doom 2, especially first few levels, though that episode doesn't have any new content to it.The presentation of the game is quite good. It's colorful more or less while giving it a dirty darkish feeling. Heck, game was considered scary at release, with usage of sector lighting, it even has has fog-like effect where you can see less clearly in dark places, nice. The resolution isn't big and colors are still quite limited, but with all the maze nacigation and sprite scaling it had to do, the game was at the top of technology cutting edge, especially in FPS genre. At least on PC and consoles, Arcades were still kicking. So, you can say that this was the point where console players got something to envy PCs over, while playing their own awesome platformers.Gameplay is just plain awesome, pure arcadeish FPS. It's quite a fast-paced game, with many pickups, wide enemy variety, set of weapons, non-regenerating health, map that you can call with Tab so you will not get lost in mazes and, most importantly, instead of being focused on cover-hiding, it was more about projectile avoidance and more out-into-field shooting and running. Well, almost. Zombie enemies still shoot hitscan at you, but those are low-tier enemies, die easily, not used as much as imps. And compared to many other FPS at that time, Doom is more of fair challenge. Once again, Doom is not perfect, it got hitscan zombies with gun and it even forces you to run over damaging acid/lava few times in some levels, it's not Heretic, but compared to games on Build engine, it's better.Though one of the things that may put people off is that levels are abstract mazes. Looking nice but making no logical sense of place to it.It has 8 weapons to keep, from useless fist and pistol, up to BFG9000. It's not perfectly balanced, plasmagun outdoes chaingun, while chaingun outdoes pistol while using same ammo pool, but it's a step over Wolf3D, as in some situation some weapons are better. The effective use of BFG9000 also doesn't make common sense, you should read FAQ somewhere over this. But hey, at least it was before SuperShotgun came, with it being best weapon in whole game in Doom 2.Dissapointing thing got to be bosses. There is only few. Two uncommon dangerous Barons of Hell in Episode 1, which were used later anyway. And then there is Cyberdemon in Episode 2 who's attack can be avoided too easily and Spider Mastermind in Episode 3 who has hitscan attack and you just have to rush him down. Episode 4 also doesn't have anything of it's own.Multiplayer isn't supported in Steam version, you will have to use Zandronum source port. Or some other mutlipalyer source ports.So, Ultimate Doom is awesome FPS. Simpler than Doom 2, but less brown and has it's own feel. You get to run over mazes while shooting down enemies in fast-paced manner. It's legendary too, though not perfect game. Highly recommended, none the less.If you want to get into Doom modding and mods, then instead head toward Doom 2 destination, sir.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												I say go play it! A game of my childhood and a game I still play to this day. I grew up with the PSX version along with Doom 64, however, this game still brings the nostalgia and still keeps you entertained to this day!Ultimate Doom comes with 4 awesome episodes and each episode contains 8 levels plus an extra secret level each. In my opinion the best way to play this is to get a sourceport of your choice (GZdoom [I use this], Zdoom, or possibly prboom) and relive the nostalgia or if you are new to Doom, the experience the greatness! One of, if not the grandpa of the FPS genre (however, you can argue Wolfenstein 3D did it first or even the ""true original shooter"" could be argued there too I geuss) but honestly, Doom really is what took the genre to a new level. The internet has the best ways on how to set up a sourceport, but basically you just paste the ""doom.wad"" file from your steam game into the sourceport folder and WELLA! It should work when you run the sourceport .exe!Also, the content for this game is endless, with so many WADS made for it. However, to get the most content out of these games, also get Doom II, as most WADS are made for that game! Heck, just get the entire classic complete collection. Totally worth it!P.S. my hours on this game are so low because I use the sourceport and the .wad externally, rather than through steam, however if you like to show off your hours, you can set that up.

												Pros- Satisfying Gunplay. Running around like a jackrabbit as a space marine blowing the bits out of demons and zombies with like chainguns, shotguns, and plasma guns is pretty fun.- Fun to explore levels, though I will admit it is pretty easy to get lost in some areas.- Interesting Enemy designs- Did I mention you're a space marine fighting demons in mars all the way through hell?Cons- It's a game from 1994. The graphics arent great by today's standards and you may very well not. Also first few tries running the game, it didn't mouse support, And had to look through the steam forums for a fix. You may have the same issues.If you can stand graphics from 20 years ago and enjoy first person shooters where you obliterate armies of demons, yes you may very well like this game and pretty much the entire Doom Classic Pack. They're all pretty dope.Note: I'd highly suggest you also try playing the mod Brutal Doom. It's a pretty dope mod, it's pretty much the same game only more difficult and with improved animation sprites and gore, as well as additional takedowns and weapons. You'd just need GZdoom to run it, and i'd actually suggest installing either Zdoom or GZdoom. They run the game better than DOSbox does, plus you've got a lot more options in the options menu.

												Classic. It's a word that is used often... And really, I think it's lost it's impact. Everything that holds nostalgic value in some way, shape and form is ""classic"". Whether jokingly admiring an admittedly BAD piece of media that you liked as a kid, or enjoying one of many similar games out there, ones that don't entirely speak for themselves; we all state that the things we like are ""classic"". In this case, the genre already existed in various, fledgling forms such as Maze War, and Spasim in the early 70's... All the way up to the venerable title Wolfenstein, a game that helped truly mold the genre at it's most basic values, by the very same company that crafted the leviathan trend-setter for the ages- the masterpiece I'm going to attempt to describe here. It was a title that, at the time, would have been mentioned of in hushed excited tones by the kids at school. A title that was so wildly different, the news media used its inferno-based imagery and its playstyle as a scapegoat for heinous crimes committed. A title SO revolutionary that every single developer creating games that followed in its footsteps were considered ""clones""....And rightfully so, many were just carbon copying the EXACT ideals, or in MOST cases, even code, right from this legend. This was the mark of something different, in how was distributed, in how open and accessable much of the content was, and how people played games together: over the internet. The most classic game of this genre may not be the very FIRST of its kind, but the genre truly coalesced with one Big. ♥♥♥♥ing. Game. It's name is Doom. and it is classic. Even if you did not like doom, or grow up with it or even PLAY Doom... Go look up the definition of classic. While those things may be subjective, and that's why we're capable of throwing the label onto anything, it is undeniable that this game is the grandaddy of them all.       I've given a large enough intro, and i doubt anyone wants to ready the lofty and article-like writing of a giant nerd such as myself for hours, regarding a game that you probably don't even fully care for... So I'll break this down for you.-The perspective had been done before (and then CONSTANTLY AFTER), but the quality and the art drawn in was revolutionary. It still holds up to this day with the right Source Mod (more on that later)- The sounds, the lighting effects, everything it set out to do, such as running on lower end machines, and even looking and sounding better on NEWER ones, meant that the modular tuning and graphics engine design were brilliant, John Carmack crafted an amazing source code.-The set up, a protagonist with no dialogue, the story elements cut, is another trend-setter for the genre. The creators intention despite the entertaining HUD, was to make YOU the protagonist, allowing you to relate more and create your own feeling for the nameless marine.-Multiplayer. Coop with damage enabled, and deathmatch. Doom did it arguably first, or for the time, best.-How the title was distributed: you got Episode 1 (sound familiar, Valve fans?) for free. 9 levels to play and enjoy nearly everything Doom offered. Free. If you enjoyed it? There were more to buy and enjoy. This leads to two gigantic pillars for which Doom stands as the father of FPS, and helped inspire Valve to do what they're loved for now-The source code became open and free to modify a few years later. This allowed for countless mods using Ids revolutionary and modular ""WAD"" file format. - and for people to convert the source code to run on platform ports (source ports), so that this old DOS game can work on modern machines.... While enjoying mods that enhance and even modernize gameplay.The best (well rounded) Source Port to download is GZDoom. Get that, buy this, and run your doom.wad through it. Tune the old graphics enough to clean them up, and relive the classic.Once you're done, get some mods. I recommend:Brutal DoomProject MSX - (amazing HUD with modern mechanics, changes monsters)Dark 7 - ( amazing mapset, play it with Project MSX)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Those can get you started. And yes, GZDoom will allow you to look UP and DOWN with your mouse...Jump (which is cheating ;] ) and even crouch.Enjoy.Fun facts about Doom:Not only was Valve likely inspired by their open distribution of the title, and source-code policies, but they got their start in game design thanks to Id software.Gabe Newell and Doug Lombardi visited Id around the time of their next trend setter- the fully 3D Quake. Id helped them start up by giving the entrepeneur coders the source code to Quake, Id Tech 2.... Which they then heavily modified and dubbed Gold Source.... Officialy GoldSrc. This engine powered Half Life.When Gabe Newell was still working for Microsoft, he was the programmer that ported Doom over to Windows from DOS, in an attempt to get more people to accept the platform, as Doom was the most widely downloaded application of the era. It had been downloaded and installed more than Windows itself at the time.			",241,14,6,20,7,2,17

												I don't really suggest buying this version of the game, but I'm still leaving a thumbs up because it's DOOM and it's cheap, but it's hard to say which version to suggest because they mostly all have something annoying about them.For new players I suggest buying the Doom 3 BFG Edition which includes Ultimate Doom and Doom II running in something of a wrapped, enhanced port with higher resolution, better speed and controls, and sadly some gutted features as well. It is much easier to get running properly.This version runs in DOSBox and while there's nothing wrong with that, the config file is missing from the Steam version of this release, and they've never fixed this, and they really should, so I can change my options. The GOG version doesn't have this problem. It's hard not to recommend a version of DOOM, but I would say buy this on GOG instead of steam if you want to emulate DOS properly, or buy BFG if you want to get into the game quickly and just play. It's worth noting that the BFG versions have Achievements, while that's more or less not even possible on the DOSBox versions. This version would be a better value if it came wrapped in its own port as well, with the option to run it in emulated DOS if so desired.Whichever version you do get is no big deal because the real fun starts once you're running DOOM in the source port of your choice such as GZDoom if you like pretty lights, or Chocolate Doom if you wanna stay purist. All you need is the WAD file from any version of the game.If you really want this version of the game to be completionist or whatever then you're probably shopping for a boxed copy of Ultimate Doom anyway, but if you're not, go ahead and pick this up if you really need to run it in emulated DOS. I don't know if you can even install this on a real DOS system.			",241,8,9,3,4,0,1

												Before you buy the new COD or Battlefield, get this game that started it all. I both love the COD and Battlefield franchises but this game has given me more fun in 4 hours than the 80+ hours Ive played on BO3. You get a lot more than what you pay for. Plus when you beat the main story you can go online and download custom maps, or download mods like ""Brutal Doom"". or play online with your friends. You cant beat the classics!			",101,7,0,4,7,0,2

												It's DOOM. Play this if you like old-school games, gaming history and/or well-designed shooters & somehow haven't tried it yet. What else is there to say about it?Alright, I'll give it a shot. In 1993, ID Software more or less revolutionized the first-person shooter genre (again) with a game that was not only blazingly fast and good-looking for the time, but played and aged so well it inspired a fanbase that persists to this day.There have been tens of thousands of custom maps and modifications for Doom and its immediate sequel over the years that take the game in every conceivable direction, and while the 'Doomer' fandom isn't exactly the monstrously huge construction you'd expect to find camping on tumblr*, there's no sign of Doom being truly abandoned any time soon.You might think, yeah, it was good in its day, but it looks so crude and simple today. Why would anyone still play it? Well, apart from the huge realm of custom content, Doom's gameplay is simply very, very well-tuned. It's a little comparable to bullet hell or chess, in that there's more focus on dodging enemy attacks than there is on tanking them.Doom's monster AI is simple yet open-ended enough to make for a wide variety of tactical situations, and the player's movement & weaponry aren't any less finely crafted. The one criticism that I can think of is that the gatling gun (which is also incorrectly referred to as a 'chaingun') more or less replaces your starting pistol.Basically, it's easy to get into, but has enough nuance and depth to carry itself even today. For a while after it was released, games in a similar style were explicitly called 'Doom clones'. To the modern observer, Doom managed to drive progress in the genre enough that in hindsight there really wasn't much shame to be had in being a 'clone' of such an excellent game. (Shoving hundreds of WADs from the Internet into a commercially-released CD was another story.[doom.wikia.com])You can't look up or down either, at least not in the game's original form. While there's absolutely something to be said for Doom's purity of form (and compensating autoaim), the ability to look in any direction is kind of a boon for newer games.You probably wouldn't want to play this for the story: you'll literally only find the setup in the game's manual. There's just enough story to justify what's happening in the game, although what's there is good for what it is.Once the technology was in place, Doom also became a catalyst for early online gaming. This game is, in fact, where the term 'deathmatch' came from. There's still[zandronum.com] options[www.zdaemon.org] available to play Doom with or against other people, without the murderous rates people had to pay 20 years ago. Perhaps bare-bones in comparison to today's offerings, but certainly faster in pace and intensity.Steam's included DOSBox port is pretty poor, so I would recommend grabbing a sourceport like Chocolate Doom or ZDoom. Those two are my personal favorites - the former lets you experience the game as it was in the '90s, and the latter lets you easily load all sorts of modern mods and enhancements.Doom's default controls are frankly a relic from the pre-WASD standard days, but fortunately pretty much every sourceport lets you change the controls and even look up & down if you wish. I would recommend at least trying the original controls, though, if you're going to start playing Doom.If you really want to experience classic Doom, you'd do well to pick up its aforementioned sequel at the very least. It adds new enemies and one new weapon, not to mention 32 new levels, and it's been more popular with custom level designers ever since it came out in 1994. That may not sound like much, but then again, if it ain't broke...As of this humble summation of Doom, the game in question has persisted for 23 years. I would seriously bet that it will last 23 more.*Not that I particularly dislike tumblr, of course.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

Uh oh! The map is being overrun by enemies! Do you:A. Escort a poorly programmed essential A.I. through monotonous level design for a QTE finale?B. Grind your way through ham-fisted and mind-numbing exposition atop consecutive turret sections?C. Hold down the fire button as the rail-shooter pulls you through an abysmal excuse of a narrative?The correct answer? D, baby. D is for Doom.Your mission is simple: rip and tear your way through the hordes of hell with your arsenal of bloody mayhem, experiencing the revolutionary shooter that set the world afire and the tears of outrage and controversy flowing. The godfather of the FPS genre is still in excellent shape, even after more than twenty years since release. Don't let the system requirements put you off, this runs perfectly well on new operating systems with a few tweaks. It's pretty easy to take for granted from a modern perspective what games such as Doom, System Shock and Half-Life had on the gaming industry upon their release; almost single-handedly creating and then revolutionising the FPS genre. The phenomenal response to the shareware release of Doom and it's colossal (and enduring) success is due to absolutely nailing the formula and standard that id had previously set with Wolfenstein.From the exceptional level design, full of secrets and opportunities for your trusty shotgun to earn its keep, to the brilliant soundtrack backed by excellent sound design as yet another imp is blown away, Doom is everything that many shooters have forgotten: Simple, bloody, fast and instantly gratifying chaos. When was the last time you played something that was this much fun?Too outdated for you? Then install Brutal Doom, the Project Brutality add-on or various source ports to bring the blood into a whole new era. Welcome back, marine.""Good? Bad? I'm the guy with the gun."" Hell awaits.

												The most influential first person-shooter of all time, and likely still the greatest. Even after 21 years, no game combines the simple but challenging mix of gunplay, exploration and resource management quite as successfully. A plethora of sourceports keep the game feeling fresh; add to that the almost legendary modding community, still going strong after 2 decades, and you have a game that delivers not only tremendous entertainment value, but an entire legacy. An absolute must-have for practically any gamer on the planet.			",269,25,8,32,25,3,45

												Doom is quite simply the best shooter ever made and it's not just the nostalgia talking. The pure unadulterated ultra-violence is still as raw and visceral as it was when it was released in 1993. In terms of pure enjoyment in the form of fast paced action, this game delivers in spades. It is what every shooter today pretends not to be as they try to disguise themselves under thinly veiled attempts at plot and character development, a no-brainer all out gore fest. It gives us what we want from a shooter with no unnecessary bells and whistles too often used in modern FPS games to cover up the fact that the game play is simply lacking behind the masquerade of fancy graphics and tedious cut-scenes that ultimately get in the way of the fun, I'm looking at you Call of Duty. I love intricate stories and fully developed characters in games, notable examples of these are the Mass Effect and Witcher series, but this is a genre that has never been about that. This is a genre where the only time you should get a break from the action is the loading screen between levels. Moreover, thanks to the dedicated and thriving fan base there are a plethora of mods and custom WAD files that are constantly breathing new life in to this game. 21 years later and there are still multiplayer servers active, that alone is pretty impressive.

												(spoilerfree review)Greatest shooter of all time!I played my complete playthrough of Ultimate Doom for the first time in 2014 and I'm still impressed!The soundtrack with the metal / rock music from the 80's and 90's is awesome!The gameplay is awesome! For one of the first FPS this had an amazing gameplay with speed!I played Doom in ""Hurt me plenty"" and I was challenging. I will try ""Ultra-Violence"" with pleasure!The Leveldesign is brillant. Very often I was amazed and I thought: ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this leveldesign kicks more♥♥♥♥♥than nowadays game."" This is really sad that a shooter from 1993 has better designed levels than fps from the past years.A big plus is the doom community. Doom is one of this game with the biggest community and a large achrive with custom levels / mods. Check it out, there are many goldies!The Doom Engine was amazing it its time.Ultimate Doom is a re-release of doom 1 in the year 1995. As far as I know, Ultimate Doom made Level E1M1 more Deathmatch compatible and there is a brand new (for it's time of course) fourth episode.id Software, please make DOOM (4) at least like this game and you will ROCK!

Despite this, I finally checked out Doom and regret not doing so sooner. It's an absolute blast; fun, challenging gameplay with a high skill ceiling. The level design is top-notch, making each level both a gauntlet and a puzzle. Recommended to anyone who enjoys challenging, fast-paced gameplay, whether or not they're normally into shooters.

Product received for free
												My steam account says I've only put 27 minutes in but I played at my uncles and we put in 5 almost 6 hours into it straight. And we loved it. Especially the cereal. We took some Fruit Loops, Trix, Fruity Pebbles, and Captain Crunch and mixed them together. It was the bomb. Then we watched Back to the Future. But you can easily get lost in this game for hours and hours. While we playing we set bandicam and we didn't ever shut it off. Even after we were done with DOOM. It was probably the greatest weekend of my life. We spent 30 minutes on one level looking for this secret door. Then we were fighting a boss on this little platform surrounded by lava only to find out it wasn't lava. We died at least 15 times, then we beat them with a lot more room. If you like a game with lots of enemies, lots of secrets, and the occasional puzzle this game is for you. And like I said best weekend ever.			",56,3,2,7,5,0,7

												If you buy this, or any of the other classic DOOM games, you have 2 options to have a decent experience:1: Get the .WAD files and use them with a source port of your choice, however this wont track your stats on steam.2: Put a source port in the game directory and rename the source port exe to 'dosbox.exe' and delete the original dosbox of course. This will let you run a source port and still have Steam track game time and show when you're playing it.Don't even bother using the DOSbox emulation that comes with it, it has performance issues, runs in an awful resolution, has awful sound emulation, and has no mouse look option whatsoever, if you plan on playing it 100% faithful to the original DOS experience, don't use DOSbox, build or buy a 486.Wait, a review for the game? Saying great things about it is basically copypasta at this point, you've heard it before.			",171,12,3,14,15,0,7

												If you never heard of doom, then there is something wrong with you. The story is basic, but you don't come to play doom for story you play for gameplay damn it. The gameplay in doom is basic but addicting and very challenging none the less. The weapons are typical you have a chainsaw, pistol, shotgun, chain gun, rocket launcher, plasma gun, and the BFG 9k. There is a total of 4 episodes all of which are all well designed. I recommend using skulltag if you want better controls and multiplayer which is very fun and addicting. Along with that there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of wars some of  my favorites are the stranger, brutal doom, doom vercetti, and natzis.10/10 legendary game you need to play it			",340,5,1,7,5,2,4

												For 10 bucks you'd at least expect a proper port that doesn't require extra configuration, editing tons of text lines and downloading of other files over the internet to actually work. Doom is amazing. This port isn't.The newer your operating system, the least chances to not crash on start.If you are new to the Doom series and want to give the first 2 games a shot, use a source port such as GZDoom[gzdoom.drdteam.org] or ZDoom[zdoom.org] instead. There are many ports out there and not only are they easy to install and use, but also come with better option menus that allow for different resolutions, graphical settings, modern controls and vertical mouselook.If you're still rotting for this vanilla feel this steam port is supposed to bring, try out the Chocolate Doom port[www.chocolate-doom.org], which simulates how the game was played back in the 90's.

												Oddly enough this game will freeze as soon as you get to the title screen without you editing the .cfg files.Although this game is amazing and has me playing for hours! I personally love this game to death becauseof its creative levels and it being a revival of the whole FPS genre! While it is a very short 3-5 hour game,you can download and create your own levels quite easily for a game from 1994. This game is highly reccomendedto those that are looking back at it for nostolgia and younger gamers (such as myself) who want to look back atthe once good FPS genre. 10/10 Amazing!

												As you can tell by my profile picture, I like this game. I play it again every few years. It's really amazing to see how different first person shooters were when id software was the only one's doing it and had nothing to compare to. You don't look up or down, aiming in the vertical plane is done automatically. There is no commanding officer shouting orders through a radio. The story is told in the instruction manual and by a paragraph at the end of each episode. No need to reload weapons. DOOM was made with one goal in mind: shoot everything and anything that moves. Usually when you play a really old game, you think about how good it would be with modern graphics, but with DOOM there is some sort of uniqueness about its graphics, you don't seem to mind. Bottom Line: DOOM is absolute carnage. A must play.			",133,21,3,12,9,0,9

												Game Review:It's Doom. It is one of the greatest games of all time.Atmosphere:The atmosphere in Doom is perfect (in the first 3 chapters atleast), and isn't too dark for it's own good. (Like another game later in the franchise).Story:The story in this game barely exists, because it doesn't need one. There's demons. Kill them.Sound:The music is some of the greatest and some of it is just metal songs from the early 90s in MIDI form.Weapons:The main guns you will ever use are the shotgun and plasma gun. The other weapons are good and have their uses, but they aren't AS useful as the first two I mentioned.Overall:The orignal 3 chapters of Doom are great and very memorable. However if you're getting this you definintely need to get a source port ( I suggest GZDoom or ZDoom). Everything about this game is great. If you haven't played it you should, and besides it's only $5.Final Verdict:Buy it Now			",97,5,0,7,2,0,1

												Whats not to love about DOOM its one of the first FPS games ever made. I maybe a bit bias BUT THIS IS ONE MOTHER TRUCKING AWSOME GAME  & YOU CANT SPELL DOOM WITH OUT CAPS YEAHHHH!!!!!Sorry got over exsited lets get on with the reviewI can rember playing this when i was 6-7  and it scaring the crap out of me i always put god mod on for the cyber demon as he was terrifiying. But not any more (said cowering under his desk)But seriouslyIts still got an active modding comunity there are tons of extra maps you can get at no cost if you know where to look if you get doom builder make your own level challenge your friends.Best part is you dont need to know how to use any code script etc...If you are craving some type of zombie mode if your a cod zombie lover  just create a level with  a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of enermys and see how long you can last  or try the NUTS wad trust me its fun to play. This version is a bit lacking in graphical style but what do you expect from the early 90s i think its just a beuatiful as when i first played it and you get that nostalgic feeling There are some source ports that  will add extra pretty grafics as well as up down look and jumps and other things  another like the selfie stick lmao i mean ok its not how i rember playing DOOM  but its worth a go if the orginals a bit dated for you or you feel like spiceing things up :)but i do encourage you if you have not played this befor to play the original i urge you if you havent played it or if you have in the past to get this awsome game if you do not own it as its soo much fun especialy if you and a few friends death match or co op the campaigne on nightmare dificulty another reason to buy are the levels are almost not scripted like cod and BF you can go almost any where aslong as you have found the key :)the levels are well crafted and they have secrets filled of demons or goodys :)OH AND A BIG P.Syou call of duty and battlefield fan boys should have to salute and bow down to this demon slaying bad♥♥♥♥♥that is DOOM GUY!!!!coz if DOOM didnt exsist neither will cod or BFpeace out guys hope you like my review :)			",243,8,3,5,4,2,2

												Most people have already said most of the great stuff about this game, so I'm just going to tell you not to play the steam game alone, play it with a source port galled GZdoom. Some negative reviews of this game on steam say that the steam version sucks but the game itself is good, well GZdoom fixes almost everything about the steam game, so play this game, and you have to use GZ doom or you're doing it wrong, you will do yourself a favor, and 5 dollars isn't that much for most people. If you can't afford spending 5 dollars, you shouldn't be playing games anyway until you fix your financial problems.			",78,8,0,0,1,0,13

												'Ultimate' DooM may have been ultimate in '95, but nowadays it's basically archaic. I don't even consider the base version playable--an 800x600 window that ♥♥♥♥s up Windows' colors? Eww--Z-Doom is basically required, which gives fullscreen windows, at least 720p and very customizable controls/audio. Alas, even Ultimate Z-Doom isn't perfect; the perfect version of DooM is a Z-doom with the Panasonic 3DO's music in it; the high-quality audio redone by a live band(name sadly unkown) is amazing. I'd still recommend Ultimate Z-DooM, but we REALLY need a modern version of this.			",104,13,0,6,2,0,3

												Game Review:It's Doom. It is one of the greatest games of all time.Atmosphere:The atmosphere in Doom is perfect (in the first 3 chapters atleast), and isn't too dark for it's own good. (Like another game later in the franchise).Story:The story in this game barely exists, because it doesn't need one. There's demons. Kill them.Sound:The music is some of the greatest and some of it is just metal songs from the early 90s in MIDI form.Weapons:The main guns you will ever use are the shotgun and plasma gun. The other weapons are good and have their uses, but they aren't AS useful as the first two I mentioned.Overall:The orignal 3 chapters of Doom are great and very memorable. However if you're getting this you definintely need to get a source port ( I suggest GZDoom or ZDoom). Everything about this game is great. If you haven't played it you should, and besides it's only $5.Final Verdict:Buy it Now			",97,5,0,7,2,0,1

												John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn’t see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad “I want to be on the ships daddy.”Dad said “No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS”There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.“This is Joson” the radio crackered. “You must fight the demons!”So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.“HE GOING TO KILL US” said the demons“I will shoot at him” said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.“No! I must kill the demons” he shoutedThe radio said “No, John. You are the demons”And then John was a zombie.			",129,24,1,19,21,0,25

												10/10 would accidentally blow myself up with a rocket launcher againno but seriously, phenomenal game. for something 20+ years old, it's better than most (if not all) modern FPSs.also: Steam installs the game with an outdated version of DOSBox. if you're not running ZDoom or a similar port, get the latest version of DOSBox to avoid problems with it freezing and crashing at the start.

												Doom, The Ulitmante Doom. I heard of the game before, but never saw anyone play itI Was born in the Late '90s now. Sure I played Half-Life and Counter-Strike on the PC when I was in KinderGarden; Doom I did not play until I was about 10 years old and in 5th Grade, and I thought the Graphics were complete♥♥♥♥♥♥There was a point in my life were I would only play on the Playstation 2, but remember that was like 2002-2005.. I told my older bother, of whom is 7 years older than me, ""Did you play this when you were little?"" he said Yes. As soon as I heard that,  i just couldn't stop playing DOOM on My Brother's PC. I would be in his room almost for like 5 or 6 hours straight playing DOOM, and he would be asking me to get off his PC so he can play Half-Life 2 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. But then Something Happend to my brother, he moved out of the house; I live in with my Parents, so now I don't see my brother almost 365 days now. I didn't know much about Doom until I was a Sophmore in highschool (this last school year, '13-'14, and researched a project about Valve Corp. and with out this game, Valve would not exist, or even Steam. Still think this review is a waste of you time, well Doom got more installments of this MSN DOS Game than anyother Windows OS at the time this game came out. So yeah, GO buy and Play a game that had more installments on Personal Computers than Widnows at one time, Go ahead, Buy It it's the best 5 dollars you can spend on one of my favortie FPS Games, but beware, when I try to Livestream this game Dos BOX.exe Crashes. I Don't Know if it's just me when I try to record with Fraps and Nvidia Geforce Experience GTX Videogame recording software(it came free with my Video Card). This game Deserves a 100/10, One of the Best games ever, even better than any COD game Franchise, I Still PLay Call of Duty, but honestly I only play the first 5  and the 7th one , for people wondering on what Call of Duty 5 is, it's World at War and COD 7 is Black opps.

												Fix : You will love this game if you buy it but this does not run on steam so you will need to modify some files to get this  game up and running, there is a easy way to get this game working, go to google and search doomsday engine and just install then find your Doom.wad and play it.      Review : This game is really good its fast fun and easy I recommend getting brutal doom the mod, it will advance the graphics and add more difficulties, even with out the mod still a fun game and with the doomsday engine it allows you to move your crosshair. What makes this game fun in 2016 is the pixil graphics from the 80s/90s its also extremely addicting for its age, I know it says 0.3 hours but I have spent hours using the doomsday engine thats why i dont have any hours in this game (on steam)      Note : If you have a good pc and wanting to spend 60 bucks check out Doom 2016 it may not look appealling but it has the old style with 2016 graphics it is amazing just give it a try!

I love how when you go down a corridor you never know what to expect in each level. The maps are brilliantly designed an thought out. That feeling when you play it for the first time after so many years is nostalgia its astounding  i love it an i love the fact its on here on Steam after years of looking for it i love the way Steam has put so many classical games like Doom on here.

This game not only has shooting, but it also has adventure, CHAINSAWS, MINIGUNS, LOTS OF ACTION, AMAZING MUSIC!!!, and AWESOME power-UPS. The only reason to not buy this game is not remembering to; that would be really surprising, since your computer is already on fire because it can't handle the GUNS. Seriously though, with this game, you will have lots of fun and entertainment. Plus, this game has a high re-play ability. Pick one up today. 9/10			",98,7,0,8,3,0,4

												If you've played the shareware version like crazy and have been dying for more, buying this and/or Doom II will not only satisfy you, it'll give you SO MUCH MORE than you expected. Play it on DOSBox or Chocolate Doom for a classic feel or try it on a modern source port such as GZDoom or Zandronum for added graphical effects. Download a few level packs and mods from the thousands available since the 90's.Doom has an active multiplayer community, It runs on just about anything (new computers, old computers, smartphones, pianos, you name it), and it only costs five bucks. Really, it's hard to come up with reasons why NOT to get this game.			",308,85,6,24,17,4,29

												No game has ever changed an industry like DOOM has, nor has a game delivered so much fun.STORYUnfortunately, there's not much to DOOM's plot. All you need to know is that Hell has taken over Mars and it's moons, and you are the last space marine alive on Mars' moon of Phobos. The story hardly progresses and when it does, it only appears through text screens. So, if you're in it for the story, you won't find much here, that's for sure.GAMEPLAYThis is DOOM's main strength, and the main reason you should play the game. DOOM utilises the old-school mechanics of shooters, with health kits and multiple weapons to carry. Your objective in DOOM is to reach the end of each level whilst eliminating monsters, receiving powerups and activating doors and switches. DOOM's gameplay is very simple and can be understood by any player. Enemy choice and enemy positioning is very creative in DOOM, with there being multiple types of enemy, each one being very cleverly designed. Enemies usually appear in groups of 5-30, which can make the game a real challenge. As you'd expect, there's plenty of ways to dispose with these enemies, with weapons ranging from shotguns to chainsaws. All weapons are very useful and well designed. Level design is another outstanding attribute of DOOM. Levels never feel to maze-like or too linear, which is still a perfect match today. Level design is creative and often gives the player a real challenge. Levels are also scattered with secret areas, which reward the player for exploring the level design and wanting to find new things.GRAPHICS/VISUALS/EFFECTSSome will instantly forget about DOOM when they see it's cheap attempts at 3D graphics, but those affect the gameplay in no way whatsoever. However, DOOM's designs are still amazing, everything from box art to level textures are well designed.CONCLUSIONDOOM is a simple run and gun shooter, however it's sheer fun and enjoyment surpasses any flaw and makes it a game for anyone. 10/10, a game that anyone can enjoy and simply understand.

I love how when you go down a corridor you never know what to expect in each level. The maps are brilliantly designed an thought out. That feeling when you play it for the first time after so many years is nostalgia its astounding  i love it an i love the fact its on here on Steam after years of looking for it i love the way Steam has put so many classical games like Doom on here.

												This game is great without a doubt and I believe everyone should give it a try. But there are some things you need to note before paying for it: 1) this is the DOS version of the game so it includes DOSbox 2)DOSbox hates running on modern operating systems 3)DOSbox runs like♥♥♥♥♥if you don't know how to edit config files. So how do you fix these problems? Simple really, download a source port of your choice, there are many out there and they make the game outstanding. I prefer Zdoom because it doesn't mess with the visuals and keeps the feel of vanilla doom. So do yourself a favor and buy the DOOM Classic complete collection, download a source port, and last but not least download the master levels patch so you can play the master levels as an episode for doom 2 (this was the easiest way I could find)			",103,4,1,14,2,0,5

												The original DOOM still holds up from a game play perspective to this day. I generally play it in ZDOOM, so you won't see many hours logged on my Steam account, but DOOM still manages to be fast and tense, despite its simple controls. Newer games could learn a thing or two from DOOM. A game doesn't have to be slow-paced in order for it to be scary. The level designs don't pull any punches, though. Some of the levels in DOOM are freaking massive.			",776,201,40,102,66,3,125

												Doom is one of my favorite games out there its an amazing Classic shooter that can still be loads of fun,The levels are amazingly designed Its a fast paced game with fun weapons and is actually a puzzle game believe it or not. I first found out about Doom like 4 years ago and im obsessed with it the only reason it says ive only played for 5 hours is because im playing all sorts of mods source ports and even made a few levels my self..Gameplay:Its nice fluid and very fast some people will get mad at the fact that theres no crouching jumping or looking up and down,if that really bothers you please dont miss out and get your self a source port and put those funcions on and have fun it dosent bother me but some people cant stand it,the game is a maze every level with you having to find at leats 2 keys to get through though finding all 3 is best because of all the secret areas they unlock theres hidden doors every where some needing keys,hidden buttons and levers or some just being hidden in the walls slightly discolored from the rest.Content:Ultimate doom comes with 4 episodes ""Knee deep in the dead"" ""The Shores of Hell"" ""Inferno"" and ""Thy Flesh Consumed"" each being about nine missions long and being done in different styles of themes,puzzle types and layout ""Knee Deep in the Dead"" is a very basic Episode with a few Secret areas  this episode takes place mainly indoors with a few secrets leading outside. ""the Shores of Hell"" Is my favorite episode with the level design in my opinion truelly being the best taking place mostly indoors from what I can remeber too. Inferno is mainly outside in demon infested areas with lava and rock every where this episode is where doom story wise ends this is my least favorite episode  as it felt kinda easy ""Thy Flesh Consumed"" was incredibley hard being kind of a sequell to Doom and a backround story for Doom 2 telling you how Doom-Guy got to earth this one is very hard it probabley took me the longest out of all 4 this one is less puzzle solving and more straight foward action you should save often on this one you'll die alot.(I played all 4 on hurt me plenty and beat ""Knee Deep in the Dead"" On Ultra-Violence)Cons (take in mind this game is being run on an emulator and is an old game in general)Multiplayer requires a source port and is not able to run as is I recommend Zandronum for this as Zdeamon is very dead and the community is full of ####faces 9/10 no game is perfect to me though it will always be a 100,000,000/10			",149,12,3,8,6,2,4

												The only reasons for not getting this game are: if you can't stand outdated graphics, if you dislike corridoor FPS, if you demand realism, if you are a specific type of religious person.The only reason why you should get this game: not a single glaring gameplay flaw. (Use Doom Legacy)There are many other reasons, the game is fun and challenging, atmosphere is great, there are some puzzles, world records to beat, but these days gameplay mechanics are so messed up in most games, that the primary reason I keep getting back to Doom is to take a rest from cussing at the game.Although this game has history with some public shooting incidents, sports heavy metal music and you basically play an alternate to Jesus, this is not Postal or Hatred. Romero had originally planned to give the story a much greater importance, but for whatever reason, it did not end up the way it was visioned in The Doom Bible. The final product is a pure shooting gallery and the only objective is to have fun. Finally, how you take it or what you do with it is you problem.			",53,3,1,5,4,0,0

Even today it still holds up and is a load of fun, and there's a -massive- collection of mod content ranging from small map packs to full gameplay conversions.Downloading the GZDoom sourceport to run the game is strongly recommended as it will help with most issues you may have getting it to run on a modern system, greatly expands graphics and control options, and supports the vast majority of mods.

												What in God's name can I say about this game that hasn't been said over and over again? The gunplay is satisfying, the enemies are all unique, well-designed and challenging without being unfair, the emphasis on movement and agility makes the game feel more frenetic and involved, the level design is top-notch, mazelike but not beginner-unfriendly, the subversive humor is endearing instead of dated, nor is it tastelessly offensive (in a game about demons from Hell, for that matter), THE BIG ♥♥♥♥ING GUN, the environment design is cleverly disturbing and nightmarish, the pixel graphics feel retro in a good way, and the music is like a 16-bit, MS-DOS hair growth formula mixed with an automatic headbanging machine. People don't kid around when this game is placed among the best FPS of all time.			",20,0,1,0,3,0,0

												Doom is one of my favorite games out there its an amazing Classic shooter that can still be loads of fun,The levels are amazingly designed Its a fast paced game with fun weapons and is actually a puzzle game believe it or not. I first found out about Doom like 4 years ago and im obsessed with it the only reason it says ive only played for 5 hours is because im playing all sorts of mods source ports and even made a few levels my self..Gameplay:Its nice fluid and very fast some people will get mad at the fact that theres no crouching jumping or looking up and down,if that really bothers you please dont miss out and get your self a source port and put those funcions on and have fun it dosent bother me but some people cant stand it,the game is a maze every level with you having to find at leats 2 keys to get through though finding all 3 is best because of all the secret areas they unlock theres hidden doors every where some needing keys,hidden buttons and levers or some just being hidden in the walls slightly discolored from the rest.Content:Ultimate doom comes with 4 episodes ""Knee deep in the dead"" ""The Shores of Hell"" ""Inferno"" and ""Thy Flesh Consumed"" each being about nine missions long and being done in different styles of themes,puzzle types and layout ""Knee Deep in the Dead"" is a very basic Episode with a few Secret areas  this episode takes place mainly indoors with a few secrets leading outside. ""the Shores of Hell"" Is my favorite episode with the level design in my opinion truelly being the best taking place mostly indoors from what I can remeber too. Inferno is mainly outside in demon infested areas with lava and rock every where this episode is where doom story wise ends this is my least favorite episode  as it felt kinda easy ""Thy Flesh Consumed"" was incredibley hard being kind of a sequell to Doom and a backround story for Doom 2 telling you how Doom-Guy got to earth this one is very hard it probabley took me the longest out of all 4 this one is less puzzle solving and more straight foward action you should save often on this one you'll die alot.(I played all 4 on hurt me plenty and beat ""Knee Deep in the Dead"" On Ultra-Violence)Cons (take in mind this game is being run on an emulator and is an old game in general)Multiplayer requires a source port and is not able to run as is I recommend Zandronum for this as Zdeamon is very dead and the community is full of ####faces 9/10 no game is perfect to me though it will always be a 100,000,000/10			",149,12,3,8,6,2,4

Buy it, if you have the guts to play the game that was so popular, first-person shooters where called ""Doom clones"" for a while.Also, if you're playing on anything much newer than Windows XP, I reccommend a port, such as zDoom.

												No game has ever changed an industry like DOOM has, nor has a game delivered so much fun.STORYUnfortunately, there's not much to DOOM's plot. All you need to know is that Hell has taken over Mars and it's moons, and you are the last space marine alive on Mars' moon of Phobos. The story hardly progresses and when it does, it only appears through text screens. So, if you're in it for the story, you won't find much here, that's for sure.GAMEPLAYThis is DOOM's main strength, and the main reason you should play the game. DOOM utilises the old-school mechanics of shooters, with health kits and multiple weapons to carry. Your objective in DOOM is to reach the end of each level whilst eliminating monsters, receiving powerups and activating doors and switches. DOOM's gameplay is very simple and can be understood by any player. Enemy choice and enemy positioning is very creative in DOOM, with there being multiple types of enemy, each one being very cleverly designed. Enemies usually appear in groups of 5-30, which can make the game a real challenge. As you'd expect, there's plenty of ways to dispose with these enemies, with weapons ranging from shotguns to chainsaws. All weapons are very useful and well designed. Level design is another outstanding attribute of DOOM. Levels never feel to maze-like or too linear, which is still a perfect match today. Level design is creative and often gives the player a real challenge. Levels are also scattered with secret areas, which reward the player for exploring the level design and wanting to find new things.GRAPHICS/VISUALS/EFFECTSSome will instantly forget about DOOM when they see it's cheap attempts at 3D graphics, but those affect the gameplay in no way whatsoever. However, DOOM's designs are still amazing, everything from box art to level textures are well designed.CONCLUSIONDOOM is a simple run and gun shooter, however it's sheer fun and enjoyment surpasses any flaw and makes it a game for anyone. 10/10, a game that anyone can enjoy and simply understand.

												What else is there to say about Doom? If you haven't played it you should.Doom is the forefather of all modern first-person shooters. Its controls are tight, its level design remains some of the best ever achieved in the industry, its music is legendary, and the shotgun blast remains iconic in the world of shooters.The story is simple, but standard for 1993 games. It begins in the Hangar of the Phobos moon base as the Doomguy fights his way through the forces of hell before arriving on the lost Deimos base. He has to fight his way through even tough challenges here and take down the vile Cyberdemon before descending into Hell itself.The first nine levels of Doom were released as shareware in 1993. It set a benchmark that future games would dream of reaching. It also had one of the first modding scenes in PC gaming.Speaking of mods, one of the downsides to Doom, especially the Steam version, is that the controls and settings haven't aged all that well. Thus, I'd recommend using a launcher. I personally use GZDoom, which you can find HERE[www.osnanet.de].There are other mods that add to the already awesome and timeless gameplay of Doom, specifically the BRUTAL DOOM MOD. This mod adds additional shooting gameplay and a whole lot more blood to the game.If you are a gamer. Specifically a shooter gamer, you absolurely cannot do much better than Doom.Further information about Doom can be found in this video:

												If you've played the shareware version like crazy and have been dying for more, buying this and/or Doom II will not only satisfy you, it'll give you SO MUCH MORE than you expected. Play it on DOSBox or Chocolate Doom for a classic feel or try it on a modern source port such as GZDoom or Zandronum for added graphical effects. Download a few level packs and mods from the thousands available since the 90's.Doom has an active multiplayer community, It runs on just about anything (new computers, old computers, smartphones, pianos, you name it), and it only costs five bucks.

												A game that wasn't the first to do it, but was the first to do it right.A combination of a simple but effective aresenal, fast (like 50mph fast) movement, a tense, dark atmosphere and 36 well paced (both in difficulty and item progression) labyrinthine levels that can either make you feel like a total Bad Dude mowing down tons of shotgun daddies, or have you on your toes, fighting for survival. Blasting your way through the adorable, yet terrifying cast of hellspawn in search of a way out is still the most satisfying mechanical experience you could have on A Personal Computing Device.one that hasn't been successfully matched in 23 yearsone with an endless amount of community-created content, from well crafted packs that replace the 3 episodes, many infamous maps that are great for a quick laugh, single maps that continue to push the limits of what a 1993 game is capable of. [the majority of wads are designed for doom 2, get that one too]and if it's your thing, there are gameplay mods that totally ruin alter what is already great gameplay and are enjoyable for about five minutes at the most and are a disgrace to one of the finest peices of interactive entertainment.I would definitely recommend using a source port when playing on a modern [not DOS] system, there are many out there which all fill a necessary hole. I recommend Chocolate Doom [designed to be as close to the original executable as possible, with bugs and limits] and Doom Retro [based on an earlier version chocolate doom with less bugs and minor enhancments but still keeps the gritty vibe and vanilla gameplay]. there are a few others, but the other one i would recommend is ZDoom [not gzdoom], as that works with the majority of user-made content and is definitely user-friendly. This isn't an absoulte list of what you need to use, but i highly discourage jumping in whatever port you decide on. that completely ruins many of the levels in the game.this game and its sequel have consumed me for 12 years off and on. still one of my all time favoritesbuy the pack with Doom II+master levels and Final Doom instead of Whatever Your Vice Of Choice Isbest played on a software renderer, capped at 35 FPS at 320X200.Ultra-ViolenceKeyboard only if you're feeling courageous♥♥♥♥ e4m2			",114,10,3,11,4,1,3

The game REALLY shines with the Brutal Doom and Metal Soundtrack mods though, making the game even more fast paced and adrenaline packed, and vastly improving the graphics.

												Taking no credit away from its genre predecessor, Wolfenstein 3-D, DOOM was the breakthrough game of 1993, and the more influential of id's first- person shooters. Its arsenal of powerful guns (namely the shotgun and BFG), intense level of gore and perfect balance of adrenaline-soaked action and exploration kept this gamer riveted for years. Initially a shareware product on PC, DOOM also offered the first multiplayer death- matches via LAN. Doom is creepy, atmospheric, with a sense of impending dread that always seems to be just around the next corner or behind that door. There couldn't have been a better name for the game. cod is better lol♥♥♥♥vault 101/10			",364,56,23,26,30,3,33

												Talk about a trip to the past of PC gaming. If you're a fan of FPS games and haven't played this ancient relic, give it a try and see how much the genre has evolved, over the ages. The game still holds up quite well today, and I find it much better than a lot of the modern-day FPS games. Though if you want a more enhanced and optimal experience, download one of the many source ports. I recommend ZDoom/GZDoom, but everyone does have their own tastes. Just please don't use DOSBox, unless you're that much of a purist.If you're up for a challenge, go download Brutal Doom. That mod revamps a lot of the game while keeping the Doom feeling intact. Also, flipping the bird at a Cyberdemon is OH SO! satisfying...until he starts blasting twice the BOOM! at you.			",350,56,1,34,9,1,9

												I love this game. Love it!!!!Doom is the first game I ever got truly addicted to, and still to this day I find myself whipping it up on any format I can get it on.I've had this from the start on Shareware disks of just the first episode, to the full version on PC, Gameboy Advance, N64, iOS, even the RPG version on phone!The game itself is pretty dated now of course, but that doesn't matter. It just doesn't. This game stands up to the test of time, and is just awesome! Gorey before a game could show individually gibbed body parts, and carrying a deep demonic storyline (i say storyline, it has a basic idea of story from A-B but is no feature length movie-esque COD. Nor does it need to be) and is the true Godfather of the FPS.There were a few that came before it to set the standard of the 3D element, but THIS is the one that made the effort! Buy it standalone, or buy it as part of the iD pack and try its predecessors too to see what paved the way to this slice of gaming History. Marvel at pixelated blood spatter as you chainsaw a Pinky Demon between the eyeballs, and then laugh as its body rotates on the spot to face you from every angle you look at it (this was a function that was not developed until Quake, i believe?).Levels are fairly linear - go through a maze of corridors, taking out all foes in your path to collect the keycards to get through the access doors to beat the badassses to destroy the head honcho to save the world. But with loads of guns and loads of ammo and loads of hellish enemies and some proper banging music! Perfect time after time! :DThis game, will ALWAYS be my number one. My first true love. Always.

												Doesn't exactly work through the normal Steam interface but once you've bought it you can download a third-party program called ""GZDoom"" and it runs peachy-keen.I highly suggest looking up something called ""Brutal Doom"" and another called ""DukeNukem_Visor""Completely, completely changes everything.... Very fun, puts a new spin on things.If you don't like Doom, I don't like you.			",122,31,0,32,32,1,21

												Takes a fair bit of modding to get it working well on Windows 10, but when it's done the game is just as good as it was in 1993. I recommend looking up how to edit the correct files for the game, because without a fair bit of editing the game's pretty much unplayable. Overall, give it a go if you're willing to put some initial effort into getting it working, because after that it plays fine.			",48,8,0,3,8,0,3

												Do I have to say why you need this game? Like seriously, it's basically the bible for FPS game to every FPS gamer and PC gamer besides Wolfenstein, Arma 2, Deus Ex, Metro Last light or 2033, F.E.A.R. and Every Valve game. Seriously? The fact that you are a space marine who's fighting Demons as a 1 man army with an arsenal that would make EVERY Space Marine look like god damn Trainees. I mean, this was basically one of the first and most important FPS Game ever. Combine with Brutal Doom, it arguably the greatest game ever made. Go buy it.			",577,115,4,72,58,9,152

												This game is great without a doubt and I believe everyone should give it a try. But there are some things you need to note before paying for it: 1) this is the DOS version of the game so it includes DOSbox 2)DOSbox hates running on modern operating systems 3)DOSbox runs like♥♥♥♥♥if you don't know how to edit config files. So how do you fix these problems? Simple really, download a source port of your choice, there are many out there and they make the game outstanding. I prefer Zdoom because it doesn't mess with the visuals and keeps the feel of vanilla doom. So do yourself a favor and buy the DOOM Classic complete collection, download a source port, and last but not least download the master levels patch so you can play the master levels as an episode for doom 2 (this was the easiest way I could find)			",103,4,1,14,2,0,5

												What in God's name can I say about this game that hasn't been said over and over again? The gunplay is satisfying, the enemies are all unique, well-designed and challenging without being unfair, the emphasis on movement and agility makes the game feel more frenetic and involved, the level design is top-notch, mazelike but not beginner-unfriendly, the subversive humor is endearing instead of dated, nor is it tastelessly offensive (in a game about demons from Hell, for that matter), THE BIG ♥♥♥♥ING GUN, the environment design is cleverly disturbing and nightmarish, the pixel graphics feel retro in a good way, and the music is like a 16-bit, MS-DOS hair growth formula mixed with an automatic headbanging machine.

												Pretty much the penultimate FPS game, setting the standard for every game that followed. Even today it still holds up and is a load of fun, and there's a -massive- collection of mod content ranging from small map packs to full gameplay conversions.Downloading the GZDoom sourceport to run the game is strongly recommended as it will help with most issues you may have getting it to run on a modern system, greatly expands graphics and control options, and supports the vast majority of mods.

Posted: September 3, 2016
												I'll start by saying that I have no nostalgia for this game. My very first experience with Doom was playing the shareware demo for the first time in late 2015, about 20 years after its release, or 2 decades. I was also using the Chocolate Doom Sourceport, which emulates vanilla Doom as closely as possible, so no fancy graphics changes or mouselook or anything of the sort. All I did to the game was rebind the controls to WSAD + Mouse, disable the ENDOOM screen, and had Patch93's Roland SC-55 Soundfont installed. That said, this is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played. Not only does it stand the test of time, but it has aged like fine wine, and I'd imagine it's almost better nowadays than before, where modern shooters are always pushing for better graphics, greater realism, and less of the high speed arcadey action that makes Doom so fun.Movement is fast, fluid, and fun. There is no crouching or jumping, but with the way the game is designed such mechanics would only break the game. The game is balanced around constant movement, whether it's dodging enemy projectiles, picking up ammo/hp, or crossing rivers of toxic waste. You don't stop to reload or take cover, you're always on the move.The weapons are all rather balanced and extremely fun to play with, except maybe the pistol and fists (though, in the defense of the stock melee fists, the berserk powerup makes them incredibly fun and they get replaced by the chainsaw later anyways). The shotgun in particular is extremely versatile and useful throughout the game and is one of the best shotguns in video games, and the BFG 9000 is one of the best video game weapons ever. The lack of reload makes sure that combat stays fast paced while the delay between each fire balances it out and keeps you on the move. The weapons (aside from the aforementioned two weaker ones) all feel like they really pack a punch, capable of killing multiple enemies in one or two shots. The sounds and animations, even though they’re not particularly high quality by today’s standards, still sound and look pleasant and add to the punchy-ness of the weapons (if that makes sense).The enemy design is extremely colorful, creative, memorable, and of course, disturbing. The Cacodemon is a perfect example of this; a red monster with a large spherical body that floats slowly through the air, crowned with horns, and possessing a single green eye over a large mouth which is persistently twisted into an evil grin showing a series of nasty teeth and a bluish interior. And, to top it off, let me quote this wiki description of the Cacodemon’s death animation: “When killed, they let out a whimpering moan and fall to the ground, splitting open like a burst pustule and spewing copious amounts of blue blood and intestines that flow forth to reveal their bared brains, while their sole eye pops out of its socket. Also, some of its horns break.” How do they come up with these monster ideas?These monsters remain fun to play against despite their seemingly basic AI, as often you will have to combat multiple enemies at a time, dodging their projectiles and staying on the move as you whittle down their numbers with blasts from a shotgun. An interesting thing about these monsters’ AI is that they can be tricked into fighting each other. This can usually be accomplished by getting into a position where one monster is in the line of fire of another. The monster, in an attempt to damage you, will hit the one in the line of fire, and the damaged monster will retaliate and attack in revenge without regard. This is a really unique game mechanic, as most games do not give the enemies the ability to hurt each other, much less the ability to retaliate. Monster infighting is a great tactic to use when low on ammo, and it’s just fun to watch two monsters ignore you and fight each other to the death.The level design is complex, sprawling, and loaded with cleverly hidden secrets and alternate paths. Many of the levels here are some of the best out of any video game out there. The replayability value is extremely high with this game because of just how much there is to discover in these levels. You'll still be finding new secrets and even secret exits and secret levels even after replaying this game many, many times. Unlike much of the linear level design of today, this game does not hold your hand and encourages you to go off and explore, and exploration is rewarded with finding goodies such as weapons, ammo, health, armor, or a new path/new exit. The game doesn't point out the secrets directly but rather guides you to them using audio and visual cues. This may be an odd wall texture, or maybe hearing the sound of a door opening far off when you press a switch or button. Sometimes a window may tease a secret behind it, and you'll have to find it using your knowledge of the level. There are even secrets within secrets in many cases (and secrets within secrets within secrets!). Another great thing about the level design is the natural sense of progression it has. You start off in a fully tech-based environment, in the UAC facilities. As the game goes on, the levels become gradually more and more twisted and hellish until everything is either made of stone or meat by the end. You really feel like you've completed a story arc (as simple as it may be).The visuals have aged surprisingly well. 2D sprites for enemies are partially to thank for this, as sprites always look way better than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ early 3D. Another part of why Doom still looks nice today is the textures. They’re low quality, yes, but not in a “blurry vomit of color” kind of way but in a pixely, retro kind of way. I don’t really know how to put it into words. I guess an example might be Deus Ex. Look at screenshots for Deus Ex: the textures are blurry and low res, and the models are low poly and also suffer from having blurry textures over them too. All in all, Deus Ex looks really bad by modern standards (don’t get me wrong though, it’s still a masterpiece game). Doom’s textures and sprites use big pixels that look sharper and cleaner than Deus Ex’s blurry textures. It’s like comparing really good pixel art to a painting behind blurry, smudgy glass. Or something.And the music is just awesome. All of Doom's music was composed by Robert Prince, on a Roland SC-55. I strongly recommend that you find a way to emulate a Roland SC-55’s playback of the soundtrack if you can.  Brandon Blume’s SC-55 recordings for Doom 1 and 2’s soundtracks are compatible with ZDoom and GZDoom, which is probably the easiest and best method of making it work. I didn’t know how to get it to work with Chocolate Doom so I just settled on using Patch93’s SC-55 Soundfont. The actual music is a mix of heavy metal and ambient tracks, drawing inspiration from groups such as Alice in Chains, Metallica, Pantera and Slayer. The tracks add to the atmosphere when they need to, and makes you feel pumped up and ready to kill things when they need to, and overall it’s just a fantastic soundtrack that compliments the game perfectly.Other things of note:The use of toxic barrels in the environment is really cool. Not only can you combat the monsters with your weapons and against each other, but you can use the environment to your advantage against them by shooting barrels and watching them blow up into bits, sometimes creating a chain reaction of barrel explosions.The atmosphere in the game is great, especially in the more hellish levels.The difficulty levels are pretty cleverly named. Much nicer than the typical “Easy, Normal, Hard”The soul sphere’s design is really underrated – a human soul trapped in a blue orb. The first time I came across it I just stared at it for afew minutes, both disturbed and intrigued, and tried to kill it before eventually realizing that it was actually a powerup. Probably my favorite powerup in any game now.TL;DR: 11/10 timeless masterpiece.			",37,0,0,2,1,0,1

												What else is there to say about Doom? If you haven't played it you should.Doom is the forefather of all modern first-person shooters. Its controls are tight, its level design remains some of the best ever achieved in the industry, its music is legendary, and the shotgun blast remains iconic in the world of shooters.The story is simple, but standard for 1993 games. It begins in the Hangar of the Phobos moon base as the Doomguy fights his way through the forces of hell before arriving on the lost Deimos base. He has to fight his way through even tough challenges here and take down the vile Cyberdemon before descending into Hell itself.The first nine levels of Doom were released as shareware in 1993. It set a benchmark that future games would dream of reaching. It also had one of the first modding scenes in PC gaming.Speaking of mods, one of the downsides to Doom, especially the Steam version, is that the controls and settings haven't aged all that well. Thus, I'd recommend using a launcher. I personally use GZDoom, which you can find HERE[www.osnanet.de].There are other mods that add to the already awesome and timeless gameplay of Doom, specifically the BRUTAL DOOM MOD. This mod adds additional shooting gameplay and a whole lot more blood to the game.If you are a gamer. Specifically a shooter gamer, you absolurely cannot do much better than Doom.Further information about Doom can be found in this video:

												Welcome to paradise...a land where angels are roaming-oh sorry...wrong speech. Ahem...WELCOME TO HELL! A land where demons came out of a portal and killed everyone in a base on Mars (Cause why not let one single man live?) and one lone space marine survior must grab massive guns and shoot anything that stands before him...and getting to the most beautiful planet...Earth. That is BASICALLY the storyline, in this game, there was barely any storyline. This game was meant for men (and women, but mainly men find the attractiveness in retro gore) who just wanted to shoot things and blow stuff up for no absolute reason and have tons of fun. The demons you fight are actually well-designed and so are the levels. This game was made in 1995 and was an instant blast! This was a game where only one kid's parents would allow him to play, so everybody would attempt to be his friend and look to him as the ""cool guy/kid"" and they would hang over at his house and play Doom all...night...long...! I still love this game and have already spent twelve hours into it, and will spend more! This is a childhood memory that won't go away for a very...long...time!Summary: Like retro gore and tons of action with a game that doesn't really have a storyline?...You met your guardian angel!WARNING: I recommend this to teenagers, not to younger children, for this game is quite violent despite the 1995 graphics!

												This game is simply a beast!The game that started it all!All online fps gaming and all fps gaming in general have as a starting point this game.Even though it's with wolfenstein 3d that the name fps was first used(if i remember correctly), it's with doom that the genre had it's breakthrough.The game still feels really good today:super fun, tons of enemies, great atmosphere, good music and simply non stop action.This ultimate version contains the ""new"" original doom chapter called ""thy flesh consumed"" too.If you are esitant cause the game it's really old and it runs at a resolution simply unbereable to many by today's standards, nothing to worry about, there are mods to increase it to 1080p and many other fixes like the option to move the mouse in all directions(originally in the game you could look only left and right) and 60 fps(originally the game was limited at 35)just google Zdoom mod, it's really easy to install and you can run it through steam too http://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/828934424054379381/ check out the brutal doom mod too!

												Great fun, this game. I do highly recommend it to anyone who is a PC gamer and doesn't hate fun. There's not much story, so don't be expected to be immersed in that, but the game itself is so fun, I feel like a stroy would ruin everything this game acomplishes. If the grahpics are too dated for you to handle, get the Brutal Doom mod. It adds extra gore and better graphics and a verticle axis. That's another thing, this game doesn't have a verticle axis (looking up and down) so don't complain about that. This was 1993, after all. Anyway, a great PC classic and definitely worth a buy, even though it is possible to get it for free.			",153,22,4,10,5,1,12

												11/10.I first played this game when I was 6 in 1999 on my dad's copied floppy disc. This game has ingrained the FPS genre inside me from a very young age and I wouldn't have it any other way. The hordes of iconic demons, your extensive arsenal, forboding environments that capture the atmosphere of that spacey hellish theme and the iconic DOOM Guy whom I have idolized for a very long time.- Non-stop action of mowing down demons of various skill- Extremely moddable- Iconic soundtrack by Bobby Prince- This game will literally almost run on anything (even the Macbook's touch bar)- A revolutionary game for it's time that pioneered gaming, popularized the FPS genre to what it is todayThis game is super close to my heart, playing most of the DOOM games up until DOOM 2016 along with replaying more of ID's games, watching the movie (as most hated it I still loved it) and even inking the title on my arm. I cannot fault it, I don't care how biased that is.			",145,10,1,19,6,0,13

												Ah, what else could be said that hasn't already been said a billion times over with regards to DOOM. This title can really be credited as THE First Person Shooter. With over 20 years time, DOOM continues to have a very much active fan base and has become a milestone for what this genre really represents. For well seasoned gamers you have played of FPS titles such as Unreal Tournament, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, Wolfenstien, Shadow Warrior, Blood, Rise of the Triad, Painkiller or Serious Sam but not have played DOOM would feel right at home with this game and I would recommend you play this on the harder difficulties or you could download a sourceport for the classic DOOM games for example (Zandronum, GZDoom, ZDoom, DOOMsday etc.) and then get a little mod called Brutal Doom...believe me it's worth the hassle. There are just to many mods and sourceports for DOOM too even mention here. If you are a diehard fan of First Person Shooters and are utterly tired of COD and Battlefield have this genre into...then this is an absolutely must have game for the collection!

												In the modern age of first person shooters such as CoD and Battlefield with their stylized presentation and Quicktime events it is a welcome and joyous occasion when you can fire up a game of Doom and be sucked in like it was 1993 all over again.On the outside Doom is just another retro shooter trying to survive in this modern world. With it’s pixelated 2.5D graphics, midi soundtrack, inability to jump or duck or even look in 3 dimensions, you would think that it would have been long forgotten in a wash of newer, flashier combat games, but that’s where Doom really shines. In its minimalistic nature, Doom makes you forget what it doesn’t have and focus on what it does have: amazing gameplay.Doom doesn’t hold your hand. Right from the start you are thrust into a foreign Martian world with a pistol and the hope of survival as you are faced with ever increasing opposition which comes in the form of possessed Space Marines and demonic creatures straight from the depths of hell, and over time that’s exactly where you go. Through the game you get access to bigger and badder weapons but also find larger and more dangerous enemies such as the Cyberdemon and the Spiderdemon-both a mix of demonic flesh and futuristic machine a perfect parallel to the twisted world around them-to use them on. Through it all, superior level design and your wits are what separate you from the dead marines at your feet. The levels unobtrusively lead you into your next surprise encounter all the while providing the cover needed to save you from near death. One thing they don’t do is raise that veil of atmosphere that Doom lays on you. All of the pieces fit together wonderfully in this game to give you the perfect immersive experience.Of course, one of the biggest reasons this game is still relevant today is the still thriving community of modders who create everything from single levels to entire modifications for the game that give you new weapons, enemies, graphics, sounds, levels, game mechanics… even huge multiplayer and coop levels. And it’s all free. If you are looking for an adrenaline rush or just want to run screaming down memory lane, look no further than Doom.			",131,72,0,27,6,0,9

												  You've probably heard of Doom. It's was a legend in it's own time, spawning an entire generation of “Doom clones”, first person shooters of the '90s that aped the original violent blockbuster. I was fairly young when Doom originally released, but remember hearing about it in whispered tones from friends and family members, staring for hours in awe at a few too-good-to-be-true screenshots in various gaming magazines. My mind ran wild with possibilities: how could a video game be so dark and Satanic? How could you control a character you couldn't see? What twisted lore did these Hellish landscapes hold? I never had a computer or console that could run this bloody fantasy of mine (or had access to this new-fangled internet technology), so I built my own mythology and hype for the game in my head. The hardcore rebellious spirit of those screencaps and schoolyard tales was only heightened by the misguided political controversies that sprung up around it (and a few other notables) at that time. Once I was finally able to play some version of the game (I can't remember if it was shareware or even Doom 64) I was hooked. It lived up to my wildest imagination, while also containing gameplay I could have never dreamed of. Since then whenever I obtain a new piece of technology capable of running games I make an effort to get Doom installed on it in whatever form is available. Recently as I was scrolling through the hundreds of games I have available to me I got the itch. The Doom Call. Rather than play any of the sequels or remakes or remixes or mods, I decided to go back to square one and see how the original held up in modern times, see if it earned it's place in gaming history. The results may shock you... or not. It shouldn't be any surprise: Doom ♥♥♥♥ing rules.  Every aspect of Doom just feels so right. The graphics may be muddy and pixelated by today's HD, obsess-over-resolution standards, but they certainly are cohesive and set a mood. Body parts litter the brown and red environments, the character sprites lie halfway between cartoon and genuinely disturbing/cool, and the death animation for each of the creative and iconic enemy types is disgustingly satisfying. The music gets your blood pumping and for good reason: they are all literal MIDI rip-offs of heavy metal songs of the time, so they're nice and crunchy, catchy, and charming. The level design is almost uniformly excellent, with the vast majority of your rampage through Hell striking a nice balance between combat, finding secret areas, solving key card puzzles, and navigating an expertly designed maze. There are only a few instances of the old-school Dungeons and Dragons design getting in the way of enjoyment: notably the second to last level in Episode 3 which is a nightmare of esoteric puzzles that can only be solved by trial and error guesswork through floor hazards that will deal damage to you. Other than that, the gameplay absolutely holds up, with some stages swinging heavily on either the combat or puzzle solving and most finding a nice mix. On harder difficulty settings (and Episode 4, even on Hurt Me Plenty) a new layer of strategy and resource management appears: every shot is essential, switching weapons to keep your ammo stock full is key, searching for secret areas and the power-ups they hide is necessary, and sometimes just flat out avoiding combat is a better option. Doom feels like the perfect storm of brilliant level design and technology that pushed boundaries but didn't get in over it's head.  A few little notes about the “Ultimate” subtitle in “The Ultimate Doom”: as far as I can tell this version is the original DOS release, but Episode 4 was a late edition to the game (I'm assuming it was semi-promotional for Doom II: Hell on Earth) and is included in the package. Episode 4 is a crazy jump up in difficulty from the base game and likes throwing shotgun guys everywhere, but it fits seamlessly with the rest of the game. Trying to control the game with just a keyboard as originally intended is doable if clunky, or you can use a keyboard/mouse combination which feels somewhat better but I had some trouble with my marine sliding around because the mouse can control movement for some reason. I eventually hooked up an Xbox 360 controller and ran Controller Companion, and man... that seems like the way to go. It might not be 100% authentic, but it feels great. Just another testament to how timeless the game is.  I could go on about how innovative and influential Doom was in it's day, but I could hardly do it justice. If you're interested in it's history there are plenty of articles out there, or better yet read Masters of Doom. What's more interesting to me is how the game has molded my outlook on games on a personal level, and just how well the game still plays. Doom is a classic in every sense of the word, and has earned it's place as legend and withstood the test of time.			",285,115,3,26,19,2,41

												This game is practically my ♥♥♥♥ing childhood. No matter how many times i play or complete this or any of the sequels to this classic, it still remains to this day awesome! It is also the only game i will sit down and happily play for days and weeks on end. I've been playing this game for over 15 years now and it still is a worthwhile game. I just wish i could revisit the childhood days of the playstation 1 and the endgame credit screen with the enemy showcase and how you could just see all the death animations etc.Recommend to everyone - a classic gaming experience that essentially put the FPS on the map!

												- graphics suck, look like they're from 1993- barely have to aim, game auto aims for you- levels have too many secrets, hurts my brain- hitscan enemies- only like two hours long- no regenerating health wtf- it said there were more weapons than I actually finished the game with, obviously lying- reload animations have like 3 frames- all you do is shoot people and push buttons- character moves way too fast- looks like I'm holding the guns with my mouth- no sniper rifles- no grenades- no multiplayer0/10 worst game ever made(In all seriousness, I have never played DOOM before and this still holds up in 2015 even if it is a pain to get working on a Windows 8 computer)			",118,16,3,9,8,0,6

												This game is simply a beast!The game that started it all!All online fps gaming and all fps gaming in general have as a starting point this game.Even though it's with wolfenstein 3d that the name fps was first used(if i remember correctly), it's with doom that the genre had it's breakthrough.The game still feels really good today:super fun, tons of enemies, great atmosphere, good music and simply non stop action.This ultimate version contains the ""new"" original doom chapter called ""thy flesh consumed"" too.If you are esitant cause the game it's really old and it runs at a resolution simply unbereable to many by today's standards, nothing to worry about, there are mods to increase it to 1080p and many other fixes like the option to move the mouse in all directions(originally in the game you could look only left and right) and 60 fps(originally the game was limited at 35)just google Zdoom mod, it's really easy to install and you can run it through steam too http://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/828934424054379381/ check out the brutal doom mod too!

												Great fun, this game. I do highly recommend it to anyone who is a PC gamer and doesn't hate fun. There's not much story, so don't be expected to be immersed in that, but the game itself is so fun, I feel like a stroy would ruin everything this game acomplishes. If the grahpics are too dated for you to handle, get the Brutal Doom mod. It adds extra gore and better graphics and a verticle axis. That's another thing, this game doesn't have a verticle axis (looking up and down) so don't complain about that. This was 1993, after all. Anyway, a great PC classic and definitely worth a buy, even though it is possible to get it for free.			",153,22,4,10,5,1,12

												This is my favorite game of all time. Not my favorite FPS of all time, My absolute favorite. This game was a technical marvel of its time. If you take the SNES verision of this game and put it next to the PC version, you will see that PC blows console out of the water(As usual).  Now that we have all of the tech and bashing out of the way lets get into the actual game! You are an unnamed space marine for the UAC. You are stationed on one of Mar's moons on a base that has been attacked by the horrors of hell. Enough story I want to shoot some demons! As soon as you press new game, choose which episode you want to play, and which difficulty you want to take on hell with, you are immediately dropped into E1M1, The Hanger, with pistol in hand with demon zombies to kill. There is no health regeneration in this game, no M4 carbine with unlimited ammo, no automatic checkpoints, and no hand holding what so ever. As soon as the level starts you are on your own to kill and explore. That is the beauty of this game there is no restriction on where you can go. If you see an area with bad guys outside? You can go there. You see a chain saw and you want it more than anything in the world? Look for a wall to open and go get it and find some meat! The gameplay is the best thing about this game. The primal satisfaction from seeing that enemy go down in a bloody gorey mess from the blast of your shot gun is like no other. The story is there, but it never really matters that much. John Carmack, the lead programmer for the game, has stated this hilarious phrase, ""Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important."" The music in this game is absolutely phenomenal. At DOOM's gate, the music from E1M1, is ingrained into every person who has played this game. The music is down and dirty metal. It fits the game very well. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this game. For $5 dollars this game is a no brainer. Especially when it's on sale for a little more than a buck. Now that the sales pitch and review of this game is done, I will have to say that the MS DOS port does not look good in today's standards. I do recommend that you pick up a source port so that you can have the game support your native resolution, mouse support, mods, etc. It's not hard to install or set up, it just consits of finding the source port, I recommend Zandronum, copy the WAD from the location you installed and paste it into your source port. That's it!I may be a 16 year old kid, but I see what this game has done to the FPS genre. I love all of the mechanics of this game and will always be coming back to this game for years to come.Thank you so much for bearing with me for this long review,Uncle Teo(P.S. Don't judge my hours played I have played this a lot with a source port that doesn't keep track of my hours)			",83,3,0,8,5,0,0

												I may only have five minutes of playtime, but that was the best five minutes of my life.But for real, Doom is an amazing game that's stood the test of time better than any other game out there; the community is still highly active and the mod scene is still going strong after 23 years, people are still speed running the game and Doomworld holds Cacowards every single year to showcase the best mods and wads of the year. You just don't see that kind of activity with many other games from the 90's (except for Quake). I mean, the game outsold Windows '95 and was promoted by Bill Gates! Everyone knows Doom, and I'm glad to say that it's my favorite game of all time.If you want to play Doom, download a modern source port like (G)ZDoom or Zandronum, play through the game vanilla, and then dive into the ocean of mods and wads. There are great mods like Smooth Doom, Reelism, Project MSX, Samsara, Fractal Doom, DemonSteele, and Doom64 EX. If Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, TNT: Evilution, and The Plutonia Experiment didn't have enough maps for you, then you've got great wads and mega-wads like UAC Ultra, Pirate Doom, Scythe 1/2, Alien Vendetta, Speed of Doom, Claustrophobia 1024, Plutonia 2, Community Chest #1-4, the recent Japanese Community Project, and so many more. Oh, and you can't forget nuts.wad!And don't forget to celebrate Doom's birthday on December 10th by playing Doom and shooting the Cyber Demon until it dies. Cheers, Doomguy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing this game and its sequel Doom II - Hell On Earth since they came out, so ignore my play time here. Buying this gets you the DOOM.WAD (and DOOM2.WAD for its sequel) which you can then use with a source port, and with a modern machine it's pretty much the only way to play. Choose between enhancements galore with ports like GZDoom, or go with a more vanilla experience with the likes of Chocolate Doom.The first game probably had the best level design of the series, and yes I'm including the latest game of the series in that comparison too, and is worth a play through for that fact alone. None of the dull, boring corridors you're expected to fight in these days. Doom has entire facilities to explore with no correct way to go about it. Spending a bit of extra time exploring will often reward you with secrets.Just don't forget to save often. Being able to manually save your game whenever you want, something that modern games don't seem to bother with these days, gives you much more freedom in your approach to exploration. Scared to jump into an acid pool to see if there's a secret? Save the game then! None of this save-point rubbish that we have to put up with in today's games.If you haven't played Doom you're missing out on not only witnessing an important part of digial history, but playing an awesome game that still stands up today too.

												Hundreds of major media outlets have already described Doom's influence on the greater games industry. Books have been written about it. It's been made into a feature film, had two major reboots, and bears a relatively small but massively dedicated community, consisting of people who have been playing for 23 years. I am one of those people. I feel as if I have done everything there is to be done with Doom, having beaten every episode, played hundreds if not thousands of add-on WAD files, *made* several add-on WADs myself (many gameplay patches and one new level), and become an influential person in the community myself.It should be obvious how much I recommend this game. Buy it and you will never, ever run out of things to do.			",389,85,13,19,28,3,26

Get it during a sale, if you're still skeptical. Get it on PSN, if you prefer that. Get it on your Xbox 360. Get it. It's the granddaddy of first person shooters, and it's aged like fine wine.Just avoid the iOS port. It's actually really terrible.			",183,37,4,32,7,1,18

												11/10.I first played this game when I was 6 in 1999 on my dad's copied floppy disc. This game has ingrained the FPS genre inside me from a very young age and I wouldn't have it any other way. The hordes of iconic demons, your extensive arsenal, forboding environments that capture the atmosphere of that spacey hellish theme and the iconic DOOM Guy whom I have idolized for a very long time.- Non-stop action of mowing down demons of various skill- Extremely moddable- Iconic soundtrack by Bobby Prince- This game will literally almost run on anything (even the Macbook's touch bar)- A revolutionary game for it's time that pioneered gaming, popularized the FPS genre to what it is todayThis game is super close to my heart, playing most of the DOOM games up until DOOM 2016 along with replaying more of ID's games, watching the movie (as most hated it I still loved it) and even inking the title on my arm. I cannot fault it, I don't care how biased that is.			",145,10,1,19,6,0,13

												  You've probably heard of Doom. It's was a legend in it's own time, spawning an entire generation of “Doom clones”, first person shooters of the '90s that aped the original violent blockbuster. I was fairly young when Doom originally released, but remember hearing about it in whispered tones from friends and family members, staring for hours in awe at a few too-good-to-be-true screenshots in various gaming magazines. My mind ran wild with possibilities: how could a video game be so dark and Satanic? How could you control a character you couldn't see? What twisted lore did these Hellish landscapes hold? I never had a computer or console that could run this bloody fantasy of mine (or had access to this new-fangled internet technology), so I built my own mythology and hype for the game in my head. The hardcore rebellious spirit of those screencaps and schoolyard tales was only heightened by the misguided political controversies that sprung up around it (and a few other notables) at that time. Once I was finally able to play some version of the game (I can't remember if it was shareware or even Doom 64) I was hooked. It lived up to my wildest imagination, while also containing gameplay I could have never dreamed of. Since then whenever I obtain a new piece of technology capable of running games I make an effort to get Doom installed on it in whatever form is available. Recently as I was scrolling through the hundreds of games I have available to me I got the itch. The Doom Call. Rather than play any of the sequels or remakes or remixes or mods, I decided to go back to square one and see how the original held up in modern times, see if it earned it's place in gaming history. The results may shock you... or not. It shouldn't be any surprise: Doom ♥♥♥♥ing rules.  Every aspect of Doom just feels so right. The graphics may be muddy and pixelated by today's HD, obsess-over-resolution standards, but they certainly are cohesive and set a mood. Body parts litter the brown and red environments, the character sprites lie halfway between cartoon and genuinely disturbing/cool, and the death animation for each of the creative and iconic enemy types is disgustingly satisfying. The music gets your blood pumping and for good reason: they are all literal MIDI rip-offs of heavy metal songs of the time, so they're nice and crunchy, catchy, and charming. The level design is almost uniformly excellent, with the vast majority of your rampage through Hell striking a nice balance between combat, finding secret areas, solving key card puzzles, and navigating an expertly designed maze. There are only a few instances of the old-school Dungeons and Dragons design getting in the way of enjoyment: notably the second to last level in Episode 3 which is a nightmare of esoteric puzzles that can only be solved by trial and error guesswork through floor hazards that will deal damage to you. Other than that, the gameplay absolutely holds up, with some stages swinging heavily on either the combat or puzzle solving and most finding a nice mix. On harder difficulty settings (and Episode 4, even on Hurt Me Plenty) a new layer of strategy and resource management appears: every shot is essential, switching weapons to keep your ammo stock full is key, searching for secret areas and the power-ups they hide is necessary, and sometimes just flat out avoiding combat is a better option. Doom feels like the perfect storm of brilliant level design and technology that pushed boundaries but didn't get in over it's head.  A few little notes about the “Ultimate” subtitle in “The Ultimate Doom”: as far as I can tell this version is the original DOS release, but Episode 4 was a late edition to the game (I'm assuming it was semi-promotional for Doom II: Hell on Earth) and is included in the package. Episode 4 is a crazy jump up in difficulty from the base game and likes throwing shotgun guys everywhere, but it fits seamlessly with the rest of the game. Trying to control the game with just a keyboard as originally intended is doable if clunky, or you can use a keyboard/mouse combination which feels somewhat better but I had some trouble with my marine sliding around because the mouse can control movement for some reason. I eventually hooked up an Xbox 360 controller and ran Controller Companion, and man... that seems like the way to go. It might not be 100% authentic, but it feels great. Just another testament to how timeless the game is.  I could go on about how innovative and influential Doom was in it's day, but I could hardly do it justice. If you're interested in it's history there are plenty of articles out there, or better yet read Masters of Doom. What's more interesting to me is how the game has molded my outlook on games on a personal level, and just how well the game still plays. Doom is a classic in every sense of the word, and has earned it's place as legend and withstood the test of time.			",285,115,3,26,19,2,41

												In the modern age of first person shooters such as CoD and Battlefield with their stylized presentation and Quicktime events it is a welcome and joyous occasion when you can fire up a game of Doom and be sucked in like it was 1993 all over again.On the outside Doom is just another retro shooter trying to survive in this modern world. With it’s pixelated 2.5D graphics, midi soundtrack, inability to jump or duck or even look in 3 dimensions, you would think that it would have been long forgotten in a wash of newer, flashier combat games, but that’s where Doom really shines. In its minimalistic nature, Doom makes you forget what it doesn’t have and focus on what it does have: amazing gameplay.Doom doesn’t hold your hand. Right from the start you are thrust into a foreign Martian world with a pistol and the hope of survival as you are faced with ever increasing opposition which comes in the form of possessed Space Marines and demonic creatures straight from the depths of hell, and over time that’s exactly where you go. Through the game you get access to bigger and badder weapons but also find larger and more dangerous enemies such as the Cyberdemon and the Spiderdemon-both a mix of demonic flesh and futuristic machine a perfect parallel to the twisted world around them-to use them on. Through it all, superior level design and your wits are what separate you from the dead marines at your feet. The levels unobtrusively lead you into your next surprise encounter all the while providing the cover needed to save you from near death. One thing they don’t do is raise that veil of atmosphere that Doom lays on you. All of the pieces fit together wonderfully in this game to give you the perfect immersive experience.Of course, one of the biggest reasons this game is still relevant today is the still thriving community of modders who create everything from single levels to entire modifications for the game that give you new weapons, enemies, graphics, sounds, levels, game mechanics… even huge multiplayer and coop levels. And it’s all free. If you are looking for an adrenaline rush or just want to run screaming down memory lane, look no further than Doom.			",131,72,0,27,6,0,9

												Ah, what else could be said that hasn't already been said a billion times over with regards to DOOM. This title can really be credited as THE First Person Shooter. With over 20 years time, DOOM continues to have a very much active fan base and has become a milestone for what this genre really represents. For well seasoned gamers you have played of FPS titles such as Unreal Tournament, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, Wolfenstien, Shadow Warrior, Blood, Rise of the Triad, Painkiller or Serious Sam but not have played DOOM would feel right at home with this game and I would recommend you play this on the harder difficulties or you could download a sourceport for the classic DOOM games for example (Zandronum, GZDoom, ZDoom, DOOMsday etc.) and then get a little mod called Brutal Doom...believe me it's worth the hassle. There are just to many mods and sourceports for DOOM too even mention here. If you are a diehard fan of First Person Shooters and are utterly tired of COD and Battlefield have this genre into...then this is an absolutely must have game for the collection!

Installing mods and multiplayer is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. If you are one of the people who complains about the graphics, and the gameplay, then get the BRUTAL DOOM mod. It makes the game twice as cool and a bit easier on the eyes. A solid 9/10 would *umpf* again.			",60,5,0,7,4,0,0

												This is the game that really started it all off. This game is very much worth the title of the game that started it all of as well. Good on id software on giving us an extra stage. As this game is a beautiful and handcrafted experiance that was rovolutionary for its time. If you didn't know already DOOM was a popular peice of shareware  with a new premise that was scary for its time because of the idea of venturing into hell itself to rid it of every demon in sight the most gory way possible. This ranges from using a shotgun to lay their guts out across the floor of sraight up punching the satanic creatures in to dust.The biggest downfall to the game is the story which is okay, it was the same as hotline miami for me as where it seemed like an excuse to shoot and kill everything is sight, which is totaly okay is you have good game play. This game delivers that exactly.The gameplay ranges from begginer to intermediate puzzles, finding secret rooms, and good 'ol fashoned gore with a range of different weapons. It doesent sound like much on paper and it isn't unless you are playing a higher difficulty. When you play on a higher difficulty you are constantly knee deep in blood and gore the whole time along with taking on a challenge worthy of you're time. There is also a large amount of weapons to work with. The most famous of them is the BFG (look up the acronym for you're selves). Other choices are the shotgun, brass knuckles, handgun, mini gun, and the rocket launcher. The next thing is the puzzles, which usualy consist of finding key cards and opening doors to make your way through the level, some of these can be tedious as it is easy to get lost and not know where you are going.The last feature is the secrets that can be very annoying to find without a guide or else you will be walking around puching ans shooting random walls alot which can also get very annoying.One of the best things about this game is the graphics. Which work around the limitations of the time to create areas that are full of detail and beautiful (technicaly) 2D sprite work of armor and enimies that all mesh together to create a revoulutionary game that almost single handededly formed the FPS genra for years to come. Let me give you some good advice, BUY THIS GAME			",167,23,2,15,25,5,7

												DooM is the ultimate FPS. The game blew me away when I originally saw it back in the early 90's, and it continues to blow me away every time I go back to it (which is frequently). The level design is amazing, the graphics still hold up, the music kicks♥♥♥♥♥ and it plays like a dream.No Steam library should be without it.			",327,50,7,17,18,3,37

												*IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING A LOT OF READING THE VERDICT IS CLEARLY OUTLINED BELOW**NOTICE: I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME MORE THAN STEAM HAS RECORDED*A classic shooter that not only acted as a fore runner for FPS games to come, but is still a lot of fun to play. Visually, the game isn't super high def PS4/XBox One graphics (obviously), but the cartoony art style coupled with great design on the appearance of the monsters makes this a game that I find pleasing to look at, especially compared to other games which haven't aged well visually. The game runs well for the most part, though I do experience very brief, occasional slow downs, usually when there are a lot of monsters on screen. This brings me to the gameplay: ""Doom"" is still a very fun game to play (at least in my opinion). Its lack of aiming up and down or need to jump from spot to spot lets the player focus on high speed (I mean seriously fast) strafing and maneuvering to survive the demons that have sought to wreak havoc on our hero. And of course who can forget the lovely sound of heavy metal and shotguns?VerdictDoom is a fast paced FPS that pioneered the genre and is still great fun to this day. It's cartoony graphics have helped the game age suprisingly well visually, while its simple gameplay keeps the action fast and frenetic. Whether you want to play for a few minutes or a few hours, ""Doom"" will keep you entertained.			",58,10,0,11,3,1,6

!!Important note!! Doom doesn’t work on my windows 10 laptop it crashes at the start, but it is easily fixable, you can download a launcher called zdoom, which is free and you will be able to easily get the game up and running on it. There is a link below to zdoom.   What I liked about Doom •	The game has an awesome soundtrack.•	There are many secrets throughout the levels to be found.  •	The monsters in the game were pretty cool to fight. •	Awesome levels. My favourite chapter in the game is Inferno•	A great arsenal of weapons. The shotgun and the chainsaw were my favourite weapons to use. The weapons have a real kick to them, makes you feel like a badass as you go around killing enemies.   •	I liked how at the end of the levels it showed you a map telling you, where you have been and where you are going to next.•	You can mod the game. Highly recommend you try brutal doom or Project brutality.• I like it how you can see doomguy's face at the bottom of the screen, seeing how he reacts to being shot at or attacked. What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Chapter four isn’t that good. A very difficult chapter, especially at the start.My conclusion Doom was one of the first video games I ever played, I have fond memories of it. It is a brilliant first person shooter and made even better with brutal doom or project brutality. I highly recommend it.  83/100Zdoom http://zdoom.org/Downloadbrutal doom http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom ",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

												Almost the same review as Doom 2What are you doing reading this review instead of buying the game?Doom 2 is one of the best games ever made. Featuring many source ports that you can choose for your liking, to make the game run well for our modern needs. I personally would recommend GZDoom if you want to play Doom with Mods, Zanondronum/Doomseeker and/or Zdaemon for multiplayer and use ZDL as a mod loader, so you can pick what mods you want to play and what source port you want to use.Doom/Doom 2 has the biggest and most active modding community in gaming, even to this day. If you're a fan of classic games and a fan of modding, then Doom/Doom 2 is a must have for you.Modders have even remade Donkey Kong Country and Sonic in the Doom engine. Go ahead and get the Doom Pack that gets you Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, Final Doom and Master Levels for Doom 2. GET IT! ",282,25,0,24,17,1,49

												There's not a whole lot to be said about DOOM that hasn't been said beforeIt's a great game. With all the secrets, and enemies to annihilate. Small choice of weapons, but that's no problem.Four episodes with 7 missions each, 8 if you count the boss battle at the end of each episode.To this day DOOM still looks good.It'll run on just about anything with a processor and graphics card.The game doesn't cost a lot. It'd be a good decision to just buy the complete package.There is Satanic imagery for anyone who's a wuss and is worried about that - wouldn't want you to cry if you reach that cyberdemon.As this is a older game it'll be running on DOSBox, I had to change my output type to OpenGL but after that everything was smooth sailing. No framerate issues here.Lighting can be a bit weird in certain places, but it adds to the atmosphere.It's a good FPS give it a try if you haven't played it yet.			",51,2,0,3,0,0,0

												Back in 1993, all we had was MS-DOS and a copy of DOOM. Instead of pressing start on your Xbox Controller, we had to type in terribly long commands. But that long journey was worth it. We got to slaughter demons and destroy Hell itself! Now, we're in an age of Call of Duty and DLC. DOOM has risen to steam as... THE ULTIMATE DOOM! The game works real well and everything just feels like your playing on an old school DOS Computer! To step up the fun, download Brutal Doom. Brutal Doom makes everything better like Fatalities, more gore, and health bonuses for brutally killing Imps and Lost Souls! Another thing that I like about Ultimate Doom is how it includes a fourth episode, Thy Flesh Consumed. It's kinda like a prequel to DOOM II Hell on Earth. If you don't know about this game, you're just a sad shell living under a rock playing Call of Duty Black Ops. Everything about DOOM is just so... AWESOME. If you haven't played this game yet, buy it now on Steam for just $4.99. Overall, The Ultimate DOOM gets a 19/10! Why? BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME!			",67,10,0,5,6,1,3

												THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE! BUY IT NOW! seriously, i have thousands of hours in this game (if you count the time i played my non-steam copy back in the day and through the years.) The base game will give you quite a thrill alone, but it also hase a HUGE modding community and tons of custom levels!!! This game has had custom levels and arenas made for it for over 15 years now, it has to have at least a million for it. not to mention the ever popular ""Brutal DooM"" mod for this game (although nothing beats the classic gameplay). This is my favorite game of all time! RIP AND TEAR!!!!!!			",110,12,16,10,9,0,5

												I haven't played this game because it looks too scary but it asks a really important question in the title: What is the ULTIMATE DOOM? I personally think it would be when you go to hell and they give you a really nice girl to talk to and you seem to be getting along very well, but then you accidentally fall over because you are trying to tie up your shoes and touch her leg and she calls the police. But because this is hell this probably happens forever and instead of a long court case and a moderate fine plus 48 hours of community service instead you go to HELL PRISON or something, which is like normal prison except instead of food you get knives and spikes and stuff, and instead of a bed you get like tarantulas or something. Maybe not tarantulas actually, once i went to the zoo and there was a tarantula and it wasn't really that scary because the man let me hold it although  it did crawl up my wrist and i did have to buy the zoo a new one because i trod on it when i went back to my seat. It was definitely his fault for letting me drop the tarantula though since i am not a tarantula expert. Overall i have to guuess that if you like scary games then this one is the scariest and therefore the best so buy it you will not be disappointed unless you prefer less scary games like Snake II on the nokia phone.

												DOOM isn't where the FPS genre started, but it is where SH!T GOT REAL.If you were alive in 1995 and you are still somehow immature enough to be playing PC games, follow these simple rules:1. Buy this.2. Google ""Brutal Doom."" 3. Download and install the aforementioned.(Brutal Doom updates the game for modern machines, but keeps the original look, while adding additional animations and a dumptruck full of blood and gore in every frame.  Do it. Do it now.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game would immediately freeze on the title image whenever I tried to run it, regardless of which version I ran. I had one moment where I lucked out and was able to play for a few minutes, but the entire screen had a red filter over the gameplay. my advice: consider looking elsewhere for a better version of Doom.Edit: I knew it was The Ultimate DOOM and not the DOOM Remake, I'm no idiot. I used my own money to buy this game and tried to fix the errors myself. I looked in the discussions and nothing worked. I do care about this old game and personally enjoy playing it on the Shareware Version I found. This version of the game just didn't work for me.			",25,6,0,1,2,0,1

												The game that started it all. Even though this is the best FPS of all time does it really need a reveiw? Not really but I'll do one anyway.DooM is a FPS game that improved off fo wolfenstein3D to launch the FPS genre to center stage. A lot of the improvements are graphical such as floor and cealing textures. While some are dealing with rendering like you can now use slopes and stairs.It has fast paced action and a modding community that makes it even better.You should really pick up this game.

												This game is the best FPS that was ever created, and will stay as the best FPS that was ever created forevermore. Just like what Megadeth is for the thrash metal, and what Iron Maiden is for the heavy metal, Doom is the ultimate accelerator factor behind the FPS genre. It's the game that opened up the doors for the FPS to grow, and become what it is today (an outlet for the 12 year old casual kids to play their crappy call of duty games and insult people's mothers over voice chat, sadly lmfao). Not only that, but arguably it is the first and foremost game (or even if it's not, it's still the most important one, and I accept no arguments over that) that opened up the doors of modding! You thought that modding community of Bethesda was pretty sick, if you are thinking that, you've seen nothing yet. The scale of modifications and .WADs created for this game is INSANE, and even after 20 years, new content for the old Doom games are still being released religiously by fans, even today! With the same Doom 1 engine that was created 20 years ago, if fans are able to recreate fairly accurate SONIC THE HEDGEHOG games, this tells many things, doesn't it? To me, it means not only it's just an FPS game, but this game can turn into whatever the hell you want it to be, even 20 years later, lol. They made a huge fuss over that triviality called Hatred, and gave it a bunch of free publicity a year ago... Obviously they don't even know the true meaning of BRUTALITY - if you know what I mean ;) - and therefore they lack the slightest imagination to think of anything remotely similar. What foolish mortals. But seriously jokes aside, ignorant people like them who don't even know proper knowledge about the things they want to critise, shouldn't even be allowed to do so. (*coughdidsomeonesaysarkeesiancough*) Because common sense, really. And this is a general rule of thumb in life, if you ask me.To finalize, if this game is able to turn me into a giddy child with it's modifications, even after 20 years later, this tells pretty much all you need to hear I think.FINAL verdict - once again - the greatest FPS of all time.

												The invention of iron sights is the reason modern shooters suck.  Forcing the player to make a clear distinction between attack and defense changes the whole pace, it encourages things like chest high walls and shooting gallery level design.  Imagine an FPS from a time before that.  When you could run fast, and also shoot at the same time.  When enemies were everywhere instead of in the Designated Setpiece Areas.  When even designing levels in 3D was new and exciting, and the best minds in gaming were thinking deeply about level design.  If you haven't played DOOM, you don't know jack ♥♥♥♥in♥♥♥♥♥♥about FPSes.There are demons.  You need to shoot them in the face, now.  Go.			",120,10,1,16,9,0,15

												The game, the legend, real mass fps starts here. Solid and tight controls, fast gameplay, reactive monsters, memorable music that gets countless remixes to this day. A blast from the past that still packs a punch and stands up to most fps made to this day. Map design is great, monster selection is ok, weapons are good, atmosphere is great, graphics - a pass considering the ancient legacy this game holds.Play with mods such as brutal doom and expanded engine such as gzdoom.

												Bought it for H-DoomI regretNOTHINGOTHINGOn a serious note:This is the mother of shooters (next to Wolfenstein 3d being...the grandmother then?)Who does not know Doom?Doom pretty much made the fundament of what shooters are today. We cannot deny doom did nothing, they pretty much started with shooters back then, of course they had to test things. Why not demons? Ok, let's use demons and see how people react. And oh boy...what an impact it had, has and will still have. Let's be honest: Am I the only one who thinks E1M1's soundtrack (1. level) is pretty much the best? I am no big fan of metal, but omg, that one just makes me wanna go off an shoot demons! ...wait, that is the actual setting of the game...What can I really say about the gameplay...well...the original controls were the arrow pads while Ctrl (I think) being the shooting button.  you have weak enemies, having a pistol or a shotgun, tankers, dealing mediocre damage but being able to take a lot of damage, and ememies, who are just strong, having the ability to fly and deal a lot of damage or just take a lot of damage and dealing a lot. Every enemy has a specific weakness, each one's different. Ofc, a BFG 9000 (i'll talk about the weapons soon) is definetly effective against everyone, but wasting that ammo for some Imps? Not useful. Ammo management is also important, so dont just foolishly spend your minigunammo. Use the shotgun or rocketlauncher, depending on the situation.So we can say, the game requires you to think (*cough* COD *cough*)The weapon choice is alright. In total, we have 8 weapons. The fists (pretty much your last choice you should use. DO NOT), the chainsaw (TIMBER), the shotgun (in Doom 2 we also have the double barreled shotgun), the pistol (semi-useful against weak enemies), the chaingun (your ""rifle"" in this game, sharing the pistol ammo), the rocketlauncher (dont need to add anything), the plasmarifle (strong, fast shooting rifle) and the BFG 9000, sharing the plasmarifle ammo (its name really is Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun 9000). you will know how to use them when playing. BFG of course is the weapon against everything using 60 plasmarifle ammo. while the chaingun is actually useful against everything, it will show its weakness against tanks or high-HP enemies (you will have to use a lot of ammo). Again, the ammomanagement but also the weaponvariety back then! Think of it!The last point I want to talk about are the maps:We have 4 chapters with 9 levels each (if I am not mistaken). each of them isnt just like a narrow path you have to follow, you sometimes have to do some backtracking to collect that one keycard you need for the final door. Or you have to solve a little puzzle to reach the end of the level/the next segment of the game. Enemies are placed in a good way, not bothering you but still surprising you at least a bit. And, many people sadly don't know this anymore: Secrets! For those picky people not living with the fact letting bits o' loot in a level, you can look for secrets! Some are quite easy to solve (walking against a wall, pressing the interaction key, normally space; or shooting against a wall) while others require you to think (eg you have to walk back to a specific point of the map and then running afap to the elevator, leading you to the secret). Something for everybody: not too narrow and challenging!Oh, the game has 5 difficulties. the first and second are not worth to try. go for the third or fourth, depending on how tough you think you are. DO NOT TRY NIGHTMARE. DO. NOT. DO. IT.But if you do, record it and show the world you are one of the best players around. Only a few managed to speedrun nightmare (as far as I know). It's really hard. For more informations what NIGHTMARE covers, look it up.One last tip:Use a ""newer"" software for Doom. DosBos is ~quite~ alright, but I highly recommend programs like zandronum. It automatically sees similar doom programs (mods) and plays them with but a single doubleclick with the doom engine.If you excuse me, the girls in H-Doom need some of René Descartes(if you get this joke, please comment this)PS:Oh, and dont think I dont know the game. I played this game around a year ago, I'd roughly say I have around at least 100 hours with it			",85,8,0,15,14,0,21

How to run ports\mods through Steam using ZDL 
A Guide for The Ultimate DOOM
By: Bunnings Wharehouse

			A guide to help people run modern Doom ports through Steam using ZDL, this enables Steam Overlay in the modern ports and keeps track of gaming hours.		


And THEN you have a highly enjoyable DOOM experience. Brutal DOOM works, I also tried some other mods like Pirate DOOM and the ZDL loader is a heaven-sent utility.I'm not going to waste space reviewing the game, it's a classic, it's the♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's my favourite game of all time and blah blah blah nostalgia glasses: activate. The first three episodes are pinnacles of 90s FPS perfection, episode four is a bit bland by comparison, and that's all I'm saying.I just wanted to set the record straight that DOOM can be run like clockwork through Steam thanks to this loader.And for those saying ""but why should I have to do this if I paid money for it!"", I say ""Do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want, but if you want a good way of playing DOOM through Steam wiht next to no effort, well, here it is.""

												DOOM is a classic first person shooter that gets even better when you slap on the amazing mod that is Brutal DOOM. I will skip the part that talks about the story for this game because it really wasn't a focus. The gameplay is fast paced fun and while it may not have aged well vanilla, BRUTAL DOOM IS AWESOME. Not much more to say really... I recommend this game to people who like old school shooters, just download Brutal DOOM for the ultimate DOOM experience. 80/100			",646,136,23,81,50,5,98

How to run ports\mods through Steam using ZDL 
A Guide for The Ultimate DOOM
By: Bunnings Wharehouse

			A guide to help people run modern Doom ports through Steam using ZDL, this enables Steam Overlay in the modern ports and keeps track of gaming hours.		


And THEN you have a highly enjoyable DOOM experience. Brutal DOOM works, I also tried some other mods like Pirate DOOM and the ZDL loader is a heaven-sent utility.I'm not going to waste space reviewing the game, it's a classic, it's the♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's my favourite game of all time and blah blah blah nostalgia glasses: activate. The first three episodes are pinnacles of 90s FPS perfection, episode four is a bit bland by comparison, and that's all I'm saying.I just wanted to set the record straight that DOOM can be run like clockwork through Steam thanks to this loader.And for those saying ""but why should I have to do this if I paid money for it!"", I say ""Do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want, but if you want a good way of playing DOOM through Steam wiht next to no effort, well, here it is.""

So satisfying. And it's not the satisfaction that had me hooked to this game, it's the music, the gameplay, the complexity the game has. And yes it is what you think. 3D in 1993.

												Playing Doom today gives you an understanding how low nowadays shitdustry has fallen into the endless pit of brainless plebeian entertainment policies.Creating a Doom shooter today is simply impossible, because everything in this game contradicts the nowadays rules of conduct of creating mass appealing titles that play themselves to make pathetic ♥♥♥♥s feel good about themselves and forget how pathetic they are.It's not an accident that every single post-2006 drone can't pass the first level of the first Doom, even if its difficulty levels are lowered after re-release on digital platforms. Doom 2, Duke Nukem 3D and SW are better though. That's what people used to call a ""progress"" - making things better, not worse. It's a lot better (and faster) with gameplay tweaking mods. Metal soundtracks are recommended, too. But the original is still very playable, especially after slogging through crap like any recent Far Cry title.Also, ♥♥♥♥ Call of Duty.			",171,33,3,33,20,1,41

												I love the game but the release. Normal price is too high 9,99€ it makes no sense. Especially if you are playing with win7 it is just buggy as ... colors are messed after a while. I think for this price you shouldn't do anything to make the game work properly all the time. Hope to see also some achievements or something like that. Shadow Warrior Redux was nice release with this one I'm not sure but if you haven't played Doom 1 ever I cannot recommend you to do so. It is an excellent game with some unique dark atmosphere.

												Yay its Doom, but alas - it runs on top of what seems to be a bugridden dosbox emu. Bug ridden? If I move the mouse the music stops and skips (and the mouse doesn't move the character fwiw - which I do recall worked back in the day).Also - it doesn't appear to let you customize anything - I can't remember if that was a thing or not, but I wouldn't mind being able to customize the keys.So overall - it just seems lazy... Even for 5 dollars.On the plus side you have the game files - you can use something like Chocolate Doom or Doomsday to play the game a bit more reliably.			",86,8,2,22,10,0,6

												One of the best first person shooters of all time, Doom has earned it's reputation for being the most innovative, (and contraversal) video games of all time. Released in 1993 for the PC by Id softwere. A range of weapons are available for killing various enemies through tons of complex, tricky maps with many secrets to find. Venture through mars, the planet Diemos, and hell it's self to kill the of the leaders of the evil that the worlds hold.This is an amazing game, and I recoment it to people who like older games and FPS games.

												One of the best first person shooters of all time, Doom has earned it's reputation for being the most innovative, (and contraversal) video games of all time. Released in 1993 for the PC by Id softwere. A range of weapons are available for killing various enemies through tons of complex, tricky maps with many secrets to find. Venture through mars, the planet Diemos, and hell it's self to kill the of the leaders of the evil that the worlds hold.This is an amazing game, and I recoment it to people who like older games and FPS games.

												I may not have been born when this game was at its peak, however, I can without a doubt say that Doom is one of my favorite games of all time. While the objectives in the game hardly change each individual level feels radically different than the last. The awesome soundtrack/monsters/weapons further aid in this since almost all of those are constantly different between each level.			",127,7,1,13,14,3,16

												I've been loving DOOM ever since as a kid, except that I haven't played it until just recently. I gotta say, it hasn't disappointed the slightest bit. In fact it is currently my favorite game. It has all the elements I find enjoyable in a game: simple premise, quiet protagonist, awesome music, rich atmosphere, ultra-violence, great sound effects, sarcasm and of course controversy. It must have been quite a sight seeing the Satanist imagery in the game and how hell is portrayed. That provoked people. I like stuff that provokes people. Anyway, I gotta say even though the game is old, I find the game as exciting to play as when I play Demon's Souls/Dark Souls or Fallout. The game can creep me out and give me a shock. Or make me desperate. I don't mind the simple controls, or the fact that the protagonist can't look up or down. When you play the game, you're not in it for sightseeing, you're in it to turn monsters into meatpulp! Legendary game. I strongly recommend it. Oh, it is nice you have the option of using two kinds of control settings, classic or updated. Both are fun but the classic setting is more challenging. The more challenging it is, the more rewarding it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Today, we are showered by games with the same story and concept: shoot first and ask questions later to break the chains of an unexpected force. Doom is not simular to any of them. Doom is unique in its own way. It gives you a badass way to kill demons and to trek through the oncoming obstacles. It's the perfect game: no puzzles, no complex, pointless story. Just kill, kill, kill.			",42,0,0,0,1,0,0

												I bought this on Steam just so I could write a review of it, and maybe push id in the right direction with sales. I have actually played this game for hundreds of hours. I probably play it for at least 10-20 hours per year, for every year of my life.Let me make one thing perfectly clear: nostalgia does not factor into this game's enjoyment. Doom still has a very active community, and new mods come out all the time. Thanks to Carmack's programming, Doom made modding a staple of PC gaming, and it hasn't gone away. Getting older has made me see more of Doom's flaws, but I don't really like it any less.Doom is far from perfect. Unlike modern corridor shooters, which almost completely abandon the principles of level design, Doom is made or broken by its level design. There are a few different level designers that worked on Doom, and once you've played enough you can tell each of them just by playing their levels, even if you don't know their names. This means that level design is inconsistent, and therefore you're going to really like some levels and hate others. Most people who played Doom as a kid forgave the bad levels because, well, they were kids. If you're new to Doom, it's best to start at the beginning and play Episode 1 of Doom 1. This is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, set of levels for Doom, designed by John Romero. They're coherent, look nice (relatively speaking) and have well-placed secrets. Oddly enough, Doom 64 has one of the best sets of levels and plays like any of the other classic Doom games; google ""Doom 64 Absolution"" and you can easily find a total conversion mod that basically allows you to play Doom 64 on your computer once you have Doom. Thanks, Midway!Virtually every level can be summed up by ""find keys, throw switches, open doors."" This sounds bad, but again, it can either be tedious or enjoyable depending on the level's design. I must stress that the player should use their automap (tab key) here. Doom's levels are not afraid of having many twisting paths, and it's quite easy to get lost without it. Helpfully, switches are usually recessed into the wall slightly, which clearly marks them on the automap. If levels truly become tedious, don't be afraid to skip them by typing ""IDCLEVXX"", where ""XX"" is a two-digit number following the convention of episode number, then level number. i.e. IDCLEV14 changes to episode 1, level 4. Each episode has 9 levels. I won't lie to you, there are a few quite truly bad levels in Doom, but fortunately id left this cheat code in. Be careful, it starts the level as if you'd started a new game, which means you lose all your weapons except the pistol, and start with 100 health and 0 armor. However, all Doom levels are designed with pistol start in mind, so you should be able to manage with enough skill. Doom should be enjoyed on a level-by-level basis; remember, there is almost nothing in the narrative that ties these levels together. If you really hate a level, you should get used to the idea of just skipping it.The guns... well, everyone knows how the guns work, since they were the basis for almost every shooter arsenal until Unreal came out, notable exception being Rise of the Triad. They're quite well-balanced, actually, with the exception of the pistol, which becomes useless once you get the chaingun. The shotgun and chaingun are good at long range. The super shotgun is probably the best all-around weapon in the game, although it doesn't appear until Doom 2. The rocket launcher and plasma rifle are high-power weapons meant to break out against threatening hordes of monsters, and the BFG is there when nothing else substitutes.  Every one of them has a place in your arsenal, although depending on the levels you're playing, you may be using one a lot more than the other due to ammo distribution. Doom is famously narrative-light. Romero makes a good effort to portray ""realistic"" military base locations, but the game's somewhat ridiculously deep story penned by Tom Hall was thrown out in short order - trust me, if you'd have read it, you would agree that it is quite over-the-top for a fledgling shooter made in 1993. The inconsistency between levels means that the ultimate choice to abandon any hope of telling a story beyond the intermission text screens was probably for the best. There are a few key events that happen in the plot, but they mostly happen at the end of or between episodes.Overall, I highly recommend Doom for anyone who enjoys shooters but hasn't played Doom before. I also recommend Doom for anyone who is new to shooters, since it was also designed for that audience. If nothing else, it will give them an appreciation for where the genre has come from. This game still holds up very well today, especially with the active modding community. HOWEVER: If you do buy this game, do NOT run it as-is from Steam's library. To run the game on modern systems, it comes packaged with DOSBox, which simulates the MS-DOS environment. The emulation can slow down your computer considerably and ironically make running the game more difficult. You should instead download and install one of the many ""source ports,"" which are redesigns of the actual game engine to make it compatible with modern computers. ZDoom is a good and popular choice. Some ""purists"" swear by Chocolate Doom, which faithfully recreates the game, merely updating it to allow it to run on modern hardware without such niceties as OpenGL or mouselook.

												I bought this on Steam just so I could write a review of it, and maybe push id in the right direction with sales. I have actually played this game for hundreds of hours. I probably play it for at least 10-20 hours per year, for every year of my life.Let me make one thing perfectly clear: nostalgia does not factor into this game's enjoyment. Doom still has a very active community, and new mods come out all the time. Thanks to Carmack's programming, Doom made modding a staple of PC gaming, and it hasn't gone away. Getting older has made me see more of Doom's flaws, but I don't really like it any less.Doom is far from perfect. Unlike modern corridor shooters, which almost completely abandon the principles of level design, Doom is made or broken by its level design. There are a few different level designers that worked on Doom, and once you've played enough you can tell each of them just by playing their levels, even if you don't know their names. This means that level design is inconsistent, and therefore you're going to really like some levels and hate others. Most people who played Doom as a kid forgave the bad levels because, well, they were kids. If you're new to Doom, it's best to start at the beginning and play Episode 1 of Doom 1. This is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, set of levels for Doom, designed by John Romero. They're coherent, look nice (relatively speaking) and have well-placed secrets. Oddly enough, Doom 64 has one of the best sets of levels and plays like any of the other classic Doom games; google ""Doom 64 Absolution"" and you can easily find a total conversion mod that basically allows you to play Doom 64 on your computer once you have Doom. Thanks, Midway!Virtually every level can be summed up by ""find keys, throw switches, open doors."" This sounds bad, but again, it can either be tedious or enjoyable depending on the level's design. I must stress that the player should use their automap (tab key) here. Doom's levels are not afraid of having many twisting paths, and it's quite easy to get lost without it. Helpfully, switches are usually recessed into the wall slightly, which clearly marks them on the automap. If levels truly become tedious, don't be afraid to skip them by typing ""IDCLEVXX"", where ""XX"" is a two-digit number following the convention of episode number, then level number. i.e. IDCLEV14 changes to episode 1, level 4. Each episode has 9 levels. I won't lie to you, there are a few quite truly bad levels in Doom, but fortunately id left this cheat code in. Be careful, it starts the level as if you'd started a new game, which means you lose all your weapons except the pistol, and start with 100 health and 0 armor. However, all Doom levels are designed with pistol start in mind, so you should be able to manage with enough skill. Doom should be enjoyed on a level-by-level basis; remember, there is almost nothing in the narrative that ties these levels together. If you really hate a level, you should get used to the idea of just skipping it.The guns... well, everyone knows how the guns work, since they were the basis for almost every shooter arsenal until Unreal came out, notable exception being Rise of the Triad. They're quite well-balanced, actually, with the exception of the pistol, which becomes useless once you get the chaingun. The shotgun and chaingun are good at long range. The super shotgun is probably the best all-around weapon in the game, although it doesn't appear until Doom 2. The rocket launcher and plasma rifle are high-power weapons meant to break out against threatening hordes of monsters, and the BFG is there when nothing else substitutes.  Every one of them has a place in your arsenal, although depending on the levels you're playing, you may be using one a lot more than the other due to ammo distribution. Doom is famously narrative-light. Romero makes a good effort to portray ""realistic"" military base locations, but the game's somewhat ridiculously deep story penned by Tom Hall was thrown out in short order - trust me, if you'd have read it, you would agree that it is quite over-the-top for a fledgling shooter made in 1993. The inconsistency between levels means that the ultimate choice to abandon any hope of telling a story beyond the intermission text screens was probably for the best. There are a few key events that happen in the plot, but they mostly happen at the end of or between episodes.Overall, I highly recommend Doom for anyone who enjoys shooters but hasn't played Doom before. I also recommend Doom for anyone who is new to shooters, since it was also designed for that audience. If nothing else, it will give them an appreciation for where the genre has come from. This game still holds up very well today, especially with the active modding community. HOWEVER: If you do buy this game, do NOT run it as-is from Steam's library. To run the game on modern systems, it comes packaged with DOSBox, which simulates the MS-DOS environment. The emulation can slow down your computer considerably and ironically make running the game more difficult. You should instead download and install one of the many ""source ports,"" which are redesigns of the actual game engine to make it compatible with modern computers. ZDoom is a good and popular choice. Some ""purists"" swear by Chocolate Doom, which faithfully recreates the game, merely updating it to allow it to run on modern hardware without such niceties as OpenGL or mouselook.

												WINDOWS 8 OR ABOVE USERS NEED CHOCOLATE DOOM OR ZDOOM TO RUN THIS! (DON'T WORRY ZDOOM AND CHOCOLATE DOOM ARE FREE)Graphics 4/5Level design 4/5 Music 5/5Demons 666/5A timeless classic that has something for everyone. Simple gameplay for people new to games, Fast paced action shooting for FPS fans and keycard collecting for weirdo's  who like to collect keycards. Now where's the red keycard?The game is about shooting demons and going to hell, thats all. Every in the weapon is useful (exept the pistol and fist if you don't have the beserker powerup). The weapons you will be using the most are the shotgun, minigun and rocket launcher. Later on in the game you will be using the plasma gun and BFG. The enemys in doom are fun to fight against and you need to find to perfect weapon to use against them. First you got zombies/possessed soldiers with guns, Imps that throw fireballs, flying demon strawberries and a GIANT goat person with a missile launcher for an arm. The music is the best part. Though it is stolen from other artists like metallica, Pantera, Slayer and Alice in chains. But it does not stop it from being good, Infact it makes it sound cooler. If your playing doom in a sourceport like ZDOOM it uses the soundfont on your computer which makes it 10 times better.just get it or I WILL RIP AND TEAR HUGE GUTS!!! YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS NOT GETTING THIS!!! RIP AND TEEEEEAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!WINDOWS 8 OR ABOVE USERS NEED CHOCOLATE DOOM OR ZDOOM TO RUN THIS!			",50,1,0,2,2,0,2

												Oddly enough, I played DOOM II before DOOM in 95, so this was really my second installment in the series, about two years later. Back in 1995 things were simpler — I only had DOOM II, and Hover! so I could just play the obvious choice; come 1996 and (Final) DOOM, and choices were not that easy anymore: there also were Grand Prix 2 and FIFA 97 to be taken care of. Well, even though the choice wasn't easy, it always boiled down to my favourite meat-grinding, first-person gore party. I believe — and this is probably just my heart talking — DOOM II was far better than the original, but even then I knew perfectly that this would be a milestone, this would matter, this would've made history.It's not too late to claim your part in it.

												An MS-DOS Classic from my Childhood. Now with ""Episode 4: Thy Flesh Consumed."" An extra Episode that's not even in the Original DOOM. My Review on DOOM needs no Introduction.The Storyline is simple, you're a Space Marine that's transfered to Mars as Security for the Union Aerospace Corporation or UAC While they conduct Teleportation Experments on Mars' 2 Moons; Phobos and Deimos. But when a Teleportation Experment goes astary due to a terrible accident, Phobos Base sends out a distress signal while Deimos Base drops dead & disappears completely. Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent by ship from Mars to Phobos to investigate, only to find the Phobos Completely overrun by devilspawns from the Gates of Hell & there's one option left: LOCK & LOAD!

												So, I have to say firstly that I love Doom games. However, a forewarning to those of you running anything newer than Windows 7. This game will NOT run if you have a new operating system. Apparently, it only works up to Win 7 and past that it just gets stuck on the splash screen of the game with no sound, and no keyboard or mouse input being accepted. This obviously makes the game unfortunately unplayable. However there are solutions such as zDoom, which is what I am using right now to relive one of the first shooter games I ever played.

On top of all this, running brutal DOOM (one of the many mods found on modDB) enhances playing this game by like 100000x. So if you don't have this game by now, get off yo couch and go buy it!

												Consider this a review of all classic Doom games.I love Doom. I didn't grow up playing games lime these, heck, I didn't grow up playing games at all.Doom is without a doubt, the best FPS ever made.BUTDon't play this version. Obviously buy it, but don't play this version.Buy the steam versions, but download a sourceport like Zdoom or Zandronium to play them instead. DOS-box is complete garbage, this is a terrible port. The controls are very wonky, and the games look very pixely on this version. Sourceports are the best way to play vanilla Doom, they add better texturing, and higher resolutions for those of us with 16:9 monitors.And also they add a whole slew of options for modding, one of the most popular being Brutal Doom.And last but not least, don't buy the new Doom, it looks like crap, like Halo and a tacked on Multiplayer with terrible Matchmaking.Good day.

												it's only natural to imitate success. doom definalty had an impact on gaming in genral, it basicly made the first person shooter genre a thing and people now-a-days do not respect that.another thing: you are not a true gamer unless you launched this game on DOS on a windows 95 computer.i remember when i was five years old playing this in my dads basement and having a hell of a good time.this game is not story driven but there IS a story: sientists of the UAC (Union Aerospace Corperation) were experementing with teleportation and ends up opening the gates to hell,hell-spawn starts pouring through the gate open because of the tleportation experements.above all else I and many, MANY other people highly recommend this game 12/10here's a shotgun! no more questions! go shoot some demons on mars!

Let's say the 10/10 rate is related to the Game itself (or every Pros I've though of and listed) while the 0/10 is related to the Game As a Steam Release (Everything is listed in the Cons Section). Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically DooM II, Final DooM nor even the Master levels for DooM II. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this Game FPS. The genre was defined by THIS game (Yes, yes, there was Wolfenstein before, but the mainstream came with DooM overwhelming popularity). I still feel Adrenaline while sporting around an arsenal of weapons through Maps totally full of monsters and a gameplay that can be summarized as ""shoot (or run through) everything that moves and get to the exit"". Sounds lame but everything started from here, and simpler things are not boring here. They're Fun. MUSIC. It's a widely known story and it's true. Most of the bad@$$ music you hear in game are nothing but ripoffs from famous Metal or Hard Rock famous songs. How could a game be more Bad@$$ than this? MODS. One of the most Modded game ever. There are even lots of Ports, because DooM originally is a DOS game so it always had few issues with windows' environment (mainly audio related, who remembers autoexec.bat, dos=high umb and other damn DOS lines like them? XD). Lots of famous mods, that can revolutionize the gameplay (like Brutal Doom), or even new maps (See Alien DooM), or totally messed up demented projects (like the Italian And somehow Satyrical/blatantly blasphemous Grezzo 2... I am told it's greatly appreciated around the world... even though most characters are italian or from italian Television, and everything is written/spoken in italian... so... O.o). There are even lots of guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam. STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work. THE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT ""Modern input"" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And ""Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95"" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, it's a bit clunky. Not being able to look up or down is always annoying. Even worse, moving the mouse forward or back instead moves me forwards or backwards, which is really annoying when I'm trying not to fall. I mean, seriously, what FPS does that, having the mouse move the player? It goes against every gaming instinct I've developed from FPSs.As far as I know, there's no way to change the controls, so I'm stuck with this bass ackwards mouse control.Other than that, there's not much to say. I mean, it's the original DOOM, pretty much. An all-time classic. I would say it's aged relatively well. Graphics can get repetitive, what you have to do isn't always straightforward, and some times the game makes you jump through extra hoops just for some cheap hits (if I remember correctly, in E1M4, you have to get the red keycard, which sets off a flag for more enemies to be released, and you have to get through them to get the blue keycard). But overall, it's fun, it's challenging, and it's DOOM.Hell awaits you... Are you ready for it?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you really need a review? Seriously. This is Doom, the grand daddy of the entire FPS genre. I will say this game has aged remarkably well (especially with mods like Doom Engine, GZdoom and Brutal Doom. The resolution change brings the sprites up quite a bit and there are even mods that replce the sprites with 3D models. In short. This game is a classic and it still kicks♥♥♥♥♥It will also likely kick your♥♥♥♥♥mercilessly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself being ""DOOM"" is an excellent fps that defined the genre, but this version is not very good. This DOOM port is  a DOS emulator with the DOOMrom attatched. This means that it is poorly optimized for a modern computer. There is a lack of any controller options, meaning you have to use the origional control scheme which is very tank-like, using the arrow keys to go forward, back, and turining while using the ""ctrl"" key to fire and holding ""alt"" to strafe. The mouse support is awful simply acting as the arrow keys. A better DOOM for a modern machine is DOOM 3 bfg edition. This includes all of the DOOM games and all have been updated for a new computer with modern fps controls.			",67,6,0,2,4,0,3

												Will not run on Windows 8 systems, no game that's continuing to be sold should have these compatibility issues.This is the modern age, despite this being an old game, this should not be continually sold while these problems persist.  DO NOT BUY if you are running Windows 8, and I wouldn't chance it if you've got 8.1.  This is a lazy port, a mere cash grab, otherwise this would not be a problemTo everyone else, I hope you're enjoying this classic!  Kick some extra♥♥♥♥♥for me, won't you? :)EDIT: After a bit of messing with it I actually got it to work, albeit with some weird tricks.

												If you are looking to relive the classic D00M experience on a system newer than Windows 98, this is not the game for you. Unlike the Ultimate Edition that came with pre-ordering Doom3 all those years ago, or the relatively recent BFG Edition, which both modernized and created a compatible experience for current systems, this version of the Ultimate Doom launches through ""DOSBox"" Emulator. This in of itself would not be a deal breaker... if of course, it worked, and I didn't pay actual money for it!Colour pallete and compatibility issues as well as the game becoming unresponsive seconds into a new game are the name of the game. Unfortunately, as much as I adore this franchise, the pricetag does not justify the *very* brief glimpse of nostalgia you will get from this title; much less buying the bundle pack, as I did. That's $26.00 AUD I'm never going to see again.It truely is painful to have to speak ill of the game that consumed so much of my childhood, it truely, truely is...Rip and Tear away from this.

												The Ultimate in Bad Ports.If you couldn't tell from the official screenshots with warped colors, this features terrible modern hardware support. How bad? No OpenGL/DirectX. Software Rendering Only. Locked 480p 4:3 Resolution. This is only worth buying for the data files, which you should proceed to use in a newer Source Port engine.""This is the roots of PC Gaming on Windows people thanks to Gabe Newell who offered to port it."" -Just Good PC GamesThe above statement is an obviously paid lie. Calling this a port at all is outright dishonest. This crap got shoved onto steam when Bethesda got the Id catalog, and it's an outdated unpatched dos version running in an emulator. Gabe did nothing, and in no way is this a Windows NT port, but a disgusting cashgrab by Bethesda using a DOS emulator they also didn't develop.Any other avenue for legally acquiring those files is better than this. This is an awful hackjob that no one should support Bethesda with. If you don't believe me, go look at Super Noah's Ark 3-D. There is nothing preventing these games from running the way they should but Bethesda.If you buy this and don't leave an extremely negative review, you are personally contributing to these bad ports on steam. Any and all encouragement to buy this by Curators should be met with extreme distrust and assumption of shilling. You can't play this as it ships and leave with a good impression unless you are a fool completely ignorant of PC Gaming and DOOM. As someone who has spent hundreds of hours playing DOOM, as someone who considers DOOM to be in the high end of their Top 5 Games of All Time, this is not how you should experience doom.

												Very dissapointed right now. I was really hoping that I was going to get to re visit this game from my childhood but clearly I was wrong. None of the games are even opening up for me. As soon as I open them they just freeze at the title screen. I have deleted them and re downloaded them 3 times but nothing seems to work. Its a waste of money and time! You'd be better off getting the new doom.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game ♥♥♥♥ing hated me.Doors did not work so I was trapped in a might I add DEMONLESS room, with a few pickups. The game would be all pissy with me until I managed to GLITCH IT into having color, BUT SUPRISE! Its in a tiny window! So thats how I learned the doors don't work.My computer is Vista and XP compatable, because I'VE USED BOTH THOSE OPERATING SYSTEMS on this PC. Over all, hated it. I can't tell if i'm doing something wrong, but its not working for me. Even went through the bogus system of contacting steam support to get this pile of glitches out of my library, and my 4.99 back into my wallet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom is one of my favorite series.But the way its being sold from Steam is ridiculous. Because Im running on windows 8 I have to suffer with DOSBOX crap. After modifying files I got it to work. But its still lagy and not fullscreen. Ive messed with the resolution and it helped a little. But in the end, the work you have to put in is not worth it. Especially for people who just want to click and play. This is 2015, product this faulty shouldnt exist anymore. I own this on multiple consoles and I love it. Why cant Steam or whoever fix this. I talked my friends into buying it. And they all feel the same. Steam just robbed us...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

WTF, id and steam, WTF? so you ask me if i recommend this game? on steam: F*** NO. on whatever other DOSBox player: maybe, if it works.. i suggest you buy the cheapest version first, MAKE SURE IT WORKS,  THEN go buy the rest, one at a time, of course..i know it doesnt sound like much, but there goes $15 down the drain. thank you, Steam, for having such great titles where only about a third of them work.. thank you SOOO much.

												I love this game to death, don't get me wrong, but don't get this version. Get Doom 3: BFG Edition. It comes with Doom 1, 2, and 3. I found that out after I already had bought this one and Doom 2, just saving everyone money. Please don't hate me. Dx			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Huh. Let me say this: It's actually♥♥♥♥♥♥Stop buying into all the good reviews, those are just people who can't take off their nostalgia goggles. Just because a game is old doesn't mean it's good.1: Slightly moving the mouse freezes the entire game.2: There are no control options so I'm left sitting there mashing buttons before realizing that the mouse is actually required to shoot. 3: I'm not playing with the horrendous classic controls.4: All the reviews made the game seem like a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece of amazement with every aspect being extremely polished up to the brim. It's not. It's a buggy, crashing mess and I see why. It's literally just an MS DOS emulator with a doom rom. You're paying 5 bucks for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rom. Do not buy. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Such a great game, DOOM is classic game that everyone knows, especially since it really got the fps genre famous. this is DEFINITELY worth it's 5.00 dollar price. this game offers hours of entertainment ( and maybe some frustration in the later levels ). and with the fourth episode added on, ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", you will be working on it for days, or maybe even weeks! The only downside is that it doesn't run well on most modern computers,  so you'll have to download a compatibility mod . I use GZDoom, and it works great, but there are others out there, like chocolate DOOM. overall this game is a must have for everyone, even if it's not on sale, because it's just that great.

												Doom is THE Orginal FPS shooter. The game has the Doom guy fight his way through the pits of hell, as you are the last defense against these satanic mutants. The ultimate doom comes with ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", which sounds cool, but is difficult as HELL (See what I did there?). Also, note to first time players: SHIFT is sprint, and theres no looking up or down, just in a 360 Degree circle. 10 Pentagrams out of 10 for awesome, intense and scary gameplay, and exisiting.

DOOM!As old as it may be, this game has aged quite well compared to many other FPS games. Even despite its age it still feels unique and once you get used to mouse controls, feels so very tight and responsive.It's a great game to throw yourself back into the days before cover shooting and rechargable health/shields and quicktime events and linear cooridoor level design. You'll find yourself seeking out each secret to get the most badass weapons. You could play at your own pace: carefully exploring every step of the way to survive or just simply running out guns blazing, leaving a trail of destruction in your wake.WARNING: This game will leave you wanting more in your other FPS; something more than Bay-esque scripted explosions, something more than NPCs running around you to shoot the things you're stuck on. Luckily there is DOOM II to fill that itching desire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom is easily one of my favorite games and by far is one of the most fun first person shooters of all time. For those of you who do not know doom is the grandaddy of all first person shooters but the first was wolfenstein 3d. However doom was what sparked peoples interest in the genre and the concept. Since dooms release their have been mods, sequels, etc. but I do not know if anything will beat the classic doom.  The game has no multiplayer but its singleplayer is fairly simple and a load of fun. Demons from hell have taken over mars and it is up to you to prevent the demons from reaching earth. Alltogether it is very violent so not for kids, but you will have to be the one to make that call for sure. Obviously you will end up in very satanic locations so it is not for the very faint of heart. By todays standards it is not so scary of a horror game but you have to take note it was made in the 1970s. I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone who likes comics, firstperson shooters, action movies and all you halo fans! enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply brilliant, yet largely overlooked these days by modern FPSes. While not a perfect game in terms of controls, this was one of the pioneer FPSes and remains a classic of the genre. I absolutely love it. The music is amazing and really has that 90s-nostalgia feel to it. The monsters are neat and unique, and the feeling you get after killing them is a wonderful feeling. The weapon arsenal is highly varied as well, with weapons of increasing power becoming obtainable later on in the game.I highly recommend it for anyone out there that plays modern FPSes and is interested in an older gaming experience, or simply someone who wants to find out what FPSes were like when they were first starting out.

Everything is exactly as I remember it and I hope that it never changed.To anyone who has not played this I would hightly recommend it as shows how far gaming has come, it also gives any older gamer true nostalgia, I knew I had it as soon as I booted it up.God bless this game and all who play it with passion.In other words I love it and hope you would too.

												When our cities have all turned to dust, and aliens come to excavate the ruins of our existence to study and measure our worth against the great, endless timeline of the cosmos, they will find Doom to be our first, last, and only great achievement. In time, it will outlive even them, its singular perfection continuing onward until the universe spins into eventual heat death and becomes nothingness. Only this game will remain, proving that when id Software says it's the ""ultimate"" Doom, they really meant it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic. While the horror has worn out nowadays, the gameplay is still very fun. It's not too hard to pick up and play, as it's basically ""Shoot things and pick up keys"". Don't expect a riveting plot. There are ""cutscenes"" at the end of the episodes but they're mainly very basic and slightly snarky.A recommendation I have is to download a source port (EG. ZDoom or Zandronum) so you can try the mods. The mods are the main things that keep me coming back. While the game itself is fair enough, the mods just add to the fun. Especially ones that replace weapons and monsters. Heck, I've made a few myself.Expect lots of pixelated and cheesy gore with satanism that looks like stuff out of a 90s rock band. While back in the day it was shocking, it's mainly kind of corny. It doesn't effect the gameplay value, however.Anyways, this is a good game and you should try it. If you like FPSes and don't just limit yourself to modern day shooters like CoD, you might like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Vel det her er jo sådan set det spil som alle andre FPS'er prøver på at efterligne, men vil man have den ægte varer så er der faktisk kun Doom at spille BaneDesign, Monster design og Fans har gjort dette til et MUST HAVE og historie i menneskets historie, check blandt andet BrutalDoom ud for at få en hel ny oplevelse af det gamle doom. anbefaler også at gå ind på doomworld der er meget nyt og rigtig spændende at hente til doom. Spillet i sig selv er fantaktisk banerne er spækket med hemligheder og puzzles der kan løses hvis man gider. Men selve kerne spillet bliver aldrig kedeligt de samme monster er sjove at dræbe gang på gang og hver monster har en funktion i spillet der gør alle udfordringerne interessante og varierende. Skal du prøve et FPS i verden så vælg Doom. det er noget af det sjoveste i Coop , Banerne er i verdens klasse og musikken er heller ikke dårlig med referencer til kendte metal numre. er der for alvor skabt action.

												The granddaddy of all First Person Shooters. Wolfenstein 3D may have invented the genre, but Doom perfected it. Calling yourself a gamer and not having Doom in your collection is blasphemy, simply put. Regardless if you're an old school gamer looking to relive those classic PC gaming moments, or the new generation of gamer who never had the opportunity to play, make it a part of your collection. Controls updated for precision mouse / keyboard controls, but has the option for classic keyboard only for you hardcore types out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With the Original 1993 and 1994 versions of Doom 1 and 2. If you buy Doom 1 and 2, get the Source Ports (Zandronum) Or (GZDoom) to play these classics. Its a waste of time playing them the way they are because the controls are outdated and the Source Ports make the game a lot more easier to use and make the game look a tiny bit more clear. If you truely want the most Ultimate Doom Experience I recomend getting the Brutal Doom Mod for (Zandronum) or (GZDoom) Happy Killing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With all of the first person classics I have played lately. Games like Team Fortress 2, Metroid other M, and the many games with first person moments in game.  You really learn to appreciate where stuff had its real start.   Sure the graphics are really dated by today's standereds. The game play is simple, and the story well, isn't really needed.  You are here, You have a pistol, You see tons of fellow characters dead on the floor, and everything is trying to kill you.  You are awesome, so you Fight back. This game has alot of the elements used in modern games.  Mini maps, Changing weapons such as the pistol, Shotgun, and my personal fave, the Chain gun.   To a lesser extent there is the worry about ammo loss, You dont regenerate so you actually have to watch your health amount and Armor remaining.   To be honest this game is actually alot harder now that I played games like Halo and Tf2.     I honestly belive that any fan of FPS games be it Tf2, those army COD games, or just shooters in general should come and try this and maybe Quake too.   IF for nothing else than to see the place here FPS REALLY began. [I have played Wolfen stein.. and yes it was first.. but Doom is FAR better in my opinion.]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you remember DOOM? The old grandpa of first person shooters? Well I don't. I wasn't born when it came out. But in the year of 2009 I found out about this miraculous game. Amazing graphics (For 1993 at least), challenging pussles, incredibly frustratingly difficult levels that keep you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off enough so that you can't let the game win. Well, at least if you play on ''ULTRA VIOLENCE'' like I do. If you wanna have a walk in the park then the lower difficulties keep you entertained enough. The controls can feel a bit slow on the default settings but everything can be tweaked if you use the GZdoom sourceport. Doesn't matter which sourceport you use but for the love of god make sure you use one as the game is ugly and plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥in normal DOSbox mode. (It's just a program you download to up the resolution a bit, lots of other stuff and to get support for the incredibly popular mod ''Brutal DOOM''.) Even if you generally don't like fps games I truly recommend you try this piece of gaming history. Trust me, this is not anything like Call of Copy or Battlefield. So do yourself a favor and try the original game that set the world on fire. And if you don't, well, there's a dimensional shambler around that corner!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Such a great game, DOOM is classic game that everyone knows, especially since it really got the fps genre famous. this is DEFINITELY worth it's 5.00 dollar price. this game offers hours of entertainment ( and maybe some frustration in the later levels ). and with the fourth episode added on, ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", you will be working on it for days, or maybe even weeks! The only downside is that it doesn't run well on most modern computers,  so you'll have to download a compatibility mod . I use GZDoom, and it works great, but there are others out there, like chocolate DOOM. overall this game is a must have for everyone, even if it's not on sale, because it's just that great.

												If you plan on buying this, unless you are getting this for nostalgia's sake and want to play it in Dosbox (Steam will open Dosbox and run Doom inside it when you click play), I would suggest getting a sourceport such as Zandronum or GZDoom and playing Doom from there. The options are a lot more customizable and you can do things like enable jumping, crouching, freelook (The original Doom engine didn't allow players to look up and down), and lots more. What's even better are the mods and their ease of use with a sourceport. My favorite by far is Brutal Doom by Sgt.Mark IV which makes the game 10x more violent than the original and a lot faster paced. Blowing off limbs and heads of demons is just a small part of what this mod contains. I've probably put more than 100 hours into Brutal Doom and it never gets old. It brings Doom up to modern standards of games and yet it leaves the original charm of Doom intact. John Romero, the lead designer for Doom gave it his approval and even showed it at the 20th anniversary party of Doom that he held. So if you get this game, be sure to get Brutal Doom for it as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can't run Ultimate Doom then look up something called ""ZDoom"" its a source a port that takes your game files and places them in the ZDoom folder and enables you to play in high resolutions and have no issues at all.So if you feel like smashing your computer and feel like selling them game because it won't work.Trust me search ZDoom and download it.just click on the exe and it will tell you to select your Doom game (Doom,Doom 2,Ultimate Doom etc) and it will work.It is also fully legal.The thing that shocks me today is that a 1993 old school fps game can still scare the crap out of me.It is extremely fun to blast away monsters and demons with a shotgun and then spray some undead humans with a machine gun.Thats why this game works and thats why people still love this today.Its the fact that its so simple yet so addictive and thats why it worked in 1993 because their wasn't anything as realistic or fun as Doom.It changed the way that games was aimed at mature audiences and the way it made you feel like you were in a virtual reality.The difficulty is hard if your used to the ""Your Hurt,Take cover!"" Call Of Duty staple.So there might be a slight difficulty spike.But if you like FPS games or like games in general and you want to try something new then buy this game and enjoy a real milestone in FPS history.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												its an amazing classic game. but if you want to open the game on windows 8 and make it work do the following:Run it in compatibility mode for Windows 95Then you have to edit both the Ultimate.conf and Ultimatem.conf files to change this:fullscreen=falseThen look down a little further and change this:waitonerror=falseBOTH files have these settings and BOTH files must be changed AND be the same.If those dont work do this too:fulldouble=falsein both ultimate.conf and ultimatem.conf.Now when the game starts, to use fullscreen just hit Alt+Enter.

												With DOSbox (the DOS emulator that the game comes with), the game is... Okay at best. The controls are awkward as all hell because you are forced to turn your character with the arrow keys. ""Why can't you aim with the mouse?"" you may ask, well, you can... Except the mouse also makes your character move forward and backward by one step. Why that's even a thing, I have no idea. You shoot your weapons with Control, and let me tell you, that WILL cramp your fingers after a while. Furthermore, you can't remap the controls, which means you're stuck with a control scheme that is more awkward than Miley Cyrus trying to twerk (though that isn't DOSbox's fault, that's just how the game is). The game will also runs at no higher than 30 FPS (if that) with DOSbox, so you could have a bloody Titan X and it would still run like my old laptop (i.e. like s%#@). Overall, Doom running on DOSbox is not a very rewarding experience. A more listy version of this review:PROS:The game runsCONS:Controls cannot be remappedCapped framerateCannot aim with mouseGame runs poorly overallThough the game's performance with DOSbox may make you want to be dead, fear not, as there is something better. Zandronum is another means of running the game. And let me tell you, it's almost as good as I imagine getting to massage Gaben's soft, luscious nipples would be. Doom running on Zandronum is absolute blissful, euphoric perfection, and that's no exaggeration. Zandronum basically modernizes the features of the game, while keeping the core gameplay intact. With Zandronum, you can aim with the mouse and edit your control scheme. The framerate will not be capped either, which means the game will run at upwards of 75 FPS. It even runs like a dream on the base model of Intel HD Graphics (32 MB of dedicated RAM? Daf*q?)! What's more, you can download the Brutal Doom mod. Brutal Doom changes the weapons, new enemy death animations, and adds a gut-wrenching amount of blood and gore (it drips from the CEILING, for Gaben's sake). Zandronum also gives you the option to use either the original graphics engine or OpenGL, which will make everything look smoother, as well as add some modernized lighting effects that a PC from 1994 would have blown up trying to render. A more listified version of this review is as follows:PROS:Uncapped framerateMouse aimingCOMPLETELY customizable control schemeAbility to use the Brutal Doom modRuns beautifully, even on weak hardwareOverall experience comparable to giving Gaben a nipple massageCONS:Makes you think of Gaben, which will render you far too randy to be able to focus on the game12/10 - would rub Gaben's nips again... and again... and again... and aga........

												This game is a hella lot more fun than any modern cover or cinematic shooter. I heard a great quote about DOOM: ""Cover exists to prevent you from continuesly shooting your enemies. The action is fast paced and you barely get a breather. This is no corridor shooter so if you easily get lost be prepared to use your map. A lot. Personally I would recommend using the Brutal DOOM and metal doom mods to really bring this into a modern light. If sprites are what is required to make a shooter this badass and this fun then Ill take sprites over 3d models any day. Still need convincing? check out this gameplay footage: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUnlq7Yy0b5OgHUeNGo6DjKfAkvDpENbREven without mods this game is really fun to play. I would  suggest finding a different emmulator like gzdoom cuz the one that come with steam is kinda crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Enough of COD and Battlefield. This is where it's really at.It'a great deal too, for $6 you can play all the levels of DOOM 1 and with an all new episode. So go ahead. Who cares about graphics and multiplayer and all that. Doom ingnores all of it and has what really matters. A fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This may sound strange, but I've never played the original DOOM (or really any DOOM title) until now. But I figured I wanted to play the title that cemented the FPS genre as we know it today, and also have a**loads of fun.However, I'm not one who gives titles free passes just because they're ""historic"" or ""influential"". You can tell me about how important Super Mario Bros. was for saving the video game industry from crashing in 1985, but I'll simply reply, ""It's still just a platformer with no real substance. It's fun, I'll give you that, but there's not much to it."" And that's the same argument I'll make with DOOM. There is no cohesive narrative. You just run from level to level, shooting demons in the face until their faces explode from the amount of lead you pump into them. Again, it's really, really fun... it just lacks enough substance to be considered substantial compared to the more narrative FPS games of today.Now, don't think for a second that I hate DOOM. Because I don't. Much like Super Mario Bros., DOOM is fast-pasted, aesthetically pleasing, and incredibly addicting and fun. I enjoyed the weekend I spent wasting my time getting to the Spider-Demon.However, there are some problems that popped up while I was played. In my very brief Half-Life review, I commented on how Gordon Freeman hovered and slid a bit. DOOM must have started that trend, because controlling Doomguy is a pain in the a**, especially when running across a ledge and being shot at, where I'd normally fall back down into the pit of lava or poison I had just come from. The level design can also be a bit cryptic. I didn't mind the first three Episodes, they were pretty straightforward. But Episode Four took all the conventions of its predecessors and threw them out the window. I like consistency in my games, is what I'm saying. I like to know that the game is following its own established rules.Other than that, there's isn't much standing in my way for recommending this game. It's an old 1990's PC FPS classic, and I certainly think anyone who loves Call of Duty, Battlefield, or Halo should go back and check out the game that started it all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic game from a simpler time before day 1 DLC, always online requirements, big budgets and forgettable storylines, DOOM still stands up as a boatload of fun.   The premise is simple.  You are a space marine trapped on an installation on the Martian moon Phobos.  Something has happened to turn all of your fellow marines into zombies, and daemons have been unleased.  Everything wants to kill you in some horrible way.  Pick up some weapons from wherever you can find them and kill everything in site before it kills you.  The gameplay still stands up after all this time, however compared to a modern game, the controls feel quite clunky.  Due to limitations in the game engine, you cannot for example, look up.  In the steam version you do get the option to re-map the forward / back / strafe left and right from the ""traditional"" arrow key controls to the more familiar WASD keys.  So you will use the mouse to look left and right, and fire your weapon.  The space bar is the catch all key to open doors; operate switches and levers etc...  I had DOSBox already installed on my PC for some other classic games, so I don't know if you need to have this already in order to run it, or if Steam will take care of this for you.  The game was originally coded to run on the MS-DOS operating system, and the fact that it runs at all on a modern Windows OS is pretty neat.  DOSBox is a free DOS emulator which you can install to run DOS applications (such as games) on your Windows PC.  A simple Google search can turn it up. One thing I have found is that the graphics in the game will occasionally glitch out and stop displaying properly.  Saving, quitting out and restarting seem to fix the issue.  The fact that it is running at all is a bit of a triumph, so this is really a minor issue.Perhaps the best thing about DOOM, and something that still shines through in this version is the sound and music.  The music is simple, but at the same time it's one of the best soundtracks for a game ever.  It manages to crank up the tension so well that the game is still able to make you jump out of your seat when a daemon shrieks at you from a darkened corridor and launches a fireball in your face.   The sound effects are some of the best ever put into a game.  The visceral feeling of the sound of cocking and unloading the shotgun has never been matched   in any other game since, IMHO. My only other minor complaint with this version is the apparent lack of multi-player support.  The game itself is great on its own, but most of my best memories of playing DOOM where sitting around the flat in uni with my flatmates and our PC's connected via NULL Modem links playing death matches until the wee hours of the morning.  I believe DOOM 2 had support for IPX/SPX connections.  I've not seen anything to that effect in this version, so perhaps it's no longer an option.  Which is a bit of a shame.Bottom line, should you buy this game if you've never played DOOM before?  In short, yes you should.  Just don't expect it to be anything like a modern FPS shooter.  This game was an evolution from Castle Wolfenstien, and was incredible for its day, and it's still a blast to play, however you need to expect that the graphics are going to look dated and that the controls are nowhere near as smooth and intuitive as in a modern game.

												Almost every FPS game released today owes their very existence to DOOM in some way or another. Most gamers have heard about DOOM. A legendary title that shaped the industry. Companies had to write up rules preventing it's workers from playing DOOM during work hours. It is estimated that DOOM was installed on over 10 million computers back in the day. Today it may look dated and old but the gameplay holds strong and the feeling you get playing it never gets old. This is another must play for any 90's FPS fan. Rip and tear indeed.

												I first cut my teeth on the 32bit PlayStation, with Ultimate Doom/Doom II then later on windows 98 PC. But its just how I remember it. I use Joytokey to get what I consider the best way to play Ultimate Doom with a pad. Its about the only time you'll hear me recommending a pad on a FPS over the mouse and keyboard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you fix it with Brootal Doom, or use the Doomsday engine app. This is a must have. Doom is by far the best shooter/FPS game ever. Period. My all time favorite game and series above so many others. I can't wait for 4. Fallout is the only other game I hold so dearly and close to my heart. And Doom is just a bit better than that to me but I love them both to a huge extent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The best FPS game I have ever played is amazing and works on almost any computer (even the crappy/non beefy ones) and plays exactly like it did on the SNES and N64 originally. Level design is amazing. There is a guide called ""READ THIS!"" to help with the various control methods. There's even an option to launch the game with the classic control scheme if you prefer that.

												What do I say, one of the first and one (if not) the best fps made. If you you like retro style games, or fps then this is the game to play. To some the graphics may be ""dated"", but this was maded with the most up to date technology at the time (1993) 21 YEARS AGO. It is still a fun, and challengeing game that has aged well, so in all a treasure in gameing, and a treasure to play. but beauties in the eye of the beholder, u deside. It didn't work at first on my windows 8 so i looked for a tutorial, this video helped me to get it to work, best of luck to you,all credit goes to cobradvs for video i just found it

												Consider it a very mildly positive recommendation.The game itself sure deserves to be played as the cult classic it is, but I assume you already know what to expect already and want to know if you should buy it on Steam.Well, there are reasons for you to do it, and also reasons against.To begin with, if you absolutely want to get the original game without resorting to piracy, I'm not sure you can get a digital copy anywhere else than on Steam, so you don't really have a choice. (Otherwise, you have plenty of easy ways to get your hands on this game.)I must say, giving Steam users the opportunity to play and rediscover this great game series is commendable. It's however handled rather poorly. Basically, you will pay 10 bucks (do yourself a favor and buy the Classic Complete package if you're going to buy this game anyways) for an emulated version of the original game running through an outdated version of DOSBox, while there are a lot of source ports doing hell of a better job for free.Now, I personnally don't have any issue with this (hence, the positive recommendation), and besides a few graphical glitches when I sometimes alt+tabbed in full screen mode, the game worked perfectly fine in this state. Judging by the negative reviews, though, the version of DOSBox it's running on isn't compatible with Windows 8 and requires messing with the game files in order to even launch.Being an emulated game also means the max. available resolution is rather low, and it will upscale pretty badly if you want to go full screen on modern monitors. But you're not looking for HD graphics on this game, are you?So be warned that while I recommend it from my personal experience, said experience may vary greatly depending on your OS.If you lived in a cave the past 20+ years or are too young to remember audio tapes, VHS and floppy disks, you might need a brief introduction that will help you know what you're stepping into.DOOM is mainly known for popularizing the FPS genre, along with Wolfenstein 3D, and, later on, Quake - to a point that the FPS genre was more often called DOOM-like and Quake-like than First Person Shooter. If you're an FPS lover who enjoys mindless fun and excessive brutality, games like Unreal, Duke Nukem 3D, or modern games like Bulletstorm and the new Shadow Warrior, you have to add DOOM and DOOM II to your list of played games.Now, if you're coming from a modern FPS background, you're in for quite a shock gameplay-wise. No mouse look (not even looking up or down, which can be tricky when shooting enemies up on platforms or down a set of stairs), no crosshair to target enemies, no reloading, and very basic movements. You can only go forward/backward, turn left/right, and run - forget about crouching, jumping, walking slowly, or even strafing. Well, there is strafing, but it will require you to use turn left/right keys while holding another key, which is quite counter-intuitive when you're not used to it. This game actually plays a lot better with a gamepad provided you have the third-party tool to activate gamepad support.If you still want to enjoy this game without going through the chore of adapting to the peculiar control scheme of the time, I recommend using Chocolate DOOM to play this game (check out the Steam forum to see how to install it). This source port is as close as it can get to the original experience, while keeping the comfort of some modern features like strafing and mouse look (you will only able to look left or right, but that's already something), and also fixing some lighting issues the Steam version got (some areas that are supposed to be pitch black are only a lot darker in this version).tl;drI recommend the game itself, but as it goes for the Steam version, make sure it works on your OS by checking out the negative reviews before buying, and take the Classic Complete package because the asking price for the game alone is too high for what it is (the original game running on an outdated DOS emulator).DOOM is a great game if you like mindless shooting, and going for 100% (all secrets/items/kills) and speed runs on each level is very fun for those who are looking for an extra challenge after completing the game once.

												Doom/Doom II is one of my favorite games of all time.  It combines horror, shoot-em-up, sci-fi and occult themes into what was one of the most violent games created.  More importantly, it's fun.  Without any ""realistic"" features seen today (run stamina, weapon reloading, auto-life regen, jumping), Doom provides the high-octane thrill of running through tech facilities blowing up any demon you come across.  But that's not to say the game is all about rampant killing.  Most of the levels are built to be a subtle puzzle, having you search for keys and switches to find a path to the exit door.  Additionally, each level has at least one secret room/closet/pathway that leads to bonus gear to greatly help you on your way.  And despite the pixilated look (by today's standards) of the game, I firmly believe that Doom's graphics stand up very well today and provide just the right level of nostalgia for a game made in 1994.  Highly recommended.  Even if you don't beat it, at least give the first few levels a try.  They're still free via shareware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom was another first person shooter that played an important role in the gaming community. Released just a year after Wolfenstein 3D, this game has similar traits except with a sense of movement on the camera, more 3-D depth on the levels, and added shadows. The plot is about a last surviving space marine who must escape from a marine base on the planet Mars that is being over run by demons and mutated marines. There are various weapons and items to collect in order to aid you on your survival. There's even an option to heighten the difficulty of the game for those who want more of a challenge. Two years after this game was released in 1993, an estimated 20 million copies have been sold, and various ""Doom"" clones and that is when the first person shooter genre officially became a thing in the gaming industry. Doom would become a very well known title that even non-gamers would immidiately know what it is without playing it. The success lead to a few sequals and updated versions of the game such as the ""Ultimate"" edition which is basically the same game only with an additional episode to it. So if you liked the Wolfenstein game, this is a must play game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would highly recommend this game to essentially everyone execpt for those who have no clue how to use mods and even struggle following instructions.  First of all THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK IMMEDIEATLY AFTER DOWNLOAD.  This is very important because if youwish to just play this game vanilla then there are probably cheaper copies elseware.  However if you plan to download Zandronum and Brutal Doom then you will the legal version of the game.  I highly recommend playing through the game first in vanilla as soom mods (Brutal Doom) tend to get alot of blood on the walls and this may cover important objectives such as a switch that opens the final door.  I'll be honest I'm a new commer to Doom and God is it awesome.  I have no nostalgia for it, I just have fun because it is a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not the first FPS game it is where most people started.There were console versions such as SNES,32x,3DO,Jaguar,Playstation,Sega Saturn,GBA,Xbox 360 and PS3 none of them hold a candle to the PC version all the other ones either have no music,no good music,poor quality,poor framerate or just plain sucks I even have problems with the console versions that I didn't get with the PC versions such as in the SNES version I can't get past the third level because of the poor framerate.Although the 3DO version has the best music in my opinion the PC version is the best version mainly because first person shooters just control better on the PC because you can use the mouse to aim rather than using the right analog sticks on controllers and it is great to have an optional episode known as ""Thy Flesh Consumed""Pros.Good ControlGood VisualsGood GameplayThy Flesh Consumed episodeCons.Average Music when compared to 3DO and SNES versionsThe need of DOSBOXDOSBOX is quite faulty and can crash at any timeTHOSE DARN DOSBOX GRAPHICAL GLITCHES!!!If you want to eliminate the DOSBOX stuff download ZDoom or GZDoom.

												To be Honest... The Steam Version of the Orginal ID Software's DOOM Series... REALLY SUCKS Compared to the PC Versions of the Game... The Graphics don't look Sharp-N-Clear as in the PC MS-DOS & Windows Versions of the different Games... This Steam Version looks like I'm Playing the Game on the SEGA Gensis 32X... Even Though the 32X Version had some Good Points for me better than the PC Version... Such as the Music has different Variations... Along with Nightmare Mode is just a Regular Round that was Harder than Ultra-Violence Mode... Try Starting out of the Level 7 Elevator on the 32X in Nightmare Mode with just a Pistol along with No other Weapons through the whole Level... Heck the Original X-Box Versions of the ID Software DOOM Series Look closer to the PC Versions of the Game... As far as the Music goes on these Steam Versions... It's Okay... As most all of the DOOM Series all seem to have different Takes for Soundtracks... Depends on what Platform you are Playing it on... Plus it depends on what Type of Sound Card you have as well as what Settings etc... Spent 15 Bucks here on Steam for the Complete DOOM Set... Mainly just to have on this Platform... Only I'm not sure I would Recomend the Steam Versions of the ID Software DOOM Series to other Steam Players... Only for myself... I'll give it a Thumbs Up... Just because I've Probably Played it on all of the different Platforms... Only I still Think the Graphics could have been better			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game remains the epitome of what FPS games should be. A benchmark for all companys seeking to create a fully featured shooter. Doom has a wide range of weapons, excellent combat, it's challenging, and immensly fun. Even to modern standards, it kicks♥♥♥♥♥ In it's time, there was nothing like it. Guns guns guns and monsters. Blood, guts, glory, and the salvation of the human race. It goes without saying, if you love FPS games and haven't played Doom even once, you aren't doing it right. This game is a MUST for all FPS lovers. Learn some history about your favorite genre while you blast away at demons with your trusty shotgun. Experience the game that created and shaped a whole new niche of gaming. I can go on forever about this game. It truly is, and will forever be, an incredible game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom is easily one of my favorite games and by far is one of the most fun first person shooters of all time. For those of you who do not know doom is the grandaddy of all first person shooters but the first was wolfenstein 3d. However doom was what sparked peoples interest in the genre and the concept. Since dooms release their have been mods, sequels, etc. but I do not know if anything will beat the classic doom.  The game has no multiplayer but its singleplayer is fairly simple and a load of fun. Demons from hell have taken over mars and it is up to you to prevent the demons from reaching earth. Alltogether it is very violent so not for kids, but you will have to be the one to make that call for sure. Obviously you will end up in very satanic locations so it is not for the very faint of heart. By todays standards it is not so scary of a horror game but you have to take note it was made in the 1970s. I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone who likes comics, firstperson shooters, action movies and all you halo fans! enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The shame is that it is shrouded in the shadow of many modern shooters such as Call of Duty and Halo. Doom should be bought and played by all modern shooter fans to see where their favorite shooters gained its popularity and gamers in general should buy this game for its challenging stages and many hidden secrets.

												One of my all time favourate games. A classic. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this game? Nothing. It is just purely amazing, I grew up with this kind of game and even today it is still one of the best I have ever played. A lot of modern games could learn a lot from looking at what made games from the 90's so fantastic.If you like this try the rest of the Doom franchise, Heretic, Hexan, Duke Nukem 3D. Another 90's game I loved was Carmageddon.The 90's were just amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, just wow I have to say. This game is... I just... Words can't explain it. This game is the best FPS I've ever played. It beats that COD crap out there because that is just a bunch of screaming seven year olds telling you how many no scooped headshots they got, and they act like we care. If I had the choice to play this or COD for the rest of my life I'd pick this. Let's just be honest shooting demons is 100x better than hearing a seven year old scream at the top of his lungs "" NO SCOOPE!!!!!!!!

												This is the first game in the DOOM series. The reason it is called ""the ultimate doom"" is because alle the episodes are included. Doom consists of four episodes, three episodes that makes up the main storyline, pluss an extra fourth episode.The Doom series is a must have for a PC-gamer born in or before the 90's. This is buy far one of the best first person shooters out there, and is therfore highly recomended. For me, and probably for a lot of other people, this game is packed with action and nostalgia.If you are running windows 7/8 you will need to run this game in compability mode for windows ""XP (service pack 3)"". To do this, go to: Steam>SteamApps>common>Ultimate Doom>base. In this folder you should see the dosbox.exe. Rightclikk it and go to properties. Clikk compability in the top tab. Check ""Run this program in compability mode for"" And choose: Windows XP (service pack 3) in the dropdown menu.For further inprovement you can change the configurationfiles for Dosbox and Doom. The configurationfiels are called: dosbox.conf, ultimate.conf and ultimatem.conf. Open the files with notepad to make your changes. If you are changing annything in this files make sure you set the same values in all three files. If you screew up with theese files, just uninstall and reinstall the game and they should be back to their default setting. In the dosbox.conf file all the different values are explained.

												Simply brilliant, yet largely overlooked these days by modern FPSes. While not a perfect game in terms of controls, this was one of the pioneer FPSes and remains a classic of the genre. I absolutely love it. The music is amazing and really has that 90s-nostalgia feel to it. The monsters are neat and unique, and the feeling you get after killing them is a wonderful feeling. The weapon arsenal is highly varied as well, with weapons of increasing power becoming obtainable later on in the game.I highly recommend it for anyone out there that plays modern FPSes and is interested in an older gaming experience, or simply someone who wants to find out what FPSes were like when they were first starting out.

												I won't lie. I was skeptical about Doom. I thought it was a piece of nostalgia that was rated to highly because it was old. But I can say confidently that this game is FUN AS HELL (pardon the pun). How do you describe Doom? Well, I can try. You shoot things. And by god is it fun. Like, (un)holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's fun. You run through different levels shooting baddies that are either people or demons from hell! You may be thinking that this game is just pixelated COD or something. Well it isn't. I cannot express the grin on my face when I picked up the gatling gun or the rocket launcher. The adrenaline that went through me when I mowed down demons while keeping a close eye on my health. But most people have heard about how great Doom was. You want to know if it holds up. And it does. Each level is expertly designed to make you think about which  way to go. The combat is fast paced and satisfying. The gore is charming in that old fashioned way. The difficulty is nothing to laugh at to. Do you want to feel genuinely terrified that each step may lead into the jaws of an angry demon? Do you want to curse at every missed shot and scour for ammo hoping to find enough bullets to fight off the demons chasing you? Remember, this was in the 90s. Back then, their easy was our hardcore. Everything was difficult as hell (there it is again). And Nightmare on Doom was grueling even by their standards. Every moment while in combat is pure and utter fun. Every baddie slain is like a scene form Fury Road. Now does it have it's flaws? Of course. Plenty. The movement feels very strange at times, some of the controls are questionable and it can't tab out. But these are all flaws inherent with age. This was back when computers ran on DOS. It's going to have a few difficulties when running on a platform that was the ♥♥♥♥ing future when it was released. Windows 10 belonged only in Back To The Future. But strangely enough, it runs beautifully performance wise. Better than most games infact. It's only 5$ too. There is very little reason not to buy this if you are not a fan of gaming. It's a staple. It's up there with Wolfenstein, Mario and Tetris. It's a classic. It's DOOM.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never played the original DOOM games, but ever since Steam sold these games, I gave them a try and I have been missing out. I was never born at that year when the original DOOM came out, but this is a true First Person Shooter classic. The controls are a bit confusing, considering that this game came out at 1993. But I'm getting the hang of the controls. The game is challenging, exploration is a must, especially if you want to progress further and for those who want experiance a true First Person Shooter game. BUY THIS GAME! If you haven't, then SHAME ON YOU! It's also pretty cheap, for a good price. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I possibly say about the original classic that hasn't already been said countless times before? It possesses a timeless @$$kickery that no matter how many times I return to it over the years it never seems to lose it's flavor. Much like Duke Nukem 3D I've played it on more consoles and handhelds than I can even recall anymore, both in homebrew and official ports. There's enough source ports of the PC version alone these days to make your head spin and more customizable options than you can shake a boomstick at (oh, did I mention controller support, multiplayer, etc. too?)So grab one of the source ports (or play vanilla with the supplied dosbox if you prefer and can work out the kinks with a modern PC...hit the guides and forums if you have any troubles or need help with ports/mods), I've been using ZDoom personally (which also has some variations depending on your needs), and get your fill of ULTRA VIOLENCE. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd like to think most gamers at least know what Doom is all about and why people like it, but I'll go ahead and lay it out.This is my favorite shooter game in the world, and one of my favorite games period. It nails the logical progression of difficulty in terms of enemy placement and quantity as well as map layout. This game is so replayable -- it's actually among the first few games people had the idea of speedrunning. If you're not out for speed, then you can kick the difficulty up a notch or try and get every secret. Every weapon has a distinct application (save for the handgun) and feels satisfying to use. Fantastic gunplay.The Doom engine itself is divine, one of the best I can think of. The game is as challenging as you want it to be, anywhere from♥♥♥♥♥♥easy (I'm too young to die!) to brutally hard (Nightmare)You can't ignore the music and graphics either. Some of the best, most appropriate game music and graphics that have aged incredibly well. The atmosphere in Doom is absolutely flawless. Never does the game fail to make me feel like I've got a monstrous task ahead of me. Sometimes you'll be anxious to activate a switch that is so obviously a trap and you don't know if you can make it out alive, but you have to activate it anyway if you want to progess. At others, you'll channel the badass nature of your space marine avatar and let nobody out of your clutches. You're supposed to feel like this is a hell (heh) of a task to take on, but also that you're exactly the man for the job, and that's exactly the feeling Doom gives me.With only select Bethesda ARPGs coming even close, Doom is probably the most modded game in the world. There are countless megaWADs, level packs, and gameplay-altering mods. And you can bet your sweet♥♥♥♥♥there's multiplayer mods available, each with level packs and gameplay mods of their own. Mods are coming out faster than you can probably play them, so don't worry about running out of content. With the base game and all these mods that have been coming out since the early '90s, anyone who gets a kick out of this game can easily get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of it.Basically, Doom is one of the most polished, most well-designed games on Earth (and Mars, and Hell) and I could play it forever.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll be honest, I never grew up with DOOM.  Heck, the first time I played DOOM was 10 years ago.  But, it did a great job at keeping me entertained for the weeks I put into it.  After a while, I found out that I could play DOOM with my friends online thanks to ZDaemon.org. Weeks of engaged interaction turned into months, and months into years.  This game is great, and should be played with your friends.  While you are at it, you might as well get DOOM II as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, despite showing its age, is very fun.As with most old shooters, this game is less forgiving if you screw up. At times, I found myself out of ammo facing demons with only minimal ammo because i wrecklessly used my ammo elsewhere. The game rewards you for exploring the maps with hidden ammo packs and powerups everywhere, but they're also protected with more demons.The backstory is provided in the manual, which isn't included with this game. Just look it up online. There's little explanation of the story in the game. It's literally all just running and gunning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												with a minor fix for newer graphics cards this game looks and feels so great! The new controls with the mouse and WASD make the game very fluent and enjoyable. I recommend this game for sure! It's a trip down memory lane for me. It holds a small corner of my childhood heart. to fix inverted colors and pink pixels replace the DOSBOX in the games directory with a downloadable program called GZDOOM [google it]. you must extract GZDOOM to the doom game folder, delete DOSBOX and rename GZDOOM to DOSBOX.

												The Classic DOOM shooters are by far the best fps's ever made.  I'm pretty sure this game was awesome when it was first realeased and it feels just as awesome as when i first played it.  It may be slightly dated (the first episode is pretty easy on any difficulty above *epic voice* ULTRA-VIOLENCE and you can't look up or down.  But thats kinda what makes it feel special.  People my age critisize this game for looking ""old""  and ""boring"".  The only thing i can say to that is ""The only people whp say that are the people who have never tried it.  In summary, this game and the entire classic collection (not including Doom 3) are masterpeices.  So get $5 and buy this game.*Protip* If you are running this on anything newer than Windows XP, go get zDOOM and Zandronum, they make it so you can run it.  http://zdoom.org/Downloadhttp://zandronum.com/*Protop2* once you get to the CyberDemon (the second and Awesomest boss battle in history) the best strategy is to pump it with lead until it falls into a pile of mush (this also works with every other enemy in the game)Overall Rating 999999999999999999999999999/10			",68,3,0,15,2,0,5

												What more is there to be said about one of the most iconic games in gaming history?Well perhaps that this is not just classic doom for you doom purists out there but it has the posibility to play using the mouse to aim witch is a nice gimmick but nothing new really but hey that's not why you buydoom, you buy it for that old skool feel of the good old day of gaming on a P166 (for me that was the case)and of course it let's newcommers to the series enyoy the solid gameplay of an epic classic shootfest that is doom without the hasle of emulation and all that jazz.If you played this back in the days or if you are new to gaming and want to check out where all modren FPS games have their roots look no further than doom.10/10!!!

The ultimate doom comes with ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", which sounds cool, but is difficult as HELL (See what I did there?). Also, note to first time players: SHIFT is sprint, and theres no looking up or down, just in a 360 Degree circle. 10 Pentagrams out of 10 for awesome, intense and scary gameplay, and exisiting.

												With all of the first person classics I have played lately. Games like Team Fortress 2, Metroid other M, and the many games with first person moments in game.  You really learn to appreciate where stuff had its real start.   Sure the graphics are really dated by today's standereds. The game play is simple, and the story well, isn't really needed.  You are here, You have a pistol, You see tons of fellow characters dead on the floor, and everything is trying to kill you.  You are awesome, so you Fight back. This game has alot of the elements used in modern games.  Mini maps, Changing weapons such as the pistol, Shotgun, and my personal fave, the Chain gun.   To a lesser extent there is the worry about ammo loss, You dont regenerate so you actually have to watch your health amount and Armor remaining.   To be honest this game is actually alot harder now that I played games like Halo and Tf2.     I honestly belive that any fan of FPS games be it Tf2, those army COD games, or just shooters in general should come and try this and maybe Quake too.   IF for nothing else than to see the place here FPS REALLY began. [I have played Wolfen stein.. and yes it was first.. but Doom is FAR better in my opinion.]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you remember DOOM? The old grandpa of first person shooters? Well I don't. I wasn't born when it came out. But in the year of 2009 I found out about this miraculous game. Amazing graphics (For 1993 at least), challenging pussles, incredibly frustratingly difficult levels that keep you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off enough so that you can't let the game win. Well, at least if you play on ''ULTRA VIOLENCE'' like I do. If you wanna have a walk in the park then the lower difficulties keep you entertained enough. The controls can feel a bit slow on the default settings but everything can be tweaked if you use the GZdoom sourceport. Doesn't matter which sourceport you use but for the love of god make sure you use one as the game is ugly and plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥in normal DOSbox mode. (It's just a program you download to up the resolution a bit, lots of other stuff and to get support for the incredibly popular mod ''Brutal DOOM''.) Even if you generally don't like fps games I truly recommend you try this piece of gaming history. Trust me, this is not anything like Call of Copy or Battlefield. So do yourself a favor and try the original game that set the world on fire. And if you don't, well, there's a dimensional shambler around that corner!			",67,2,0,8,8,0,1

												DOOM is a classic for a reason, and it's still a blast to play. The combat is fast-paced, visceral, and immensely satisfying. The levels are well-designed, and they are complex without being maze-like. There are a variety of enemies with different attacks and movement styles, and they range in toughness from annoying cannon-fodder zombies all the way to the giant, rocket-shooting, insanely deadly Cyberdemon. On top of all that, the sound effects, gore, and hellish imagery serve to create a sense of atmosphere that nicely rounds out the gameplay experience.The controls, and the inability to look up or down, give DOOM a slight learning curve for first-time players. However, with just a little practice you'll be fine. Additionally, mods like Brutal Doom bring a lot of cool new things to the DOOM experience, including modern FPS controls.Simply put, DOOM is a must-have game for anyone who's a fan of FPS games.

												This game, despite showing its age, is very fun.As with most old shooters, this game is less forgiving if you screw up. At times, I found myself out of ammo facing demons with only minimal ammo because i wrecklessly used my ammo elsewhere. The game rewards you for exploring the maps with hidden ammo packs and powerups everywhere, but they're also protected with more demons.The backstory is provided in the manual, which isn't included with this game. Just look it up online. There's little explanation of the story in the game. It's literally all just running and gunning.			",80,17,7,8,32,2,17

												Doom was one of the very first FPS and helped massivley progress the genre into one of the biggest video game genres out there. I had heard all this and much more about how amazong this game was yet I was hugley sceptical of the as I belived it must be alot of nostaliga that is affecting people view on the game. So I bought the game to try it out myself, at first I wasn't keen on it atall as im used to modern titles such as COD and battlefield. But onec I got into the game I realized I was have so much more fun than I did on say a call of duty campaign. The graphics are bad and you cant look up or down but it didn't affect me atall as the game is just so much fun. In reflection this game is one of my all time favourite FPS games and maybe even one of my top 10 games of all time, ok maybe im pushing it with top 10 games of all time as there are so many good games out there. I think I got my point accross though that this game is indeed an amazing game and not just a nostaliga throw back.The weapons are immesnsily satisiying especially the shot gun and the soundtrack is also fantastic, the levels are also laid out greatly. I would give this game a full 10/10 and think that this really is the ""classic"" that many deem it. I would recommend this to anyone.			",153,5,14,17,6,2,21

												Often referred to as the 'Father of FPS' (Wolfenstein 3D being the grandfather), DOOM by iD software is an absolute tour de force. 21 years later and it still holds its place as one of the greatest shooters of all time. The weapons feel good, sound and level design are top notch, and the nostalgia feels are off the chart. DOSbox has now been incorporated into this release, making it possible to run hassle free on basically any system. Pick this up and battle your way through the shores of hell.			",122,14,1,9,1,1,16

												Doom is proof that while technological supremacy is fleeting, good game design is forever. Twenty-plus years after its release, it still stands tall as one of the greatest first person shooters ever made, an orgy of twitchy bloody death and destruction matched only by its own sequel. All the game needs to make you forget it came out in the early 90's is a fresh coat of paint, and all it takes is a few free downloads to cover that. GZDoom ports the game engine to run natively on windows, instead of requiring DOSbox, and gives the game a host of modern conveniences features like fully 3D environment rendering, texture filtering, and most importantly, proper mouse look. Brutal Doom, probably one of the best and most comprehensive mods ever made, fills out the package by overhauling the soundtrack, adding buckets and buckets of gore, and rebalancing the gameplay to be faster and more intense than ever.If you're willing to take a few minutes to set it up properly, Doom is absolutely worth your time. It was great then, and thanks to twenty years of technical advancements and a somewhat overzealous fan community, it's even better now.			",302,76,4,62,25,3,53

												It's amusing why I'm writting this, since it's DOOM for ♥♥♥♥ sake, but I'll get to it. Anyway for those that have experienced this game all those years ago and haven't touched it since, I advise to pick it up, play, to relieve the nostalgia, then hop onto the mod scene for a kick in the nuts surprise. Anyway, it is one of the first FPS games that started the genre and got me interested in it. (Though to be fair Duke Nukem 3D was the real spark for me for shooters, and Quake was what got me into competitive MP portion of the genre).The vanilla experience is extremely dated, no proper aiming, clunky controls by today's standard, heavy reliance on auto aim and naturaly the primitive graphics. Even with all that I played the vanilla recently (though I ended up modding it via zdoom for better control scheme) and still was fun as ever. Secrets were ♥♥♥♥ well hidden (for those that I couldn't remember), shooting still felt great. Amusing how a primitive shooter like Doom can have such great shooting feeling. Enemies will flinch depending on guns, rockets will gib and blast stuff apart and BFG will clear rooms. The level design was fantastic, mazelike key hunting formula that made a lot of old games great, and put a large majority of modern games to shame when it comes to inteligent level design. While I had an absolute blast with Doom, and not just due to nostalgia, I encountered the large amount of fantastic mods. At first I take this with a grain of salt. Mods for games are peculiar, usually extremely specific, niche or such. Here or there there will be some that truly stand out. In Doom's case, good God are there a lot of great mods. I'm not going to rattle them off but I will mention one particular mod that enhances the experience to modern standars, and puts to shame almost every known FPS developer today. I'm talking about Brutal Doom mod. If you liked doom, any iteration of it, go look this up. It takes the entire old game/s and tuns it to 11 with gore, weapons, effects, sound and feeling. To me this mod made Doom game so much more in standard with current games. Doom already was a pinacle, had nothing to prove since it stood among the first and best, but with mods like this it really makes me ask: what the ♥♥♥♥ are current FPS devs doing. The original game is timleess, and while I admit there is some nostalgia there, there are still a lot of technical aspects (gameplay wise) that hold strong even 20 years after. With mods (like Brutal Doom), all bets are off, this is balls to the walls amazing value in a game that offers everything a shooter should have. Shooting is fun, satisfying, strategic, skill based, and no matter how much they throw at you you will want more to paint the walls with (that is quite literal in Brutal Doom's case).If you feel that game requires fancy graphics to be good, you are in the wrong game genre. This game right here does everything justice in terms of shooting, level exploration, wit, and just not giving a ♥♥♥♥. Go to hell, and make them sorry they ever heard of you.			",216,28,1,21,3,2,18

												So this is it- the infamous DOOM I've heard so much about. Don't be fooled by my six minute playtime- I've spent much, much longer running this masterpiece through ZDoom.This game may be older than I am, but holy hell (see what I did there?) it wipes the floor with modern FPS games.Graphics:Again, this game is older than I am.  You could run this thing on a printer.  However, that is no reason not to play this game.Gameplay:This game and Wolfenstein pioneered the FPS genre. Pick up guns, point, and blast demons back to the holes from whence they came. No crappy ADS system to assist you. Navigate through the level, find the key cards, and move on to the next level. Move around walls and press the activate button- you may just reveal a secret room filled with a treasure trove of power ups and weapons.Story:Eeeeeeeh. The game doesn't do too good a job of storytelling. It tells you that demons have emerged on Mars, and YOU (Doomguy) are the only survivor! From there on out, you singlehandedly rip their pixelated hides to bloody bits.Soundtrack:Do you like heavy metal? I sure as hell do. Your ears are treated to 8-bit repetitions of guitar riffs from the likes of Metallica and Pantera. Can't complain.Overall:If you haven't played this game, play it. Killing demons old-school is the only way to kill demons. This game gets a 9/10 from me.   ",140,7,0,17,12,0,6

												I was wrong about this game. I had trouble enjoying it, until I started playing it on easy mode through a third-party Doom engine like Doomsday or ZDoom. Doomsday has an option to disable the motion-sickness-inducing view bobbing, and has a map overlay that makes navigating the byzantine levels more fun for a modern gamer. Easy mode is built in to the regular game (there are 5 difficulty settings, and the default is the one in the middle), and I found it much more fun to treat the game like a shooting gallery in a maze (with a map that fills out as you go through the level) than a tough as nails, player versus the world hellscape.There are people who played Doom when it came out and still love the original game for what it is. The majority of current FPS gamers have never played it, but they should. Maybe they can't appreciate it in the same way as the original fans, but if they're like me they can still enjoy the incredible shooting mechanics. Among all first-person shooters, this game has one of the best and most satisfying to use shotguns, for example.			",170,85,8,10,15,3,29

												Such a great game, DOOM is classic game that everyone knows, especially since it really got the fps genre famous. this is DEFINITELY worth it's 5.00 dollar price. this game offers hours of entertainment ( and maybe some frustration in the later levels ). and with the fourth episode added on, ""Thy Flesh Consumed"", you will be working on it for days, or maybe even weeks! The only downside is that it doesn't run well on most modern computers,  so you'll have to download a compatibility mod . I use GZDoom, and it works great, but there are others out there, like chocolate DOOM. overall this game is a must have for everyone, even if it's not on sale, because it's just that great.

												I was wrong about this game. I had trouble enjoying it, until I started playing it on easy mode through a third-party Doom engine like Doomsday or ZDoom. Doomsday has an option to disable the motion-sickness-inducing view bobbing, and has a map overlay that makes navigating the byzantine levels more fun for a modern gamer. Easy mode is built in to the regular game (there are 5 difficulty settings, and the default is the one in the middle), and I found it much more fun to treat the game like a shooting gallery in a maze (with a map that fills out as you go through the level) than a tough as nails, player versus the world hellscape.There are people who played Doom when it came out and still love the original game for what it is. The majority of current FPS gamers have never played it, but they should. Maybe they can't appreciate it in the same way as the original fans, but if they're like me they can still enjoy the incredible shooting mechanics. Among all first-person shooters, this game has one of the best and most satisfying to use shotguns, for example.			",170,85,8,10,15,3,29

A lot of modern games could learn a lot from looking at what made games from the 90's so fantastic.If you like this try the rest of the Doom franchise, Heretic, Hexan, Duke Nukem 3D. Another 90's game I loved was Carmageddon.The 90's were just amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best FPS games of all time. It was so ahead of its time when it came out, that despite missing a lot of features found in modern FPS titles, Doom manages to make you forget all of those things and just shoot everything. If I were to complain about anything, it would be that Dosbox can be a little clunky at times. And the graphics are really good, they're just a bit blurry. Playing through ZDoom and getting rid of the jump button and crouch button, lets you enjoy the masterpiece in it's original glory without any blur. The game itself is also not very long for a first playthrough. I played on Ultra-Violence and it only took me about 10 hours. But the amount of time you're going to be spending replaying the game, trying to find every secret and the countless mods there are to play (both new single player maps and original game enhancements like Brutal Doom) will leave you with countless hours of entertainment.For anyone who hasn't played Doom and is worried about the graphics, just look up Doom Source Ports on Google, look up how to setup Steam to launch a source port through the library and good times are to be had with this masterpiece.

												What can I say about this game that hasn't been said a billion times over? The granddaddy of all first person shooters. The orignal, the classic, and arguably the best. This game remains the epitome of what FPS games should be. A benchmark for all companys seeking to create a fully featured shooter. Doom has a wide range of weapons, excellent combat, it's challenging, and immensly fun. Even to modern standards, it kicks♥♥♥♥♥ In it's time, there was nothing like it. Guns guns guns and monsters. Blood, guts, glory, and the salvation of the human race. It goes without saying, if you love FPS games and haven't played Doom even once, you aren't doing it right. This game is a MUST for all FPS lovers. Learn some history about your favorite genre while you blast away at demons with your trusty shotgun. Experience the game that created and shaped a whole new niche of gaming. I can go on forever about this game. It truly is, and will forever be, an incredible game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not sure if it's just for Windows 8 users, but I definitely had some trouble running this game as-is. I did finally manage to get it working (by hitting the home key right as DOSBox began and then going back into the game), but I ran into lag and sound issues.If anyone is experiencing any sort of problems with any Doom I or II games on Steam, the best way to fix it is to download ZDOOM (a newer engine that runs Doom just like it was played originally, but with higher resolution and more options) and copy all the files into the directory where ""dosbox.exe"" is. To get to the game's folder easier, you can just right click it from the Steam games list, click properties, and then find ""Browse local files..."". Delete the original dosbox.exe file, and then rename zdoom.exe to dosbox.exe, so Steam will recognize it and automatically run it for you every time. This will make sure it runs your Doom .wads on every computer without trouble. If this helped you, please give this review a thumbs up to help spread the word. Thanks! :) Anyways, that aside, onto the review:I'll make it short and sweet. Doom is one of the best first person shooter video games to this day. Wayyyy way back in the early 90s, id Software revolutionized the FPS genre with Wolfenstein 3D, and then ultimately cemented it into gaming as we know it with the release of the first Doom. It plays very well, even to this day (although you may have to adjust some controls for maximum precision and more comfort). You'll have fun running through each level, blasting zombies and imps to pieces with anything from a pistol to a shotgun, all the way to a chaingun or a BFG. Don't look the acronym up, kids. And those aren't all the weapons the game has, either. I won't spoil it for you, though. There are loads of enemies to do battle with, and all the levels are extremely complex. There will be doors opening behind you, keycards that you need to find in order to get to the next room, secret hidden hallways, etc. The music is perfect in all its MIDI glory. The modding community has always been faithful. Check out Brutal Doom if you want to know what I'm talking about. I mainly bought the entire Classic Complete pack just to have the WADs legally. That's right, lawyers and PC haters. Not all of us just sit around pirating games all day. If we really love it, we'll buy it. Anyways, with these WADs, you can copy them directly from your Steam folder and use them on other source ports for features such as playing multiplayer on modern servers, upgrading the graphics/resolution, and, of course, modding. There are also methods of creating your very own WADs, which is one thing that's made Doom such a popular game. It has stood the test of time for 2 decades, and I see it going for even more than that. It's a classic. Just like Super Mario Bros., Sonic The Hedgehog, and The Legend of Zelda. Definitely pick this one up. I have no complaints for this version of the game, other than what I said about it possibly not working for everyone's machines when first downloaded. But follow my guide up there, and you'll have it fixed in minutes. It's really easy, even for those not tech savvy. 10/10			",430,79,14,49,47,11,47

												DOOM is a great game, and it's an awesome experience for any FPS player. It's not one of those games that has you going straight from point A to point B. You have to explore the maps to find keys that you to proceed to the next map. There is a wide mariety of maps, this version of DOOM has a total of 36 maps if you also count the secret maps. Some maps can be a maze, however, and it can ruin the pace of the game. The game also has a lot of secrets and even a few secret levels. DOOM also has a good variety of enemies, some can be annoying though, such as the Lost Souls, the pinky Demons with partial invisibility, and the Cacodemons. The bosses are probably the most badass bosses in gaming, a giant robot demon with a rocket launcher for a hand, and a robot spider demon with a chaingun. I won't count the bruiser brothers, because they're just two Barons of Hell. The game also offers some kick♥♥♥♥♥music, which adds good pace to the game, although some songs can be a bit boring, but most of them are awesome. It has some really neat powerups such as +100% health, invinsibility, increased damage, +200% armor, partial invisibility, a sphere that brings your health and armor to the max (200%), and a radiation suit. You start with 2 weapons, your fists, and a pistol. The other weapons, which you earn as you progress through the game are a shotgun, a chaingun, a rocket launcher, a plasma gun, and the almighty BFG 9000, this weapon is a beast and can kill multiple enemies with one hit, and it's also an easy way to quickly end a boss fight, but it is very overpowered, and might ruin the fun unless you're a psychopath, which you probably are if you can't stay away from DOOM. The gameplay is quite simple, find what you need to continue to the next map and shoot whatever is alive. No living thing here is your friend. The controls can be awkward for players, you use the up and down arrow keys to move forwards and backwards, and the left and right arrow keys to turn left and right, left control shoots, alt strafes, shift sprints, and space flicks switches and pushes buttons, they aren't rebindable. But you can still use GZDoom, which has rebindable keys mouse looking, and it allows you to move left and right. And GZDoom also quickly starts the game, which is something we should really thank the dudes who made GZDoom for because the game takes about a minute to finally get to the main menu.TL;DR: Doom is awesome, some things can be a bit meh, GZDoom can fix some flaws. My individual rating the aspects I talked about are:Gameplay: 10/10Enemies: 8/10Map design: 8/10Music: 9/10Weapons: 8/10Controls: 6/10 (GZDoom fixes that)Time to load the game: 0/10 (GZDoom makes is a 10/10)Simplicity: 10/10Bosses: 8/10Powerups: 10/10Maps: 7/10Overall score: 7.6/10			",230,29,7,13,10,3,23

												Doom, the ""original game that set the world afire"", is one considered one of the greatest first person shooters of any time. With all due respect it is. The shame is that it is shrouded in the shadow of many modern shooters such as Call of Duty and Halo. Doom should be bought and played by all modern shooter fans to see where their favorite shooters gained its popularity and gamers in general should buy this game for its challenging stages and many hidden secrets.

												I can't describe how amazing this game is i used to have a copy of DOOM (not the ultimate doom) when i was about 7 played it for a bit i had a blast with it but then my copy sadly didn't work was scratched to f*ck and stuff like that,when i saw this game for only $1.50 on steam,my best friend gifted me this game and ever since i have been playing this a lot,this game is just nearly perfect,not to easy,not to hard. This game offers a lot of challange if you are a new player even the chainsaw is better then the DOOM 2016 chainsaw,the thing about this game is you never know what happens you just gotta  shoot the hell out of these demons,the only flaw i really see in this game in my opinion is that the game is to confusing don't get me wrong the level designs are very good but if you don't have a good memory like me you might get confused a lot but i will get used it i think, i give it a 9.5/10 if you wanna play DOOM i recommend you starting with this game if you can :D			",99,5,2,0,3,0,1

												Wow, just wow I have to say. This game is... I just... Words can't explain it. This game is the best FPS I've ever played. It beats that COD crap out there because that is just a bunch of screaming seven year olds telling you how many no scooped headshots they got, and they act like we care. If I had the choice to play this or COD for the rest of my life I'd pick this. Let's just be honest shooting demons is 100x better than hearing a seven year old scream at the top of his lungs "" NO SCOOPE!!!!!!!! "". 10/10 best game ever I own all the classic ones, I have a problem. I like this problem though.			",49,1,0,5,6,0,6

												Simply brilliant, yet largely overlooked these days by modern FPSes. While not a perfect game in terms of controls, this was one of the pioneer FPSes and remains a classic of the genre. I absolutely love it. The music is amazing and really has that 90s-nostalgia feel to it. The monsters are neat and unique, and the feeling you get after killing them is a wonderful feeling. The weapon arsenal is highly varied as well, with weapons of increasing power becoming obtainable later on in the game.I highly recommend it for anyone out there that plays modern FPSes and is interested in an older gaming experience, or simply someone who wants to find out what FPSes were like when they were first starting out.

												Doom is easily one of my favorite games and by far is one of the most fun first person shooters of all time. For those of you who do not know doom is the grandaddy of all first person shooters but the first was wolfenstein 3d. However doom was what sparked peoples interest in the genre and the concept. Since dooms release their have been mods, sequels, etc. but I do not know if anything will beat the classic doom.  The game has no multiplayer but its singleplayer is fairly simple and a load of fun. Demons from hell have taken over mars and it is up to you to prevent the demons from reaching earth. Alltogether it is very violent so not for kids, but you will have to be the one to make that call for sure. Obviously you will end up in very satanic locations so it is not for the very faint of heart. By todays standards it is not so scary of a horror game but you have to take note it was made in the 1970s. I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone who likes comics, firstperson shooters, action movies and all you halo fans! enjoy!			",68,1,0,2,5,0,2

Some slightly older gamers might still recall the term ""DOOM-Clone"" years before the name ""FPS"" came along and there's a good reason for that. DOOM is still just as great now as it was then.

One of the first first-person shooters (ONE OF THE, saying it very loosly...) that was mind-blowing epicness. If I accually grew up with this (I was a tiny bit earlier) I would of loved it, and bought all the accessories for it (*COUGH* http://store.bethsoft.com/brands/doom.html) so I say go buy it for the creators sake!! They need the money!! (I think)5 outta 5.			",104,7,1,8,1,0,3

												Where has this game been all my life? Honestly, I never expected it to be more fun than I thought it'd be.Run around, shoot demons, collect guns, shoot demons, collect ammo, shoot demons, collect armor, shoot demons, collect powerups, shoot demons, collect keycards, open doors, push buttons, flip switches, find secrets, and shoot demons. So simple yet so elegant.However, the control just doesn't hold up today. So the solution to that is to download a sourceport! There are quite a few out there, but I most reccommend GZDoom. You just need to first configure the controls and stuff and you'll be all set! It'll feel like a modern FPS in no time.And then there's the mod Brutal Doom. More blood, more gore, prettier visual effects, new sprites, new functioning weapons, different customizations for the mod, just overall brilliant.Buy the Doom Classic Complete pack. It'll be well worth it.Rip and tear! Rip and tear their guts!			",68,8,3,2,6,2,0

DOOM!As old as it may be, this game has aged quite well compared to many other FPS games. Even despite its age it still feels unique and once you get used to mouse controls, feels so very tight and responsive.It's a great game to throw yourself back into the days before cover shooting and rechargable health/shields and quicktime events and linear cooridoor level design. You'll find yourself seeking out each secret to get the most badass weapons. You could play at your own pace: carefully exploring every step of the way to survive or just simply running out guns blazing, leaving a trail of destruction in your wake.WARNING: This game will leave you wanting more in your other FPS; something more than Bay-esque scripted explosions, something more than NPCs running around you to shoot the things you're stuck on. Luckily there is DOOM II to fill that itching desire.			",171,46,2,14,14,1,26

												I was wrong about this game. I had trouble enjoying it, until I started playing it on easy mode through a third-party Doom engine like Doomsday or ZDoom. Doomsday has an option to disable the motion-sickness-inducing view bobbing, and has a map overlay that makes navigating the byzantine levels more fun for a modern gamer. Easy mode is built in to the regular game (there are 5 difficulty settings, and the default is the one in the middle), and I found it much more fun to treat the game like a shooting gallery in a maze (with a map that fills out as you go through the level) than a tough as nails, player versus the world hellscape.There are people who played Doom when it came out and still love the original game for what it is. The majority of current FPS gamers have never played it, but they should. Maybe they can't appreciate it in the same way as the original fans, but if they're like me they can still enjoy the incredible shooting mechanics. Among all first-person shooters, this game has one of the best and most satisfying to use shotguns, for example.			",170,85,8,10,15,3,29

												Doom Classic Complete (Doom 1 + 2 + Expansions) was selling at Bundle Stars for $5.09 + 10% voucher, I had to get it.This Steam version runs on DOSBox, ditch that and get a source port.  Configuring took me a while, ended up settling for ZDL running Chocolate Doom (I wanted to play as close to Vanilla as possible first). But the potential is there to add more source ports and epic mods such as Brutal Doom later on. The gameplay cannot be denied. 20+ years later it is still a legendary game and I'm having heaps of fun.			",162,47,5,22,13,2,33

												I was 4 years old when Doom came out. Wow. Has it been that long? 4 years old, and I would never had thought games could be any better than Doom. It still almost seems that way. It was Wolfenstein 3D, and Doom, that got me hooked on FPS games. Later when the other FPS games that followed after Doom came out like, Quake, Decent 1 & 2, all would solidify my cravings to be the one to pull the trigger. Doom is a household name! The somewhat endless stories of people suffering from sleep depervation because Doom was so addictive is just awesome to hear, because I know personally what they mean. I remember I would sometimes through a fit, because my parents would make me go to bed. But, I know if my parents would've let me played as long as I desired, then I would definitely have stayed up for days playing Doom. That's not good for the health. Nope, nope. Hey, one time my friends and I stood up for three days straight just to beat Duke Nukem 3D. Lol, good times. Awe, man! When, I turn 40 years old, I will expect you future kids to know Doom. You kids now have the privilege to either choose to play this old Doom game, or some new, hyped up, Next-Gen, game coming out next week. When I was you're age, Doom was the Next-Gen game for us, and boy does it still rock! Not to make you kids feel underprivileged because you were born late, no, I'm just suggesting you to buy Doom, and see why it became a huge turning point in the history of gaming. You're gonna wish that you love it as much as we who grew up with it do, and that's an encouraging thought. There are so many great FPS games out there, but Doom will always have its rightful spot in my collection.			",47,2,0,3,6,0,7

												I remember popping in those 3.5"" floppies containing a shareware copy of DOOM, included in some magazine.  Not the first FPS I had played for sure (Wolfie 3D already had its share of game time) but even when considering its primitive graphics, it truly provides an immersive experience.  Music, SFX, world design, all spot on.  In addition, smartly paced action throughout the original 3 episodes.  Can't recommend it enough to any youngsters who still haven't discovered the greatness in Doom.			",141,26,1,13,8,1,6

												Before DLC, Before Online DRM, Before Regenerating Health, Knee high walls and two weapon pick-up limits there was DOOM.Whilst not the first First-Person Shooter ever to exist its impact upon the gaming landscape is still one that is evident to this very day; sure, modern FPSs have slowed down, their colour pallets drained and their necessity to have some micro-transaction laden multiplayer is practically a requirement by law these days but deep, deep within the DNA of those more modern games their rests a strand protein with a toothy grin and a chainsaw in hand making every other strand feel deeply uncomfortable and maybe, just maybe, deep down, somewhat jealous...

												Doom is quite outdated, so if you feel like you cannot play it, you can try Brutal Doom! Conserves the aesthetic and level structure, while massivily improving the gunplay! Guns have a better impact, there are smoother animations, there are better special effects, etc. Buy the whole collection and play them with Brutal Doom!			",232,12,0,18,7,1,19

												Yep, as all the other people, who wrote reviews today, I nominated this for the ""Test of time"" award, and now I'm writing review for it to earn the badge ""review a game you've nominated"". Being one of the best games ever made, Doom is absolutely ageless. And you know that, because you've already played it. Everybody had.			",80,16,1,7,4,0,1

												This game is actually still one of the top shooters to date if you can get past the poor graphics (play it windowed ot with mods) and unconventional controls. I don't mind cutscenes and maybe sometimes even longer times between the fights if there is some good story, but modern shooters, even the likes of Shadow Warrior (2013) or Doom (2016), are simply not fast enough.

												Well if you don't already know what DOOM is than you must literally live under a rock. This classic comes from the guys at Id software. They knew they were on to something after titles such as Hovertank 3D, Catacombs 3D and Wolfentein 3D. The brand new FPS genre was born and DOOM was set to be the best game ever. Not long after release, DOOM was installed on more computers than WIndows 95 and a mega hit to say the least. Between superb level design, amazing soundtrack and a great, smooth, gaming experience wrapped in a sci-fi/hell and demons theme. This game definitely lived up to what Id Software knew it could be. DOOM is still known to many as the best FPS game ever made and even if you don't agree, you have to realize the importance this game had on the gaming world as a whole. If you enjoy first person shooter games, you owe it to yourself to play this masterpiece.			",102,6,3,9,4,0,0

												DOOM 1 is perhaps the ultimate classic game that everyone even remotely interested in first-person shooters should at least try out once. And I say this, admittedly, as someone who simply cannot enjoy games with outdated graphics. That is unless the game is really special to me, having played it lots in the past. And I admit, too, that I only rather recently bought Ultimate and Final Doom, quite a bit after I played the newest DOOM (2016) for almost 60 hours.So no, the oldschool Doom games weren't about some retro trip. They're all about pure fun. And let me tell you, it's so, so much fun, no matter if you play with classic controls (using only the arrow keys, ctrl and spacebar), WASD keys with horizontal mouse aim (as is standard in this version, though I advise you to look up how to lock your y-axis), or simply replace the exe with a Doom interpreter to run amazing mods such as Brutal DOOM, where you have fully fleshed out ""modern"" controls, lots of gore and just an overall amazing experience. And you can customize it however you want, utilizing the tons of maps & mods that have been developed over the last two decades.So, overall, I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it's Doom! One of the best and groundbreaking game of all times!Was nice to be able to buy a copy from Steam that runs on modern systems (I have the original discs I bought back in the day and it would take way to long to try to get them to install and run properly).This game is timeless and always fun to play over and over.

												If you have a Steam account and have not played Doom, you're committing a crime against humanity. You are obviously a demon, and need to go back to hell. Or, you could play Doom and redeem yourself by cutting your way through hordes of your brethren in a fast-paced, brutal shooter that pioneered the shooter genre. Then, once you're done, download some .wad files off the internet and do it again. There's 22+ years of content out there, and dedicated modders are still pumping it out. Plus, if the original 320x240 resolution and keyboard only controls aren't cutting it for you, you can download source ports that fit every need. Hell, if you really wanted to, you can take the .wad file that comes with the game, find an appropriate source port, and play Doom on basically anything. I've seen it played on printers, ATMs, and I'm pretty sure as soon as a toaster comes out with a screen, Doom won't be too far away. So, what's your excuse, then? Are ya chicken?

The new Doom really takes what made this game good and made it even better. I just LOVE this game. Why? Your character, Doomguy, is basically a god. He can't die.

												Pretty much (for me at least) THE game that started my PC gaming addiction. Decades old but is always a blast. I still play this game to this day. Best played using the Doomsday engine.The appeal for me here is the simplicity of the game. You aren't part of an interactive movie where gameplay is disrupted every 5 minutes. You can save the game at whatever point you want, unlike a checkpoint system.			",226,24,0,18,6,0,7

												What the hell ID? I love DOOM, but when I realized this was running in DOSBox, I realized I wasted my money, you can download DOSBox for free, and the Ultimate DOOM (Registered) for free on the internet! At least do what apogee did with the new Rise of the Triad (Except don't upgrade the graphics, I like the classic DOOM graphics) also, there is no multiplayer since we can't open ipxsetup or setup or anything else for multiplayer from the DOS DOOM, DOOM 95 was better (and I got that from good-will for 2 bucks.) At the very least I'm still happy I have this on steam, but its such a scam if its running on DOSBox and you pay for it. Just saying. But for anyone wanting the game. Its a good game, I'm not saying the game itself is bad, its f***ing awesome. Get it now (or don't because internet...)			",65,22,0,10,9,0,8
