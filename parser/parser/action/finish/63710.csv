												Great little game. Really enjoy the blend of retro artstyles and music with the modern 3D voxel and progressive music and the game manages to gradient between the old and the new seamlessly. Solid gameplay induced fun, with a hardcore and challenging nature that will leave anyone that finishes it pleased with his results.Pros:-fun-challenging-even greater rythm and musically designed levels-great art style-great blend of retro and modern-great gameplay-great music

Bit.Trip Runner - Short ReviewBit.Trip Runner is a challenging rhythm platforming game that has a good soundtrack, but is essentially a game of trial and error. If you've played ""The Impossible Game"" and liked it, then you'll probably enjoy this as well. Although if you're prone to raging, then expect to rage a lot; especially if you like to go for that 100%.Pros:► Challenging and fun platformer► Great music► Responsive controlsCons:► Basically a game of trial and error; requires memorizing levels and hitting your marks► Hit boxes might register a hit even if you don't appear to collide with it► Only the zones are unique in terms of aesthetics, and there are only 3 of them.► No checkpoints during a level, so you'll need to pick up everything again after messing upHit / Miss:N/APersonal Rating:Avoid at all costsPick up during a saleWorth PlayingMust Play ",895,349,25,120,91,10,141

												I'm torn between recommending this game and recommending against it. Ultimately, I recommend against buying it.Pros:- The game has a wonderful and cohesive visual and auditory aesthetic.  The levels convey a compelling liveliness and otherworldliness.  The obstacles, enemies, and background ""creatures"" are inventive and cool-looking. I wish I could go explore the background with Commander Video.- The music is great.  I actually bought the album of the band that did the opening credits theme (Anamanaguchi) after hearing it in this game.- The mechanics are pretty predictable. It's obvious when you need to jump, smash, etc, although sometimes certain elements can get muddled by everything else going on around it.- It has achievements, and I like achievements, because I'm kinda OCD.- It has Steam cloud sync, because it's 2014.Cons:- It's billed as a rhythmic platformer, but falls short on both counts. As a platformer it's dull and the controls are tight. It requires rote memorization in many places rather than reliance on reflexes.  As a rhythmic game it falls short because the beats of the songs actually throw you off and aren't very well-timed to what you're supposed to be doing.  Rhythmic platformers must be pretty difficult to design because they require absolute integration in the spatial and time dimensions, but when the designers fail it actually makes the game less intuitive and more frustrating.- At times it seems like my character didn't actually collide with an object, but it registers a hit, sending me back to the beginning of the level. Seems like there's fudgy hitboxes. A game like this requires skintight hitboxes.- Just because it's hard doesn't make it fun. The designers deliberately made the game very hard by the exclusion of checkpoints.  You could call this ""sadistic"" or say it's meant to attract only the most diehard platformer fans (of which I am one), but it makes the game inaccessible and artificially extends the playtime. It's a crutch you see used a lot in indie platformers these days. Super Meat Boy was exceptionally hard but had an enormous amount of depth. Bit.Trip Runner is actually a pretty short and shallow experience if you add checkpoints.  - Since this is a rhythmic platformer, a large part of the game experience is enjoying the music. But it's incredibly difficult to even get past the first world (of three total), and you don't really hear different music until then.  By the time I got there I was so ♥♥♥♥ing tired of the music in the first world I never want to play it again. Contrast that to Electronic Super Joy, 140, and Super Meat Boy, where I frequently go back and play levels just to hear the music.- You have to focus so much on timing your movements that - Autoscroll on every level kinda sucks in platformers. That's probably a controversial statement, but it's what I think. Oh, and while I'm at it, Metallica's ""And Justice for All..."" is their best.- The boss battles are inventive, but by the 100th time I tried to beat the first world boss I was ♥♥♥♥ing bored out of my mind. I actually had to write down the order of what comes at me in order to beat it. This isn't Calculus. I shouldn't have to take notes.I think the cons outweigh the pros, so I can't recommend this one. But, if you like really hard platformers with good music and don't mind nearly-endless repetition, you'll probably enjoy it.			",162,28,2,8,16,1,15

												Frustration deluxe.Ok so the game and concept is simple, your character constantly run to the right and you have to slide, jump, kick, bounce, reflect or any of these combinations together to get to the end of the level. The music that plays in the background helps you keep the pace somewhat and you can probably blindfold this game if you memorize it completely.But the bad thing about the game, is that you have one try.If you fail in any way, you will start at the beginning of the level. The first few levels are easy, but the further in you get into a chapter, the levels get both longer and more complicated, some lasting up to 4-5 minutes. So the game turns into a game or memorizing every little thing, you have to remember which buttons to press and for how long to press them as well, some things you get barely no warning of at all so the first time you get there, you will die.Fun.So the game itself is pretty fun, except the lack of checkpoints, which makes it extremely frustrating instead.Graphics: It’s pretty if you like this 3d-pixel environment. It works well I think. :)Things kind of tend to blur together at times, but might be intentional to make it harder.Technically I had no real hiccups, though I experienced some light lags at times, but think it might be my computer instead of the game. 99% of the time it was smooth sailing.So should you buy this? Well, I don’t know, some might like this a lot, perfecting levels is a wonderful feeling, but if you are forced to perfect them… Well, it just sucks the fun out of a game. If you don’t mind this, then you should probably buy it. It is a good game in the bottom, but the frustrating stuff really tended to get in the way for me.			",510,139,5,56,39,3,57

												This game is fun and addicting, but it has some major flaws.First of all, the difficulty curve in this game is pretty wonky. Now, I'm not sure if this is because I got used to the game as I progressed, but I felt that some of the later stages (especially from world 2) were incredibly easy when compared to the earlier ones. The difficulty ramps up again towards the end, but you'll still find that it varies greatly from stage to stage instead of following a steadily rising curve as you would expect.Second, while the level design will overall test your skills and reflexes, it can be a bit repetitive and sometimes very frustrating. The game will resort to artificial methods of increasing the difficulty by placing obstacles and items at very awkward positions, and since a single mistake will take you back to the beginning of the stage, that translates into annoying trial-and-error gameplay. If you don't mind having your patience tested, then you should do just fine.And last but not least, the game has a motion blur effect that, as far as I know, cannot be disabled. I guess they chose to use this effect to give a good sense of speed and movement, but it would have been nice to include an option to disable it. Not only that effect is going to tire out your eyes  if play this game for long periods of time, but it might also cause you to fail at certain points of the game because the game's art style doesn't stand out very much — obstacles and items tend to blend in with each other, it's hard to tell them apart sometimes, and the continuous blur doesn't help one bit.The game is still worth a shot, if you're feeling adventurous. The difficulty is insane and rage-quit inducing, and finishing a tough stage can be very satisfying. Sadly, however, I personally think that the flaws outweigh its qualities. I recommend you try the sequel, ""Runner2"", a much better game in pretty much every aspect.			",212,24,10,12,11,0,8

												Very much on the fence on this one, but I'm going to have to come down on the side of not recommending this game. Bit Trip Runner is a scrolling rythm based platformer. The screen constantly scrolls to the right and as you run you have to jump, slide, kick and block your way through the level. It starts off great. Good music, tight controls, and bright colorful graphics put together an awesome presentation. As you pick up gold and ""power ups"" the music fills in and the your actions in the level fill in the background to the music. It's a cool effect. That for me was where the good times ended. Near the end of the first world, the game becomes brutally hard. There are no checkpoints in Bit.Trip Runner. One mistake will send you flying all the way back to the beginning of the level. You have no health so it's one hit and you die. With some levels over 3-4 min long, the constant act of being sent back to the start every time is annoying and gives you little chance to work on the one tough spot you're having a problem with.  And those tough spots? This game leaves very little to no room for error. You have to be precise. At least with games like Super Meat Boy, the level is very short. It lends itself well to quick deaths and restarts because you're working on the same area and you can go at your own pace. That's not the case here. I finally did beat this game, but my feeling was more relief than triumph. If you're hardcore into platformers you may enjoy it, but there are better titles out there.			",306,110,7,32,26,2,24

												BIT.Trip Runner is a rhythmic, side-scrolling platformer.The player takes control of Commander Video, who will run endlessly until he reaches the end of each stage. You can have him jump and duck to avoid obstacles, kick certain obstacles out of the way, launch himself on springboards or deflect objects with a shield. If Commander Video impacts with an obstacle, the player is forced to repeat the entire stage from the beginning. The game consists of 3 themed worlds, each with 11 stages and a boss stage.Aside from the main objective of reaching the end of each stage, the player can also attempt to collect all items within each stage (score multipliers that increase the intensity of the music and particle effects, as well as gold bars). Completing a stage with every item collected will give a ""Perfect"" score and grant access to a bonus stage in the style of an old Atari game. The core mechanic is mostly the same in that you reach the end of the bonus collecting as much gold as you can while avoiding obstacles. Collecting all the gold within a bonus stage gives a ""Double Perfect"" score.Graphics are simple, most objects being composed of low-poly blocks with very basic textures. The overall visual aesthetic is competent, pulling off a retro-inspired look yet remaining in a 3D space, but the repetitiveness of playing stages consecutively undermines the appeal of the simplicity as there is very little visual variation between them. Audio quality is likewise competent and fitting to the overall theme, with the level designs reflecting the rhythm of the music to varying degrees, mixed in with suitable arcade sound effects. Unfortunately, this also suffers from monotony as you will hear a lot of the music repeated over and over as you progress, with only two unique songs for each of the three worlds (excluding boss stages, which again all share the same music) and none of the music is particularly good.The controls are tight and responsive, each stage is mostly a fluid experience with each button press feeling natural in time with the rhythm. Mistakes will be made but they rarely feel unfair, but the game is nonetheless totally unforgiving in that any mistake that causes an impact with an obstacle will cause Commander Video to fall right back to the start of the stage and do it all over again. Later stages may cause players to give up out of frustration, even on easy difficulty (which isn't actually easier at all).Completing a challenging stage gives great satisfaction and the motivation to carry on through the disappointingly bland presentation. It tests your skills and timing rather than relying on stats and/or making it too easy, but this will of course leave some people out of luck if they are finding it too difficult to continue past a certain point, because anything short of perfection will not allow for progression. Despite this, the difficulty curve is relatively steady from start to finish.BIT.Trip Runner is a fun game to play in short bursts, but due to the monotony of the visuals, audio and level design, would probably cause headaches and frustration if played for much longer durations.

												It's a great, original and nice looking platformer without any doubt, but i actually really enjoyed just the first few hours i played it. First of all, this game is tiring as hell for your eyes, after following this small black guy for 10 minutes you can start seing damn ghosts. Also, this game is truly verry hard, even on easy mode you'll have to play a stage over and over for at least like 20 times. Maybe being so hard is a important point in this game, but it's not my type then for sure. My nerves just cant handle it, a few times i almost threw my controller in the wall. I own the second game too, but i don't think i could handle playing it, at least not now. just got the first one done and i need a brake from it verry badly before trying the second one, at least a few months...

												This is a beautiful side scroller where you jump, slide and kick your way to make it through things. Did I mention that it automatically scrolls to the side? You really have no control over the movement, just the ability to jump over things, kick through them and slide under them. Seems simple enough. The jumping is not floaty at all and takes some true prescision. Even the simplest jump up stairs or jump over a chasm needs to be timed correctly.The music is also a stand out plus in the game even if it seems like there really aren't many songs. Just beats in the background. Every time you jump it makes a sound that adds to the melody. Every time you grab a + sign the beat amps up.Bit.Trip Runner is split into 3 episodes each with around 10 levels. Each level will have you trying to obtain + marks on your way to the end. A lot of levels seem like the level is really 1/4th the level and they just make you run it 4x in the level. You will come to know these levels VERY well, because the downside is if you bump into something you will be taken back all the way to the beginning of a level.If you are the type of person that loves timing games with beautiful backgrounds and good music then this game is for you. But I can't imagine after beating this game that I will ever play it again.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												A very challenging rhythm game disguised as an auto-running platformer. Unfortunately, much of the challenge comes from the total absence of midlevel checkpoints, making the game more frustrating than satisfying in my experience. I'm not the biggest fan of rhythm games, though, so your mileage may vary.Regardless, the whole series of Bit.Trip games has unique aesthetics and excellent music.

												An interesting concept that starts fun but by the time you reach 1-11 becomes grating and tiresome. Should you pass this point, you are met with a boss fight that is the very definition of ""trial and error"" gameplay and after the umpteenth attempt at getting through his inhuman-reaction-time laden battle I grew annoyed.That aside, the visuals are nice for what they are and can obviously run well on older machines. The sound is pleasant though it gets repetitive. I would only recommend if you have a good deal of patience and an overwhelming desire to own all the BIT.TRIP games. Otherwise, skip this and go to the second.			",348,60,6,36,22,1,42

												While I enjoyed the game for a bit, a couple of things really bothered me. I bought this game thinking it would be a nice rhythm game I could press buttons to music to. However, the music actually throws you off as your button presses do not coincide with the music at all. Furthermore, some of the obstacles in the levels are almost unreactable on your first play through. The length of the levels and the repetetiveness of the gameplay all lead to my eyes glazing over as I jump and slide through the same obstacles over and over again. If you enjoy a challenge where memorizing level patterns is your thing then you will probably enjoy this game. However, if you're looking for a rhythm game with more in depth platforming, you should look elsewhere.			",228,31,4,32,15,1,33

												Controller Enabled: Lies. You'll be stuck with the keyboard on this. As you'd expect from a bit trip title it's funky and difficult. Sadly, the main barrier to difficulty is the inconsistent jump timings, random moments of lag and moments where jump simply does nothing. Given the one shot nature of the levels they are far too long and quickly grow boring. Wait and pick it up when it's cheap or you'll be disappointed. As for the ""extremely addicitve one more time gameplay"" you'll find it's more ""♥♥♥♥ sake not again gameplay"" as you repeatedly get to the end of the level only to be thwarted by yet another set of stairs that require an inhuman level of timing. Oh and unlike Beat, don't try time your jumps to the tune cos you'll only end up failing.			",237,104,17,64,66,8,49

												If games had voices Bit.Trip Runner would be nothing but a prolonged maniacal laugh, over the casual-friendly endless runners that permeate the mobile game market, and you the player for your thousands of clumsy failed attempts to clear a level. Runner demands absolute perfection, and in returns provides one of the most precise and satisfying games to ever grace the genre.Although it bares many similarities to endless runners such as Canabalt, BTR is a far more deliberately structured experience than the many flash offerings available, and doesn't actually deserve to be called an endless runner as shares more in common with a rhythm game than anything else. Each enemy, obstacle, and jump is timed directly to the music playing behind it, an integral fact that is critical in landing your timing and predicting what is coming down the line. As you dodge these hurdles you in turn add your own portion of the soundtrack, fleshing out the melody and adding new layers to each track. Nailing a run perfectly is exhilarating, all the more so because doing so requires such finesse and determination.It should be noted and re-noted that BTR is a very, very hard game, perhaps the most difficult one in fact that I have ever successfully completed. It is brutally unforgiving from the onset and doesn't hesitate to send you right back to the start of the level over the tiniest slip-up. There are no checkpoints at any point in the game, and as levels become longer the trial and error design calls for some serious memorization and hand eye coordination.I don't doubt for a second that most will not complete the game, perhaps not even the first would. It's a grueling task that appeals to a specific sect of masochistic gamers which, although I personally love it to death, is the reason I simply cannot recommend the game to anyone who isn't ready for an immense challenge. Everyone else will find a far better time skipping straight to Runner 2, which is all around a much more easily enjoyable game regardless of skill level.Level variety is also a bit of a problem, as with only three different worlds you will be spending a lot of time looking at the same things, and overcoming the same obstacles. This isn't such a bad thing as the music and art are excellent across the board, but it did begin to wear on me after spending so long stuck in the same place. Another minor problem is that for the later two worlds the backgrounds become so congested, that they sometimes obscure obstacles coming toward you which is highly frustrating and one of the few parts of the game that just feels cheap.No matter these smaller problems I still adore Bit.Trip Runner. The way the music ties into the gameplay gives it a unique feel and keep the experience feeling fair no matter how often I failed at it. The electronic soundtrack perfectly complements the style of gameplay, and the way it all comes together is much more consistently great than likely any Bit.Trip game that came before it. There is something to be said for the difficulty turning many players away (and you would be right to do so if that isn't your cup of tea), but for those unafraid to attempt to conquer the laborious challenge it presents, Runner is easily worth a try and for provides a sense of personal accomplishment that other games can't.

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is an indie game that, like most indie games, will leave you either wanting more or wanting your money back. The game was developed by Gaijin Games for the Virtual Console on the Nintendo Wii in 2010, but was released on Steam in February 2011. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a rhythm-style action plaformer that consist of a protagonist, Commander Video, on a 2D plane. The player controls Commander Video as he runs along the set track from left to right and controls when the character jumps, slides, and kicking. As you progress through the 36 levels in the game (three worlds, each consisting of 11 levels, plus a boss encounter stage), you collect powerups that increase the quality of the music that plays through each level. The game is notable for it's unique soundtrack, retro feel, and it's frustratingly difficult gameplay, as the current level is started over each time Commander Video runs into an obstacle that the player failed to acknowledge. The game forces a trial-and-error style of play, and in the end, it can hurt the experience. I myself found that I would get particularly frustrated on nearly every level that I played, as I would have to start the level over simply for pressing a button to early or too late. However, the game exceeds in rewarding the player, as the sense of accomplishment that comes from beating a particularly difficult level is unrivaled by most games that are released on the market today. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a unique game that can be extremely rewarding, or absolutely crushing. Be warned: the game is not for everyone. While I didn't particularly enjoy BIT.TRIP RUNNER, it continues to be a game that is loved by the Indie community and the games that follow it only stand to be a testament to their devotion. A 5 out of 10. Authors Note - I, personally, did not enjoy BIT.TRIP RUNNER. I felt that it was too difficult for me and that it simply wasn't my type of game. However, I do highly recommend this game to any and all gamers that have yet to play it. It's a challenging experience that harkens back to the older days of retro gaming, and for that, I can honestly say that everybody should play these games, at least once.			",139,18,1,14,1,1,7

As the name implies BIT.TRIP RUNNER belongs to the genre runner.Your task: run forward, collect gold and powerups, but dodge the various obstacles of living and nonliving genesis.BIT.TRIP RUNNER is in 8-bit retro style game. This graphics may cause dizziness and even epilepsy.BIT.TRIP RUNNER has hardcore gameplay - stuck in any obstacle you come back to the beginning of the level.Highly recommend to use a gamepad for playing, as well as stock up soothing. :)For support gamepad you need to purchase additional software, example Pinnacle Game Profiler or Xpadder.Как понятно из названия BIT.TRIP RUNNER относится к жанру runner.Ваша задача: бежать вперед, собирать золото и поверапы, да уворачиваться от различных препятствий живого и неживого генеза.BIT.TRIP RUNNER выполнен в 8-битном ретро стиле. Такая графика может вызвать головокружение и даже приступы эпилепсии.BIT.TRIP RUNNER обладает хардкорным геймплеем - воткнувшись в любое препятствие вы возвращаетесь на начало уровня.Очень рекомендую использовать геймпад для прохождения, а также запастись успокоительным. :)Для поддержки геймпада потребуется приобрести дополнительный софт, например Pinnacle Game Profiler или Xpadder.Итого: 7/10 ",436,124,12,64,93,3,113

												Hate this game. Hard to look at -- constant attempts to focus on blurry foreground objects cause eye fatigue. You need a precision gaming keyboard to play it with any success. It's so repetitive. The gimmicks that make it interesting get old and boring, since they just repeat endlessly. So pointless. So frustrating. Punishes you for the slightest tiniest misstep by forcing you to re-do overly long levels from the beginning. Seriously, I hate it so much.			",395,278,9,111,63,1,111

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER pushes the boundaries on sound design, gameplay, and atmosphere. Where should I start?Sound Design:The BIT.TRIP series is well known to be part of the ""rhythm game"" genre, so not surprisingly, the sound design is absolutely superb. You can tell how much dedication Gaijin Games put into this specific installment. Every obstacle you face has an associated tone that adds to the melody of the song, where collectable + signs give you a score boost and make the rhythm of the music more basey. Every + sign you collect, a robotic voice declares that you are ""Mega"", ""Super"", ""Ultra"", and finally ""Extra"", which really helps with my self esteem issues.Gameplay:Hence the name, BIT.TRIP RUNNER is about running. What the title fails to convey, however, is the sheer amount of dodging, blocking, ducking, and kicking you will be doing throughout your adventure. Some levels are easier than others, and there are many instances where there are massive difficulty spikes (*COUGH* ODYSSEY). The main objective is to dodge all enemies, but for all the completionists out there, every level has a certain number of gold bars, and you will score PERFECT on a level if you collect them all. If you accomplish that, you can even get a double PERFECT by getting all gold in the insanely difficult bonus levels that follow. What can be concluded from all this: Gaijin Games has a capitalist agenda that they're trying to push on the media.Atmosphere:Upon first analyzing the game, the graphic design is very jarring. Commander Video is a sprite, and yet the entire world is in 3D! Yet, it is that juxtaposition between his appearance and the world that allows us to appreciate the environment for what it is. Make the main character too realistic, and you would focus on him. Considering there is no dialogue in this game, much of its story and impressions rely on noticing subtle details in the background. Meat Boy even makes a cameo in one level! For this reason, I think it's simply genius that they made that gameplay choice.All in all, I think this game should be nominated for Game of the Year 2016. It's a must buy.			",455,173,5,70,41,6,73

												This is like the Simon electronic memory game from the 80's except with better visuals, music, and an occasional chance to mitigate bad memory with hasty reflexes. That is to say: it's better than Simon, but that's a pretty low bar. The problem is that it passes itself off as a rhythm-platformer –– an acceptable label until the level length and difficulty becomes such that memorizing the hazards is the key to victory. ""Okay, duck twice in row.. then 3 jumps and a kick and then...."" forgetting makes you freeze and you plow into an obstacle.You might find this kind of misery to be something at which you could excel, and I'll grant that the gameplay has a certain appeal. But there are other misfires which prevent me from really recommending the title. One in particular: BIT.TRIP RUNNER places heavy emphasis on ""perfect"" completions of the levels (rewarding it with achievements and the like). Nabbing all the collectibles in a given level gives you subsequent access to a ""retro level"" –– an additional challenge postfixed to each normal level. If you mess up anything in one of these retro levels (which you most certainly will do), the game offers no chance to have another crack at it. It immediately queues up the next normal level and starts. If you want to attempt that particular retro level again, you must exit to the level select menu, choose the previous normal level you played, and complete that one with a perfect score to give you one additional shot at the retro stage. Having to repeatedly complete (perfectly, remember) one level to have individual chances at another will make you grind your teeth to powder. Is this negligence by the designers or leveraging time for difficulty (a member of the gaming Rogues Gallery)? Neither of those explanations is satisfactory.That's all to say, this game will make you mad. But I think it's often for the wrong reasons.edit - fixed a word			",66,14,0,5,8,0,12

												I don't play many runner games, but this one definitely was very fun (in spite of Odyssey, a brutal level which takes place early at the end of the very first world).Be advised that the game starts easy to become hard later, but levels can be learned by heart exactly like in a rythm game ('though not needed) so you should eventually succeed.For those who want more challenge, there is a fair amount of replayability thanks to interesting, challenging achievements - not the typical ""collect 1000 boxes"" or ""kill 500 zombies"", no the ""play better"" kind of achievements.

												I'm gonna have no mercy here:This game is downright laughable. As a huge Platformer fan, I'm actually insulted by this game. It's beyond repetitive (the level Odyssey especially made me lose any faith I had in this game), the music is bland and the platforming elements are just horrible at times (although not all the time). This game woulda been fine as a flash game, which is more or less what it is, but as something that's been priced at 10 bucks I'd say they're stealing money with this.			",145,24,2,26,6,0,10

												I've read many reviews about people comparing this game with its sequel, and basing this comparison to basically not recommending it.I'm in the point that I can comprehend both visions. Indeed, this game is unfair, the hitbox is confusing until the end, the lack of checkpoints makes it hardcore, it's more based on memory than reflexes, and as a rhythm game, it's basically a failure. Runner 2 fixes all that stuff, so it's logic that many people around here suggest you should avoid this game.BUT.I must remind you all that Runner 2 is actually the odd member of the family. Apart from it, ALL Bit.Trip games are this mercyless, and even more (in fact, the Runner games are the easiest ones from the franchise IMO). So Bit.Trip Runner is just another game similar to all those from the same company. It's not fair at all to compare it with a game that has very few in common if you look coldly. Personally, the Runner's games are the only ones from this franchise that I enjoyed. And if you have to choose one of them, it's just a matter of interests: if you wanna beat a real challenge and prove yourself you can face a hard game, try Runner 1; if you want to enjoy those kind of arcade games where you main purpose is avoiding things without getting frustrated, try Runner 2. I suggest playing both though. In conclusion, you'll read many positive and negative reviews, and all of them will be true. This game is simply not made for everybody, only for people who enjoys challenges from videogames, while its sequel is suitable for everybody.			",308,68,8,26,7,2,10

AUDIORhythmicVISUAL3D PixelDIFFICULTYToughVIBEPlatforming hellCRAVINGMusicON SALEOccasionallyPROS: A great addition to the musical-runner genre, and leads by example as to how these games should be made. Visuals are unique and highly-rewarding. Music when running at full speed in more active levels is fun. Teaches through gameplay rather than dialogue boxes, keeping the flow going.CONS: Very repetitive if being sent back is your worst nightmare in a game; one mistake and you're unceremoniously placed back at the beginning of the level. No checkpoints, no second-tries. Lots of artificial difficulty.WORTH: I see this game stagnating in people's inventories often. It's easy to open up, but hard to pick back up after the long breaks it ends up sending you on out of rage. If you don't have patience, you shouldn't pay full price.OVERALL: You may rage-quit, but you'll be back.

												Oh my this game is so good.  It's unforgivingly hard, even on Easy difficulty, but it's never unfair.  Every time I fail (and I fail over and over again) it never feels like the game cheated me out of victory, but that I needed to play better.  Further, I can't play this as a marathon play session.  After 10 or 15 minutes my concentration starts to break, I stop improving, and I have to quit for a while and come back later.  And I do keep coming back.As to what the game is actually like, the trailer video is a good representation.  If you see that and want to play, you won't be disappointed.  If you see it and aren't sure, maybe just watch some perfect runs on Youtube.  Different genres appeal to different people.The only difference between Normal and Easy is there are no coins to collect in Easy.  That's it, all the obstacles and platforming challenges remain.  In theory you could play through the game on Normal that way and just ignore all the coins to complete the levels more easily.  But there's so much to focus on that's harder than it seems, and removing the distraction does make a difference.And the difference between Normal and Perfect is you have to collect ALL the coins and other scoring opportunities in a level to pass it.  This is actually really helpful.  When you're trying for a perfect run on a level you don't have to fail on purpose and lose your momentum if you miss something.So the only reason to play the game on Normal is for the Braid achievement.  Otherwise I recommend switching between Easy to see the whole game (and make the Endure achievement easier) and Perfect for collecting all the things.  Beating a level on Normal doesn't feel quite as thrilling when you know you left some points behind.  (It still does feel pretty awesome though.  Just even more awesome when you get all the things.)The only misstep in the whole thing is Odyssey (stage 1.11).  And it's not bad, it's as great as everything.  But it may be the hardest stage in the game, and it feels like a wall to get stuck on compared to earlier and later advancement.  It seems to be included as early as it is not because of a difficulty progression, but because as you progress you are taught new skills, and Odyssey doesn't require abilities and tricks that later levels do.One final note -- other reviewers have talked about the artistic quality of the graphics and music.  But the level design throughout is art too, and a joy to experience.			",232,112,0,29,11,3,15

												Tough side scrolling game. I'd call it a platformer, but when the screen continuously scrolls without you controlling it, it makes it rough to qualify it as a platformer, though it obviously resembles one. Some call it a rythmn game, and while it does utilize a rythmn of sorts, I found that it was just easy to play this game with the sound turned off as it was easy when the sound was on. Easy, isn't the correct word to describe this though, this game is incredibly difficult at times. The idea is to jump, block, slide, or kick your way through each level. If you die anywhere in the level you start all over. This makes it difficult on the long levels. The graphics work for the type of game that it is, though they will not attract many newcomers without the gamer feeling nostalgia for the retro graphics. This is a good game, just know that you may either smash your keyboard or lose some hair with the frustration that it can bring.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												""So many times I had to change the pain to laughter."" ""BIT.TRIP RUNNER"" is the type of unforgiving rhythm game that will put you through hell, right up until the completion of the last level. But with pain, comes gain, and although most of your screaming will be through anger at hitting that one block or missing the last piece of gold, nothing is better than the reward you feel after crossing that finish line. ""BIT.TRIP RUNNER"" is perfect for the rhythm gamer, and a definite buy for any completionist, wanting a challenge.~PanHeath			",88,14,6,6,7,1,2

												You're hungry. You haven't gone to the bathroom in hours. Your mom is yelling at you to come eat dinner. Your fingers are starting to cramp, and your arrow keys are covered in sweat. You slam the keyboard in anger is you die once again. The urge to play disappeared hours ago, and now you're simply playing to beat this damn level. You can't quit, because then all these deaths will have been for naught. So, you grit your teeth and try one more time. Welcome to every single level on this stupid game. I hate it. Highly recommended.			",98,21,1,3,4,0,6

												It's been YEARS (maybe even a decade) since a game got my blood pumping this hard. Intensely hard, but super rewarding; Bit.Trip Runner will have you on the edge of your seat screaming ""I'm doing it! I'm doing it!"" right before you screw up and die.You kind of need to be a true gamer to appreciate this game (not that I'm saying you aren't a true gamer if you don't), but I TOTALLY recommend it!

												Ok, as you can see this game called bit trip RUNNER is pretty much that, a platformer on rails where you dodge obstacles  and -only if you want to unlock everything like I did- collect floating gold bars, and not much else. This game works great, super fluid, and is compatible with a 360 controller, sadly that's the only thing that I can appreciate from it. Its funny because some people claim that this game is ""hard"" and ""fast paced"", and let me tell ya, is none of those1) Its not really hard, with some practice you will end up memorizing the secuence of the obstacles, you are just avoiding them without having control of your character, other than kicking, jumping, ducking, reflecting (you have some kind of orange bar that reflects only one kind of proyectile), or jumping higher from a spring, and thats one of the cheapest flaws in the game that makes it ""hard"". There are some kind of pink tiles that work like springs, all you have to do is press up or the Y button and you can jump higher than the regular jump, obviously there are sections that you need to do this in order to beat a level, how can you screw that up? usually you'll need to press the button right before you miss the pink tile because if you press it too early you'll land 3 pixels behind of the very spot you need to land on because, most of the time, in the spot where you should have landed there was a golden bar that you have to collect and if you landed right behind it you won't touch it and its game over for you if you're playing it on perfect difficulty and you lose whenever you miss anything you have to collect. Another cheap flaw is the perfect difficulty, because as I said before whenever you miss anything like the golden bar you lose, thankfully when that happens you can try again because it takes you BACK TO THE BEGINING of the level.Every.Time. This game wants you to be sooo perfect that when you press one button one instant before or after the instant the game wants or if you don't land on one magical pixel the game wants, hell even if you are almost half of a second late you lose and you have to restart the level at once. That's what make the game hard, because if you play it on normal or easy its pretty much, no, its the same crap, with the only difference of not having to collect EVERY GOLDEN BAR.2) fast paced? no, simple as that, this ain't sonic, is just commander video. You can see whats ahead you, unless you're playing the bonus stages where your field of view is reducedPeople claim that the gameplay is brilliant, I didn't find it like that, at all, not even close. This game gets repetitive in a few hours, there were times where I could tell that the developers recycle some sections in many levels, to the point that I could even guess the algorithm that dodges the obstaclesI gave this game and its sequel a chance, bought them during the sale so I did't spend too much money, but I was so dissapointed that I feel it would've been the same even if they were freeThen again, you can pretty much tell what kind of game it is ny just looking at it, but I saw some many positive reviews saiying that the gameplay is brilliant, fast paced, and unique. I bought that and ended up dissapointed because I found this game average at its best. Even at the end of the day I didn't expect too much from it, no matter how many people recommended it, but still deep inside I expected something at least better than what it looked like, and this wasn't the caseBit Trip Runner is a bad game? nah, its not, just because you see that red downvoting hand doesn't mean that this game sucks, not really. You may find it entertainingand all but thats about it, not a really memorable indie game tbhThis game took me around 30 hours to unlock everything, including the freaking achievements because whenever I buy a videogame I want to beat it and unlock everything that I can, and these achievements weren't that hard, just annoying, and made my experience way longer that it had to be, because I couldn't find any replay value, once you unlock everything that's it for this game, same thing happened me with the sequel. And speaking of which, people also claim that the sequel was uperior because they made runner ""better"" and with more variety, and the only variety there were some minimal thing that didn't make it harder, hell I thought it was way more easier since they made the hit detection more merciful on the sequel, because on the first runner whenever you thought you collected the golden bar you ended up losing because you missed by one pixel. The only variety on Runner 2 is that you can play as other characters and actually find alternative exits that you need to follow in order to unlock stuffBoss fights are pointless, they are basically an extra level for each zoneOne last thing, this game is supposed to be a rythm game but Guitar Hero was more of a rythm game than this, here you have a generic bgm for each zone (there are 3 zones with 12 levels each, including the ""boss"" level) and whenever you collect these red crosses the bgm changes a bit, and every obstacle that you dodge makes a silly sound. When you keep dodging the secuence it kind of plays a melody but it doesn't have that kind of an impact unlike GH, some people may find it charming but not meTL;DR meh, wouldn't reccomend this nor its sequelwant a hard game?

												""So many times I had to change the pain to laughter."" ""BIT.TRIP RUNNER"" is the type of unforgiving rhythm game that will put you through hell, right up until the completion of the last level. But with pain, comes gain, and although most of your screaming will be through anger at hitting that one block or missing the last piece of gold, nothing is better than the reward you feel after crossing that finish line. ""BIT.TRIP RUNNER"" is perfect for the rhythm gamer, and a definite buy for any completionist, wanting a challenge.~PanHeath			",88,14,6,6,7,1,2

												I'm really not one for ""runners"" or difficult platformers and this game still has me hooked. Good challenge, awesome soundtrack, and a devlishly utilized aesthetic. I don't see myself growing to love this genre but all the BIT.TRIP games are all quality so it's no wonder I enjoy this. Yet another woefully neglected Humble Bundle game I took way to long to pick up in earnest.There are some disappointments, though. There's very often forced moments of rote memorization rather than reliance on reflex and skill. The ""rhythm"" component of this game is a bit of an undertone rather than a core component of the game as well. And worst of all, despite how lightweight it is, it still manages to drop some frames on my laptop gpu (Intel HD 3000) and turning off v-sync isn't quite an option due to how visually distracting it is. I honestly dont know what makes a good game in the genre, but those are some things I've noticed. Still a good play.			",144,20,1,12,13,0,12

												Bit.Trip Runner is an insteresting rythem game featureing CommanderVideo. Jump and dodge your way through long roads, collect gold, and defeat some bosses. Stylized with classic 8-bit/3D combination, the game is fun and has some cool tunes to listen to. Although only containing 3 zones each with 11 challenges and a boss fight, it's also very difficult at times. When you mess up, you have to go all the way back to the begining, and you wouldn't belive how many times that's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, espicially when I'm close to finishing a level. So if your in the mood for some good rythem game action, I highly recommend this game.			",74,16,1,2,3,2,1

												This is an semi-rhythm, auto-scrolling platformer where you time your actions to avoid death.  Your basic actions are jump, kick, block, and duck -- and combinations of those.  Pretty simple stuff, but the challenging part is to do this quickly without too much error.  This is really a test of hand-eye coordination and memory (due to the levels being the same each time).  Rhythm and music are a key part of this game, but the game also relies on non-rhythmic actions as well.  As for any negatives, I have read some complaints about levels not having check points.  The lack of level check points is actually part of the appeal!  But do consider that the levels take no more than three minutes to complete so it's not as if you are losing a lot of invested time here when you die.  And speaking of dying, you will die a lot but in a fun and challenging way.  In the end, this is one of those games that doesn't look all that fun until you actually play it.  I've fallen in love with this game, and indeed, it is highly addictive!			",243,49,1,8,12,0,34

												It's Meh  I've heard lots of good things about this game, so I bought it during the Steam Winter Sale. I did not enjoy this game. At first, the game was pretty fun, and I liked it, though I noticed a delay from when I hit a key to when the game responded (I had no lag/framedrop during the time of play) so it made the game difficult to stay on beat, so I found myself starting over quite a bit. This could just be my keyboard, so I don't know. Also, there are no checkpoints. At all. So one little mistake, one little off-beat press of a button, and you are sent all the way back through that 5 minute level you just drudged through.  The game itself is a music/rythm platforming game, however I wouldn't call it a rythm game. It feels more like a memory game. Throughout the game, you must jump, kick, slide, bounce, and reflect to reach the end of the stage. The graphics made me felt like I was going crosseyed while I played, they look good, but they don't mix well with a moving foreground. It made it unenjoyable, and I got headaches from it. This, mixed with the whole jumping and kicking, made it nearly impossible for me to even see what was going on. The rounds would drag on, and on. So, I had to memorize the course, while the backround remains stationary with a moving foreground, with a delay on me hitting buttons.  Here is the most enjoying part. The music. I loved it, except, every time you die, you get sent back to the beginning. Meaning that the music starts over with it. So you will be hearing the same du-du-dun-dun-dun-du-dun ... du-du-dun-dun-dun-du-dun ... du-du-dun-dun-dun-du-dun over and over again. I know I said I loved the music, but I couldn't love it enough from the constant restarting. Also, a lot of the songs sound the same, the music is put together from you ""staying on beat"" with the music. Staying on beat is used loosely (see above paragraph). I liked this aspect, you were making the music as you played along. The music progressively got better and better as you played, unless you miss one of those power-ups that up you, and the music. That part bugged me, but it is my fault for not being good enough, it made me want to replay the level and try to hear the music to it's full potential.  The graphics, they are really good. It's a mix of a stationary backround and a moving foreground, which I hated, but even though I hated how they pulled it off, they looked very good. So credit where it's due.  So, to close this review, here are the pros and cons of this game.Pros:Good music, good graphics, fun to play, bonus levels are repetetive, but fun, a bit of replay value in there.Cons:Repetetive music, headache inducing graphics, late controls, lack of checkpoints makes the game very unforgiving, not a rythym but instead a memory game.   I did not enjoy BIT.TRIP RUNNER and I do not believe it is worth the $10 it is being sold for currently. I'm glad I paid for it during the sale for much, much, cheaper. I have no words for the sequel, as I have not played it. Some may find it okay, if they don't have the late controls or headaches, but I did not like BIT.TRIP RUNNER.			",99,9,1,4,13,3,4

												I really tried to like this game, but wow frustrtion != fun.  I died more times to steps than any other obstacle in this game, no checkpoints for the levels I tried, and doing the same set of precision jumps 15 times in the same level doesn't make them harder, just more annoying.  I'm sure somebody likes these kind of games, but it's for sure not me.Pros: Fun concept with the music and pretty responsive controls.Cons: Devoid of all fun for me, especially frustrating when you fail on steps right before the end of a level.

												I am so disappointed with this game. I really wanted it to be a rythm game, but it's not. You have to jump or slide before the obstacle. The obstacle is on the beat, so you have to move a little bit ahead, and totally of the beat with no notion of tempo. It is actually easier to play without the music, because if you follow the music, you always move too late. I'm really disappointed, because I like the theme and the music, but the game is totally unplayable if you take the tempo into account.			",25,4,0,4,3,0,0

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a game that hails to the pre-NES gaming era. This game has the player performing well timed jumps, slides and other moves, usually in a rhythmic fashion, to collect gold bars and avoid obstacles. BIT.TRIP RUNNER was a well received game and it seems that this game has a lot of indie cred but my experience playing this game contrasted to what I hear in the reviews has me wondering if I'm playing the right game or if I need to drill down into an option menu somewhere to enable the good content. The art style is distinctive and appealing and the game itself does have it's moments, however it forces you to endure quite a bit of tedium to get to a meager portion of enjoyable gameplay. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a game that requires very price timing and rythmn and a single half-second delay will mean restarting the level in most cases. The first 20 seconds or so of each level will insult you by being boring and unchallenging and due to the nature of this game that first 20 seconds of gameplay will be what you experience most as any mishap will transport you back to the beginning. I'm not advocating making the game easier as I appreciate a challenge but I don't appreciate being forced to repeat uninteresting gameplay several times over.  Many levels seem to be laden with challenges that can be fun at first but are repeated ad nauseum and end up feeling like a gimmick (for instance there will be a staircase in almost every level that requires consecutive jumps). These challenges quickly become tedius and only serve as a mechanism to return you once again to the boring part of the level. Levels can get quite long too so the chances you'll be repeating uninteresting gameplay is quite high. I've read comments about the game's soundtrack and the menu options do feature Anamanaguchi in the menu and credits the actual game's music is boring most of the time as it requires progress in the level to become interesting. I wonder why the game's music didn't feature Anamanaguchi as well. If you're looking for a game that's challenging and requires a high level of precision and quick reactions, although the format is different, other popular indie titles like Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV do a better job. Super Meat Boy's short levels and VVVVVV's room based format allow these games to respect the player's time. Score: 5/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												Super Meat Boy is designed correctly. This is not. I saw someone compare this game to shoving pinecones up your own♥♥♥♥♥That's pretty accurate.The main problem with this game is that the game throws a lot of stuff at you that you can't predict beforehand, at which point you will die, because you aren't given enough time to react. Then you will be sent to the start of the level, and play through the level (a minute or two) until you get to the same place. If you guessed correctly as to how to beat what just killed you, you get to be killed by the next thing. Just try and beat the last two stages of World 1-- Marathon, and the boss. It's pretty damn frustrating.Typical level progress:<- n ->[..........] ^[--.......] |[----....] n/c[-----...] |[-------]V=> time to beat level is O(n^2) because screw you that's whySo why is Super Meat Boy properly designed, when this isn't? Mostly because Super Meat Boy's levels are a lot shorter, and because you can see what's ahead before you throw yourself at it and die. Playing Bit.TRIP Runner is like playing a version of Guitar Hero where any missed note will fail you out of the song. Also, Bit.TRIP feels very rigid. It's a timing-based game where your movements form a song, except the resulting song normally isn't that good and your movements are rigid as hell.1/10 for effort			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't use swear words, but when I do, it's because of Odyssey level.And then the boss level has the whackiest hitboxes. I kicked the purple thing, but I'm still hit by it? Really?Why do I not recommend? Unlike Runner2, this game is not even close to enjoyable. A lot of the difficulty lies in two things:-being able to successively repeat measures-rote memorization (especially for the first boss, as it's near impossible to ""just react."")In fact, I could think about other things, like my life and what better things I could be doing with my time while I go through the 30th try through Odyssey because all it contains is the same set of manuevers repeated 4 times over...What do I recommend? Get Runner2 - way more enjoyable, much more variety, and the ability to actually react to what's next, rather than attempting to memorize the level...			",26,3,0,3,1,0,0

												An awful mash up of music games and platformers. At best its a button pushing simulator, at worst its a form of psychological torture. This game forces you to clear your mind and focus on the mind numbing boredom of their terrible music, timing your jumps with vauge visual cues from the distances of things. If you're looking for a music based runner, play melody's escape it's everything you want and more. If you're looking for a hard platformer, try super meat boy. But this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't even a good difficult It's just punishing. You have to go through ridiculously long easy sections between the hard. While in super meatboy you're at the difficult sections again near instantly.			",198,54,0,17,22,1,28

												I genuinely wanted to like this game: it manages to make the unholy trinity of auto-scrolling/run, reaction times and collectibles into genuinely fun and compelling gameplay. I was thoroughly enjoying the game up until the last level of the first block of stages.There are no checkpoints in these levels, once you die you go all the way back to the start. While this presents no issue for the standard shorter levels, this becomes something of a hindrance in the aforementioned one. At first you may trip up on early obstacles which doesn't matter too much, but when you find yourself three-quarters of the way through a level and mis-time a button press for the tenth time you start to get frustrated and worn out. You eventually start making stupid mistakes earlier in the level and then give up.There are two schools of thought about this design choice:1) I, the writer, am awful at video games and should be removed from the public and placed in a retirement home so that the mean games can no longer make me feel like a useless idiot.2) Not having checkpoints is a♥♥♥♥♥♥move that artificially pads out the game time and gates it off to people who either don't possess the time, reactions or patience to endure this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Based on your preference you should know whether this game is for you or not.

												Be prepared to develop an extreme love-hate relationship with BIT.TRIP RUNNER. It's an excellent side-scrolling platformer, but it's relentlessly unforgiving and hard as hell. Be warned upfront: there are no check points! In retrospect it works well and fits the game, check points would have made it too easy and casual - if that's what you're after then grab RUNNER 2.In many ways this game throws me back to the 80s in its simplicity, but it retains a modern gaming appeal and atmosphere that will keep you coming back for more and more... and more... and more. It's one of those 'just one more try' games. The modern take on 8 bit graphics is really good and brings the world to life. The music is great and never became repetitive like some people mentioned in their reviews. In fact, the music was one of the highlights of the game for me and always set the perfect mood.BIT.TRIP RUNNER occupies a pretty unique space when compared to typical platformers, and I can't think of any other game that competes with it head on. It's perfect for short, fun bursts of gaming and is guaranteed to test your platforming skills, no matter how seasoned you think you are. If you're in two minds about buying it, take the plunge. It's selling at the right price and well worth the money. If you can pick it up on special then it's an absolute no-brainer... even if it's not on special, I'd consider it a must buy and must play.

												BIT. TRIP RUNNER is a runner game: you take control of a character that is running and it's up to you to avoid obstacles by kicking them, by sliding under them, by jumping over them, etc.. If you don't, you'll begin the run again and loose every gold or bonus obtained. If you can do a 100%, you can play a retro-challenge level.However, you have to make sure that the mapping of the keys is suiting you, else, you'll make many mistakes. Besides, you need to be coordinated: you jump but you need to immediately slide, in other words, some parts are really tricky. And if you miss a jump and touch a stair, you're sent back to the beginning as I don't recall any checkpoint.Anyway, the challenge is real, as at one point, I couldn't pass 1-4. I did it since but the difficulty is sometimes too much for me, so, I had to abandon the idea to finish it and to unlock more achievements.The graphics are those of retro-gaming: with pixels. And it's not desserving the game. The soundtrack is also an excellent point. It's very well suited.Anyway, BIT. TRIP RUNNER is a good little game, well-done and that is worthy of at least being tried.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												Be prepared to develop an extreme love-hate relationship with BIT.TRIP RUNNER. It's an excellent side-scrolling platformer, but it's relentlessly unforgiving and hard as hell. Be warned upfront: there are no check points! In retrospect it works well and fits the game, check points would have made it too easy and casual - if that's what you're after then grab RUNNER 2.In many ways this game throws me back to the 80s in its simplicity, but it retains a modern gaming appeal and atmosphere that will keep you coming back for more and more... and more... and more. It's one of those 'just one more try' games. The modern take on 8 bit graphics is really good and brings the world to life. The music is great and never became repetitive like some people mentioned in their reviews. In fact, the music was one of the highlights of the game for me and always set the perfect mood.BIT.TRIP RUNNER occupies a pretty unique space when compared to typical platformers, and I can't think of any other game that competes with it head on. It's perfect for short, fun bursts of gaming and is guaranteed to test your platforming skills, no matter how seasoned you think you are. If you're in two minds about buying it, take the plunge. It's selling at the right price and well worth the money. If you can pick it up on special then it's an absolute no-brainer... even if it's not on special, I'd consider it a must buy and must play.

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is an interesting retro-looking, rhythm & platforming game. The game starts out simple enough, the first few levels only requiring one to use the jump button, adding a kick, duck/slide and block (certain projectiles only) later on.There are 3 difficulties to choose from, Easy, Normal & Perfect. Unfortunately, Normal was testing my patience before I was halfway thru the first zone. The reason being: there are no checkpoints during the levels. None. Sometimes this isn't that big of a deal, but when attempting the last couple of levels in a zone it's incredibly annoying because these levels are way longer than the others.Upon completion of a level perfectly (by grabbing all the gold & the plus shaped power-ups), a bonus level awaits with graphics like that of the Atari classic, Pitfall. In these bonus levels one hit and it's over. There's no restarting at the beginning. You will have to complete the level perfect again to try the bonus level and aim for a perfect on it.RUNNER consists of three zones of 11 levels (and a bonus level for each one) plus a boss level, which could have you spending quite a bit of time trying to get perfects on everything. Recommended, but be warned that the lack of checkpoints and the frustrating difficulty might not be for everyone.			",517,146,9,63,36,4,72

BIT.TRIP RUNNERA throwback to the 8bit era of fiendishly tricky platform games, reminiscent of games like Jumping Jack on the ZX Spectrum.Rating 5/10The first thing you'll learn about BIT.TRIP RUNNER is that it's a game that requires perfect timing and precision as well having to memorise level layouts and obstacles as there are no checkpoints and that each level has to be completed in a single run as failure returns you to the beginning of the level.This requirement of a perfect run is both what makes and breaks Bit.Trip Runner. At its best it's a gloriously fluid experience as you meticulously learn the obstacles on a level and the feeling of exhilaration when you manage to pull of a perfect run. However it's also at times an incredibly frustrating experience. There are a handful of levels that are too long which can lead to extended attempts to the point of quitting and some obstacles require such pin-point precision that means failure towards the end of the level is a maddening experience as you watch your character revert back to the start. However if you stick with it your perseverance is rewarded.There is much to recommend in Bit.Trip runner, from the visuals, music and the challenge but I would only recommend it to those who like an old fashioned challenge, for those who like their games to be unforgiving and to reward patience and practise as well as precision.

												I haven't dumped too much time into this one yet.  No more than an hour.  Already it has infected my mind with it's mechanics of obstacles and collectables becoming additions to the music as well as the score.  Oh and there's the B button.  Took me forever to figure out what it did.  My score began to plummet the second I did.  The B button allows you to shift the key up or down for the next note.The levels may be identical on each playthrough, but trying to spin the track for your own personal edification on the same set of buttons that handles your jumping is...tricky.I'm not certain where fun entered into this.  It's just sort of totally engrossing.  I recomend you never buy this and just shoot heroin instead.  I can't stop thinking about this game.  it's been like 2 weeks.			",266,25,2,25,8,1,28

												You run at blazing speeds through sidescrolling levels jumping over, sliding under and kicking obstacles while collecting gold and multipliers.  Everyone gets the same score on the level by collecting all the gold, then there's a bonus level afterward which is the place you earn your spot on the leaderboards by collecting more gold than others have.  Meaning if you want to try at a higher score you have to redo the entire level just to play the bonus level again, which is a surprisingly stupid mechanic.  Game's alright for a brief romp and does take some skill and reflex, but ultimately it's just that -- alright.  People who love the indie retro graphics/tunes scene will squee.

												    this game is so great. do not listen to the people that posted negative reviews. they say its too hard and repetitieve but the just need to git good. admitedly there is a dificulty and learning curve, but if the haters would stop raging and  get past level 4 they wouldknow that this game is creative, varied, and fun.     but don't get me wrong this game is balls to the walls hard.  especially when you get to zone 3.  you will spend weeks if not months on certain levels and you will rage...a lot , but beating the level is so rewarding you will quickly lose the rage.  10/10 just keep  playing DO NOT STOP PLAYING FOREVER IN YOUR RAGE.

												Commander Video runs from left to right and you have to help him jump, slide and kick his way thru various obstacles. Every time you jump, Slide or whatever past an obstacle a little musical note is played, Power-ups fill out the background music. So during the best parts of the game a little jaunty tune is played as your kicking, sliding and jumping. Collect all the gold on a level to get a bonus retro challenge level. So the game seems to come down to memorization and synchronized button mashing. Once you get to a tricky part and miss something you have to start the level over again. I needed to replay a level many times before getting the timing or whatnot to a tricky part down. And then the next tricky part after it comes along. Needless to say I would eventually make it thru the level. But with only 3 or 4 more levels to go, I just don't care anymore. Now maybe in the bad old days when all you had were a handful of games to play at any one time I would have finished this game. Today I have over 60 games I haven't played yet, So it's time to move on.Edit - It's an OK game, Marginal thumbs up.			",82,30,1,7,15,1,15

												GAME: BIT.TRIP RUNNERBUYING PRICE: N/A (GIFTED)RATING: 8/10This action platformer was quite better than originally expected, if I bought the game at its current price rather than getting it as a free gift I think this game would have been worth it. Not much to say more than this game is quite difficult and requires a sense of rythm as a platformer with an appealing soundtrack. Difficult is enough to suffice playing over the same level multiple times to get the highest score but may seem relatively boring after a few levels due to the monotonous task one might be doing, however I always find myself coming back and progressing further. The art is simple and slick with interesting 3D background and ambient events to add to the experience. I recommend this game at its current price of £1.39. ",54,2,0,3,3,0,5

												Not much to say...run, jump, slide, shield, kick! A lot of fun, only problem is the progression of the difficulty. I believe it is Level 1-11, ""Odyssey"", that was so incredibly difficult for it's point in the game. It is debatably on par with the last few levels of the entire game, and they stuck it at the end of world 1. It's not that horrible, but it definitely seemed like a questionable design choice when I played it. Also, I was a little saddend that to get the hardest achievements, you have to ace all of the bonus levels simply because of the fact that to get a bonus level, you have to ace a normal level, and if you make a mistake in a bonus level, you have to redo both the normal and bonus level. Can't really count it against the game, it's just frustrating having to replay easy levels repeatedly. Great game to get for $2.50 or less.			",547,184,11,74,40,7,70

												This game is INCREDIBLY punishing. Unlike the sequel, there are no checkpoints, and timing is very prescise if you are aiming for the gold. However, that doesn't make a bad game. The steep difficulty makes every stage ""Perfect""ed an accoplishment, and finishing the area that much more rewarding. The retro graphics fit very well with this game. It helps to concentrate on wat you're doing rather than the .vtfs and shaders. I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for a challenge. ",114,18,3,14,10,1,15

												Like the other Bit.Trip games, Bit.Trip Runner combines cool, catchy music with quick, fluid gameplay. The one main difference that I've noticed between Runner and the other Bit.Trip games is that Runner makes you learn from your mistakes. When you accidentaly hit an obstacle, despite how far you are in the level, you are instantly transported back to the beginning. This can be frustrating, but well worth it becasue it ensures that you perfect a level before you can move on. The game steadily gets more difficult and intricate as the game progresses by adding new challenges and obstacles for you to face. Still, Bit.Trip Runner is a great game and well worth the time to play it.			",179,31,4,22,24,3,47

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a good game, if you have the patience and good timing. With a background distracting you with crazy effects it is hard to concentrate on timing perfect jumps or slides, making the game confusing and difficult. However dispite it's difficulty I had a lot of fun playing the first chapter of this game, but didn't like the repetitiveness of some of the levels.   I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge. (and doesn't mind their eyes hurting after playing)			",154,17,1,20,15,0,29

I had fun with this but honestly it's just a polished mobile game for $10. I mean it's fun and challengeing to complete the levels rather than endless running but i still think there are better options for $10 if you really like a mix of rythum and platform and a challenge get this game. 5.5/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

This game didn't give me it since it has some parts that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off since  i had to rejoin it like 30 times. However, it is not that hard either.  It s a nice game and you gonna enjoy it surely but sometimes i couldn't difference at all the objects from the scenario and the background... that, in a fast game, is unacceptable... but appart from it i have no more things to point out.About the price: Just take it in a deal.

			BIT.TRIP RUNNER and BIT.TRIP RUNNER2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien. Both games are fantastic indie arcade games. They are sweet and simple but very challenging and with great music to boot.		

BIT.TRIP RUNNER: A great little arcade game that is sure to challenge you in a variety of ways. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a challenging game in it of itself and requires quick reflexes as well as patience. While it is simplistic the game offers a hidden layer of depth that is only marred by some basic design choices. Levels are fun…for a while, they become stale and repetitive since there is only ever one way to go and if you fail you must start over at the beginning of the level, so repeating the same sections over and over may not appeal to some and may frustrate even the most seasoned of gamers. Music and style are perfect for this game, it’s hard to imagine it looking nor sounding any different, the music has a great retro beat that suits the game well and the 16-bit retro style of the game gives it charm, as well as being creative and colorful which helps nail down the fast pace action it’s trying to drive.  Overall, BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a nice simple arcade game with fantastic music; it’s challenging and may seem unfair with overly long levels and may frustrate some gamers with having to repeat sections over and over. If you love a tough challenge, retro looking games or a game with great music for $10.00 USD it may be a bit much, however when on sale this game is easily worth it. You can also enjoy the game and support the developers by purchasing the awesome soundtrack that is also for sale. Either way BIT.TRIP RUNNER is certainly a game to consider adding to the collection of fun and challenging arcade games.-Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork ",349,48,4,71,30,3,49

												Super Tripping Game!Amazing soundtrack, mostly effects, actually and frenetic gameplay. You'll need all of your skills, reflexes and a good memory to achieve high levels.However it gets frustrating too sometimes, as you may have to repeat a level over and over and it won't be enough. Mostly I liked the game so far and i still haven't defeated the boss on 1:12. Some checkpoints would have been appreciated.			",612,223,27,58,46,11,72

												Like Bit Trip Beat, I recommend this because it's an experience and the music is amazing, but like Bit Trip Beat, the gameplay really gets in the way of it.Gameplay just isn't fun, and it's super frustrating to mistime something by a nano second and then get sent to the beginning of a stage again.  The game demands an unnecessry amount of perfection and that annoys me.But yeah, like bit trip, I might just dislike it because I'm bad and the game doesn't endear me enough to get better at it.  Check it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Finished Wii version, re-boght on Steam.) BIT.TRIP RUNNER is an auto-runner. You have no control over Commander Video's movement speed, and your only interactions are jumping, ducking, kicking, and blocking objects that block your path.   The main difference between BIT.TRIP RUNNER and other auto-runners is that obstacles aren't randomly generated or placed in every stage, and instead appear in a set rhythm and melody to the music. As you collect gold bars and dodge obstacles, you fill in various bits of each stage's song, and the more power-up cores you find, the more intense the music gets and the higher your score will soar. The game is HIGHLY focused on immediate reaction, and if that's not your cup of tea, then your pattern memorization skills will be put to the ultimate test. RUNNER has a relatively smooth start to try and ease you into the experience, but if you're to complete the game then your execution is going to have to be near-flawless. There are no mid-stage checkpoints to save you, and one missed jump means being thrown back to the beginning of a stage to try again. It's easy to get caught up in a flurry of ""just one more try""s, but that satisfaction isn't quite the same as you'd get from something like Super Meat Boy or Rogue Legacy. RUNNER can be rote almost to a fault, and it'll probably take people that enjoy very specific types of linear challenges to enjoy it. If there's one major issue with the game it's that there are some crazy intense swings and spikes in difficulty. Stage 1-11 - ODYSSEY will probably be enough to shut down most that aren't dedicated to trying to see the game to its end, and there are more than a few other bad apples in the bunch whose level of challenge can feel a bit excessive considering the game's lack of checkpointing. It's all doable with the right amount of practice, but again, if that kind of rote memorization isn't for you, it may be best to pass on this one. Otherwise, game on. It's a fantastic game with great music, a fun aesthetic, and engaging gameplay for those of us that like a little something different in rhythm games.			",280,60,2,29,8,1,17

												Bit. Trip Runner is a simple but pretty fun game. Your task is basically to avoid obstacles by jumping, sliding, springing or blocking at just the right time in order to complete increasingly difficult levels. One mistake sets you back to the start of the level. This can get frustating especially towards the end with the last two levels in particular being very tough. I would say a bit similar to the likes of Cook Serve Delicious in that the gameplay consists only of accurate sequences of button presses but here timing is very important.

												I've never felt so frustrated by a game before that I felt inclined to uninstall it.This game is brutal in its timing, but it doesn't feel fair. The time windows for some jumps are very deceptive, and you're punished by being sent to the very beginning of the level every time for making very small mistakes. I expected a rythm based platformer, or something close to that, but it's almost impossible to follow along with any tempo. You basically just have to play over, and over again to memorize the level layout-- which isn't fun at all. I would say maybe, just maybe the game would have some redeeming factors if the music was any good, but it's pretty bland. Maybe I'm just really bad, but the game overall feels highly unrewarding. The level design feels unexciting, and beating levels feels like a chore.I would not recommend.			",76,10,0,2,1,1,7

												A compilation of very bad gameplay choices to make an over challenging, over-punishing game that leaves the player with no sense of fun. Merely a challenge of how long you can stand the masochism till you give up and walk away. Cluttered graphics that make it hard to tell what buttons you're meant to be pressing, fast-based scrolling which means sometimes you can only win by remembering level layouts, little-to-no margin for error with the only punishment of sending you back the the start of what can be a very long level.There's also jittery frame-rates on even high-end systems to add to the difficulty adding to the final opinion that once again Gaijin Games proves that it can make pretty and nice sounding things, but it can't make fun games.

												This is kind of funny, but not as good as I expected. There's really not much to it except jumping over barrels and platforms, sliding under things, collecting coins. You're constantly running, so you have no other control over movement. This could be designed as a tablet game. The soundtrack is pretty nifty - arguably the best part of the game, but not something I'd pay separately for, either. Some bad rainbow jokes which don't make any sense to me.

												It's well made, the sound/music is a great throwback to 8bit retro music (But aren't all indie games like that?) and it's indie.That's where the goodness of this game ends.This game is basically a fustrating version of guitar hero. You make ONE slip-up throughout the whole game and you have to start the whole level over again, and the levels are pretty long. It's like taking Temple Run and making it so fustrating that it's no longer fun.Just stay away. If you want a fustrating game, just go pick-up Super Meat Boy or the AVGN Adventure Game. All much better than this game. ",293,64,23,23,50,3,33

												Overly punishing platformer that requires route memorization over reflexes.  The later levels have some of the tightest (in a bad way) obstacle placements I've ever seen in a game. No actual ""rhythm"" to the game, either: the sounds are made as you hit the collectable objects or avoid obstacles, but there's no real rhythm to the way the obstacles are placed.  The music is OK, but you are hard pressed to enjoy it as you're probably gritting your teeth as you do the level the 95th time.  Avoid this for better platformers such as Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Joy.			",222,40,3,40,12,2,41

												Ahh what can I say about bittrip runner. On the one hand you have a classic rythm expierience, set to catchy 8bit music and a  chalenging game where you get to run full speed through traps and obstacles. I know I have always been a sucker for the   look of games like this. But despite this, all I could think about while playing was the lack of simple CHECKPOINTS! I mean if any game needed to have them this would be it. The new runner2 had these, so why not this one? For instance A tool that could let you place points while you were you wanted while running and would take off points for using them, would have made the game 100% more enjoyable. Every time I almost make it to the finish then jump a split second to soon or late, I felt that the only thing that kept me playing was the same feeling that keeps you trying to win a prize in one of those machines at the mall. You think: well maybe if i just try once more I will get it.Also despite it being a classic there was a definite lack of story through the game. Basically your just plopped down in the world and start running, no explanation, no nothing. This being said, I still had fun with it at points and Im not saying that runner1 is a bad game, its just not nessesarily a good game. If you want to try it out make sure you get it on sale.

												While I love the characters and the music is fun, this game messes with my vision and everything feels incredibly hard. Maybe this is because I'm not a veteran of the side-scrolling genre, but the issue is this: everytime you make a mistake on a level, you are sent back to the very beginning of that level. So, if you are a couple minutes into your run and you are close to completion but then you flub, you are sent back to the very beginning of that run. In this sense, it is brutal and without mercy. This, parred with the fact that the graphics and the side-scrolling motion have such a negative effect on my eyes, this is unfortunately something that I cannot recommend, but I wish I could because I do enjoy the characters.

												I bought this on discount a while back, didn't like but gave it now another chance. I played through the first two worlds and but still didn't get into it. I suppose wasn't really in target audience even though I generally like platformers, simple gameplay mechanics and rhythm games.The thing is, while the music is great, this isn't really a rhythm game. If you try to react to rhythm, you're too late and therefore the beat can be offsetting. This is purely skill game but unfair to my liking. Reaction time on first try is often very small and advancing becomes purely trial and error. You just have to memorize everything. I suppose getting through a level is satisfying at times.Art direction looks forced to me. Just by making everything out of blocks doesn't make it look retro in good way. I also found background distracting in second ""world"".Some levels were fun and on discounts this game is dirt cheap. To me this just isn't fun nor the gameplay or challenge addicting and therefore I cannot recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I didn't get very far. Only level 1-7 before I just stopped and said enough of this.Okay, BIT.TRIP RUNNER isn't a bad game. It's just frustrating because it wants you to learn from your mistakes by basically forcing you to repeat the level from the beginning if you hit an object or wall. I won't say I didn't  learn from my mistakes, I just have terrible reaction timing to incoming objects and sometimes hit the wrong button in running platformers such as this. This isn't Mario where you can assess the situation; you literally have to dodge stuff as they come at you; or rather as you're running at it.Otherwise, the cool rhythm music and simple pixelated graphics are fun and vibrant. But there isn't much of a story and you're literally just pushing the same five buttons to maneuver around objects. Gets repetitive and tiring.8.0/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

Sometimes you might want to try the bonus stage over again, but to do this, you have to play the whole stage over again (getting all the gold and powerups of course), so to 100% the game can get a bit tedious.

												For $10, no. If you get it from some sort of bundle where it amounts to $1, then go ahead, because this game is worth just that $1. The length of the game is longer than it needs to be because of the constant retries over unfair jumps. All it is is trial and error and memorization. Don't forget to add the same beat that you'll be hearing for an hour straight, because that doesn't drive someone insane at all..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrid game whose idea of difficulty is having too much activity on the screen, mis-matched music to platforming, and tops it all off with an unforgiving collision system that will count a jump as being ""missed"" even though everything looks fine on the screen.This game had some promise as one of the first endless runner type games and could have been interesting or told a fun story instead of giving the player zero notion of progress except a leaderboard system that died alongside arcade machines.Don't buy it and don't waste your time with it.

												I would give BIT. TRIP RUNNER a 5/10. BTR is a music and rhythm game, where you must perform a simple set of platforming moves to music. As you progress through the level, you can collect gold pieces or bonuses that allow each gold bar to be worth more. Each of these upgrades adds new levels of musical melody and harmony, making the music more complex and beautiful.Whenever your character that you control collects a gold piece, smashes through a box, or jumps over a cavern, the game reflects that by making a musical sound within the realm of the song. Your character, in essence, can add to the song, which is pretty cool. The music itself sounds great, an electronic, pulsing rhythm. You progress through 3 ""worlds"" each with a different setting, and each world has a dozen or so levels. Each world has similar style tunes, and each level within that world is slightly varied from the one before.As cool as the levels are though, I still don't recommend this game. The main thing that is frustrating is that you can make zero mistakes throughout the course of the level in order to beat it. While getting gold pieces does make the music sound better and gives higher scores you don't have to get it. But if you run into a block that can't be broken or miss jumping a gap, at all, through the whole level, for each level, you must start over at the beginning of that level.I am fine for having a difficult game, but some levels are quite hard and require precision, and sometimes the levels can have a lot going on to watch for. This can make it frustrating to practice the level a lot but see zero progress. Many of the later levels especially have a somewhat cheap mechanic at the end of the levels, that throw something random at you just as you feel you are near the end. Think you are done? Nope a random purple block with no leadup from the music or other channels after you are simply running on a flat path for 5 seconds takes you out and you start over, ending your perfect run.Because of that I can't recommend it. If you get it for a good price and are up for the challenge or like rhythm and music games, it may be worth a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like rhythm-based games, then DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Having been a fan of rhythm games that tie gameplay to music, I find this game almost unplayable. In fact, the only way I could play the game is with the music off. That's not to say the music in the game is bad.You see, the game is inherently flawed because instead of matching the game's sound output to the player's controller input, it matches it to the game objects. You don't jump to the music's beat, you have to jump slightly before it. This means you have to constantly fight against the music to jump, slide, and kick slightly BEFORE the beat, instead of with the beat. Considering the game's difficulty increases very early on, it's very difficult for me to play any more. If they had an offset function that allowed me to adjust the gameplay with the sound ala Stepmania, that would make this game playable.			",231,67,3,18,12,2,24

												Providing a colorfol and musical romp that will likely entertain you for all of about half an hour, Bit.Trip Runner presents itself as a hybrid platformer-action-rhythm game, but it can be easily summed up as ""Perform the required command at exactly the required moment to progress,""; there isn't any true freedom in deciding how to move through the levels beyond ""jump here or die,"" and it quickly becomes an exercise in trial-and-error and mindless repetition. This title would have been better off with an autoplay feature so the programming could run through each level for you as a mildly entertaining 8-bit music video. There are multitudes of significanly more worthwhile rhythm-based games than this available, and I wholly recommend any one of those over Beat.Trip Runner.			",224,28,2,25,8,1,30

												Ahh what can I say about bittrip runner. On the one hand you have a classic rythm expierience, set to catchy 8bit music and a  chalenging game where you get to run full speed through traps and obstacles. I know I have always been a sucker for the   look of games like this. But despite this, all I could think about while playing was the lack of simple CHECKPOINTS! I mean if any game needed to have them this would be it. The new runner2 had these, so why not this one? For instance A tool that could let you place points while you were you wanted while running and would take off points for using them, would have made the game 100% more enjoyable. Every time I almost make it to the finish then jump a split second to soon or late, I felt that the only thing that kept me playing was the same feeling that keeps you trying to win a prize in one of those machines at the mall. You think: well maybe if i just try once more I will get it.Also despite it being a classic there was a definite lack of story through the game. Basically your just plopped down in the world and start running, no explanation, no nothing. This being said, I still had fun with it at points and Im not saying that runner1 is a bad game, its just not nessesarily a good game. If you want to try it out make sure you get it on sale.

												While I love the characters and the music is fun, this game messes with my vision and everything feels incredibly hard. Maybe this is because I'm not a veteran of the side-scrolling genre, but the issue is this: everytime you make a mistake on a level, you are sent back to the very beginning of that level. So, if you are a couple minutes into your run and you are close to completion but then you flub, you are sent back to the very beginning of that run. In this sense, it is brutal and without mercy. This, parred with the fact that the graphics and the side-scrolling motion have such a negative effect on my eyes, this is unfortunately something that I cannot recommend, but I wish I could because I do enjoy the characters.

												I bought this on discount a while back, didn't like but gave it now another chance. I played through the first two worlds and but still didn't get into it. I suppose wasn't really in target audience even though I generally like platformers, simple gameplay mechanics and rhythm games.The thing is, while the music is great, this isn't really a rhythm game. If you try to react to rhythm, you're too late and therefore the beat can be offsetting. This is purely skill game but unfair to my liking. Reaction time on first try is often very small and advancing becomes purely trial and error. You just have to memorize everything. I suppose getting through a level is satisfying at times.Art direction looks forced to me. Just by making everything out of blocks doesn't make it look retro in good way. I also found background distracting in second ""world"".Some levels were fun and on discounts this game is dirt cheap. To me this just isn't fun nor the gameplay or challenge addicting and therefore I cannot recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First review here:BIT.TRIP RUNNER is an interesting game, but that doesn't mean it's good. In fact, it is the opposite of good, it's a rage game. The only difference is that this rage game has the balls to charge you for this crap.One of the main selling points of this game is the music. Is it good? No, the music is annoyingly repetitive. Although I admit it does sound good for the first 2 levels of the game before you realise that it is practically the same thing over and over. Not only that, but there is no other sound at all. Just the sounds of jumping over rocks and trash cans. Also, there are these 'powerup' things that go from Hyper to Mega to Ultra to Extra, and they make the game sound more lively each time. Sounds cool right? Wrong. The music does get more lively until you get to Extra, which turns the music into low, slow sounds that break up your pacing and eventually leads to you losing the level. Speaking of levels...The level design, don't even get me started on the level design. First of all, no checkpoints? Really? I get that it is a kind of 'music' (if you could even call this music) game so you wouldn't want the 'song' to be broken up, but the game is so insanely difficult that it takes more than 30 minutes for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2 minute level. Who thought this was a good idea? ALso, some of the powerups are in difficult to get places, which is good for a running game like this. The only problem is that some of these powerups are almost completely impossible to get. One powerup involves you jumping down a hole then springing back up. The problem here is that the spring throws you into a wall, which of course kills you instantly.So, the rating is probably what you want to see from this random guy on the internet.2/10 - Not recommended to all who wish to keep their sanity.

												I loved the sequel to this game, so naturally I thought I'd try the first and like it. Oh how wrong I was. I played the second on normal difficulty and of course had issues on some levels, but eventually I overcame them after a few tries. The level difficulty of normal in the first is vastly far from being the same as normal in the second. The 11th level of the 1st world (that's right, the first world) is so insanely difficult, I was about to switch difficulties to save my blood pressure. Then I learned that I'd have to re-do all the levels on easy. Like I'd do that to myself. Eventually, after at least 30+ tries I beat it (didn't get all the gold of course, I was lucky to even reach the finish). Next is the boss level, I thought it couldn't be too bad after the hell I'd just endured. Wrong again. This game is just too hard. It forces you to memorize rather than follow the rhythm. I'll have fun playing the second instead of torturing myself with the first.Oh by the way there are no checkpoints in the first game, go figure.			",56,10,1,11,7,0,4

												This game is hard as ♥♥♥♥. You get an adrenaline rush like no other while being a good bit into a level realizing that one mistake will send you all the way back to the beginning. This could be a huge minus and for some 6 year olds, it is. However when you consider the fact that your character is forced to move at a certain pace whether you want to or not, you'll realize that the complete reset actually isn't that bad, as the play time of each level is already set, it all depends on how much you ♥♥♥♥ up. All positives aside though I would recommend that you eat this game in bites. Purely for health reasons. However the rush that this game gives makes it worth while playing every now and again, just to see if you can get a little further this time.			",123,13,0,9,9,2,3

												Runner is the fourth and highlight game of the original Bit.Trip series by Gaijin, which is basically the Atari classic Pitfall! on steroids. You jump, slide, kick, spring and block to avoid obstacles, while grabbing gold and multiplier power-ups to attain the highest score possible. Overall, it is a musically-addictive and increasingly-intensive game to play frequently and minutes at a time.			",282,139,2,28,29,3,43

												As a ten buck game, it's kinda crappy.BUTAs a 99 cent game, it aint bad.The deal is that there isn't much content in the game for it to be worth more than about 3 dollars. But it is fun, just not to play an hour at time (more like 10 mins at a time, just look at my playtime).So all in all, it's difficult, it's simple, but it's also a fun timekiller.7/10 (if bought for less that 3 dollars)4/10 (if bought for the fool* (#punzferdayz) price)*I'm dreadfully sorry for that pun.

												Don't tell anyone but in this game you have to run. Really, you already knew ? What gave it away ? Anyway, you 'control' a character who can't stop running (really, there's no stopping the guy !). Along the way you have to kick objects, jump over or on them, and even slide under them, as well as collect gold bars. Let me tell you, it's quite the challenge. You have to remember the entire level pattern, so see it as some sort of rhythm game (it really is since it creates music based on your movements) and you get the general idea.Another 'Easy to learn, difficult to master' game ? Check ! It's brilliant though ![Rating: 84/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												I really like this game, but I can't quite say I love it. Some of the levels were just slightly too long to use the ""all or nothing"" game design. And I say that as someone who beat the whole game, so I'm not just whining.Simple checkpoints would not work for the game though. They would take away too much of the challenge, and a decent amount of replaying is necessary to build your skill for future levels.While it's a really fun game, the fact that it's so unforgiving in its difficulty and for minor mistakes makes it hard to have that much fun with it.At first you may experience some kind of input lag. You can become accustomed to it, or lower your settings (Disable V-Sync, change your resolution..). It worked for me!			",884,281,31,96,56,12,122

												This is a reflex based puzzle/game, where you are constantly moving to the right and dodging obstacles while hitting keys/buttons.  Be warned, the graphics flash often, and the constant movement on the screen may cause you to become dizzy from eye strain if an epileptic seizure (from the flashing) doesn't paralyze you first.If you are into masochism, as inflicted by video games, then this title is made for you.  Failure to avoid obstacles results in a total restart of a given level.Fun (for average people): 2/5Fun (for epileptic people): 0/5 (may result in death/seizure)Fun (for people who like Steam Trading Cards and/or Achievements): 5/5Fun (when you realize it only has 3 Card Drops and you can stop playing): 5/5			",460,137,18,85,37,3,78

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a rhythm platformer. The input to this game is similar to that of rhythm games, but instead of colored buttons you have to press, you're given obstacles that you can either jump, slide under, kick or propel over, like a 2D platformer. Every successful action you make creates a sound or note, and the better you play the better the music becomes. The death system in this game is extremely cruel though, one mistake will send you back to the beginning of the level, and this can be really frustrating especially on the boss levels and on the long hard levels. They've ""fixed"" this on the sequel with optional checkpoints, but for those who want a challenge, this first game is the one to play.			",340,111,6,45,24,6,51

												- Jump Jump Jump Duck Duck Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Duck Jump Duck Duck Jump Jump Jump Uninstall LOL -The designers deliberately made the game very hard by the exclusion of checkpoints. You could call this ""sadistic"" or say it's meant to attract only the most diehard platformer fans (of which I am one), but it makes the game inaccessible and artificially extends the playtime. It's a crutch you see used a lot in indie platformers these days. Super Meat Boy was exceptionally hard but had an enormous amount of depth. Bit.Trip Runner is actually a pretty short and shallow experience if you add checkpoints. - Since this is a rhythmic platformer, a large part of the game experience is enjoying the music. But it's incredibly difficult to even get past the first world (of three total), and you don't really hear different music until then. By the time I got there I was so F***ing tired of the music in the first world I never want to play it again. Contrast that to Electronic Super Joy, 140, and Super Meat Boy, where I frequently go back and play levels just to hear the music.- This game is so bad that I'm deleting it from my library.

Posted: December 15, 2014
												I wish I could recommend this game. The idea is really cool especially for something that seems like it may be limited since it's a rail platformer. But there are problems... a lot of problems.Graphics: Look, I'm not going to complain about the graphics being 8bit. That's the style the game wanted to take itself (for the most part), and I'm ok with that. I actually like the basic look of the character and some of the 8bit objects in the world are pretty cool looking too. But then you have to realize that this is a game where the character never stops running. The background, the foreground, the obstacles you have to dodge... it just gets vomit inducing. It just looks so blurry that it hurts to look at this game for very long, and I'm somebody that doesn't get motion sickness very easy. If you get powerups, then the screen pretty much flashes every time you grab a gold piece. In a game where you have to have your eyes taped open to make sure you don't blink and miss a jump, having distractions like that is unforgivable.Gameplay: It's simple, and actually provides entertainment to an extent. At first, it's fun to get pass the slightly challenging obstacles. It feels nice to pass something that seems really difficult on your first try. The problem is this game is seriously one of the most repetitive games I've ever played in my life. I guess you could say a rail platformer that uses only a few buttons will inevitably be pretty repetitive, but they could've done much more with this game. If you play the game and come across a slightly challeging obstacle, you can be damn sure that you'll be doing that same exact obstacle twenty more times through the rest of the game (that's assuming you complete the rest of the game in a perfect run, which you won't)Replayability Value: As stated above, this game is repetitive. At first, it's repetitive because it's really easy, and not much can be done to change the repitition. Later on, it's repetitive because the level design lacks creativity and just rehashes the same things from the last few levels. After that, starting at about world 3-9, it's repetitive because you get killed by something that's actually a new challenge. Then you hit world 3-10 and it's repetitive because that new challenge is being milked for all its worth and is thrown into the next level 4 times and you get killed after completing it because you misjumped and hit the edge of a staircase. So, the replayability value is bad. Keep in mind, this is a game that forces you to start at the beggining of a level after one screw up. Yeah...Soundtrack: At first, I liked the soundtrack. It was interesting and kept me playing the game despite its lackluster gameplay. But just like the level design, they got lazy. The soundtrack sounds the same throughout the entire game. There may be slight changes, but it still sounds so bland after playing for a while. You get a headache from the ugly background, the repetitive music, and the fact that you have to keep playing the beggining of every level 200 hundred times because you can't get through these levels like a robot.Difficulty: Don't even get me started. Personally, this game bored the hell out of me until much later. I'll admit, 1-11 was hard because it was a couple of minutes long, and making a perfect run over a few minutes isn't easy, but I still got through it after several tries. Then the game got boring again. It got boring because the obstacles that I was coming across were the same obstacles I came across ten times in the last map. All of the sudden, I got to 3-9 and out of nowhere the game decided to throw, by far, the hardest obstacles the game has to offer. There was no warning, no slowly scaling diffculty leading up to this point, it just went haywire out of nowhere. But, luckily, it was at the very beggining of the round, so I had a good chance to practice and practice. Finally, I perfected it! Eventually I got pass the level, and even though it was difficult, I stayed positive and continued into the next level. I get through half of the level filled with obstacles I've seen before just to be greeted by this same ♥♥♥♥ing obstacle from 3-9. Then eventually I get to 3-11, and the same ♥♥♥♥ing obstacle once again. I played throughout this entire game and feel like I've only really played 4 different levels.And, don't get me wrong, I don't hate this game because I died a lot. I love Super Meat Boy and that game infuriates me to no end. The difference between this and SMB is that SMB had good level design. They implemented some obstacles you've seen before but they did it in new, clever ways. This game does no such thing. You just do what you did before.I wanted to like this game, but it has only provided me dissapointment and infuriation. Opinions are subjective, so take what you will from this review, but if I could do it all over again I wouldn't even get this game for free, it's just a waste of time that I've only put so many hours into because I'm obsessed with completing it.

												This game is painfully difficult and ultimately more frustrating than fun. There are no checkpoints; one mistake means you have to start all over, and the levels are quite long. Sadly, only the truly hardcore of hardcore gamers and masochists will be capable of finding this enjoyable. Fortunately, its sequel, Runner 2, solves these problems by adding checkpoints and variable difficulty. So skip this one and check out Runner 2 if this kind of game appeals to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its the LAWNMOWER MAN virtual world in 8 bit !!!A great improvement over the BIT.TRIP.BEAT. franchise! If you had to only choose one bit.trip. series, go with Runner. Here's why.Difficult but not sadistic.Faster interface. Get in and play, and quit. While it's still an 8 bit mess, at least you don't have that silly delay waiting for the game to bounce your choice off your paddle...Achievements that can actually be 100%'d. (however there are A+ perfect related ones so prepare yourself..)So much more user imput. With bit.trip.beat. you adjust your paddle with UP or DOWN. that's it. Got real boring real fast. Here you gotta dodge and it requires several buttons. Therefore the gameplay, is much more satisfying compared to .beatTough to perfect, very very tough.

												For some reason, I keep playing this game even if I really suck at it. You play a level by memorizing the jumps, dodges and punches, then you keep trying until you complete it just to experience the few moments of euforia before doing it all over again. The design is clever enough to have loading between dying and trying again, making it easy and (relatively) painless to keep trying. The music changes and intensifies as you pick up some items, giving you both visual and auditorial rewards.I recommend playing with a controller instead of mouse+keyboard.			",284,126,5,61,37,4,69

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is quite simply a 'Simon Says' side-scrolling gauntlet, but instead of memorizing and pressing buttons to tones, you memorize buttons to obstacles in which your ""Runner"" evades or smashes. The game balances more toward frustration than reward. You must complete each gauntlet perfectly otherwise you start over at the beginning. They start out pretty short and easy, but then get much longer and much tougher. I got to a point where the frustration started compounding by making very simple mistakes trying to get to the part where I was stuck. It really needs a practice mode so that you can work on specifically hard spots. I find it much easier to forgo the agony and not play it. Take a pencil, stick it in your eyeball--you'll get the same sensation.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												It's way more frustrating than it's worth for me. The selling point for the game seems to be it's punishing difficulty, at least according to fan defenders on forums. Personally it's a game that I want to enjoy, with interesting visuals and music (the first time you see/hear them), and neoclassical gameplay style (there's really no classic game it's like, it's more similar to Guitar Hero than Mario or Sonic). Unfortunately, every time you miss a step, you get to repeat the entire stage. The music and visuals run very thin, very quickly. The reward for beating an insanely difficult for no apparent reason level is that you've just beaten an insanely difficult for no reason level and can move on to the next one. I've never had this much trouble jumping up a flight of stairs in my life. 2/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												Reminiscent of Canabalt, and just as frustratingly difficult.If you like one shot, click to jump games like Flappy Bird and the wealth of others out there, or are high on some drug of questionable legality, you may enjoy this game.I'm not saying it's a bad game, by any means, it's just not my cup of tea.Plus the fast sidescrolling is almost impossible to focus on and hurts my eyes after a while.If it's on sale, you might wan't to give it a shot.I'm leaving my recommendation as a ""No"", as I don't think it's worth the £6.99 normal pricetag - but that's just my opinion.

												Although purposefully blocky and a tad repetitive, this game is not bad so much as spitefully difficult. The lack of save points means you can die on the last jump right before the end of the stage, a stage that may have already taken 20 less-than-successful tries, and dying means being reset to the beginning of a stage, negating any gold bars you may have obtained.BIT.TRIP RUNNER is not a game conducive to continued sanity. Players beware.			",90,41,0,22,17,0,15

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER reminds me of an acid trip.So I was in Denver, tripping out and I sat down on a planter because I had just left a Ross's with pants one size too small. Me and my friend took a break while we waited for the girls to get back. They'd abandoned us to go to Forever 21 to get outfits for the rave we were going to. Anyways, We were sitting there and all of a sudden a bus passes about 6 inches away from us. My knees almost scrape the side of the bus and I'm staring into the windows of the bus only seeing my reflection and wondering ""Why am I not reacting?""BIT.TRIP RUNNER is fast paced, chaotic and yet at the same time lulls you into a rythm. It grabs hold of your brain despite the bus that almost just took off your legs and says ""Try again.""			",673,155,32,92,55,5,98

												Bit.Trip.Runner is one of those games you'll come back to quite frequently for a quick run through just to enjoy the music and basic gameplay.Gameplay mechanics are standard and timing is everything, but not too intimidating. You'll quickly learn the progressive controls and be hopping, sliding, and kicking with ease. The challenge with the game comes with having to be 100% accurate. One mis-step of timing failure and it's back to the start of the level. Some may say this isn't a big deal, but the levels get quite long and so you quickly realize the smallest flaw killed you mere feet from the finish line.The soundtrack is what truly makes this game standout though. Music is of course a subjective thing, but the gameplay mixed with the semi-chiptune soundtrack made this an engaging experience.			",207,65,6,35,35,4,43

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a one-trick pony, like many indie games. It's a platformer with a neat 8-bit techno soundtrack. Your character runs at a fixed speed, and has to avoid obstacles by jumping, sliding, and kicking. The moves you make are timed to the beat of the soundtrack. That's kind of neat. However, when you miss a jump, slide, or kick, you have to go back to the beginning of the level. That part is not so neat, it's super-annoying.It may not be fair, but it's hard not to compare this game to other recent super-difficult retro indie platformers, like VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a lesser game than those. It's just not very fun.			",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												For some reason, I keep playing this game even if I really suck at it. You play a level by memorizing the jumps, dodges and punches, then you keep trying until you complete it just to experience the few moments of euforia before doing it all over again. The design is clever enough to have loading between dying and trying again, making it easy and (relatively) painless to keep trying. The music changes and intensifies as you pick up some items, giving you both visual and auditorial rewards.I recommend playing with a controller instead of mouse+keyboard.			",284,126,5,61,37,4,69

												This game is annoying and addictive. Bit.Trip Runner is one of those indie games which I looked at and didn't expect all that much from, I was unsure how any of it worked but I only expected a normal indie game with little to it. Of course I was wrong. The graphics are surprisingly good despite the almost retro look and feel, the music actually had an effect on me, even if it was just me humming along. There isn't much story to it, but the game really doesn't need one. the controls are confusing and fast, but introduced slowly so you pick them up easily enough.Positives-Fun and Addictive-Brilliant soundtrack-Good visuals despite indie feel-ChallengingNegatives-Frustrating-A little short if you have good rhythmIt has got to be one of the more fun games like this I have played. The music was one of the best bits for me, but the game itself is impressive. I'd suggest this game for anyone liking a little bit of challenge and with good rhythm.			",199,50,5,9,17,4,13

												It's way more frustrating than it's worth for me. The selling point for the game seems to be it's punishing difficulty, at least according to fan defenders on forums. Personally it's a game that I want to enjoy, with interesting visuals and music (the first time you see/hear them), and neoclassical gameplay style (there's really no classic game it's like, it's more similar to Guitar Hero than Mario or Sonic). Unfortunately, every time you miss a step, you get to repeat the entire stage. The music and visuals run very thin, very quickly. The reward for beating an insanely difficult for no apparent reason level is that you've just beaten an insanely difficult for no reason level and can move on to the next one. I've never had this much trouble jumping up a flight of stairs in my life. 2/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												Although purposefully blocky and a tad repetitive, this game is not bad so much as spitefully difficult. The lack of save points means you can die on the last jump right before the end of the stage, a stage that may have already taken 20 less-than-successful tries, and dying means being reset to the beginning of a stage, negating any gold bars you may have obtained.BIT.TRIP RUNNER is not a game conducive to continued sanity.

												I really, really disliked this game. BIT.TRIP RUNNER takes the mechanics of The Impossible Game and cranks it up to 11. However, whereas The Impossible Game was simplistic, BTR is punishing and convoluted.You have a few different commands mapped to different keys (or buttons if you're on a controller) such as ducking, jumping, kicking, etc. Depending on the upcoming obstacle, you have to do one of those. However, the game is sorta 2.5D, and there's a very annoying effect in some instances (especially concerning stairs) where the camera will move enough for you to lose a bit of accuracy in your timing.Like The Impossible Game, interacting with something will send you to the beginning of the stage. Thank goodness the stages are much shorter, because after crashing into the same exact wall 10 times, I don't think I could have dealt with the level going on for much longer of a distance than that.The pickups in the level are pointless. After getting them all, you get a rainbow behind your character, but it doesn't seem to do anything at all. Otherwise, they just add points, but they're so easy to get that everyone must have the same score on every level that doesn't include other methods of getting points.Overall, I had a terrible time with this game, and I would rather wait for The Impossible Game to get off of Greenlight than recommend this to a friend.

												This game's not really worth it. All you have to do is push the correct button sequence with precise timing, with a lot of trial and error. After you get hit, you have to restart the whole level. Also, when I tried to give it a second chance, the game somehow deleted all my progress. No, thanks. #crapIRegretBuying			",259,84,8,33,27,2,57

												This is a really addicting game with fantastic 8-bit music which is in time with your gameplay. However, on the other hand this game can get very frustrating as a result of you getting set back to the beginning if you crash. I also think that this game would be one of those games which you'd complete once and then not really play again. Overall, I'd recommend this game to someone who doesn't mind a challenge etc.			",77,5,2,4,10,1,6

												After playing the second installment in the Runner series and loving it to bits, I was enticed to buy the original, and am very sorry to say that this game does not hold up. I'll refrain from comparing this game to the sequel as much as possible during this review in order to keep things fair.To start off. This game looks bad and sounds boring. I can't comprehend as to why the developer would want to keep commander video as a 2D pixelart sprite, and have the rest of the world in a disgusting looking, 3D, roblox-esque style. It would be much better if it were all just pixelart. To make matters worse, the music,  which is supposed to be one of the game's main features, just doesn't mix well. The best description I can give it is that is sounds flat. The little chimes that play as you surpass every obstacle make it sound like a toddler bashing his xylophone at random, unfitting moments. There are upgrades you collect in each level which increase your mutliplier, and make the music climax, but that's the only redeeming factor about this bad soundtrack. Particularly, during the first boss battle, I was stuck listening to the same loop over and over and over again, for about 20 minutes. This made the battle downright boring.Whilst I'm discussing the boss battle, I need to bring up something that's downright shamefull about this game: The fact that it breaks the golden rule of good video game etiquette. That rule being ""When a player reaches a lose state, it should be his fault and not the game's"". During the entire game, you spend your time looking to the right of the screen, watching out for obstacles. The fact that these obstacles move from the right side to the left means you have enough time to react and avoid those obstacles. This boss battle broke that mechanic, and sent obstacles towards me from just a couple of pixels infront of my character. The game stopped being something that could be compared to ""The Impossible Game"" and more like ""I Wanna Be The Guy"", where winning was no longer about how skilled you are, but about how you can remember exactly when you need to perform a precise action.I suggest you purchase the sequel, and forget this game even exists.

												The game reminds me of those fun ""platform-on-rails web flashgames""- think Robot Unicorn with a budget!Jubilant music encourages you to complete each level just to keep the catchy 8-bit music going. Getting Items, and jumping through obstacles adds musical notes to the background music which adds rhytmic gameplay to the already awesome andtight platform mechanic.The last few levels can be a bit long but that's what makes the journey OH SOOO memorable! My only complaint is that sometimesyou'll mistake gold from those ""gold-colored"" obstacle you must try to avoid only to get killed.No lame checkpoints! Cool music! Buy it on sale!

												Bit.Trip Runner was designed by someone who likes listening to music and jumping in videogames, but unfortunately they just decided to smash the two together and call it a day without htinking about the implications. The music in Bit.Trip Runner is synchronized with the game, so when your character jumps over an obstacle, a note plays, but the note plays when you clear the obstacle, not when you start the jump, so if you're musically inclined and start to jump with the rhythm of the music, you'll always jump too late and have to start over at the beginning of the level. Basically, if you can carry a tune, you're boned, because the instant you try to become one with the beat, you lose.			",218,98,3,24,13,1,35

That's what i feel!Thanks to Ridian for finding me and for gifting me that awesome of one of the BIT.TRIP series.Story: 7/10 - It's so intensive, but the story is minimal and it is more a rhythm game.Controls: 10/10 - I can tell, you need some skill to avoid and bash some things on rhythm games, if you're a child you won't be getting this easily.Graphics: 9/10 - Both 2d and 3d graphics are a good mix.Music: 10/10 - Both 8bit and then modern-generation music are also a good mix.Gameplay: 10/10 - The gameplay is perfect for a rhythm game, both a jump n run game and a rhythm game is a very nice mix!Total: 4.6/5			",42,4,0,5,10,0,13

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is trolling at its finest. I went back to play this several years after giving up on the 100% in order to get the trading cards, and wow, just wow. Whoever created ""The Guantlet"" (a level late in the game, and notorious by this point) must have been wracked with fits of maniacal laughter as they developed the game. That level is a slap in the face to decency, and trollbait for rage-quitters. A close runner up to ""Guantelet"" is the hilarity of ""Odyssey."" I won't spoil it for you, but you'll get the joke when you understand that level. And you'll know the joke's on you. Be warned: you may want to destroy the equipment you're using to play this game, and yet you won't because then you would have to stop. And it's just. too. addictive. to stop.

												A great idea! Very fun at first, but eventually gives way to frustration and tedium. I think I spent 4 out of the 5 hours I played on one specific level. Runner 2 is a vast improvement, but this game is still worth playing. The graphics are surprisingly enjoyable (I'm not usually a fan of pixel art), and I really enjoyed the music, though it could use more variety.If you have a sense of rhythm and like platformers, you'll probably like this game: 7/10If you don't, you'd be better off banging your thumb with a hammer, over and over again: 2/10Obviously, I fall into the first category. :)			",370,114,4,79,36,1,78

												Ehh. Still mixed thoughts on this one. I was a little harsh on it before but some of the criticisms do still hold valid. The lack of checkpoints goes directly against the concept of allowing the player to learn levels and as a result makes the game very tedious. I'm sure this was intentional but it's certainly not good design. This is mostly an issue on the longer levels though, on the shorter levels the game is a fun level of challenging without being frustratingly so. Suffers a bit from a lack of variety though, there's really not a huge variety of level design. The music's decent, the graphics are fine for the style. It's... alright. Competent. Passable.

The original story of Captain Video begins here.  Run, jump, slide and kick your way through multiple levels of the 'Finite Runner' style game.The basic building blocks are well thought out in this game but with the existence of the sequel the flaws that were overlooked when this was originally released now stick out like a sore thumb.However if you want a more punishing game without checkpoints this might be what you're been looking for.

												The game reminds me of those fun ""platform-on-rails web flashgames""- think Robot Unicorn with a budget!Jubilant music encourages you to complete each level just to keep the catchy 8-bit music going. Getting Items, and jumping through obstacles adds musical notes to the background music which adds rhytmic gameplay to the already awesome andtight platform mechanic.The last few levels can be a bit long but that's what makes the journey OH SOOO memorable! My only complaint is that sometimesyou'll mistake gold from those ""gold-colored"" obstacle you must try to avoid only to get killed.No lame checkpoints! Cool music! Buy it on sale!

As with many auto-runners, the pace picks up as you progress and the challenges become more complex.CameosWhat’s rather nice about this game is the cameos from other Indie Game characters such as Super Meat Boy, these pop up in all sorts of places so you’ll have to keep your eyes glued if you wish to spot them all!SoundtrackSometimes we don’t often talk about when highlighting features of a game is the soundtrack and really it’s one of the most important parts of a game. It keeps you immersed, add to the emotion of the game and even makes you jump from time to time. BIT.TRIP RUNNER has one of the best soundtracks from the Indie Game Genre it’s simply perfect for the gameplay.VisualsA rainbow of colour delivered in well crafted blocks, whilst side-loaded it still creates enough depth that the story can interact with the landscapes in ways that help to make this game feel very modern even when it reflects a retro feel.RetroSpeaking of retro, one of our favourite features about this game is if you perfectly finish a level you get to go on a bonus retro adventure, it’s like having two games in one!The challengeWith more than 50 levels, new easy and hard modes plus leaderboards and achievements you will find yourself not only challenge your friends but yourself in your quest to be on top with the perfect score!Published Blog Post[www.dabs.com] ",322,83,26,27,33,3,59

												It's the Boku No Pico of videogames.How? That's rather difficult to explain. As a platformer it's frustrating, unfair, the controls are loose, the music is repetitive, level design is grating...but despite its numerous faults if you let it the game will suck you in for hours on end. No matter how it might enrage the player, it is *very* difficult to stop playing. To say a game is that compelling sure sounds like a great compliment, but I assure you it's not. Anger sets in after the first few minutes and builds--not declines--with each successive level. It's a Simon Says at a million miles an hour, forcing the player to perform a series of monotonous tasks to a degree of precision in the milliseconds, and there's not a moment's respite for failure. Expect to see the beginning of each level many times. While the challenge and satisfaction of success could make the game very rewarding for the few willing to take the time to master its nuance, it's plagued by control issues. Suffice to say, the input feels unacceptably loose and many times the player can expect to have quite a defeats snatched from the jaws of victory by a missed keypress or delay of only a few frames. This I cannot overstate: the game expects the player to perform to a level that it itself cannot reach. So why persist? It's succubus! The level isn't *that* hard. You can't be *that* bad at such a simple game. You were *so* close that last attempt. Surely you'll get it *this* time. It's just enough to keep playing, but not enough to feel any satisfaction for a victory.Maybe I'm nitpicking, but I can't bring myself to recommend a game that demands so much from the player, but isn't precise enough to handle the players it's trying to court. With a little refinement and some tighter controls, I could see this as a great Super Hexagon or Audiosurf-alike, but that's simply not the case.			",217,50,4,23,15,1,37

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a REALLY hard game, and it can get repetitive. But some games are all about that and learning how to move through a stage until it's in your bones. You'll be mostly jumping over, sliding under and kicking through obstacles in every stage. Boss fights are essentially the same as any other stage, but they still have a different vibe about them.The music is not only nice and catchy, but it actually helps you a little bit, since a note will play everytime you avoid an obstacle. You'll get used to the music, remember it and it'll help you remember the obstacles ahead. The music also get more intense as you get the boosters along the way.Graphics are nice retro style 2.5D with lots of colors and rainbows and it gets close to psychodelia sometimes. It can get a bit too confusing to me, but I guess it's due to my poor video card. =/All in all, it's a good game, though not an outstanding one. Just make sure you're looking for a real challenge before purchasing it!			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												This has bad design all over it.Your character always runs right and you have to jump at the right time to avoid obstacles. This is a simple game, but it works against you in a way that is just dependent on your abilities as a gamer.I won't say that the game sucks because you don't know what's coming ahead of you and it's all about memorization. Some people won't like that, I'm not the biggest fan, but I play retro games made that way and manage to find them fun if they feature good design otherwise (good controls, level design, enemy behavior, etc.).The game sucks because while the camera is often placed fine, there are very important moments when the action gets fast and you have to make a sudden fall to avoid an obstacle at the top, at those moments the camera stays in place and doesn't give you the focus necessary on the bottom part. (One might not know what I'm talking about if they didn't play later levels.)And you'll notice a ton of moments when the game is slightly buggy or the controls suddenly don't respond in an optimal way. I wonder how I got through the game at all.I heard Runner2 is an improvement in many ways, in fact a great game. The first game though, it's frustrating for all the wrong reasons and that's coming for a retro gaming fan like me.			",2946,1218,116,340,427,27,495

												Overall the game is fun and rewarding to play. Although there are some levels that will make you want to pull your hair out, finally getting the ""perfect"" rating on a level that you've been stuck on for a while is a great feeling.However, towards the end of the game the difficulty level ramps up to the point of unfairness. This makes the ability to get a perfect on a level almost impossible unless you win the coin flips or play it numerous times to figure out exactly when to jump and when not to jump. All of that said, I still had a lot of fun playing this game. But for someone looking for a more fluid platformer/rhythm game, runner 2 completely outshines its predecessor.			",66,8,0,10,2,0,2

												I've played many hours of this offline before I started using Steam.The retro look and music give it a unique feel and I'm sure it must hold the world record for number of fails per level, it certainly dwarfs all my other games in this respect. You have to try countless times to complete the more difficult levels but that results in a huge sense of achievement when you finally make it. Yes, it does rely on memory a lot of the time but I would consider this a feature rather than the negative given by other reviewers.I recommend buying both this and Runner2. This is the hard-as-nails expert version and 2 is the beautiful casual version.			",328,121,1,15,29,4,75

												Ohhh BIT TRIP !! This is in my opinion the best in the BIT-TRIP series,other BT games are based around different styles of gameplay and this one is all about running without dying,it's fast paced and will have you shouting at the screen of unfair pixels grrrr anyway I enjoy runner style games like that of the warioware series and others,this however is the best and is very challenging,my only complaint is that I would sometimes like to speed up and slow down the gameplay at the cost of a time bar or something like that,a good idea for BIT-TRIP 3 !I play this game every other day and find myself coming back for more even when the challenge can be really tough at times and I feel like smashing the screen in,I take a break and come back to it so it must be good ! The game also sounds great however there is no audio timing to gameplay sync like you are led to believe from other reviews but it's still a fun run.There are plenty of hidden goodies including many steam awards for playing and that keeps me going when I get a bit angry with the brutal difficulty that some of the levels display,I am on world 2,the first boss was a nightmare and the pace seems to have calmed down to introduce new play mechanics,I might also add that world 2 is quite refreshing to look at after being stuck on world one for so long.I will also note that I am playing the game on normal difficulty,I didn't know it could be set to easy and I would recommend others to keep it on normal,my 6 year old also plays this game and he can also complete quite a few of the stages and like me,he is also addicted to the daily BIT-TRIP play through challenge.Great game that all old school arcade lovers should play,if you like a solid challenge that is also fun and rewarding then get this game and have some fun but be prepared to also shout at it grrr8/10 !!

												Interesting art style, nice soundtrack and great game play = one of the better games I have played all-time.  It is a game that challenges your reflexes, memory and can frustrate you to where you want to rage quit but you don't stop playing because it is just so much fun.  I will say though if you get into a situation where you find you are not making any progress sometimes well just quit the game and come back to it another day.  I was able to learn to realize for me at least that quite often my best attempt at clearing something will come in my first 5 or so attempts in a session.  Now that is not to say you can't play it longer and have fun and clear stuff as I have done that too but I am just saying some days you will need to step away from it so that you get the most enjoyment out of playing the game.  Why wait til you rage quit?  Just quit when it is obvious you are getting nowhere.Anyway .. bottom line ..10/10 and like I said earlier one of the greatest games of all-time			",430,39,23,44,20,6,21

												A supremely grueling exercise in patience, memory, and repetition.After playing off-and-on for three years, I've finally beaten BIT.TRIP RUNNER.  While I feel a sweet sense of fulfillment and satisfaction, the punishing difficulty borders on insane.  With no checkpoints or second chances, perfection is demanded for complex stages that can last for ages.  Worse, the visuals sometimes hinder the player's accuracy from lack of clarity.  You'll find yourself hitting brick walls hard, only to punch through them from playing a level over and over for dozens of times.  However, the eminently charming graphics and dynamic soundtrack will keep you motivated to come back.If you can endure the challenge, you'll find an extremely artistic and challenging experience that you can't put down - and that's just the base game.  For even greater masochists, there are higher difficulty modes - including Perfect mode - with collectable gold and additional after-levels.  With all this value, a recommendation is easy, if not highly pained.			",126,44,3,18,15,4,26

												I do not recommend to ever get this game. The 2 is fine but this one is just not good, the hitboxes are horrible. The level 1-11 is completely unbalanced due to it's length ( more than 3 minutes or so. ) There are no checkpoints either.I can't even complete 1-11 on easy because even it seems like I will run into a weird hitbox and die, on shorter levels it's doable but I won't retry this level 100 times. If you are to get a BIT.TRIP Runner game, get the second, not this one!			",1398,507,40,151,122,22,188

												Despite my eternal hatred towards this game's graphic, I'll try to write... objectively. I hope.Gameplay: similar to Super Meat Boy. Frustrating and requires you to practice so you can get through a level. I was stuck like 30 minutes trying to beat 1-4 level, of which I nearly threw the towel in and uninstalled the game.You control an ugly character that can run forward. At first you can only make him jump, but as you progress deeper he can slide and kick. How he can keep on sliding and kicking endlessly while running is beyond my logic though. Unlike SMB, your char runs forward automatically, so you just need to concentrate on kicking jumping and sliding to avoid the walls / obstacles.Level designs can be incredibly tedious, as you keep on repeating moves you do in the first one-third of the level and repeat and repeat it. However, because of that, learning curve isn't that steep. As you memorize the first one-third, the rest is pretty easy.Game has NO checkpoint. If you die one second before you reach the finish line, you will repeat the entire level. No question asked. Imagine if it happened to you? I felt it many times, don't worry, I know the feeling.Graphic: no further comment or I'll look like a complete hater. I even have problem reading the menus.Sound: Okay, I guess. I am not a fan but I don't dislike it either. Pretty fitting for the game.Replayability: Based on levels I've finished, it's close to zero. Unless you want to fix your score, then there's no reason to play previous levels.And lastly, as far as I'm aware of, no proper controller support for Dinput gamepads. Even when I try to attach x360ce the game doesn't recognize it. I don't know which one is wrong - as that emulator can hook my controller perfectly for many games.Buy it or not? I personally would just think this game is a bundle material. And certainly for 10 bucks it is too expensive. Maybe a hardcore fan of Bit Trip games is alright I guess.

												Art style doesn't make up for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay. The music and art are wonderful, but the gameplay mechanics are clunky. Music doesn't time with jumping the way it should in a game like this (so it's easier to play without music), jumping height is invariable, and if you hit anything, it sends you back to the beginning of the zone. Furthermore, before you get to start again, you have to watch a stupid animation. There are so many minor tweaks that would have made the game playable instead of leavivng the gamer irritated.

												I got this essentially for free in a package I was already buying for other games, and I still feel vaguely ripped off.  Dull gameplay, lackluster music.  As a rhythm game, there's not much else there.The music doesn't quite line up with the actions you're supposed to take either -- like, the beats will line up with when you pass over obstacles rather than when you're supposed to initiate the jump.  This might be the only rhythm game I can think of that's actually easier when you mute it.			",46,33,0,30,2,0,6

												This game is addicting. Luckily, it is fairly short. You definitely need high-tier reaction skills. The aesthetic it portrays is also very nice, but let's not get out of hand here for innovation. This title's graphics are stripped STRAIGHT from Katamari Damacy, a truly innovative title that will go down as one of the very best. Even with the obvious inspiration, this game succeeds in the runner genre with its total package. To me it's just a fun and challenging game with a pick up and play attitude that doesn't leave me obsessed with getting everything.Expect to die a lot as you learn the levels. The biggest pain is repeating instances of platforming that are super easy only to come to the tough parts a minute into the level. As others have mentioned this may not be your cup of tea, but it does feel very good to complete levels like The Odyssey at 1-11. The difficulty curve is definitely a little bit all over the place, and there are only three zones to play. Plenty of levels mind you, just expect certain levels to ♥♥♥♥ you off more than others.Again, don't play this if you don't want a decent challenge and some repetition. The music is pretty good for a simple game like this, though a bit repetitive as is the game in many parts. Overall, this is still a solid recommendation for platform lovers that want a challenge.I play this at 4K resolution through custom resolution toggle/hack in Nvidia CP with SMAA injected. It seems to do 4K this way even if you don't have the in-game resolution toggled correctly. There were no jaggies basically. Looks perfect. Nvidia DSR did not work nor did staying on 1080p desktop and toggling resolution in game. So use a custom resolution if you want true 4K.With a DS4 controller through Input Mapper lag does not seem too bad. Give it a try, but you have been warned. Vsync may add a bit of lag as well but I passed some of the hardest stages without too much trouble.			",367,166,12,22,21,3,39

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a frustrating, repetitive title. After playing a few hours, you wouldn't be blamed for uninstalling it. Instead of focusing on skill, RUNNER leans more towards 'memorization'. You play a random pitch black thing with a white spot for eyes, as well as arms and legs. Really good character design there, instead of making an interesting character, just throw random stuff into it.Wow...Your character decides to run to the right, without stopping. It is up to you to control his jumping, sliding, kicking, and shield. But instead of taking skill, BIT.TRIP RUNNER decides ""NO! Memorization is more fun"". You die if you touch one thing, and you go back to the beginning of the level.No checkpoints...Let that sink in....NO CHECKPOINTS...I hate this game so much, but luckly, the sequel is far better! Play the sequel, but don't play this.-MandatoryAlcatraz ",261,16,3,21,9,0,11

												Hello everyone Elemix here again with another game review, this time I'll be looking at Bit.Trip Runner a 'indie' game. Here's a little back story of the game. You play as a stickman from the popular Newground flashes and you have to rescue your girl friend from the main bad game (like that's never done before, Bethesda). Now In the past I've never really had any good experience with indie-games but maybe this one will be better. Lets dive into Bit. Trip Runner!When you first start up the game you start off running and you have no control of your character. I mean no control what so ever, if you try going left doesn't work and if you try jumping it doesn't work. At first I assumed my keyboard was broken but I tried my other keyboard AND I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. Seriously in this game the controls are just not existed.Graphics look like tehy're staight up indie doo doo, the guy looks like my fat over weight friend mettic.All and all Bit.Trip runner will make you run from it seeing how terrible it is.

												this game will make you suffer but let it be known that i love experiencing intense suffering every once in a while. once you reach a certain level of enlightenment and let go of your anger its pretty fun, but until then youre experiencing existential horror of the likes youve never known because seriously? some of these levels are literally impossible to get on your first run? half the time was spent with me going, 'how the heck did i not see this coming?' well, for starters, while the visuals are quite pretty and colorful and horribly distracting, it may have just been my impaired eyesight (low contrast is the worst and focus is hard to keep), but sometimes it was hard to see objects in the foreground against the background. may have had something to do with the 2D on 3D (which, while unique and charming, again made it hard to see), or maybe my attention span didnt run long enough. in either case, it cost me an entire run, and also my dearly bought patience.that said i love this game and would definitely recommend it, if only to watch other people wailing in agony as well.

												A tremendous execution of a simple concept. The visuals are superb, in their funky 3D-2D kind of way, and the music is brilliantly entwined with the gameplay. You essentially have to run along an obstacle course, and the better you do, the nicer the sound gets. It's very rhythmic, so those who don't find music to be a particularly strong point of theirs, this game will be tough. In fact, even though I am a relatively good musician (I play a few instruments) this game was exceptionally difficult. I recommend to all to try to play!			",748,185,19,65,52,12,82

It can be annoying to have to restart a level if you make one mistake, but since the level instantly restarts, it's easy to try again for one more run. Brutally unforgiving, but exhilerating to execute a perfect run. Reminds me of Lode Runner.			",304,100,9,41,46,6,41

												My god. If there was ever a game that made me want to toss my controller at the screen it's THIS game. Do not play if you suffer from hypertension or high blood pressure. This is has to be one of those games you persevere through so when you beat each stage you know you worked really had for it. Makes me wish I had a physical cartridge to throw out the window. But if you can get past the sudden bouts of anger and wanting to beat Commander Video down after the 20th time doing the same stage you'll find achieving every little success to be rewarding. There are 3 modes but it's all pretty hard and tedious. Really recommended for those who have a high threshold for pain and the agony of defeat, again and again and again.			",460,286,7,85,41,7,68

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is an oddity, particularly because it's a Wii port and that's a bit on the strange side to begin with. There are three levels divided up into eleven stages and a 'boss' stage, in between each stage is a challenge stage where the real high score hunting comes in as it's relatively easy to unlock each one through normal play, as the path the game takes puts the gold blocks required right in your way.As a game, it's relatively simple. You automatically run forward and have to duck, kick, block and jump through a stage full of obstacles. This sounds very shallow in depth, but the patterns introduced can be a bit of a shock to encounter at first, but are satisfying once conquered. The game is all too aware of how long you hold the jump button. This belongs among games such as Super Meat Boy and Jamestown - Difficult without being punishing, but satisfying when finally beaten			",231,46,4,27,16,1,37

												I like the style of this game, and I'm not opposed to these types of runners, but it is way too punishing.  Some kind of checkpoint system or gold-loss or something when you get hit seems necessary (maybe three hits, but getting hit means no bonus, or maybe it pushes you back only a certain amount but you lose all gold before that point)  Some levels are too long to justify playing through again and again.I'd say that in general, I wouldn't recommend this now that Runner2 exists, as it does almost everything better.  However, I don't want to totally shy you away from it - there's some good stuff here and if you're a bit.trip fan and completionist, go for it.  It's not bad, just make sure to play this BEFORE Runner2 and you won't be disappointed.			",219,123,2,27,26,1,29

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a game where you must press buttons in order to jump over and slide under obstacles, kick the said obstacles or block (only 3rd world) orange bullets. Your character runs automatically. The games has a really nice art style and good soundtrack. If you hit any obstacle in the level, you have to restart the whole level and some of the levels are pretty hard. The game is fun UNTIL you get to the last 3 stages (3-10, 3-11 and ""boss""). I can assuredly say that I spent at least half of the time I played this game on these stages. The reason is that these stages are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You have to make some of the hardest jumps not just once and for me, those last 3 stages made me so frustrated that I would recommed buying this, but only playing until and completing 3-9, the last 3 stages are not worth it, they are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized and will make you furious.

												This game is a great challenge for people who are looking for one in a 2D scroller, I would definitely recommend a controller if you are going to take the fight to this game, as it will break you, and your fingers, if you decide to go for the keyboard options which I did. It combines music and gameplay in a fantastic manner.I would recommend buying and playing the second game, before this, since it's more forgiving, and has some improved mechanics which are great for first time players. Overall the game is a great and fun experience for those with great reflexes or at least looking to improve their reflexes.			",191,26,6,12,22,2,32

												Aka: OH GOD WHY DO I GET SO ANGRY WHEN I FAIL?Bit.Trip Runner is the third in the Bit.Trip series, which makes a break from convention of the previous two. This time, you actually play as Commander Video in a side-scrolling platformer. The screen moves at a cracking pace while you run constantly in a 3D retro 8-bit inspired world. Your basic functions are to jump, slide, and kick your way around/through obstacles, while collecting gold and powerups, to reach the finish line at each stage.While this seems simple enough, and it is easy early on, it quickly delves into devious territory, requiring the utmost attention and rhythm. As with the previous Bit.Trip titles, the gameplay is heavily dependent on the music. As you collect powerups, the music becomes more and more intense, so you know after a few of them (and when that glorious rainbow trails behind you), you’re close to the end. It’s often much easier to time your jumps with the music, rather than looking at when obstacles are coming up.But if you fail; fall down a gap, hit a wall, etc, it immediately carries you all the way back to the beginning, and starts straight away in that dull pre-powerup music. It’s incredibly demoralising, to know that you were so close, only to go right back to the start music. Particularly on the longer levels (damn you, Odyssey).Because of the instant reload times, much like Super Meat Boy (who also gets a sneaky cameo), it forces you to keep trying, and keep trying, until you finally triumph. And you will retry. A lot.Only one other game has ever made me more frustrated than this (you’ll keep, Dark Souls). I’d have the final powerup, rainbow trailing behind me, knowing the end is near, only to miss-time an easy jump and go all the way back to the start. My desk is not fist-pound rated, but it should be. What makes it frustrating, is that on paper, it is so simple. All it is, is timing and reflexes and knowing the right inputs. There’s no other tactics that that. But the timing here can be unforgiving.Makes it all the better when you do finally complete a level you were stuck on forever.This is the best of the Bit.Trip series; if you want to start somewhere, this is the game to buy.

												A really addictive side scroller that combines 3D surroundings with a 2D character which works very well. The music changes depending upon how you progress in the levels which adds uniqueness to the game itself.

This game's alright but in my opinion, you can live without it.			",123,30,3,6,5,1,13

												This game is legendary, i suspect the brutal difficulty in Bit.Trip Runner will be polarizing, some will find the challenge exciting, and some will find it too stressful. My personal experience occupies something of a ""sweet spot"" in the middle.			",501,114,15,60,35,3,47

												This is one of the most peaceful and beautiful platformers I have ever played, most new indie platformers like Super Meat Boy have very challenging levels with great platforming, but that isn't what this game is about. Every time you jump, duck, kick or collect gold or any action you do makes a sound, and as you do all of these actions it creates a melody that goes perfectly with the background music. Listening to the beautiful music that you have created and looking at the beautiful art style, puts you in a perfect state of relaxation. Buy this game, its worth it.			",109,13,0,11,14,0,13

												This a fun, but difficult game. The music gets louder and catchier the farther you go in the level, so its punishment for failing is going back to the start when the music isnt as awesome.

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a very neat little old school Jump n Run. The Running is done by the game, you ""simply"" have to slide, kick, block and of course, JUMP. But make no mistake. Though it is a very nostalgic looking piece of software, this game IS NOT EASY. There are 36 levels to beat. It took me 5 hours to finish 34 of them. And 3 straight hours for the remaining 2. Anyway this game rocks. In search of game you can play for some 15 minutes and pick up the next day? BIT.TRIP RUNNER. Oh by the way : TURN OFF THE SOUND. It's simply annoying.

												Definitely feels retro, though going as far as making text so square that you can't even read your score kind of sucks. You don't really need a lot of ""skill"" to play this game, but rather a good memory and a lot of patience. Constant trial and error is why this game is not particular enjoyable. The developers tried to incorporate music into levels which would give you an indicator as to how well you run (avoiding obstacles and getting gold). It would seem this feature require some further tweaking before getting what i assume to be the desired effect. However, some of the music in the game (in the menu and background during levels) is really good and definitely adds to the whole retro feeling. Strange, strange hardcore people might enjoy this game. Most will not.			",257,70,6,31,28,2,48

												This game is about jumping, destroying and ducking(as far as I made it through the game). The objective is simple...get to the finish line without dying - but the objective is quite hard to reach. During the level you should also try to get some kind of bandages which will make you get the rainbow behind yourself(after you get all 5) and with that you get a lot of points.While the game looks simple it's actually preety hard and I can only play 1 level per round as I ragequit after that :PMy rating: 10/10			",142,32,17,8,23,6,31

												Like BIT.TRIP.BEAT with it's faux-retro graphics and sound, but it's more challenging that BEAT and more fun. It can be annoying to have to restart a level if you make one mistake, but since the level instantly restarts, it's easy to try again for one more run. Brutally unforgiving, but exhilerating to execute a perfect run. Reminds me of Lode Runner.			",304,100,9,41,46,6,41

												My god. If there was ever a game that made me want to toss my controller at the screen it's THIS game. Do not play if you suffer from hypertension or high blood pressure. This is has to be one of those games you persevere through so when you beat each stage you know you worked really had for it. Makes me wish I had a physical cartridge to throw out the window. But if you can get past the sudden bouts of anger and wanting to beat Commander Video down after the 20th time doing the same stage you'll find achieving every little success to be rewarding. There are 3 modes but it's all pretty hard and tedious. Really recommended for those who have a high threshold for pain and the agony of defeat, again and again and again.			",460,286,7,85,41,7,68

												The Good: Addictive 2D platforming at its finest, charming visuals and audio, responsive controls, great level designThe Bad: Can be very frustrating in later levels, only one audio track, casual gamers may quite early onRhythm games may not be all the rage anymore the unique ones really stick out. You can’t pick your own songs, there’s no fancy instruments, it’s just you and the controller/keyboard jumping to make a good techno beat. The idea of the game is to get through each of the three worlds through 12 levels each while jumping, kicking, and sliding your way through the level. If you get hit just once you reset back to the very beginning. While on the early levels this is fine the later ones take up to 4 minutes or more to complete so getting reset is so frustrating.Obstacles range from blocks you have to jump over, low hanging objects to slide under, stairs that require quick taps, and even some stop to fool you like a bouncing cube which one you slide under and one you jump over. There are spring pads and other obstacles to block your path, but precise timing will be required to get all the gold blocks to get to the bonus stages which are 8 bit variations of the 16 bit/3D levels. It’s very unique, charming, and extremely addictive and fun. I am currently stuck on 1-11 and have been for weeks, but I keep going at it because I just want to play every level.The music is pretty good and full of life despite it being the same track through each level. During parts of the level you will pick up a giant plus sign that will add tracks to the beat and it also adds to the visuals. BIT.TRIP is really a game for casual players and hardcore platformers who miss the days of the 16/8 bit era. The game has brilliant level design that adds a lot of challenge while still being manageable. I haven’t really played a 2D platformer this addictive in years.The visuals are stunning with wonderful 16 bit to 3D translation and the game has a wide color palette that sticks to the 16 bit and 8 bit era. Everything is made of blocks, but is built in 3D and can really be a mind trip some times especially when you first start playing. Don’t let the hard levels keep you from playing because being able to play the later levels is rewarding and challenging. I highly recommend this game to any 2D platformer or even for someone just looking for a fun arcade game.--Score: 8.5/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												It started as a simple Winter achievement but Bit.Trip Runner quickly turned into one of the most frustrating platformers I've ever played. That's not to say it's bad or anything, it just happens to get incredibly intense when it comes to memorization and pixel perfect execution in the last levels. If your intent is to complete it on Perfect mode you better borrow some Balls of Steel. Just to be one the safe side when controller-snapping frustration kicks in.			",907,390,16,194,90,8,172

												Stay away from this game. It's a good example of poor game design.The core idea is fine; it's a runner-style game, not unlike others of the genre. The good distinguishing things that it has are the art style (it looks like an Atari game) and the music. As you evade obstacles and grab items, it adds to the music in interesting ways. Sometimes, you can use musical patterns to help you determine when you should jump. It's a nice, unique touch.The problem is that the game demands perfection, and requires trial-and-error and memorization in order to achieve it. If you die (get hit by an object, run into something, or fall in a pit), you're sent back to the beginning of the level. There are a number of cheap deaths to be found, where you can't realistically be expected to foresee or react to a threat quickly enough to survive it. This means you'll have to die repeatedly while you discover these points and memorize them, until you reach a point where you can clear a level. Many of these spots require pinpoint precision, and a few levels are particularly infuriating for their great length.Perfection's a fine goal, but it shouldn't be what's required in order to play or enjoy a game. If Rock Band ended a song as soon as you missed one note, no one would play it. That's essentially what this game does, and it ruins what could have been a pleasant pixelated romp.(Note: The sequel is MUCH better, correcting most of the major problems that the first game had. If you're interested, go check that out instead.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best $0.99 i ever spent.  Also the budle deal is great.  BUT wait till this game is on Sale.  There is no reason you should have to pay full price for this game. This game is very addictive,  The soundtrack is great, and the game play is fun. Only draw back is it's short and somewhat repeatative. It get's tough as b@lls later on.  If you don't have patience you will break something while playing this game.    And a big issue,  If you're seizure prone or get panic attacks (like i do) this game might not be for you.  I can play for about 10-20 min at a time only without getting sick.Bottom Line: GReat Game, but not worth the steap price.  Wait till a sale then buy it.			",295,83,2,54,6,0,42

												Here's the thing. This is a good game. However, it is no walk in the park. This is a very difficult game, requiring very precise timing in some places. And sometimes it seems like it's hard for the sake of being hard; some parts just seem unfairly difficult without having a particular reason for it.			",412,136,14,67,46,7,81

												FIendishly hard, very simple gameplay. SIdescrolling platformer with a weird 2.5D parrallaxy background, once you get over the weirdness this does to your eyes it's a pretty awesome game. Each powerup affects the background music and the rhythm of the background music determines when to jump, slide, kick, bounce or repel.I've played way too much of this game probably but have to say it's very enjoyable.

												At first it reminded me of The Impossible Game with 3D backgrounds, you auto-run to the right and jump gaps and rocks, fairly basic right? wrong.In the impossible game you just had to jump gaps and doge spikes, in this you will be jumping obstacles, sliding under UFO's, and kicking your way through crystals, all timed to some awesome sounding Bit-Tunes.Not a fan of Bif-Tunes? Niether am I, but it works so well with the gameplay it sounds a lot better than it normally would, and I am actually motivated to get to the end of each level because I want to hear the rest of the track.The only thing I wish I could improve in this game, is my own skill level.

												A game that is definately not for everyone. Myself included. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a very simple 2D platformer and I do not recommend getting this game unless that is a genre you very much enjoy. The game has a very 'unique' artstyle, which in my opinion clashed with the actual gameplay. I've had several short sessions of the game now, in an attempt to give it another chance but after a couple of minutes I either get bored, annoyed or (most likely) a combination of the two. I might've somewhat enjoyed had I got it as an app on my phone.			",59,4,1,9,6,0,6

												I really don't enjoy this game.  I feel that this game uses 8-bit aesthetics in all of the worst ways, it caves to every shortcoming that comes with being #8bit but it follows no rules, particularly none of the rules that make those games beautiful.  I feel the music prides itself on being retro, but the only genuinely retro part of the soundtrack are two the menu and credits music by Anamanaguchi (a far cry from the Scott Pilgrim game).  The actual game music feels like it's barely there, sparsely composed poppy sounding nonsense that consitutes player influenced music by it's vapidity alone.  This isn't Rez, it doesn't feel compelling become one with the music and the environment it creates, adding to a great whole.  You feel like a program playing what little gameplay is there, and it essentially comes down to being an incredibly stiff rhythm game.  And a rhythm game it is not, it sullies the concept of rhythm games by having none of the compelling parts of a rhyth game.  Think of something like Dance Dance Revolution, or beatmania in particular.  Huge skill ceiling that offers an endless climb for the skill of the player, a wide variety of fully realized music by a variety of different artists that satisfy a broad variety of taste, and an interesting and fulfilling input that gives the player variety while achieving game flow.  Runner maybe accomplishes flow, but not in a way you can't find in dozens of free games on the App Store, and those feel much more appropriate.  This may seem severly negative but Bit.Trip Runner outright fails in a lot of areas I really require more of from an experience that I don't just like, but not actively unenjoy.

												To me, this game is fustratingly difficult for some bad reasons.No check-points.It would be much better if inbetween the stage, you didn't have to FLY ALL THE WAY BACK to the beginning of the stageReally long stages.This combined with the other reason makes me hate the last parts of chapters in this game.New mechanics out of nowhere.Lets say you are playing normally, but then, something you had no idea on what to do came out of nowhere, which severly annoyed me since it kept making me start over since it didn't properly introduce this to me.I could go on, but I think that's all I really have to complain about.Anyways, the music is great, (except for the last mode of it while playing, Don't like how it removes the rest of the music that was playing before that.) The mechanics don't drive me to insane, and is fun to play.7/10			",176,36,6,17,9,3,8

												Really enjoyable rhythm runner. My biggest problem with the game is at times the levels seemed to be trial and error focused. By that I mean you have to lose repeatedly and get a little further every time until you have the level memorized. A few levels are disproportionately more difficult than the others. On the plus side, this means beating the entire game is extremely satisfying.  Aside from that the chiptune music is excellent, the graphics are charming, and despite difficulty spikes the game is addictive.For what it's worth by comparison Bit.Trip Presents Runner 2... is a lot easier and a lot less satisfying to complete than its predecessor.  If you want a real reflex challenge, then try this one out.			",86,21,3,9,4,0,5

Highly recommended if you grew up with early classics like Moon Patrol on Atari 2600 and don't mind some punishing difficulty from time to time.			",122,8,3,7,7,0,14

												First of all I feel I should say that I hate ""Runner"" games. However if you do enjoy 2D runners, I imagine this'll be like all the rest of 'em. Note: I'd recommend using either Num5 or a controller for jumping - Not SPACEBAR as I found (at least with my k/b) a few timing issues with it.			",601,232,18,79,37,6,71

The sequal is a bit more refined in my opinion, but this game is still a good addition to the collection.			",953,222,33,95,80,9,117

												A classic in indie rythim games for a good reason. It's a look back in classic running platformers with some more enriched scenarios and, most importantly, a wonderful soundtrack to motivate - that is partially made by your character! Cute and cheerful, absolutely worth at least giving it a try.The main downside is the no-checkpoint gameplay, in which you always head back to the beginning each time you miss. on the longest and hardest stages, it can lead to some serious ragequits. However, if you quit and come back at another time, you should be ready for the challenge again. (it works for me)			",129,25,7,3,6,1,6

I find it harder than Runner 2 and even though the difficulty frustrates me more and the lack of a midway save point is excruciating, somehow I'm liking it even more. Runner and Runner 2 are simply two of the best games EVER for me. Highly recommend you pick this up!			",77,15,8,5,5,0,6

												DId you know I spent two hours on the penultimate stage?OF WORLD 1?That illustrates a lot that is wrong with BIT.TRIP RUNNER right off the bat doesn't it?... and yet, I can't hate this game very much. This is very much a ""white noise"" game, a game I once played to reign in my temper. It made me want to cuss at the screen. throw my controller at the screen... throw my shirt at the screen for what it's worth. I still haven't finished it at time of writing and I was going to give it a thumbs down... but the game really did give me a fair shake. Yes stage 1-11 is pretty bonkers and yes I haven't played anything past that point (not that it matters because every other f*cking review seems to agree with me about the difficulty curve), but I never really felt that the game was not following its rules...... no, that's all fine. What this game severely lacks is a F*CKING CHECKPOINT SYSTEM.Other than that all good. Will play again and again until my temper goes down to a manageable level.			",211,81,7,31,32,3,38

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a fun little musical platformer. Unfortunately, the game has several problems. For one, Gaijin Games doesn't seem to know about the concept of a proper difficulty curve. The difficulty is all over the place. Some levels are hard, some levels are easy, and some levels are just disproportionately hard. Odyssey is one level that comes to mind, as several people haven't even gone past that level, if you check the achievements page. Another problem is that this game is only fun if you are good at it. Otherwise, it's just frustrating. And even if you are doing well, making one little mistake forces you to start the entire level over, which can be incredibly frustrating if it was a long level, and just plain disheartening if you keep making mistakes in a level. And one of the more glaring flaws, is how bonus levels are handled. You get to those after getting all the gold in a level. Unfortunately, you only have one try at them. If you fail, and want to try again to perfect the level, you have to play through the regular level all over again, just to get one shot at the bonus. Overall, it's a really unforgiving game.Now some of you may be thinking, ""What are you talking about? The game's pretty forgiving, it gives you 11 checkpoints in one level! Quit whining!"" I've heard that argument before. I am aware of how the other BIT.TRIP games work, but those games had room for error. You were allowed to make more than one mistake, and you didn't have to start a particular section over if you did. And some of you may be arguing that all this challenge and unforgiveness is just reminiscent of retro games. I suppose you could make that argument, but there's a reason why most modern games don't pull off what's done in this game, and those games were made in a time where game designers didn't really know any better, or had different ideas about what made games challenging.I suppose if you're one of those gamers that can tolerate ridiculously hard games, or are one of those people that think modern games are too easy, and are looking for challenging games, you'll probably feel right at home with this, or heck, the entire series. If you're not one of those people, you may want to skip over this title.			",127,40,2,11,10,2,12

												TURN V-SYNC off. simply doesn't do any good for the game other than messing up your timing that you'll find was spot on when you turn it off. Its the LAWNMOWER MAN virtual world in 8 bit !!!A great improvement over the BIT.TRIP.BEAT. franchise! If you had to only choose one bit.trip. series, go with Runner. Here's why.Difficult but not sadistic.Faster interface. Get in and play, and quit. While it's still an 8 bit mess, at least you don't have that silly delay waiting for the game to bounce your choice off your paddle...Achievements that can actually be 100%'d. (however there are A+ perfect related ones so prepare yourself..)So much more user imput. With bit.trip.beat. you adjust your paddle with UP or DOWN. that's it. Got real boring real fast. Here you gotta dodge and it requires several buttons. Therefore the gameplay, is much more satisfying compared to beatTough to perfect, very very tough. Several achievements are pretty trying but i WILL 100 percent this game legit one day! ",53,1,0,1,0,0,0

Each powerup affects the background music and the rhythm of the background music determines when to jump, slide, kick, bounce or repel.I've played way too much of this game probably but have to say it's very enjoyable.

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a very neat little old school Jump n Run. The Running is done by the game, you ""simply"" have to slide, kick, block and of course, JUMP. But make no mistake. Though it is a very nostalgic looking piece of software, this game IS NOT EASY. There are 36 levels to beat. It took me 5 hours to finish 34 of them. And 3 straight hours for the remaining 2. Anyway this game rocks. In search of game you can play for some 15 minutes and pick up the next day? BIT.TRIP RUNNER. Oh by the way : TURN OFF THE SOUND. It's simply annoying.

												Personal Enjoyment: 5/10Standalone Rating: 6/10General Rating: 8/10I really, really wish Steam had a ""conditional"" rating.BIT.TRIP RUNNER is the fourth entry in the BIT.TRIP franchise, and the first that I played. You play Commander Video, an alien humanoid who crashes onto an odd planet. The goal of the game is to run to the end of the level while dodging hazards and acquiring gold. Getting the gold is optional, but getting all of it lets you play a bonus stage at the end of the level. The game is divided into three zones, each of which contains twelve levels, the last of which functions as a boss fight of sorts. The story isn't of note unless you've played the whole series.The big clencher in my decision to recommend this is the difficulty. If you hit an obstacle, you are forced to start at the beginning of the level. This isn't a problem for most levels, as the obstacles don't get too tough early on and most levels last around a minute. However, certain parts of the game feel downright frustrating (1-11, for instance, has only been beaten by around 13.9% of game owners as of writing) as the level of reflex demanded climbs higher and higher. At times, it feels less like I'm getting better at the game and more like I'm memorizing the level's patterns.If you're the patient sort who likes games requiring reflex or just wants to experience the series, I'd get this game on sale. Otherwise, I'd stay away.			",410,140,6,40,31,4,31

												Although extremely hard, this game is a ton of fun.  The platforming has to be perfect or you are done and starting the level over.  This can at times move over from fun to frustration, but the frustration is never at the game, just yourself as it is always completely fair.  Every time I try a level again I felt like I was steadily getting better, which is a good feeling.  The way the game plays to the beat is especially engaging.  As the level starts there is just a minimal framework of the music present.  As you progress through the level different elements of the song get thrown in as you pick up items and by the end of the level all of the aspects of music are there in all their glory.  This can really make you feel awesome as you get close to the end of a challenging level and the song is going in full swing.  The music is great and the building up mechanic of the music never seems to get old for me.  Definently worth putting some time into.  I really enjoy my time with this game.

												Trash. The games repetitive levels, lack of checkpoints and 'twitch' platforming combine to create system that punishes you severely for dying even once, and just gets worse and worse from there.

												This game's adorable 8Bit design makes this the most perfect platforming game. It's highly addictive, frustrating at times (all in good fun!), and well made! Each level some how matches up with the music and in game audio which makes me want to play every level even more! I can't wait to buy the second one.			",8,2,0,0,0,0,0

												BIT TRIP RUNNER is a nice rhythm game.It has a nice artstyle, and the music is easy on the ears.Too bad the difficulty is not well balanced:- Easy and Normal is the same thing, you don't need to collect the gold on normal- Only 10% of the players reached the second world- Once you pass Odissey, you can breeze through the second world in no time.I would say skip this one and go directly to the second game, which has better graphics and variety, but most of all is more accessible.

												I find this to be much better than Runner2 (which is still a great game) because my eye-sight is not 20/20. In this game the character stands out more whereas in Runner2 I'm having enormous difficulty distinguishing whatever character I'm using and the backgrounds making it incredibly hard to time anything. It's a minor thing really but I got incredibly frustrated with Runner2 because of it. But if your eye-sight is fine you might as well go for Runner2 instead because in all other aspects it improves on this game.			",451,118,17,37,40,7,64

												Bit.Trip Runner is a platformer where the movement is like a endless runner. The challenge is in jumping, sliding or whatever on the right time. If you miss you need to start the level over again. But all the timing are the same. So it doesn't get frustating, because it's always your own fault for making mistakes. The only thing I don't like is the 2D graphics mixed with 3D graphics which make it very hard to see what's what at times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although this game is platformer, you would make the basic assumption that the experience would be easily complete, don't allude to that.Be sure to isolate yourself for this game demand the outmost focus. Be sure to only play this game in small sessions at a time, for it easily induces rage.If you are aiming for that 100%, then you should probably be informed to be setting up an appointment with your Therapist in the near future.

												Aka: OH GOD WHY DO I GET SO ANGRY WHEN I FAIL?Bit.Trip Runner is the third in the Bit.Trip series, which makes a break from convention of the previous two. This time, you actually play as Commander Video in a side-scrolling platformer. The screen moves at a cracking pace while you run constantly in a 3D retro 8-bit inspired world. Your basic functions are to jump, slide, and kick your way around/through obstacles, while collecting gold and powerups, to reach the finish line at each stage.While this seems simple enough, and it is easy early on, it quickly delves into devious territory, requiring the utmost attention and rhythm. As with the previous Bit.Trip titles, the gameplay is heavily dependent on the music. As you collect powerups, the music becomes more and more intense, so you know after a few of them (and when that glorious rainbow trails behind you), you’re close to the end. It’s often much easier to time your jumps with the music, rather than looking at when obstacles are coming up.But if you fail; fall down a gap, hit a wall, etc, it immediately carries you all the way back to the beginning, and starts straight away in that dull pre-powerup music. It’s incredibly demoralising, to know that you were so close, only to go right back to the start music. Particularly on the longer levels (damn you, Odyssey).Because of the instant reload times, much like Super Meat Boy (who also gets a sneaky cameo), it forces you to keep trying, and keep trying, until you finally triumph. And you will retry. A lot.Only one other game has ever made me more frustrated than this (you’ll keep, Dark Souls). I’d have the final powerup, rainbow trailing behind me, knowing the end is near, only to miss-time an easy jump and go all the way back to the start. My desk is not fist-pound rated, but it should be. What makes it frustrating, is that on paper, it is so simple. All it is, is timing and reflexes and knowing the right inputs. There’s no other tactics that that. But the timing here can be unforgiving.Makes it all the better when you do finally complete a level you were stuck on forever.This is the best of the Bit.Trip series; if you want to start somewhere, this is the game to buy.

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is as swanky and cool as a game can be. It doesn't bother with any of that garbage like story or graphics and instead focuses on teh two things that gaming is about; controls and music.You play the role of Comander Video and you contrinually stride forward dodging the caterpillaers, spikes, cranes campfires, minecarts and other♥♥♥♥♥♥in your way. The slick moves at your disposal are all you need to confront these challegnes but you'll soon realise that there's a rad beat to it all. This game doesn't throw crap at your randomly, it throws random crap at you methodically and you'll add to the soundtrack as you go. Get a clean run and the music has turned all chillaxed to reflect the zen state you find yourself in and the feeling of crossing the line after collecting all the gold in any level is almost as satisfying as the feeling of ejaculating into a warm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or scoring the winning goal in the dying seconds of the big game. Because that's what this is; a big game that fills you with emotion whenever you play.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that each world is marred by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss fight at the end. These are awful and you'll hate yourself.If your a no rythym loser who can't dance then this game isn't for you but if you're a groovy cat like me this is as good as gaming gets.

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a rhythm based endless runner by Gaijin games which has spawned a sequel and a whole bunch of spinoffs. I personally didn't really enjoy the game. It's simply not very fun to play. It's definitely challenging and according to the statistics less than 1/3 of players ever beat the first world. In the games detriment, I get the feeling that's because people have realized by that point that the game isn't fun enough to try to beat rather than the game being too hard. The rhythm aspect of the game might make it more enjoyable if the music were better, but frankly the music does little to improve the game. It's not a terrible game, seeing as its highly polished and feature complete but I wouldn't really reccomend it to anyone unless you really love endless runners.			",552,247,9,84,51,5,115

												Bit.trip Runner is a beat/platforming game starring Commander Video. Controls start out simple enough with the first couple levels consisting of just jumping. Then the levels get a little harder adding sliding, then super jumps, then kicking, then blocking.  By the 6th or 7th level you are jumping, sliding and kicking over under and thorugh obstacles to the beat, and if you fail, back to the start. This can be soo frustrating at times, getting through 80% of a level and having to go back to the very beginning but when you do beat it, it just makes it that much better. One of the harder beat games I've ever played along with other Bit.trip titles. The kind of game that once you beat it you will have no desire to play anytime in the near future. 8/10			",292,66,4,29,23,3,20

												This game is comparatively much more difficult than its sequel. OMG. It's a turn-off, if you are determined or invincible to frustration, you will enjoy World 2 which is actually easier, and very pretty. This game is tough, especially the rediculous helical obstacles in World 3, SWEET GOLD GIBLETS! I did, however, enjoy the gameplay, visuals, and music. Be warned, your patience will be tested.

												Like BIT.TRIP.BEAT with it's faux-retro graphics and sound, but it's more challenging that BEAT and more fun. It can be annoying to have to restart a level if you make one mistake, but since the level instantly restarts, it's easy to try again for one more run. Brutally unforgiving, but exhilerating to execute a perfect run. Reminds me of Lode Runner.			",304,100,9,41,46,6,41

												My god. If there was ever a game that made me want to toss my controller at the screen it's THIS game. Do not play if you suffer from hypertension or high blood pressure. This is has to be one of those games you persevere through so when you beat each stage you know you worked really had for it. Makes me wish I had a physical cartridge to throw out the window. But if you can get past the sudden bouts of anger and wanting to beat Commander Video down after the 20th time doing the same stage you'll find achieving every little success to be rewarding. There are 3 modes but it's all pretty hard and tedious. Really recommended for those who have a high threshold for pain and the agony of defeat, again and again and again.			",460,286,7,85,41,7,68

												Well,this game is a Indie. And a good one,at least.I'm new to the BIT.TRIP franchise,so don't blame me.BIT.TRIP Runner is WAY different then the other games,like BIT.TRIP Flux and Beat. Is more of a rhytm game,but I like it.The art style of the game is A-MA-ZIN'. The attention to detail,the soundtrack,even the level design! Plus,I love when games mix the 8-bit with modern 3D. But it can't be always good,for me,the price,is a bit salty. 17 reais? Or around,8 bucks and 50 cents. The difficulty,the lengh of some levels...But anyway. This game,for me,gets a 9/10.Do I hate it? Of ♥♥♥♥in' course not. As a old youtube that I heard: ""It seems that only the Indie genre gets it rigth.""-Sr.Wilson from the brazilian channel Colonia Contra Ataca.			",105,8,2,10,8,1,7

Its the LAWNMOWER MAN virtual world in 8 bit !!!A great improvement over the BIT.TRIP.BEAT. franchise! If you had to only choose one bit.trip. series, go with Runner. Here's why.Difficult but not sadistic.Faster interface. Get in and play, and quit. While it's still an 8 bit mess, at least you don't have that silly delay waiting for the game to bounce your choice off your paddle...Achievements that can actually be 100%'d. (however there are A+ perfect related ones so prepare yourself..)So much more user imput. With bit.trip.beat. you adjust your paddle with UP or DOWN. that's it. Got real boring real fast. Here you gotta dodge and it requires several buttons. Therefore the gameplay, is much more satisfying compared to beatTough to perfect, very very tough.

												A platformer/runner game with appealing and colorful visuals. You run automatically, having to collect powerups and gold on the way to the end. Everything flows with the soundtrack, the music increasing as you collect more. Can be a bit frustrating at times as if you hit anything you start for the begging of the level, no checkpoints, although most levels are not too long. 8/10 *Game goes on sale quite often, so grab it if you can, especially when it is 50% or lower*			",146,49,7,10,17,3,10

												This game is a great challenge for people who are looking for one in a 2D scroller, I would definitely recommend a controller if you are going to take the fight to this game, as it will break you, and your fingers, if you decide to go for the keyboard options which I did. It combines music and gameplay in a fantastic manner.I would recommend buying and playing the second game, before this, since it's more forgiving, and has some improved mechanics which are great for first time players. Overall the game is a great and fun experience for those with great reflexes or at least looking to improve their reflexes.			",191,26,6,12,22,2,32

												A challenging rhythm/platformer that should keep you entertained for a few hours.Runner is a bit of a weird game, not really being a platformer, but not exactly a rhythm game in the traditional sense. Instead, you have to think of jumps as notes that you have to anticipate and hit at the right note, with collectibles and gold littered across the levels extra notes that make a more layered track. The fact is, that's exactly what happens and it makes for a great game when every sound is bleeping and blooping at you in harmony. Of course, it's not that simple.The challenge is getitng the rhythm right, unsurprisingly. Whilst on the whole there's a very good difficulty curve, there are the odd speed-bumps in certain levels, or certain sections in certain levels, that may prohibit you from progression or from getting that last collectible you need to 100% a level. It's this challenge though that drives you to not making do with simply passing the level and thus provides the bulk of time spent playing the game.The result is that certain levels can invoke that sense of you moving forward inch-by-inch as you clear one jump, only to fail on the next one, forcing you to replay through the rest of the level once, twice, however many times until you get that one section right. Sometimes this is okay, sometimes it can be frustrating, probably dependent on whether or not you're going for 100% or not.At the end of the day though, it's a fun game with a vivid visual presentation and some great audio that offers some pretty satisfying challenge in gameplay that's a little bit different.

												Stay away from this game. It's a good example of poor game design.The core idea is fine; it's a runner-style game, not unlike others of the genre. The good distinguishing things that it has are the art style (it looks like an Atari game) and the music. As you evade obstacles and grab items, it adds to the music in interesting ways. Sometimes, you can use musical patterns to help you determine when you should jump. It's a nice, unique touch.The problem is that the game demands perfection, and requires trial-and-error and memorization in order to achieve it. If you die (get hit by an object, run into something, or fall in a pit), you're sent back to the beginning of the level. There are a number of cheap deaths to be found, where you can't realistically be expected to foresee or react to a threat quickly enough to survive it. This means you'll have to die repeatedly while you discover these points and memorize them, until you reach a point where you can clear a level. Many of these spots require pinpoint precision, and a few levels are particularly infuriating for their great length.Perfection's a fine goal, but it shouldn't be what's required in order to play or enjoy a game. If Rock Band ended a song as soon as you missed one note, no one would play it. That's essentially what this game does, and it ruins what could have been a pleasant pixelated romp.(Note: The sequel is MUCH better, correcting most of the major problems that the first game had. If you're interested, go check that out instead.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game as a 90% off deal. I have had quite a bit of fun with the achievements and the first couple of levels in this game, however I do not think that this game is worth the retail value of 10.00. If you are looking for a game to waste time and want to be slightlyamused with the different aspects to the game pick up BIT.TRIP RUNNER. Otherwise, don't spend too much money on something that isn't worth it.			",109,26,1,8,11,3,17

												I really enjoyed this game - it is very challenging at first but i got better really fast. All you have do is press 5 Buttons a t the right timings to dodge obstacles,  collect pieces of gold and finally finish the level.Kinda short, but since it was in the humble bundle with super meat boy and cave story its def a good deal.

												I picked up the BIT.TRIP collection during the steam sale and so far this is the only game I have played and I LOVE it.  My favorite part is probably the music.  I played 1 level and was hooked.  If you are stuck on a level I recommend just coming back to it another day and work on getting all of the gold bars on levels where you may have missed them.  :)  Wonderful entertaining game if you are looking to just jump over stuff with cute music and memorize some patterns for more difficult levels.

												Value for Entertainment: $5.00This is a fun little platforming game, though may prove to be frusturating during the later stages for those not used to memorizing level layouts and patterns. The majority of the game is 'just challenging enough', and there is a lot of replay value if one has the skill to complete all of the achievements. One of the better indie platformers I've played for a while.			",106,29,1,21,10,0,2

												I find this to be much better than Runner2 (which is still a great game) because my eye-sight is not 20/20. In this game the character stands out more whereas in Runner2 I'm having enormous difficulty distinguishing whatever character I'm using and the backgrounds making it incredibly hard to time anything. It's a minor thing really but I got incredibly frustrated with Runner2 because of it. But if your eye-sight is fine you might as well go for Runner2 instead because in all other aspects it improves on this game.			",451,118,17,37,40,7,64

												This game is like a paradox. The more frustrated you get, the harder each level is to beat, and that just makes you even more frustrated. I've commonly found the best way to beat a level is to quit and come back to it later... often I can get it on the first try, no matter how difficult I'd found it before. It's a game you love to keep coming back to and I've played for hours (often in offline mode, hence my play time).Bit.Trip Runner is an extremely difficult game, but it hooks you with catchy music that will leave you mumbling motions under your breath (""kick. jump, down, jump. kick kick jump down jump kick""). Your curses at each loss (which all catapult you to the beginning of the level) will not be quite so quiet. If you're used to playing normal difficulty at other games, I recommend playing easy on this one, and don't try the most difficult setting unless you are a god. 8/10 would not buy for the full price simply because the game is so frustrating and simplistic, but would pick it up on sale any day of the week.

												This game, despite being a ""rhythm"" game, does not reward any use of rhythm- in fact, it's almost completely trial-and-error, plus it only has a few songs in it that you'll be hearing the entire time.  In addition to this, the game appears to be inconsistent with certain rules such as what constitutes an ""obstacle"".Not only that, but the graphical style and motion blur of the first world somehow managed to nauseate or give headaches and eye strain to nearly everyone who observed me playing this game- it's a literal eyesore.  I've heard decent things about its sequel, but this game is rife with problems.			",64,21,1,5,5,1,2

												A game that is definately not for everyone. Myself included. BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a very simple 2D platformer and I do not recommend getting this game unless that is a genre you very much enjoy. The game has a very 'unique' artstyle, which in my opinion clashed with the actual gameplay. I've had several short sessions of the game now, in an attempt to give it another chance but after a couple of minutes I either get bored, annoyed or (most likely) a combination of the two. I might've somewhat enjoyed had I got it as an app on my phone.			",59,4,1,9,6,0,6

												Most fun I've had while simultaniously cussing at my screen. I put it as close to Super-Meat Boy as anything can get in difficulty. (Aside from games like IWBTG, that are just there to be hard) It also rewards you nicely for accomplishments by making a pretty soundtrack even prettier. PLEASE play this game. Your life will thank you!			",174,45,6,39,20,3,37

												Why I bought the game: BundleWhat I liked about the game: This was one of my first indie bundle games that sat in my library for a while collecting dust. I am glad I tried it out, it's a simple game, you have a few commands, jump, kick, slide - what makes the game fun and not just some lame jump side scroll is the perpetual movement, mixed with positive reinforcement with sound activated moments upon collecting certain items. This is an awesome tablet or phone game as well, easy to pick up and let go, overall I love BIT TRIP and it's become a staple game for steam for me. What I didn't like about the game: The game is not easy, this isn't a bad thing - it just gets frustrating, so if you get frustrated easily this game is not for you. Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? It's cuyrrently on sale for .99 cents, which is normally is on sale or found in bundles. It's worth a play for a sale price.**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant. The current date of review 11/28./14			",163,13,8,16,20,0,28

												It is a very excellent game. You dodge obstacles as you make your melody to the songs. The songs are very catchy and great especially with the more upgrades you collect during the levels. The controls are very fluid and easy to use. If you want to, you can use a controller, but keyboard controls are very good as well. The art work is 8 bit style but with some blocky 3D models in the backround. But causual players should be wary as some of the levels are ball bustingly hard and some levels like odyssey are not forgiving as there are no checkpoints during any of the levels.overall I can't find a reasonable complaint for this game.

This game is fairly difficult due to it's very nature but it's so very enjoyable.

I would say it has the same ability to motivate you to a beat a level just like Super Meat Boy. You mess up, you start over and learn the pattern. The music also becomes a part of your process to learn the level as you collect the gold and power-ups. Usually on sale or part of a Humble Bundle, BIT.TRIP RUNNER is well worth your money and time!

												Bit. Trip Runner offers an excellent running experience with a high grain of difficulty. Players control Commander Video, the black sprite as he ventures through the world. Story is very minimal, with a few cutscenes at the start of each world and for the ending. The blocky art style transfers into 3d, where objects feel as if they could fit in a retro game. The music is superb, using chiptune and contemporary electronic music to provide beats while playing, making for dynamic music. A few songs by Anamanaguchi add to the experience. The first world is not too hard, but the later levels provide much pain yet also a refreshing change in appearance and music. I've had issues with a couple tough levels in all 3 worlds but muscled through to the end. In addition to simple running and jumping, more complex commands and obstacles are added to put difficulty and spice to the mix. The toughness of the game may be a turnoff, but the graphics and music create a love for the older era of games.			",106,20,5,4,5,2,24

												Really enjoyable rhythm runner. My biggest problem with the game is at times the levels seemed to be trial and error focused. By that I mean you have to lose repeatedly and get a little further every time until you have the level memorized. A few levels are disproportionately more difficult than the others. On the plus side, this means beating the entire game is extremely satisfying.  Aside from that the chiptune music is excellent, the graphics are charming, and despite difficulty spikes the game is addictive.For what it's worth by comparison Bit.Trip Presents Runner 2... is a lot easier and a lot less satisfying to complete than its predecessor.  If you want a real reflex challenge, then try this one out.			",86,21,3,9,4,0,5

												BIT.TRIP RUNNER is a fun little musical platformer. Unfortunately, the game has several problems. For one, Gaijin Games doesn't seem to know about the concept of a proper difficulty curve. The difficulty is all over the place. Some levels are hard, some levels are easy, and some levels are just disproportionately hard. Odyssey is one level that comes to mind, as several people haven't even gone past that level, if you check the achievements page. Another problem is that this game is only fun if you are good at it. Otherwise, it's just frustrating. And even if you are doing well, making one little mistake forces you to start the entire level over, which can be incredibly frustrating if it was a long level, and just plain disheartening if you keep making mistakes in a level. And one of the more glaring flaws, is how bonus levels are handled. You get to those after getting all the gold in a level. Unfortunately, you only have one try at them. If you fail, and want to try again to perfect the level, you have to play through the regular level all over again, just to get one shot at the bonus. Overall, it's a really unforgiving game.Now some of you may be thinking, ""What are you talking about? The game's pretty forgiving, it gives you 11 checkpoints in one level! Quit whining!"" I've heard that argument before. I am aware of how the other BIT.TRIP games work, but those games had room for error. You were allowed to make more than one mistake, and you didn't have to start a particular section over if you did. And some of you may be arguing that all this challenge and unforgiveness is just reminiscent of retro games. I suppose you could make that argument, but there's a reason why most modern games don't pull off what's done in this game, and those games were made in a time where game designers didn't really know any better, or had different ideas about what made games challenging.I suppose if you're one of those gamers that can tolerate ridiculously hard games, or are one of those people that think modern games are too easy, and are looking for challenging games, you'll probably feel right at home with this, or heck, the entire series. If you're not one of those people, you may want to skip over this title.			",127,40,2,11,10,2,12

BIT.TRIP RUNNER is the fourth game in the BIT.TRIP game series, starting with BEAT and ending with FLUX. Anyways, BIT TRIP Runner plays like the game Canabalt, in which the main character (In this case, its Commander Video.) cannot stop moving to the left, so the player must avoid obstacles via Jumping, Kicking, Sliding, and even using a spring, totally not ripping off Mario or Sonic! 9/10   Good game, but really hard.

												Sometimes this game is so hard and so buggy, that isn't easy to say it's a good game. But if you're not a big baby boy, this game can be really enjoyable. The OST is fantastic and it's integrated part of the game, I love it. The visual is pretty, but sometimes it's annoying, mainly because it can confuse you and make you die a lot of times. In the end, Bit.Trip Runner wasn't the best indie game of all time (how I used to imagine), but it's a good game. As hard as Super Meat Boy, with great musics as Bastion and with a peculiar and pretty visual as Limbo.			",157,46,4,19,7,1,24

												It is what i like all put into one game: weirdness, platforming, awesome soundtrack, retro, more weirdness, unexpectedness. It is one of those games that make you happy no matter what mood you're in before you play it, because this game is very colorful. I think the Ultra soundtrack is the best. I regret buying this game without the music. So if you are reading this and planning on buying it, spend one extra dollar to get the theme music. This game has lots of adrenaline when you get in the deeper levels. The obstacles are so well timed with the beat of the music.Cons:uhh.....emm...cant think of one...maybe this: it can get slightly frustrating, but after 5 times dying on a level it is somehow not so frustrating anymore.

												This game is full of charm and always manages to put a smile on my face. It's a simple platformer game on rails. You jump, slide, kick and spring your way through each stage, broken up into levels with a boss at the end to the infectious beats provided by the games' addictive soundtrack. Gold coins are scattered throughout each level, collecting them all gives you access to a bonus round if you make it to the end of the level. Bonus rounds are retro-stylised versions of the main game where you play for extra points to improve your high score.Death in BIT.TRIP.RUNNER is caused by hitting any obstacle, be it a knee-high ledge you were supposed to jump over or a UFO you needed to slide under. The best feature this game posseses is that, upon death you don't face loading screens or some mocking text, you are visually dragged back to the start of the level to instantly resume in the fun, this makes death (almost) painless and doesn't break the flow of your gaming.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys video-games but perhaps not to those who detest the sort of precise gameplay that BIT.TRIP.RUNNER demands in its latter levels.

The music changes depending upon how you progress in the levels which adds uniqueness to the game itself.
