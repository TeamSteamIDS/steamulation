												Background: Purchased as part of a Bundle Stars Bundle.Impressions:Wow.. it's a quick download and a quick deletion. I played up to the first boss and then quit out.Basically it's a bullet-hell game like '1942' with futuristic 3D ships and a horribly restricted field of view.It's something you've seen a million times before and does nothing to improve on the formula. The shooting just requires you hold down 2 fire buttons and let them auto fire as you try to dodge the incoming while nabbing the upgrades as they drop down.The Good:*Looks pretty decent.*Controls work well.*Sound is ok.The Bad:*Lack of impact and satisfying enemy destruction.*Field of view is too close in a tight downward angle.*Boring enemy attack patterns.*Cheap enemy tactics, attack from behind, really suck.*Weapon pickups have no discernible impact on your killing power.*Just holding down the 2 fire buttons and moving is not fun.Recommended for:Fans looking for an updated '1942' type game.. but even then it's a hard sell.Conclusion.2/10. Really weak all round and lacking anything original to keep you interested.			",683,273,20,84,61,7,96

												As there is nowadays a big influx of shooters games on steam there is starting to be somewhat of a crowd at the bottom of the pile. This game is down there in the pile. It may perhaps be more on top of that pile as there are worse shooters but that doesnt help much. Why so? As other reviews have accurately described this game suffers from hard to tell hit collision as enemies alter altitude and often approach you from behind. I'd also add that pacing is a problem. Evidence? Find a Let's play video about the first level -> notice the attack patterns and hit boxes? Long long chains of repeating patterns come at you. And then without much ado the boss crawls forth to battle you. I must also point out it's by far biggest sin: Pricing. there are other shooter games that i won't be naming that score points as they are simply so incredibly cheap you can get them for some coins and they give you that 30-60min of mediocre fun. This one is overpriced and gets annoying quickly and thus it's price/quality is bonkers. I like to see past problems of games and find redeeming qualities in them that would make them different and perhaps place them in a niche. Alas i can't find any redeeming qualities in this game considering the competition on steam AND pricing.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												Quick review coming from a shmup lover.The Good :- the game does't look too bad. By today's standards, it doesn't look too good either, but I wouldn't mind if it played ok.- Music sounds good, but...The Bad :- Controls are rigid. Don't even try to play with an XBOX360 controller...- Patterns are repetitive.- I have a big feeling problem with this game. Can't feel the power of the weapons. Can't feel when I'm hit. This is probably because the sound in the game is not very well balanced.- ... the sounds FX are weak. Can't hear any explosion. Shot sounds are flat and weak.- Music sounds totally inappropriate. It's good, but it feels like it's the music from another game...Definitely not worse the full price.			",206,44,15,19,7,2,24

												Wow this is bad. Almost impressivly so. Sure, It was probably easy to make things like the art bland and the music painfully generic, but in other areas it seems like there was some real effort to make this properly terrible. A camera angle which makes it difficult to place where your ship is relative to bullets, that's some effort right there. Ship movement which seems oddly disconnected from controller input, hit boxes that float some distance away from the actual target, sound effects that scrape against your will to live. This crap doesn't make itself y'know.  ",669,204,30,92,73,10,138

												This game is mediocre at best. The menu selection is just awful, especially for the upgrades, it's not clear what each upgrade of your guns, rockets, power, shields can do, no idea what each gun is, everything is trial and error. Even so, it starts with such a fury and speed, the bosses are almost unbeatable, and it feels like all of the time someone's attacking you from behind or just trying collide with you. This game feels like nightmare even if you selected easy.My advice: This genre is best portrayed in the old ""Raptor: Call of the Shadows"" game. This game should have been influenced more from that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Made by the developers of Bad Rats, need I say more?This game is bad. Really bad. The gameplay is repetitive and boring, even before the end of the first level I wanted to stop playing. The voice acting is the worst I've heard, the music is a short 30 second loop, the fire sound is awful and since this is a space shooter you'll hear it A LOT. Visually the foreground and background objects feel like they are drawn for two entirely different games (they don't mesh well) and are hard to look at.I'm sad that I even installed this game, in the end I found no enjoyment.

												While not a terrible game, I wouldn't recommend it because frankly the current price of $10 is much too high and also as it is a classic arcade-style shooter, if that is what you feel like playing then I might suggest you go and play one of those instead that you could get for much less and that would not have some of the same issues.What I liked:-Classic arcade-style shooting-Ability to upgrade ship in between battles-Decent number of affordable upgrades for ship-Shields can make your ship tolerate more punishment than some other similar shootersWhat I did not like:-No tutorial or explanation of item pickups-No saving even between missions (play all at once or lose your score)-Default controls unintuitive; controls could be remapped but some are hardcoded and these are not identified anywhere  -For example, Space = swap secondary weapon. You can map Space to something else, but it will then do both (annoying)-Sounds were not well balanced, so voices were always too quiet in contrast with background music even after adjustments-Level backgrounds did not feel very dynamic, more like a scrolling wallpaper than your ship actually flying through a zone.

												Razor2: Hidden Skies is a sci-fi ""bullet hell"" game made by the Brazilian studio responsible for Bad Rats - Invent 4 Entertainment.  The numeral ""2"" appended to the name of the game begs the question as to the whereabouts of the original game. There was no Razor 1 listed on Invent 4's website which leads me to believe this is the only publicly available game in this series. Unable to find any mention of an original game, it leads me to speculate that the developers artificially appended the title with a ""2"" to make it seem like a more successful franchise than it actually is. Razor2 seems to make strides in being as mediocre as possible. Much of each level seems to insult the value of your time by presenting you with repetitive and uninteresting fill content. Most attacks simply vanish into the enemies and offer little to no indication that you're actually doing damage which both makes you wonder if you're using the right weapon and leaves up unsatisfied in the shoot 'em up experience. To the game's merit many of the enemies have a very appealing design albeit a bit generic. The game's soundtrack is very orchestral that made the game feel a bit like a movie. The boss fights offered a fair challenge but enduring the levels of mediocrity to get to them failed to make the endeavor worthwhile.The game offers you three lives and a single continue. Once these are depleted you are forced to start the game from the beginning.The game does support USB controllers but only in game as navigating the menu seemed to require the mouse at some point.Score: 4.5/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												Razor 2: Hidden Skies tries gallantly to emulate the shmups of yore, but falls flat not for want of creativity (though it could certainly use a bit more), but inexcusable♥♥♥♥♥♥ups on the game mechanics themselves.The game attempts, in some places, to be a bullet hell game but the hitbox of your ship is extremely large and does not even match the graphic - it awkwardly extends out an uncertain distance to both sides, but does not seem to include the nose of the fighter. Furthermore, the areas extend visually farther than your actual range of motion, but this is impossible to tell without running right into an invisible wall. In several areas, enemies park right on this wall, giving the illusion that you can zip around them to avoid fire and take them out, right up until you crash into them headlong making the attempt. This is made even more unweildly by the boss fights that zoom the camera out, supposedly to impress you with how big the boss is. Sadly the net result is that now you can see even more but have the same narrow movement lane, exacerbating the problem even more.Two subweapons are heat-seeking with auto targetting, but there is no mechanic to choose what you'd like to target - the game seems to completely arbitrarily choose for you, and even if the lock-on happens to be a priority target, anything flying in the path of your slow-traveling relativistic missiles will intercept them and explode instead. (Which prompts the question of how does a missile travelling at relativistic speeds even work, and if it does why are they so bloody slow?) The bosses are all recycled variants of each other - fight three tanks, then fight three spinning satellite things, then... etc.Unfortunately the problems do not stop there. Movement is imprecise and jerky. Combine this with the awkard hitboxes and you've committed a cardinal sin in the shmup genre - dodging is effectively impossible in places, though this doesn't matter a terrible lot since to cover for this the game slathers you in multiple shields which partially refresh upon each pick-up. Despite that fact, you still take a lot of hits simply because your hitbox isn't where you think it is, and it's nigh impossible to guage where its limits are precisely, since it extends well beyond the ship graphic. Unfortunately, the pickups themselves don't make a terrible lot of sense. One of the most common is Energy, which restores a pip on your Energy meter. Which is grand, only the game never quite explains what Energy is for or why you want it, despite being able to upgrade your ship batteries to have more of it. Oh well, free shields I guess!In general the game is horridly unpolished. The translation is riddled with grammatical errors, word misuse, and typos (I'm not sure what a Gravity Riffle is). Each mission has a cheesy low-quality text-to-speech mission introduction voiceover, only it gets a few words into it before the explosions start and the rest is completely drowned out. Oops. Hope it wasn't important. Soon after starting the second mission, the primary fire input became stuck and I was essentially on autofire for the rest of the game. Which isn't all bad I suppose, except with the input stuck, I became unable to read mission briefings (not a tremendous loss since they're an exercise in bad English and misspelled words) and upon finishing and going to the main menu it would spam me right into a new game on Easy Mode, not allowing me to change settings or even exit the game. I had to alt-tab and manually kill it.In short, I can't recommend this game at all, even to die-hard shmup fans, unless you seriously need a fix and simply cannot find something else to scratch the itch.

												This is the Bad Rats of shmups - that is to say it is a work of art. Wonderfully paced, and with stunning action and dazzling laser shot fighting, you can't go wrong with this game. Every bullet is exciting to dodge - will it hit you? With the hitboxes being mostly arbitrary, this will lead to endless excitement. The boss battles are pulse-poundingly exciting, and as the bosses have extreme amount of health, and no way to see how much health they have left, it makes a profound statement on the futility of war. I don't know what happened to Razor1, but Razor2 is a game that will change PC Gaming forever.			",1056,410,51,127,132,12,182

												This game had a few issues;The collision with other enemies is atrocious. You'll often take damage without even touching the incoming ship. The bullets are ok though;This collision issue gets worse when you notice the area you can move in around is much smaller than it looks;It crashed a few times which is really annoying;Not all menus can be controlled by keyboard, for example I couldn't close the medal earned windows, it's rather annoying to have to click it with the mouse when I'm mostly playing this with the keyboard; Speaking of the menus, their click area also seems to be a bit off. Sometimes the option doesn't get lit up even though the mouse is hovering over it. Should respond to a rectange that expands well beyond the text to avoid such annoyance;Some weapons seemed clearly more powerful and useful than the others, so that got me into not even bothering with the other ones;The default options have to be changed. I only noticed there was a woman talking on the second time I played the game - the default Music Volume value severely overpowers both the voice (which is quite useful) and the game sounds;There is a large number of resolutions available... but not mine? (1600x900) Really? C'mon...Also, the W resolutions (which I suppose stands for Widescreen) for some reason make the game display wrong. It'll not show up fully to the top, so you'll not see most enemies that appear near the top. I don't know if I crapped the configs up to get that effect or what, but it happened, so I switched to windowed mode at 1024x768 I settled with that;The time limit for the bosses is annoying. I killed a boss at the last few seconds of the time limit, and it ran out and killed me while the boss was exploding. It offered me to continue, which I accepted, it completed the mission and for some reason the next one no enemies could shoot and they would die a few instants after entering the screen. Not sure if related, but, that's a glitch right there....That aside, it was pretty fun, though nothing memorable.I personally found the soundtrack a bit weird, I felt like I was playing God of War or some♥♥♥♥♥♥lol			",196,8,8,19,2,0,4

												This game could have been a lot better, but it isn't. The ship upgrading part of the game is pretty cool and that had me excited. Unfortunately, that was all. It would be nice if you received more money to better experience what all the upgrades have to offer.The collision/hit boxes are terrible, primarily on your own ship. You try and go around a stationary enemy and you end up with a collision even though there was plenty of space between.The camera isn't entirely top-down like most shoot-em-ups, but that's not necessarily a good thing, especially not with this game. Sometimes it's almost impossible to tell if any bullets are going to hit you or if you're able to dodge them. Chances are, you're going to get hit. There's a game called AirStrike. That one's much better.At first I thought this game was designed to be tough, but later on I just wasn't so sure. I enjoyed Raptor, Tyrian, and Do-Don-Pachi. This game felt like it was challenging only due to design flaws.			",605,160,18,61,55,9,75

I don't know what I was expecting from this game, I guess I felt like finishing a game since this one is only 1-2 hours long but I couldn't get pass level 6. The weapons, shields and slots are confusing af, and the 3 weapons you can chose to upgrade are worthless.The game is overpriced, with 10$ you can buy a much more entertaining game than this. I guess you could buy it for 2 or 3 bucks if you like these kind of games and you're looking for a challenge, otherwise it isn't worth even the 2$. The graphics and the pattern the enemies attack you make this game very unpleasent. It's not fun, and sometimes I feel it's not challenging either, as you can't possibly dodge every incoming bullet.Do I recommend this for the full price? Totally no. Do I recommend this for 2$? Still no. The game is playable but it's not fun. Pick it up in a bundle or something if you really want to try your luck on this.			",437,97,29,58,44,7,64

												It's an ok game but the controls are very unforgiving. No controller dead zone means your ship will go in random directions sometimes for no reason. You can also feel those effects on the menu screen when it starts going places you don't want it to. The game itself is rather basic. The auto is odd, the music is really loud and the sfx and voice are very quiet by default. You can upgrade a few weapons to max very quickly and they become your default weapons. Just not all that enertaining after a while. I wish it was. It has the potential to be a lot better but they need to sand off all the rough edges.			",896,291,34,99,89,8,128

												Razor2's biggest fault is the lack of level structure and enemy variety.  Stages consist of the same formation of enemies, that only have one flight pattern and one bullet pattern, and just repeats over and over.  Fifteen seconds into any stage, and you've already seen everything there is to see for the next few minutes.Powering up your weapons works in reverse.  That is, leveling up your weapons only lets you keep up with increasing enemy hit points in the next stage.  Whichever weapon you choose not to upgrade becomes completely unusable.I also had some issues with controller support, which others noted in the forums as well.  However the game is playable on keyboard, so there are workarounds available to those who seek them out.For some better shmups on steam, I can recommend:Alltynex series (Kamui, RefleX, Alltynex 2nd)AstebreedCrimzon CloverDanmaku Unlimited 2Ether Vapor RemastereXceed series (mostly 2 and 3)Gundemonium series (Gundeadligne, Gundemonium Recollection, Hitogata Happa)JamesdownSatazius			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hilariously bad. Out of its many faults, the bad controls are the dealbreaker. That and the fact that you can only use 80% of the screen for some reason. If you try to go to the leftmost or rightmost 10% of the screen you just hit an invisible wall. Hope you weren't trying to dodge something! Oh wait. Of course you weren't. Beacuse this is a bad game and you shouldn't play bad games.			",364,94,24,42,44,4,77

												I have a soft spot for all old-school 2d platform action games like this.  So when this was on a special, I was really excited. Firstly, this is an indie title, so mentioning anything about graphics is really quite daft.  So I will only mention the gameplay control elements.And with that, the game is honestly very dull.  The boss fights are tedious and frustrating.  You dont get any sense of achievement during a boss fight as you dont notice if you have destroyed a part of it or not, and you dont really get to focus on the boss as the devs decided to add spawns of continious non-bosses in the boss fights.  So yes, the boss fights are ""incredible"", but not in a good way.  The collision detection is also really awful, most of the time I dont know whether a bullet actually hit me or not, even though I could swear that it should have hit me.  This is also true in shooting enemy planes, I shot down enemy planes where I could swear I shouldnt have been able to.  Then there is also the fact that enemies just spawn randomly all over the place and that they just hammer and spam attacks in every direction that all you really do at the end of the day is focus on is trying to dodge while just jamming the attack button while you have your homing laser equipped.  The entire combat system thus feels like dumb luck and an exercise of chance and pointlessness.The controls are also unitiative and silly.  There isnt a brief tutorial to familiarise you with the keys, so it forces you to look up the key config. Sure, it might be better on a controller, but to be honest, I am not going to bother with a controller if there is only partial controller support because I really cannot be bothered to fiddle with a keyboard+mouse AND a controller while playing a game.  Though, this complaint generally stems from my complete disinterest in the title, and I guess if you really manage to get into it, this isnt really an Issue, but I couldnt, so it was an issue for me.One of the large draws of these action games is a sense of excitement, achievement and skill, and this game does not provide any of it.  There are too many games on the market, and while this would have been worth a go a few years ago, there really are just better alternatives, as it has been done better multitudes of times, and I can therefore not recommend this game.

												Old school with new technologie. - Well i have to disagree, the gfx could be back from 2005, even with a good configured highend rig the game is acting slow, seems the devs never made a shmup or don't have a idea about good gameplay in such games. The sound is awfull and i turned it off immediatly, the sound effects are ok but not good at all. If you set a widescreen resolution like 1980*1080 the ui will fill up almost 50% of the screen, the controll is like if you play with a wet sponge.If you are looking for a good shmup : Go by Syder Arcade or Sine Mora, those two games fit the slogan Old school with new technologie and are worth every penny.

												No, please don't waste your time on this. Razor2 is a complete joke as compared to many better shooters you can grab in both the arcades and online.Gameplay is very poor and unpolished as it gets repetitive, cheap (as in enemies coming in from behind unexpectedly), and boring (predictable and lame enemy patterns, and bosses take FOREVER to kill without appropriate weapons or upgrades).Even as a fan of shooters (like me), it's still not worth it....I guess the ONLY possible reason for grabbing this is the orchestrated music, but still no. The music is so incredibly loud that you will not be able to notice over 50% of the sound effects in this game (voices included).Long story short: Save your money for better shmups.

												Played 11 minutes with this game so far. I want it back. I expected to have an old-school shooter but didn't expect to have such technical execution and I don't mean it in a good way. A strange thing I really didn't expect was that this game's graphical engine is so badly optimized that I experienced stuttering, laggy controls and pretty low framerate and this ruined my game experience in no time.If you want to play a great shooter, check out Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender instead.Edit: Played a little more and here are some notes:* You cannot save. Once you quit you need to start from Mission 1 again.* The menu mouse controls are awful. You'd think that you clicked on something while you haven't.* When there are a certain amount of enemies on the screen I still get a large framerate drop when I have shadows enabled.

												Can't remember where did I get this - bundles?Almost instantlly installed this just seeing a 3D shmup is kind of rare and worth taking a look. The first thing that pretty much disappoints me was the video setting - no 16:9 options at all, default setting is 1024*768 or so that stretches so wide I can barely read the words. After finished with the video settings I started a game with only 60% of my screen used.Gameplay is more terrible than I can imagine. Poor graphics is still acceptable, but this game fails to deliver any tension, you will have absolutly no feeling of accomplishment - dodging bullets is way too easy and provides no challenge at all, you wound't feel that you are swift or keeping up your precision to survive. Battles before the boss are so bored you will start to ponder how long it will take. Finally the boss battle, it is just another X minutes you can't stop thinking ""when will this boring $*** end""? Terrible thing for shump games that requires you to concentrate.I forgot to mention - poor SFX and BGM, any random music will sound more relevalant to the scene than the BGM.Definitively not worth $9.99, not even $0.99. I don't think the team can do better with 2D, it is more about gameplay than graphics.			",360,144,13,66,57,5,98

												Who doesn't love a clone of one of the more beloved arcade games? 1942 and its bottom-up schmup ilk are easy to pick-up and play, and require no need to learn complex button presses or tactics. Hold the button down and blast away everything in sight. I was hoping Razor2 would scratch that itch - a 10 minute pick-up and play game. How wrong could the game go? Pretty wrong in fact.First of all, for a game that was released in 2010 this game doesn't run well. My computer isn't a monster, but it should be able to run something like this. Judging by the screen tearing, rapid drop in frame-rate, and dodgy animation, maybe I'm wrong. Bear in mind the game doesn't run at full resolution, it vertically blocks either side of the screen to squash the image. This is a poor show, even with all these solutions the game runs badly.The gameplay isn't any great shakes, but after playing the first boss for 10 minutes and not getting anywhere, I decided I was done with this game. The most frustrating thing is there was no feedback whether I was hitting the right part of the boss. The small enemies line up like pawns in a chess game taking all the hits and doing nothing but make the game more frustrating. If a game can't tell the player whether what they are doing is right or wrong - as in you hit the enemy and it turns red - then how does the player know whether their actions are effective or not?I'm done with this game. It takes something of a certain quality to not even make it through the first level. This is one such game.			",37,19,0,5,13,0,4

												I was hoping for this to be a port or spiritual successor to Raptor: Call of the Shadows. At best, this game is just another vertical-scroll shmup that could-have, should-have, but didn't. At worst, this game is the deformed afterthought of something great, standing as a grim testament to game quality sacrificed at the altar of publishing dates and delivery deadlines.The graphics are unpolished and the game UI/menus are painfully slow, with unusable tooltips. The gameplay is monotonous and uninteresting and collision detection is indiscernible. Bullet hell generates notable in-game lag even on a new computer from 2014. Power-ups seem to be ineffective, and replay value is nil. In summary: Just go play Raptor. You're welcome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really wants to be Raiden 2 but sadly lacks in art direction and gameplay compared to almost any other shmup I've played on PC.			",286,66,8,16,22,2,19

												This little top down scrolling shooter was ok at the beginning, then just like Midway 1942, it all gets rather boring quickly. Fun just the same.cb.			",349,88,50,45,65,5,52

												this game is just another bland shootemup. it also keeps crashing.i mean sure it has upgrades, but the weapons are pretty basic, the same kind you would find in a free flash game. the graphics are also of free flash game level.			",492,164,25,70,87,4,128

												This is a Shoot 'm Up arcade style game.Personally I have a big fan of these kind of games.But this game I think obviously a lot less funYes, there is possibility of upgrading body, arms, reactor core and many others.Game does not give me the feel of an arcade game.I can be much hit by bullets and not die.Until I get to the final boss you suddenly sweeps away.By the amount of bullets makes it confusing and dodge is almost impossible ..Joypad support is there, but works really bad.There is little depth in the game because you do mission to mission.I've Played many games but I think this one of the more lesser games.Music is pretty good but we do not buy the gamefor that.Not a very bad game only very boring after small amount of time.Fun for 80 cent not for 8,99 or 2,49 on sale sometimes.Skip this and buy another game !!

												A terrible, terrible game. Riddled with crippling bugs and painful music, this game has no place being on Steam. So many other, more deserving games are being passed over on Steam - and turds like this and Revelations 2012 are allowed to♥♥♥♥♥♥up players' game libraries and waste precious minutes of their lives. Avoid like the plague.			",463,84,17,48,56,4,84

												Upon opening, the game wouldn't load past the opening screen, a low resolution picture: ""RAZER2: HIDDEN SKIES"".After that, I couldn't alt tab out to close the game. I hooked up a second monitor, opened task manager, and I couldn't force the process to close. Taskkiller couldn't end this game. So far it is basically a cockroach. I had to restart my pc just so I could end the thing and uninstall the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.			",362,72,13,40,25,1,58

												Decent top scroller, but the menu system is a pain. Graphics aren't the best, and the music is over used and under diversified.gameplay is fun, and familiar. Not gonna say this is the best ever, but if you can get it on sale, it is worth playing. I like the upgrade system, and gameplay, even if the menus and graphics arent as polished. (I believe I paid .79 Cents for this)			",480,150,19,94,19,4,38

												It has your basic elements of a shmup, but fails to provide anything special. I don't necessarily hate the game, but it is a bit bland and kinda slapped together. Overall, not absolutly terrible....just clunky.			",511,105,11,72,14,3,65

												A good 90s style bullet hell vertical scrolling shoot 'em up.There are certain limitations to this genre: I don't think it's possible to make a AAA bullet hell game.  ( It doesn't have the content of a AAA game so don't pay AAA prices for it.)  Indeed some of the best shooters have very primative graphics.  But assuming you are aware of that, and you like the genre, you will enjoy this.  To the basic formula it only adds 3D graphics and upgrade shop.  It also has good orchestral music.  Everything is quite generic but since this style of game has been done a thousand times before I guess that is inevitable.  Only major thing missing is a 2 player mode.			",413,86,19,39,46,2,66
