												It has a nice theme. The cutscenes are gorgeous. The concept is fresh. And the overall style is neat ... BUT ... : ...At first you'll have to play a level !!! E-X-A-C-T-L-Y !!! as it was thought up by the developer AND you will have to restart a level quite often just because those damn turrets sometimes simply don't shoot at the leading guy but keep changing firepower from enemy to enemy. What's worst about it: this behaviour is not foreseeable by the player. Sometimes the guns do their job well, some other time they totally ♥♥♥♥ up your defense.Now what's MOST ANNOYING is that the GUI doesn't securely get your mouseclicks. Sometimes you have to click 2 - 3 times before it's recognized. Naturally regarding the totally weird difficulty curve of this game this behaviour will have you to restart the levels quite often too.ON THE TOP OF IT: Each time you leave the game it produces a nice little memory leak which is absolute ridiculous for THE leading benchmark producer ... though I must assume I haven't gotten better experiences from their benchmark programs either ... and I've got  a quite decent setup ...Don't get me wrong. This game can be fun when it's played on easy difficulty but don't expect to reach any of the heigher achievements anywhere soon in this game. Look at the achievements stats and you can clearly see what I mean ...The good thing about this game is it's arcade mode which stands synonymously for freeplay and can be a lot of fun for a coffebreak or some ...Get this game only on a large discount and try the demo first!

												Unstoppable Gorg is a tower defense game of the sub-genre I call ""pointlessly manic"" -- to play it properly you must fail a level repeatedly while figuring out a sequence, and then click 8 billion times per round and hope against hope that something random doesn't get in the way of the exact movement/clicking sequence ""strategy"" that the hardest difficulty requires to 100%. Repeat until you beat... or in the case of this game, don't bother. Because it's not even worth it. The orbit gimmick is stupid and never should have left the drawing board. Forcing players to memorize sequences and deal with RNG on top of that nonsense (to say nothing of the glitches and gotchas that ruin round after round) is just lazy tower defense design and a luminary like Futuremark should be ashamed of themselves. With the gameplay removed this would be a great screensaver, but a great game it is not.I love tower defense games, but man do I hate tower defense games like Unstoppable Gorg. The music, art, and presentation are all top notch -- I especially love the bad sci-fi movietone reel feel. But the gameplay is just atrociously designed spew. Even many flash TDs and war3 maps were far better. Unstoppable Gorg isn't just a bad game, it's gameplay is actively annoying, irritating, and head shaking. Deleted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unstoppable Gorg is a tower defense game with a twist: Your defense towers must be placed on concentric rings: you are placing defensive satellites in orbit around a planet. Once in place, you can swivel the rings to reposition your towers to face attackers from different directions.I loved Unstoppable Gorg's 50's sci-fi aesthetic, but I didn't really enjoy the gameplay as much as I thought I would. I would recommend this if you are a fan of tower defense games in need of a new challenge, but those new to the genre might prefer the more straightforward approach of a traditional tower defense game like Defense Grid.

												I'm a sucker for tower defense games, so I picked this up. Unstoppable Gorg puts a few new twists in the genre by allowing you to swing your entire defense row in a circle. There are 21 stages, 4 difficulty levels, most stages will be beaten within 10 minutes or so.I would have liked the ability to see the stats of my foes at a glance, and the ability to survey the map before I start the battle. The game gets annoyingly difficult quickly. I always feel like I'm under pressure, as enemies assault you within seconds of your establishing an economy.The cutscenes are fantastic, mimicking 50's science fiction films, complete with cheese. If anything, I played the game just to watch these, however short they were.Despite the amusing cutscenes (which can be watched on YouTube) , I am not recommending this game. It's short, kinda frustrating at times, and to me has little replay value. I had richer experiences with Flash TD games.EDIT: With the new reviews system, I changed the default thumbs up to a thumbs down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A silly tower defense game.  Fortunately, I happen to like silly tower defense games.It offers a decent variety of towers and enemies, always a key ingredient.  (Although I found some of the tower types more or less indispensable, and others pretty worthless.)  You get money from killing enemies, but also from building generators, so there is that tension between investing and beefing up your defenses.  Lastly, the game brings us something new: orbiting towers.  All your defenses must be placed at preset points in 2-4 rings surrounding your ship/station.  These rings are fixed in distance from the center, and the build points are fixed in distance from each other, but the entire ring can be rotated.  This lets you move your towers into position near the enemy's attack paths (highlighted by glowy dotted lines), or even follow a wave around to keep it in range longer.  Since the levels are in space, with no real 'terrain', this is a good way of doing things.One of the game's strongest points is actually not the system itself, but the whole aesthetic.  The entire thing, down to the last detail, is done over to look like a cheesy, low-budget, 40s/50s sci-fi movie/TV show.  The costumes in the live-action cutscenes, the flying saucer enemies, the robots that look like they were patched together from old car parts, the towers that look like they're made of cardboard and tinfoil, and the buttons & iconography on the menus all appear just like you'd expect them to.  I've never played a game that did something similar, and while I wouldn't want it to become a trend, it really works here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While fun at first, and made better by an interesting play mechanic, this game is frustrating to say the least (and not a in a buggy way, purely in terms of play).  I'm a huge fan tower defense in general but this game feels a little unbalanced and too hard to be accessible to the masses that I imagine they intended to sell this one to.For 99 cents or some other low sale, give it a try, but don't feel a need to pay retail for this one. It is largely disappointing...and did I say frustrating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A middling tower defense game. Has decent graphics and cool retro-futurism designs and cinematics. Its very original concept, a tactical perimeter based on satelites and orbits around a base or planet, is ruined by  emplacements restriction, the marching of foes timed to the second, and the random trayectories of asteroids that prevent get better classifications. Sometimes the weapons point to closer enemies instead of ones first of the row... Requires many patience and perseverance to pass levels at high difficultly with perfect stadistics.

												An nice little tower defence game, seems fairly challanging. Not my favourite genre of game, so perhaps you should look elsewhere for a review of gameplay comparisons, but I can say I found them enjoyable. Being able to rotate the orbits of your defence buildings is an interesting mechanic, meaning the placement of your guns takes a little more spacial awareness than it would elsewhere. As far as I played, the maps seems smaller than other games, where you'd place less towers, but as you're expected to move them this is a good thing. Means you have to conisder your placements even more.Why I love this game is the style. Playing through the story you get 50's style info clips, with a perfectly done voice over, perfect cheesy style, film of bad alien costumes and spaceships hanging from wires, It's lovely, and fits so well. It even has a couple of easter eggs in the films, which was a nice touch. Anyone who has ever smiled at cheesy 1950s sci-fi stuff will enjoy these scenes. You couple that with a like of tower defence and spacial awareness puzzles and you should maybe buy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unstoppable Gorg is a unique, retro-styled approach to the Tower Defense genre and takes the whole gameplay into space. Instead of towers, you have a wide selection of satellites that you have to carefully place on one of the available orbits of the habitat that you have to defend.You have to constantly rotate the orbits to move your satellites towards your enemy's routes, which is also the biggest difference to other TD games where you simply place your towers and wait for the enemy waves to pass by. This is a cool twist as it can cause quite a few hectic moments, but involves the player a lot more into the actual gameplay.The story mode features a total of 21 levels and has some really cool cutscenes in between. Additionally there is a Challenge mode where you can replay all 21 levels with additional, pre-defined modifiers. Last but not least, there is also an Arcade mode, which is basically a survival mode where you fight endless waves of enemies for the highscore.Good stuff!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 20, 2014
												TL;DR summary: A tower-defense game with an interesting twist and a fun theme. Recommended if you can get it while it's on sale.This one was a pleasant surprise. I think everyone is sick of tower-defense games by now, but this one has a pretty interesting mechanic. You place your defense sattelites on building spots on orbits. Each orbit can be freely rotated, but only the entirety of the orbit can be moved. So you can click and drag your towers to make them follow the critters, but you run the risk of moving other towers on the same ring *away* from enemy paths. Similarly, you might end up moving support towers near enemies where they have no business being. So it's a bit more involved than just placing towers and clicking ""go"". So that's fun! The difficulty seems alright, too. I can generally make ""Moderate"" at first try. ""Hard"" and ""Unstoppable"", not so much. There are a few nuisances - like having to reassign Research Points at the start of *every* mission - but nothing too grating.The writing is pretty nice. Obviously, a game like this isn't going to have astonishing Deus Ex-esque plot - actually, the fact that there's a plot at all surprised me. It's deliberately patterned after horrible old sci-fi movies, which is nice if you like it. (I very much do!) If you don't, well, you can skip the cutscenes and you won't lose anything. So on the overall, I'd say this is well worth it, if you can get it for less than 10 dollars. A few things made me roll my eyes - really, you don't need to tell me five times about what enemies are vulnerable to - and obviously it's a bit rough around the edges, but nothing big. I could see this do nicely on mobile devices. How about an Android port?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely LOVE this game -- it's probably my favorite indie title ever.  It has a goofy retro sense of humor which perhaps some younger gamers don't appreciate, so just to avoid any possible confusion: it is NOT trying to be serious.  Some folks complain that it's too hard for a ""casual"" game, but I didn't find that to be true at all.  True, I had to repeat some levels several times before I got through them -- but do you really want a game that you can beat in one sitting?  I think of each level as a puzzle that has to be solved rather than a simple anything-goes shoot 'em up.  Most of all I appreciate that this game has in abundance something that most are completely lacking: style.  I periodically return to play through the whole campaign just to experience that.  An unreserved thumbs up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really nice Tower Defense game. It's pretty unique where you place your towers (actually Satellites) in concentric rings around whatever you're trying to protect. Most of the time the rings are moveable, allowing you to focus fire on an enemy by sliding the ring around, keeping your tower on them.It's got a decent steep difficulty so it's no walk in the park. The best part is the story. It's a campy 50's style with news feeds and breaking news, along with multiple aliens trying to wipe out earth. The production values, while cheap looking, actually are pretty cool in the detail presented. It has deep gameplay - with many modes and difficulty levels and challenges. High replay value Highly recommended if you like TD games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love a good Tower Defense game, and i love all the innovative versions people come up with.But the sad fact is that this game didn't quite deliver. Well they delivers a whole lot, but the overall product isn't good enough. The pace, the difficulty, the upgrades, together they don't feel right. And a good feeling is the most important in a TD game, however vague i was in explaining what that feeling really is.But the developers should get credit for running with their idea all the way. I love the old black and white sci-fi feel to it. But even that feel forced since they have them before and after every mission. Half of that would have sufficed.Close, but no prize i'm afraid, as i had high hopes and really wanted this gem to have been more pristine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game, but after changeing to the ""Easy"" in options... ""Normal"" is way too hard. And I finished many, many games, also tower defence.In general: Visulas and this great, super-funny (for me) retro-feeling is OK. But the game becomes way too difficult after a few missions. It's due to the complete lack of decent pause, or active pause. You also cannot look at the paths of your enemies at the begenning of the mission... Thus strategy and planning is quite difficult - when yor're playin on ""Normal"" difficulty. On ""Normal"" you have re-play missions for many, many times, losing any fun in it pretty soon....But when you change for ""Easy"" (and it's a must, belive me), game becomes ""Normal"" ;) It's a great relief, because it's worth it - to own it and to play it! So if  it's on sale, and you like tower defence games, just buy it. Quickly change difficulty level to ""Easy"" and have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unstoppable Gorg is a charming tower defense title with, unfortunately, some flaws. Planet Earth is your base, and you can use orbits to place sattelites (which are your towers actually). It's just that it's very limited... since there are predetermined spots where you can place sattelites. When I bought this game I was initially thinking I would be able to place them anywhere on the orbit lines, but that's just not the case.Besides that, the game can get frustratingly hard, resulting in an aweful lot of replays.Now, the graphics do look good and the sounds get the job done as well. But it's nothing special really. The movies inbetween are kinda cool though, using real actors and stuff. But in the end it's all about the gameplay, and Unstoppable Gorg just isn't the tower defense title I hoped it would be. Still, you really can't go wrong with tower defense games, so if that's your genre I suggest you try it out anyway.[Rating: 63/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything had to be exactly the way the developer imagined you beating the game. This turret there, that turet there. Move them at this precise time, etc..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very difficult tower defence game. you can move around the orbits of satilites which I thought would make it easier, but it really didn't. It just makes it incredibly difficult.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily worth a dollar, maybe 4. Hilarious intro graphics and funny concept. If you like dumb tower defense games and goofy 1950s sci-fi movies, this might even be worth the main asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tower Defense in the form of Satellite Defense.  There is a high level of challenge in later missions, especially on the ""Unstoppable"" difficulty level.Many will appreciate the humorous cutscenes.  There are a few game modes - Story, Challenge and Arcade, so there's some decent gameplay hours if you want to finish the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty fun tower defense game.  The ability to move your defenses around being a nice twist.  Great 1950's schlock sci-fi theme with cheese ball short movies between levels.  (Yeah, the Roman numeral says 1914.)  Shortish story mode that doesn't over stay it's welcome and is relatively easy to beat on easy.  Also has challenge modes that are unlocked as well as an infinite wave arcade mode.  Not as polished or as in depth as Defense Grid, but still a great game over all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
