												Couldn't decide what campaign was betterThe russian campaign was incredible, the fighting in the streets, your comrads fighting alongside you, it was amazing.The british campaign had amazing story, fighting alongside captain price and privatemacgregor, getting stuck in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations with both of them like ""armored car escape""Rushing the nazis in a tank alongside other crusader tanksThe american campaign had exhilerating cinema and dialogue, like when you run offthe carrier and it explodes behind you, leaving you on the ground watching men burning andgetting shot, and the part where Braeburn and Mcloskey leave the spare can of ammo on the road""geez louise Mcloskey, how did you get to be company gunner?

The AI over all was really good. you'd actually have to sit and fight with your fellow soldiers to kill the nazis,no rush or you die. the amount of guns in the game was amazing, a wide variety of russian, american and britishguns, and historical accuracy. something the rest of the WWII Call Of Duties lacked.The graphics were amazing for its time, they didn't over do it and gave it exactly the right kind ofambient textures.an incredibly enojyable game, from crawling through pipes to shooting down aircraft to scaling a cliff, call of duty 2 is the best WWII Call Of Duty of all time.

												Best CoD and WW2 Shooter I had ever played.Singleplayer and Multiplayer are brilliant!The Singleplayer campaign is huge and challenging. It is very cinematic style and makes also a lot of fun. On high difficulty level the game is very hard and forces you to change your strategy. Even only hidding for enemies is not possible in some cases.The soundtrack is great and the voice overs are also brilliant.The Multiplayer is great. The Maps are all well done and there are even some remakes from the first CoD Installment like ""Carentan"".			",171,19,2,17,8,0,8

												Call of Duty 2 is a first-person game from Activision. It is a next installment in the Call of Duty franchise, probably the best before the modern warfare series came out.Call of Duty 2 with better engines, has a new set of story of history in the second world war, as the Russian, we go back to Stalingrad but we get the chance to Moscow too, while the American side of the story, you play with the 2nd Ranger Battalion on D-Day, and then the British side, the battle in Africa and sometimes after D-Day with Captain Price and the boys from the 7th Armoured Division, meeting the famous Tiger Ace along the way. You also get to play with kinda more detailed world war II era weapon like the Mosin Nagant, M1 Garand, or the MP-40.Call of Duty 2 has far better graphics than the previous Call of Duty with the new IW 2.0 engine. The graphics are so much more detailed, the effects are great, looks advanced on its time while the performance remain great with no lags and frame rate issues or any issues.Call of Duty 2 is a great sequel from the previous game, with better engine makes better graphics and improved gameplay. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												With almost 200 hours (give or take) on the old 360, I wanted to get a taste of the old WWII theme of CoD. I bought this purely for the nostalgia, and to see if it still played as well as I remembered it. Turns out, it does. I'm prepared for all the flak of being a ""CoDfag"" and other completely original jeers, because this game makes it worth it.The game puts you in the boots of 3 different soldiers in a Russian, English, and American Campaign. Each with 4 missions comprised of 2 or 3 sub-missions. As I played this on the 360 way back when, I don't recall that kind of setup, and requiring to beat so many missions to unlock the next campaign threw me for a loop. However, I'm willing to look past that.Pros:-The combat, much as people hate it with its typical ""Run and gun"" nature, the combat was this game's biggest selling point back in the day; and remains to be to this day. Guns feel lifelike, the sounds accompany each shot perfectly, and the spray of red allowed the game to keep its ""T"" rating. Melee leaves a lot to be desired however, but you shouldn't ever resort to it anyways.-The soundtrack, which people often ignore as it's only truly present on the main and pause screens, as well as at the end of each mission. It may be subtle (unless you have the game at full volume) provides the slight ambience you'd expect from a gritty WWII FPS. The low hum of the deep brass and drums truly puts your heart in the action (not literally, that'd be weird.) -The difficulty. Remember when CoD games were hard? Yeah, you most likely don't, as apparently adding regenerating health apparently made the series ""Casually easy"". But oh no, not in its first appearence. This game, especially on Veteran, is regarded as one of the most difficult in the series (Besides CoD 1 and WaW, highly recommended). On Easy, you could take an MG42 for about 15 seconds before your screen turns red and informs you to duck behind the nearest dirt pile for all the ice bullets (my reasoning) to vanish and your wounds to heal. But on Hard and Veteran, expect A LOT of deaths, and even more rage. On Veteran, one bullet puts you at near-death, and the second is fatal. Don't expect an easy run with this game.-The story. WWII did in fact happen, I have a Veteran Neighbor to prove it. And to me, that adds a little something. No random Russia/Korean/Whoever-the-UN-Doesn't-like-currently attacks. It's you, against the Nazis, end of story. You may not like it, which is fine, but I enjoy that realism.Cons:-Game reasoning. You see that building full of enemies that needs clearing? You're not supposed to go in there until your buddy goes in first. And you'll die a few times before you notice that. Sometimes you're tasked with clearing a room or providing covering fire, other times not so. It's a bad case of Trial-and-Error gameplay. Like another game I won't mention...-Infinitely Respawning enemies. When I first played this, I remember sitting at a grove wall as an endless swarn of enemies rushed through for almost half an hour. Only to find hopping a single wall forced them to retreat. This game does this A LOT. Be prepared to rush virtually everything, because the game expects you to.-Technical Bugs. I remember manning an AA Cannon to gun down planes, only to get killed by the same grenade about ten times. I rage quit, start the game again, and complete it first try, sans grenades. The game will often glitch and force you to the next checkpoint without wiping all the current enemies, forcing a restart. -Forced gray-zones. If you've played this before, you know what I'm talking about. Moments, almost always involving tanks, in which you suddenly drop to the floor, your screen goes gray, and you think you died. But nope, you can get back up, take increased damage, and move at a snails' pace. I recall this game being something I'd play for hours on end. There's something awesome about storming the Normandy Beaches and moving around as artillary shells explode around you. This game was great fun back then, and it's even more fun now. If you're a nostalgic, this game is completely worth $20. If you're new and have grown up in the ""I hate on CoD because it's a meme"" group, I'd recommend waiting for this to go on sale.

												A timeless Classic. Used to play it a lot on LAN-Parties back in the days.The Multiplayer is still existant, which is even more wonderful. (Though i am a b0b)The biggest Con, in my opinion is the price of, even on sale, 19.99/9.99 for a Game of this Age.Whats wonderful about the MP part, you dont need to Level-Up, no Perks. Pick the Gun of your favour and go ahead.The SP Campaign starts with the Russian Offense toward Stalingrad, to the African Battlefields of the Desert Rats, to the Landing at Point-du-Hoc. You dont go to Berlin as in WaW though.Even if the Visuals are dated, in my opinion once again, you dont necessarily need shiny Graphics if the Game is programmed well and works. (Rarely had bugs, like scripted events not happening)			",174,12,2,20,39,2,98

												While old, cod2 still holds its top place in my library. Online community is alive, multiplayer servers are (sometimes) full and (always) fun to play, and, at least in Europe, we have online tournaments and lans still going on. Singleplayer campaign is great but not extremely long, so If you want to buy this game only for the story, i suggest you waiting for a discount. If you consider giving up your social life (equals to starting playing multiplayer), then it is worth its price here. Graphics are not breathtaking, but consider them great as for almost 10 years old game.Since 2008 I have spent over 500 hours playing and I am not planning on stopping anytime soon.

It is just awesome when u get a game u havent played for like 6-7 years and you started to play it again that i cant even describe it, you have to try the game its totally worth the 10 euros.Havent tried the multiplayer yet but i dont think it will be as fun as the campaign.

												Pros:There is no contrived plot. You’re just playing through epic battles from WWII.It’s still rated T. It’s not super dark, or gritty. You don’t have a bunch of ugly dudes getting angry and swearing a bunch, and trying to make you cringe by performing particularly inhumane acts.You get to play as the British and Russians, as well as Americans, and get to fight in different environments. Snowy bombed out Russian cities, vast African deserts, and French villages and countryside.Each mission stands on its own, so if you want to come back to this game for a quick battle or two, you can easily jump into whichever mission you want to. There are no long, unskippable cutscenes that make replay a chore.Cons:The characters are not memorable at all (expect Price, with his mustache, and MacGregor, with his Scottish accent), and those that do stick around are one-dimensional. There is no character development.But you’re not really here for a plot or story. You’re here to take part in epic WWII battles, and CoD2 does that spectacularly.			",117,17,0,7,11,0,32

This game is fantastic. One of the best FPS ever made, and maybe the best WWII FPSs.Call of Duty 2 has 28 levels, split into 3 arcs, each arc following a different character. The first following Private Vasili Koslov, a conscript in the red army, pushing the german army out of Russia. Arc 2 follows Sergeant John Davis, one of the Desert Rats, as well as Tank Commander David Welsh, fighting the german Afrika Korps in Egypt. The final arc follows Corporal Bill Taylor, a sharpshooter apart of the US Army Rangers. Pretty much every level is solid, designed with thought and care. Each level is beautiful, recapturing major battles throughout the second world war. They're all designed in a way that gives the player enough room to take cover, and have a good fight against the enemy.The games textures and models are a bit dated, with pipelines looking more hexagonal, and textures looking stretched a bit. The sound design is still excellent, especially the soundtrack for the game. The music is different for each arc, all done in an orchestral style fitting the era. Tchakovsky-esque tracks fitting the Winter War chapters, powerful fast strings and loud horns for the North African front, and songs befitting Medal of Honor and Saving Private Ryan for the battle in the German homeland.This game is truly a labor of love, from before Call of Duty became Activision's #1 cash cow. Infinity Ward did something amazing, almost comparable to early iD Software projects. It absolutely deserves a remaster, maybe even more so than Modern Warfare. With solid gunplay, lots of intense action, great level design, and an amazing soundtrack I absolutely recommend this to any FPS fan.			",163,7,1,7,4,3,3

Posted: June 27, 2016
												(I wrote this review after having played a few multiplayer matches and completing the entirety of the campaign on the Veteran difficulty.)Wow.This was... really good. In fact, even considering the phenomenal Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, I think this is my favorite Call of Duty game in the series.First, let's talk about the campaign. This campaign did so many things right.There is a training level where in the bottom half you're defending yourself against living German opposition. No better training than actually going into battle, eh?The environments are big and beautiful, and they're very well designed from a gameplay standpoint. There were a lot of good places to move from cover to cover.I had a blast playing through each campaign. The Russian campaign was fun and brutal, tanking through Africa in the English campaign was a blast (if IW had done vehicle things in multiplayer, they probably would be giving DICE more trouble today, tank gameplay was fun and smooth), and storming through Europe and crossing the Rhine in the American campaign made me feel satisfied and patriotic. I think the best part of the campaign was that it was completely gameplay-centric. Nothing was story-driven, and there was no filler. As much as I enjoyed Call of Duty 4's story and missions, in Call of Duty 2, every level was filled with fast, intense action and I was fighting through to the end. It felt more like the classic FPS games that were also gameplay-centric and it's really what I prefer.If you are going into this on Veteran difficulty, be prepared to practice moving cover and killing quickly and accurately. The grenade spam is real. In terms of entertainment value and legitimate challenge, this is probably the best Call of Duty game to play on Veteran. Multiplayer is also really fun. There's a reason why this is one of the best and most famous currently active WWII multiplayer FPS. The few servers that operate are filled with elite clans, and most servers are modded where you can choose any weapon (and some weapons are added). The pure gunplay is a blast. With actual recoil and no perks, you really have to earn every kill that you get. The maps are also all very beautiful and fun to play through. I really can't wait until I'm able to play this with a friend or two, it's sure to be a good time!Plus, the game has little things that make me smile, things that have been missing since MW2.The field of view is 80 degrees by default, and I can change it to 90 in the campaign through console commands.Though there's no intel cheats, I can use the console for all the campaign fun I want.Multiplayer has a server browser and dedicated servers.The game is balanced for lean.Servers can have way more than 18 players if they want to. I once saw a 64-player server.The characters in the campaign have personality and throw wisecracks at the enemy at times, like ""Hey Fritz, your sister said to say hi!""Overall, all things considered, this is probably the best Call of Duty game in the series. If you're a kid fresh out of Black Ops III, someone who grew up with Modern Warfare 2, or have been with the series since the beginning and somehow missed out on this, I HIGHLY recommend you trying this. You won't regret one bit of it. Unless of course, you play Veteran and end up getting frustrated out of your mind.			",59,0,18,0,5,0,2

												By far the best Call of Duty. I still play the campaign every couple years and think how COD could have gone if they the third wasn't a catasropthic failure and they didn't steer for the realistic feel of COD2. Even after all these years if you haven't played it, its worth it. Even more so if you hate the COD series these days and never played the old ones cause you might suprised.			",333,31,7,36,22,0,47

												Really love the first two COD -games. If you missed out on this one back in the day I totally recommend buying it, at least when on sale.There is this weird thing when comparing the old COD A.I. and the one in newer games. The old A.I. makes you really feel as a part of the military group: your brothers in arms really shoot ""at the enemy"" and advance. In the newer COD A.I. it's player versus the whole opposing military force where your fellow soldiers are like puppets that can't do anything.			",176,46,3,29,27,0,29

												Call of Duty 2 is a First Person Shooter set in World War 2 and like its predecessor features three campaigns that follow Russia, United Kingdom and the United States in their fights to push back the German menace. The first campaign has you fighting in the snow covered outskirts of Moscow and one of the most noticeable things right of the bat is a pretty significant graphical overhaul compared to the first game. It is not very impressive in this day and age but it has not aged badly at all. Much has also been revamped under the hood like friendly AI that is actually useful this time around and will occasionally shout out the enemies’ location in real time. It sounds like an insignificant thing but when your squad is being mowed down by enemy fire and you have no idea where it's coming from, having an ally yell out his location can be the difference between life or death as well as being very immersive to boot. The revamped AI in this sequel really help give it a more dynamic and intense feel as enemies are now much more adapt at hiding behind their environments while also being more capable of flushing you out of cover, forcing you to move around the environment instead of playing a deadly game of whack a mole with your enemies.    Enemies will use their grenades far more liberally making it vital to keep your ears open to that ping of a grenade being dropped on the battlefield so you don't get near it. Once you get close enough to a grenade there is an onscreen icon alerting you of the threat but if you are moving around the area and come across one, chances are that there is very little time left until it detonates making it a rather solid compromise between player approachability and punishing your carelessness. A new addition to your arsenal are smoke grenades which are invaluable when cornered by overwhelming firepower and must run across gunfire towards a better vantage point. There are times when you must run towards a tank with nothing but satchel charges to destroy it and it is pretty awesome to run out of the smoke, plant an explosive on it and then disappear back into the thick smoke. This works both ways however, the Nazis just as easily can throw a smoke grenade onto an open plain and rush your company. It is a really cool addition that helps to further encourage you to stay on the move rather than to stay behind a good hiding spot for the duration of the fight.   Call of Duty 2 is a more difficult game than its predecessor and will test your mettle with very one sided situations, especially when the Nazis are near defeat and fighting with tooth and nail in an attempt to turn the tides towards their favor. On some occasions you will be surrounded on all sides and have to hold out for a set amount of time which leads to some really intense, chaotic battles in where you must be very alert, least you get flanked by enemies or shot from behind. It often leads being overwhelmed and constantly having to move from location to location to avoid being pinned down while having your allies location in mind so you don't end up shooting them in the heat of battle. These events were both my favorite and least favorite part of the games as your goal goes from trying to defeat the enemy to simply trying to survive an extremely bad situation while what little allies you have left are dying before your eyes and you very well could be next. As cool as these sections of the campaign are they do feel too common place to the point of feeling like they are just there to pad out the game with an arbitrary time limit until you can proceed with the story. Speaking of the story you will not be fighting in iconic previously covered battles such as Berlin instead it focuses on the more “minor” battlefields and events of WW2.  Both the American and the Russian campaign take a far less major roll than the previous game. This time around it is the British campaign that shines in stark contrast to their pretty lackluster journeys in the original Call of Duty. The British campaign are mostly centered on their struggles in Africa and is a location very rarely explored in video games. It creates some interesting situations whenever you must get in a tank that show off the German's superior tanks that have much better range and armor forcing you to withstand their shells until you are in range to fire back. Kicking up dust and smoke clouds when you destroy an enemy will disrupt your line of sight as well. While it is a rather short sequence it helped to break up the monotony of shooting Nazis in the face and was the only time you can control a vehicle. Your missions will have you following a handlebar mustached Captain called Price across many fronts but there is no real character development or personal story, it's all about the journey towards winning the war.  Russians have the first and shortest campaign that is not all that interesting. Americans on the other hand are getting hammered by their daring offensive strikes and their first mission is the Normandy landing which is probably the most brutal level in the entire game. The American campaign is short as well though it does have a lot of memorable moments such as invading a small town and having to fall back multiple times as the Germans proved far more fearsome than anticipated. The final mission of the game is also from the American side though it was a pretty disappointing ending to a series of intense missions. One of the most disappointing changes to this sequel was that health packs are now gone and in its stead we have regenerating health. It really takes any fear out of getting shot since you can now get shot until near death and hide for a few seconds to be good as new. It is a far cry from taking a lucky shot on the battlefields of the original and hoping you can crawl your way through the warzone in hopes of finding a health-pack to treat your wounds. In this game getting shot means nothing and you can simply shrug it off as long as you don't take too much damage making it feel a lot less dangerous and making carefully fighting your foes a thing of the past.  Unfortunately I have not been able to stop the game from crashing while trying to access the multiplayer portion of it so I do not know if there is still an active community nor can I properly review it. Another oddity is that unlike the original there is no more manual or quick saving in this and instead relies on a checkpoint system. It's not a problem since checkpoints are frequent though it is a rather weird design decision. All in all even though this sequel loses a few of the things that made the original great I would still consider it on par or better then it's predecessor. While it is true we no longer have to fear a bit of damage it also forces you to move around the area with the addition of smarter AI and grenades can easily kill you if you are caught in a bad place. It is a case of fast paced, guns blazing action versus “realistic” slow combat where the danger comes from taking unnecessary risks. Neither is objectively better than the other though this tweak to the gameplay may be something that deters fans of the original. If that is something you are fine with or don't care about this is definitely a great sequel that expands on many key things like having larger levels, better graphics and more satisfying enemies to face as well as many small tweaks that makes it an overall better experience.

												The gud old days when cod was a ww2 game had no suply drops or exo jumps. No horribly balanced weapons. This is a nice classic i totaly recomend it! And if you are having a problem with multi (black screen) you just have to wait some time but i dont mean 1 min meaby even more like 10 or 20 mins. I dont think it can be fixed that it goes instantly so just watch a vid on youre phone.			",79,5,0,6,2,0,8

												Call of Duty 2 is a major step up from its predecessor in practically every way. With improved graphics, mechanics, and epic missions, COD2 is a must have for any WW2 history nut or shooter fan. Where Call of Duty 1 borrows heavily from ""Band of Brothers,"" Call of Duty 2 seems to borrow elements from both ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" The standout American campaign towards the end of the game is easily the best part and worth the effort to be able to play. Unlike COD1, COD2 finally puts you on the frontline during D-Day (albeit, one of the lesser known and smaller scale battles at Point Du Hoc), where you scale the cliffs of Normandy and face off against the defending Nazis. Not only that, but you then have to secure the nearby village, fight off attackers until you are eventually pushed back and forced to defend with limited ammunition and man power in one of the more epic missions I've seen in a COD game. But the other campaigns aren't too bad either. The game starts off with the Russian campaign a few weeks after the events of the first game in Stalingrad during the harsh winter months. You are tasked with pushing through Nazi forces to the town hall in an effort to push the Germans out of Stalingrad. In addition to this, there's also a signfiicantly improved british campaign with some really enjoyable missions that take place in the Africa theatre of war, which is already very rare to see in a WW2 game. There's a few missions that still task you with moving with a small unit and getting into stupid car chases, but they're not nearly as long or as ridiculous as before. So to summarize, COD2's campaign is fantastic and offers plenty of large scale battles and a few memorable (but not necessarily that significant) characters like Captain price and Seargent Randall.    Another major improvement in this entry into the series is the graphics. They have significantly improved and surprisingly hold up rather well today despite this game being an Xbox360 launch title. Textures on friendly soldiers pop out and their wet uniforms look muddy, heavy, and dirty giving a real authentic feel to the game. The smoke introduced in COD1's expansion back are reintroduced here in the form of smoke grenades which not only look good but are a core mechanic to the game. Lighting is fantastic, character animations are improved (albeit a little dated to todays standards especially considering there is no rag doll physics at all), and overall presentation is very well done.    The mechanics have recieved some major imrpovements. This is the first call of duty in the series to feature regenerative health, and one of the first shooter games in the market to introduce the concept as well. Instead of searching frantically for random health packs, you simply need to rest behind cover without getting shot in order to recieve full health, allowing you to get back into the action without any significant interruptions. This feature may seem like it makes the game easier, but the difficulty of the enemies has been increased dramatically. One issue that I found pretty frustrating as I played is that enemy soldiers will now throw grenades at you almost all the time, and they are generally really good at throwing them right at your feet, even if your upstairs in a window shooting down at them. Not only that, but your own grenades are pretty much useless in the game because 75% of the time, the enemies will pick up your grenade and throw it right back, sometimes resulting in an instant death.    The same problems with enemy AI still exist from the first game into this one. Whenever you peak out from cover to engage the enemy, every single soldier in your line of sight will immedietly drop what they're doing and aim directly at you with insane accuracy, almost always dropping your health down and forcing you to sit back down. Enemies also seem to be bullet sponges, taking several shots just to get them to drop their gun. And then they still sit back up with their pistol that has even more damage somehow until you finish them off. The game also tasks you with infiltrating buildings filled with germans and expects you to kill all of them by yourself while the 5 guys you stacked up on the door with are just waiting downstairs. If an enemy drops a grenade or starts rushing you, its possible to get stuck in the doorway because friendly AI act as barriers, keeping you from retreating or moving into doorways which can really get annoying. Also, for some reason the sprint feature introduced in the last expansion was removed, forcing the player to ""walk"" to the fights while your friendly units can sprint all over the place. Not sure why this design choice was made, but thankfully it doesn't seem to impact the game that much.    So aside from all those complaints, the game improves in several other areas in terms of mechanics. Smoke grenades are now a major gameplay component that allow you to conceal your squads movements as you cross ""no mans land"" in an attempt to flank enemy gunners. You are now given access to binoculars that you can use to scout ahead so you can try and figure out what exactly is shooting at you. And like I said before, the regenerative health is a major improvement that really makes the game move at a faster and more enjoyable pace. This game also features a multiplayer component but I didn't bother with it. I was more interested in the lengthy single player campaign. In conclusion, Call of Duty 2 remains one of my all time favorites because of its incredibly tense missions, great graphics, and fun gameplay. I highly recommend this game, if you haven't played it, you are missing out.			",213,12,5,6,9,1,2

												This is up there with World at War as one of my favorite CoD games. It mixed simplicity with fun gameplay and did it well. The guns felt and sounded nice, and the levels felt great and were fun to play. And I'll always remember some of the best NPC banter from any CoD. ""I'll see you Jerry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Hell or Berlin, whichever I get to first! - British NPC""Pros +(Singleplayer)+ Great Campaign with quite a few levels.+ Play as the British, Americans or Russians.+ Nice selection of weapons.+ The NPC banter is funny and gets you in the mood to shoot Nazis.+ Good atmosphere with things like, propaganda in the background, the banter, the level design.(Multiplayer)+ Even playing field (no Create-a-Class, just set classes with set guns, and no ranks) (This is subjective)+ Multitude of Servers to choose from (This game is far from dead with a dedicated community)+ Only $20 ($15 to $10 if there is a Steam sale)+ The game came out in 2005, so it should run 60 fps no problem.Cons -(Singleplayer)- Some weapons are extreamly rare (PPS-42 & Webly are only in one level and have little ammo) or are multiplayer exclusive (M3 Greese Gun and the Trench Shotgun)(Multiplayer)- It might be hard to find a sever that has ""standard"" gamplay with good ping. (By ""standard"" I mean severs that AREN'T crouch only or have a special ruleset)If you enjoy other WWII shooters and you don't mind that it's a Call of Duty title, pick this up now or wait for a sale!EDIT: Spelling corrections.

												This is the pinnacle of WWII gaming--from an arcade FPS perspective. The game is as difficult as you make it. For best experience I prefer regular difficulty. I've grinded all of the CoD games on Veteran and this one especially becomes a slog in some of the missions on the harder levels on veteran. It's the most cinematic on a lower difficulty as well, and you will still die plenty.The shooting feels good except for PPsH in the Russian levels which feels underpowered from a sound, recoil, damage perspective. Also, the enemies can be slightly bullet-spongey even when using high-caliber weapons. However, you aren't playing this for the realism so it can be forgiven.If you only are going to play a single CoD I would choose this. Holds up better than Cod 1 and is less frustrating (also alcks a narrative) and has more character and depth than many of the modern warfare games, including non-linear maps.Overall, strongly recommend.

 Call of Duty 2 Review Call of Duty 2 does everything a sequel should do. It ups the ante, give us more missions, more action and more locales to fight in. It let us expeience the war on three fronts. The Americans, the Russians, and the British. All of them have pretty diverse locales. But what makes this really awesome is that the battles you take part in are often on events or war fronts that are not often covered in videogames or even movies. On the technical side of things, Call of Duty 2 has great graphics. Runs mostly well with the occasional stuttering when something loads or saves. It's graphics still hold up pretty well. It ran on my Windows 10 computer and with a couple of ini edits I was able to play it at 1080p while using Nvidia Inspector to spruce up the graphics a bit. Do make use of it's PC Gaming Wiki page, because it helps you bring a host of improvements to the game. On that matter, you should look at ever game's PC Gaming Wiki page since it's a wonderful tool. The level design is great, giving you multiple oppurtunites to flank your enemy and use other means to get the better hand. Also let's you tackle multiple objectives with your choice of how to complete them. Definetly less linear than even World at War. On the artistic side of things Call of Duty 2’s authenticity comes through not only in the voice over performance, but with the music that harkens back to Saving Private Ryan’s score. However the authenticity stroke a real chord with one of the last missions in the Call of Duty 2 campaign. The Battle of Hill 400. I played through the battle which was a multi-part affair that lasted a good 30-40 minutes. I died quite a few times, but it was intense and moving. However, I was blown away that it was a battle that actually happened for real life. I know most of the missions in Call of Duty games are based on true events and battles, but this one blew me away. Knowing that this was something that took place, sure gave me the chills. Trying to imagine if I could even pass the level without getting shot is nearly impossible. So in the end I must say that Call of Duty 2 just like it’s predecessor has an air of authenticity that is just simply missing from modern Call of Duty games.Call of Duty 2 is a game that is not easily forgotten. Whether it be the anti-war quotes that pop up after you die, the missions that are based on real life affairs, the score that is quite great, or the comradery amongst your squad. All of this together make Call of Duty 2 one of the greatest World War II shooters ever made. A game that in a way still feels ahead of it’s time. You can’t go wrong buying the game on sale, even it’s just for the campaign.  Ran on my WIndows 10 Computer with a couple of ini edits, be sure to consult the PC Gaming Wiki page Only FPS Drops occured when the game stuttered to load or save. I tried to get rid of this, but to no avail.  Played for about 10 hours, on Hardened diffidculty which I would higly recommend. I must warn you, it is quite a bit       tougher than the average Call of Duty at least in my opinion.   ",555,84,35,64,16,3,34

												My second favourite Call of Duty game. This gem was a huge leap from CoD1 / UO and breathed a lot more into the series in helping create a cinematic World War 2 experience. Theres mayhem, shooting, fast paced action and the weapons are a lot better than they were back in the first two titles. The Multiplayer is a significant improvement and even though it's been toppled by Call of Duty 4's MP, it still lives up to today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Slightly better than the original due to smoother gameplay, a D-Day mission, more advanced multiplayer and slightly better graphics. Not to mention more interesting speech from your allies, ""Hey Fritz, I'll see you in hell -or Berlin, whichever I get to first""""Hey Fritz, your sister said to say hi"" -German cries behind the sandbags.Don't forget the classic Russian encouragement, ""Shoot those fascists!!!""""Comissar, why are we throwing potatoes, and not real grenades?""... ""Because real genades are valuable private, worth much more than you anyway""Great game, but sometimes fails to launch on my laptop for the first few tries. So if you're intending to play this on a laptop more than 3 years old, you should still buy this but be prepared for a little bit of rage at your hardware.No cows were harmed in the making of this game.

												One of the most famous WW2 PFS's still plays well on the single player campaign - Well, SP lasted only 8 hrs and was pretty easy on the regular level, but there were battles to rememeber, especially by the end of the campaign enemy bullets seem to have a greater impact. Multiplayer is somewhat problematic - existing populated servers (4 of them are almost full at any given time) are full with age old players that get you killed within a few seconds, so this is far from being fun. Other are populated with bots. I recommend find a half full server- it's easier to get into the game this way.Later CODs multiplayer are better to my taste, but it's OK to try...The downside to this game - many crashes concerning compability. I ran the solutions but still the game crashes on startup or between MP maps.Worth buying in a 5$ deal.			",325,36,29,34,38,4,80

												The story in this game is basicly world war two as seen in saving private Ryan. The interesting part is the Russian campaign where the brutality of the Eastern Front is on display which as a histroy buff i like. In a time of sci fi and modern shooters a return to the past might be very refreshing so in that regard i can recommand the game. The gameplay is standard cod whith a short but good campaign.

												Overall continues on with the CoD franchise.... or the first ever CoD.This time draws in more historical aspects to the game itself- Russian, American and British Campaigns which all individually focus year-by-year as it were. More concise, varied and detailed than to its predecessor, allowing for 1920x1080 display (which wasn't available in the original) and high-graphics (more detailed than previous). However, being a 'port' from old-PC to New PC. It does offer some problems with startup, setting settings and/or crashing on initial startup and when setting settings. You may also experience problems with a black-screen on initial startup, simply close the .exe via task manager- then start again. The game should work- no problems whatsoever. Just make sure to set your ideal settings in the first instance- this may take a few attempts.Other than that, it's a playable, enjoyable, challenging and exciting game- which hones into the classic CoD/MoH styling of games- which offers a solid few hours of gameplay (estimation roughly 10-20'odd). I like it, and so should you.... if that's your thing!			",42,2,2,0,15,0,1

 Call of Duty 2     ""The game is set during World War II and the campaign mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, with a total of twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many features were added and changed from the original Call of Duty. The most notable change is the regenerating health. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode.""- Activision    After some good time playing the story on veteran, I have come to really appreciate the true flow of combat mechanic where a good player cannot run out into fire by him/herself. Getting mowed down by the Germans in a train station for 30 minutes may sounds frustrating yet, I implore you that it is for that one reason that this game has drawn me into the way of its special game mechanics. The visuals are not the greatest yet, for the sheer number of hours that I spent on this game without realizing it made me feel like a kid again. I recommend this game whenever it goes on sale for a nice collectors game in your library to add to a nice shooter library.Originally posted by author: Worth the buy  ",144,19,1,2,11,0,3

												This, in my opinion, is the best Call of Duty of them all! The voice acting is brilliant, the game looks great and it is well optimized, and the AI is ridiculously challenging on the hardest difficulty. The historical accuracy and story presentation of the protagonists is also second to none from what I see nowadays!Highly recommended, especially if you played the first Call of Duty!

BEST COD GAME EVERAll went downhill from here. This was the best online competitive FPS. I spent over 1500 hours (xfire ftw) on COD2 multiplayer a good 8 years ago. Still feels like a current title and the basic gameplay is what makes it awesome. Make sure you get the relevant patch (i think its 1.3?) for the best multiplayer experience.

												Infinity Wards best WWII era Call Of Duty. The first missions featuring the Russians and the missions with the English in Tunisia I wasn't gripped by but the later US and English missions set in Normandy are fantastic with massive open villages with multiple objectives which can be taken in any order.Visuals are a massive step up from the original game and they hold up pretty well today. Easily recommended.			",287,38,7,10,9,2,16

												One of the pave makers for the CoD franchise and still an FPS classic, Call of Duty 2 is a classic World War 2 FPS. It brings the war experience to a more personal level as you're on the front lines fighting the Nazi Army. The graphics are decent (by today's standards) and the mechanics are really good. The ""Carry 2 Primary Weapons"" mechanic may or may not be in this version as I roughly remember having trouble replacing my side arm for an enemy SMG. If you have trouble exchaning weapons on the field it shouldn't be a deterrent because it's still an enjoyable game. Pick it up when it's on the cheap.			",158,4,1,7,13,0,9

												This Review is coming from the perspective of the mainstream gaming industry's lack of attention on World War 2 based shooters right now; funny enough I hope one day this review will be irrelevant as odd as that might sound, hopefully because of a resurgence.Now I don't got much to say on the game's mechanics so to speak due to that information being already out on the internet (And there are people who could explain it better then I could) but no more of that. World War 2 has always from the beginning been seen as changing warfare in a way never thought possible, so it's not that big of a surprise that it was a very popular setting in video games; but now the balance of era based shooters has been anything but in the spectrum of the modern gaming industry.This can be shown with the recent success of Wolfenstein: The New Order, A game that further expands on the conflict fought between Allies and Axis powers of World War 2, it shows that the fundamentals of WWII can be brought in from a new and original perspective to create a game that's frame is of that time but also feeling fresh; it has been said that you can make any story interesting based on your execution thereof. It shows people have been craving this new perspective in there shootersI know this is not much of a review of Call of Duty 2 but if I can say anything about it is a very well done alternative to AAA modern military shooters.PS; oh yeah and the $20 price tag for Call of Duty 2 on steam is just ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ even for the quality on offer here, Ok OK soap box over.

This game features an awesome singleplayer campaign in which players will fight in snow, the desert, D-Day, and citys.  As for the multiplayer this games got no multiplayer communtiy what so ever.  This game is still pretty good and gets 8.7 out of 10 stars in my oppinon.(just a note, I will soon be writing a review for Ace of Spades)			",65,3,1,2,10,1,4

Multiplayer here is highly moddable, although the number of players has probably shrunk. There may be many WWII shooters, but Call of Duty 2 is probably the best one made by Infinity Ward.

												I bought COD 2 back on the Xbox 360's launch day, and sunk countless hours into the campaign and multiplayer modes. The campaign features a diverse set of locals ranging the African, Eastern, and Western Fronts, and still remains fun to this day. Multiplayer is fair, with a multitude of quality maps. The servers for COD 2 are dead on consoles, so it is nice to see a small but active community thriving on steam. Definitely worth a purchase and its the best COD in the series.			",17,3,0,1,1,0,5

												Hello fellow COD lovers, here is my review Call of Duty 2.One of the first COD games intitled Call of Duty brought WWII FPS games back into the world. This game features an awesome singleplayer campaign in which players will fight in snow, the desert, D-Day, and citys.  As for the multiplayer this games got no multiplayer communtiy what so ever.  This game is still pretty good and gets 8.7 out of 10 stars in my oppinon.(just a note, I will soon be writing a review for Ace of Spades)			",65,3,1,2,10,1,4

												Fast-forward two-and-a-half years where neat fancy light tricks start coming into play. Regenerating health and a more streamlined approach to storytelling in the same-old World War 2. While not great, the gunplay in CoD2 provides for a massively interesting challenge. Rifles did a LOT of damage and the gameplay was designed to penalize sprinting around too much without turning the entire game into nothing but prone shooters inching along at a snail's pace.It isn't bad, and it has aged better than it's predecessor. Give it a try if you'd like to see just how far the series has come.			",653,134,32,120,86,3,104

												Call of Duty 2 is the biggest shape-up to happen to the series, gameplay wise. The way that the battlefield was operated in was overhauled from the first Call of Duty, Finest Hour and United Offensive.The most obvious overhaul in gameplay is the addition of regenerating health. This arguably makes you feel like a super-soldier, going against the theme of the first game in which you were a single average soldier. However, unlike its sequels, the scale of the battles means that normally this is not the case. Another large change is the largest engine overhaul in the history of the series (at least until Advanced Warfare). This was the first game to make use of the IW Engine, which performs far better than the original games, looks much better and allows for far better quality textures, models and animations. The game looks significantly better than the original, has higher quality sound and much better animations than the original. Just like the original game, the game features support for high framerates, and unlike the original, native high resolution support for modern monitors is also supported.Campaign-wise, the game is great. It’s longer than the original Call of Duty, and longer than any of its sequels. The campaign, just like the original, features Russian, British and American soldiers. The Russian campaign is brilliantly done, with a mix of large open fields with little cover, narrow alleys and trenches, and a sniper mission in a surrounded building. The British campaign also combines trench warfare with large open dust plains for tank commanding, tight alleyways for urban combat and hold objectives in France and against the Afrika Korps. The American campaign contains the games landmark moment, the D-Day landing and Hill 400, which is brilliantly done, while containing more large battles. Call of Duty 2 features a campaign that can stand o its own, without multiplayer, just as the first and United Offensive did.The multiplayer is still populated by some players. The maps range from new to re-mastered versions of the best from Call of Duty, Finest Hour and United Offensive. Unfortunately, the vehicle combat from United Offensive does not make a return in the multiplayer, which is somewhat disappointing, as the game appears to disregard much of what United Offensive added, such as the ability to sprint.This leads into my main problem with the game. It doesn't take on board the new features added in United Offensive, instead only building on the original Call of Duty. Although the game is still solid, if it had taken on board these features from the expansion pack, it could easily be the best of the series, and possibly one of the greatest first person shooters ever made. Despite this, the game stands up much better than its sequels as a brilliant first person shooter, a highlight of the series, and a sign of what this series once was before it was slaughtered unjustly by Activision and its need to milk a franchise for it was worth. Instead of buying next year’s new Call of Duty, why not buy the Warchest and treat yourself to three epic World War II shooters that show what the franchise is truly about, and how these games should truly be done.

												Call of Duty 2 is one of the finest and most cinematic World War II first person shooters out there. It is probably one of the best games to play if you want a cinematic experience out of a WWII shooter. I originally played this on Xbox 360 several times so there may be a form of biasness so be warned.The game features the same three campaigns playing as three soldiers from the Russian, British and American armies and a British Tank Commander as well. Each campaign offers a good amount in variety in locale as the majority of each campaign is set in a different nation. The Russian campaign was by far the best as it had a good balance between making you immersed in the game as well as having a great amount of variety in gameplay objectives. The American and British campaigns are still pretty fun and the American campaign in particular has the best starting level on the beach landings of Normandy. There is actually a small form of humor in a cheesy way which I like compared to the more modern games which try to be outgoing but coming accross as more awkward. Russians have their dark humor, British with their dry wit and the Americans with their more silly banntering makes the game feel more at home with an old war movie.Visually it still holds up for the most part. Nothing looks terrible but nothing looks great either. It gets the job done. Combat is fun giving you a nice variety of WWII weaponry. One problem I had was that out of maybe the 6-8 weapons each nation has, only 3 of them are properly given to you so if you want to play with the more interesting guns you're gonna have to wait for one of the AI soldiers to die and hope you have enough ammo for it. The health bar has been removed with regenerating health which I'm a little mixed on. I don't mind either but I think I probably lean towards health bars as personal preference goes. Music is nice but since there is much more action happening at the one time it's either more absent or you're not going to hear it as much. One thing I didn't like is the checkpoint system. Manual saving is always going to be superior no matter what. I don't like replaying 5-10 minute sections all over again because I did one thing wrong. Still this game usually does it in a more tolerable fashion so it's not as bad. I was unfortunately unable to play the multiplayer which was again like the last two Call of Duty games a little dissapointing if understandable.  Call of Duty 2 is probably the pinacle of WWII shooters. It was also the Call of Duty title I believe that got its full identity and the franchise having its own personality rather than being inspired with the Medal of Honor series. This is one of the most cinematic WWII games you can find (maybe Call of Duty 3 but I haven't played it for a long time so I might have to check that out again). It has good variety in missions, gameplay and locations. I give it an 8/10.			",199,62,1,29,20,1,29

												Its a pretty damn good gameIts my favorite Call of Duty of all time right in front of BO1.Now I've pretty much lost all hope in COD after spending what 170 dollars on ghosts and 90 on BO3 absolutly hating both (I never bought AW, and im not too excited for IW I'm pretty much done with COD, the only reason I bought BO3 was for zombies with my friends and even then the maps suck d*ck.Now to the real review, the game is amazing, It looks amazing for such an old game especially if you crank up them graphics. The sound effects are good and clean and are actually original unlike how ALL germans in EVERY Call of Duty use the EXACT same voice sound effects for German enemies.The game is set in a certain and very fun way (To me that is) where there is no set story but plays through different missions that actually took place in real life during ww2 which actually makes the game much more diverse since they dont get held back by ""This doesnt add up to the story at all"" Now you dont have to do an entire campaign you just have to play the first couple missions of the next ""mini campaign"" then you can either continue or pause that faction to start the next, and return to it later.The first set of missions, you play as a Russian soldier Vasili (forgot his last name), through Stalingrad with your legendary PP and rifle, you start out as a soldier in training as you get attacked by germans and must move on. to take over stalingrad as you run out of ammo and supplies.The second set of missions you play as the British. You play as a British soldier, Sergeant John Davis of the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa, led by Captain Price. which is in my opinion the best even though ALL of the ""Mini Campaigns"" had their moments especially the American battles which were crazyYES the ORIGINAL Captain Price was from this game not modern warfare like people think.The British campaign was amazing due to how beautiful the maps were and especially when you had to defend the town from the hundreds of germans in the counter attack where they rush you over the hill, you also get tank battles in Libya with the british. (Funny side comment I wrote an essay on the ONE, THE ONLY, PVT. ♥♥♥♥ING MACGREGOR and I got a 100% even though my overall grade was like a ♥♥♥♥ing C- in historyThe third campaign was obviously the Americans!You get to play as Corporal Bill Taylor of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, you get to play through the Battle of point Du Hoc (A battle where the Allies had to scale a massive cliff to destroy Nazi artillery and advance into Normandy. This campaign brings chills to my spine every time I play it due to how grousome but utterly amazing the Allies fought against the ♥♥♥♥ing Nazis, which I feel WAW failed at dilivering with their sub par and slightly boring (In my opinion) Japanese campaign missions.This game is super amazing and the multiplayer is EXTREMELY fun especially with how many memories Ive had with friends coming over and playing against each other even though they usually rage quit because I was, and still am a loser who is way to good at this sh*t compared to an average player. I remember having my less raging good friend Jack come over and he wouldnt know about sensitivity in the settings so I'd spin around him in circles and he couldnt turn fast enough to see me (God I was an a**hole). I never did get a good understanding of the online multiplayer because I was so young and never had xbox live so I could only play against 1 or 2 other friends at once in offline. Activision does pay their respects to the fallen and survivors of world war 2 and really if you havnt already go back and play this game its worth every penny. I wouldnt recommend buying ANY Call of Duty on steam since they are ATROCIOUSLY overpriced, now not that its not worth it but if you want to save some cash you can probably find a cd key or even a disk on amazon or ebay (And just use the cd key from that and get rid of the disk) for under 10 bucks.Other than that I guess this is the end.

												I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first-person shooters or WWII games in general. This is the best Call of Duty games in the series and probably the best WWII shooter ever released. The controls are simple and straightforward. What really makes the campaign great is its diversity. You go from playing a Russian soldier at Stalingrad to a British soldier in North Africa to an American soldier in Europe. Yes, there is less ""story,"" but the point of combat games should be to survive and meet objectives in a particular battle or skirmish, and with this approach you get a rich array of settings, weapons and even vehicles in some battles.I especially like how the game does fair treatment to the Eastern Front. Stalingrad was really the turning point for the defeat of Hitler, and the scale and casualties of the Eastern Front far exceed the Western Front, although US and British culture tend to focus on it more. Infinity Ward managed to avoid the ugly stereotypes of Company of Heroes 3 as well as stealing from the ""Enemy at the Gates"" movie.			",25,4,0,11,10,0,16

This is the best Call of Duty games in the series and probably the best WWII shooter ever released. The controls are simple and straightforward. What really makes the campaign great is its diversity. You go from playing a Russian soldier at Stalingrad to a British soldier in North Africa to an American soldier in Europe. Yes, there is less ""story,"" but the point of combat games should be to survive and meet objectives in a particular battle or skirmish, and with this approach you get a rich array of settings, weapons and even vehicles in some battles.I especially like how the game does fair treatment to the Eastern Front. Stalingrad was really the turning point for the defeat of Hitler, and the scale and casualties of the Eastern Front far exceed the Western Front, although US and British culture tend to focus on it more. Infinity Ward managed to avoid the ugly stereotypes of Company of Heroes 3 as well as stealing from the ""Enemy at the Gates"" movie.			",25,4,0,11,10,0,16

												This game, among others, has defined my childhood. I remember buying the Xbox 360 on Christmas 2006 and getting this game, Gears of War, and Ghost Recon. The best part of my gaming years (so far).However, I DEFINATELY wouldm't spend $20 on this game. If you're gonna get it, get the warchest whenever it's on sale. It comes with CoD 1, its expansion pack United Offensive, and of course CoD 2. Anyway, game is simple.Get gun.Follow instructionShoot germans.Basically, this game was where most of CoD's traditional design originated from. It still looks great ~10 years later, and hasn't aged terribly, unlike other games. Don't worry about compatibility as CoD 2 still runs like butter (by that I mean ~60fps on my HP stream 7 with 1gb ram and an Atom processor)			",113,3,3,6,3,1,5

												Fighting amongst the ruins of Stalingrad...Firing Heavy guns under the desert heat of Tubruck...Being dragged out of a landing craft on D-Day....The best Call of Duty by far, if they would remake the original Call of Duty (yes there was COD's before Modern Warefare) then it would be utterly amazing. The only COD based activity I prefer over this is the expansion pack for COD1 (United Offensive). Graphically this game is good despite its age, the voice acting is brilliant and the mission content and action is far from dull. The only problem I have with this game is the Russian missions as the begining of the game tend to get slightly boring (from a biased ""I love playing as the British"" kind of way). There is still A LOT of people who play multiplayer on this game too and the MOD's and DLC for multi is top socks too! 9/10			",62,33,0,7,6,2,14

												The Good: Great production values, graphics look great, uses lesser told stories during the warThe Bad: Typical multiplayer, not very cinematic, objectives are repetitive and boring, highly linear, no gore, nothing new at allAll those World War II shooters we endured for an entire decade felt like a war on its own. Shooter after endless shooter bombarded our systems, and then there were the really bad ones in between the Call of Duty and Medal of Honor yearly releases. Call of Duty 2 was highly anticipated because it was the actual sequel to the award winning original. Does it stand out like the first game did? Is it full of cinematic finesse and finely nuanced mechanics? Not really.There’s not much of a story here because it’s based off WWII. Black and white footage with a dull narrator telling you about different theaters of the war, then there’s the typical journal entry during the load screen, nothing interesting at all, and even when the game came out I was sick of these WWII shooters. What does Call of Duty 2 build on? Nothing, it’s just more of the same, but at least it has high production values and it does the same stuff right. The game has you following three different soldiers from the Russian, British, and American side. One thing I did like was that you get to play a different side of the Normandy beach storming and that’s the Rangers. They climbed up the cliff side trying to shut down the German pill boxes and various artillery so our troops stopped getting slaughtered on the beachhead. Call of Duty 2 tries to tell the smaller stories in the war which is a nice change of pace.The same weapons are here that you have shot a million times. Lee Enfield, M1 Garand, Mp40, MP44, Sten, and various others. Of course not ALL WWII weapons are here, but I wanted to see some of the more obscure ones like the Browning or BAR. At this point in time it was just about better graphics and who’s weapon textures looked the most realistic. Call of Duty 2 delivers on the visuals and was a benchmarker much like Crysis is now back in 2005/2006. It was one of the first game to support SLI and really pushed PCs and made you get those $500 graphics cards. It was a must have for PC owners, and was also a GPU seller. With that aside, the textures look great even today and the visuals really pop. The sound is great as well with gunfire chattering in the distance and soldiers yelling all around you. It may seem dated today, but you can really see how much the Call of Duty series hasn’t evolved. There’s striking similarities to the Modern Warfare series because it’s all the same, shoot anything that moves.The game can be pretty easy at times, I could just rush into a building and blow everyone away with one clip and survive. I still find it painful to know that grenade physics are still really bad and bounce around like rubber balls. There are various things I just really can’t stand about these shooters and that’s the lack of realism. When I shoot enemies blood doesn’t even come out, where’s the gore and violence? Brothers in Arms was the first WWII shooter to use this violence in the genre, but Call of Duty just feels like some sort of censored theme park ride.CoD2 had a huge multiplayer following, but sadly no one’s online anymore. Even so, it’s just a typical online shooter and isn’t anything special. I was really disappointed to find that CoD2 wasn’t as cinematic as it could have been and just felt the same throughout the whole game. Blow up this door, defend this position, destroy that mortar nest, kill this Flak 88 crew. It’s the same stuff we play in every single WWII shooter and nothing ever changes. Sure it was mindless fun, but I have come to realize why I was so glad everyone moved on.--Score: 8/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												Call of Duty 2's campaign will put you in the shoes of a few different soldiers fighting for different Allied factions. You start off as a private in the Russian army, visciously fighting off the invading Germans in Moscow and Stalingrad. The British campaign is unlocked after beating the first Russian mission. For most of these missions you'll be fighting in the sand-swept deserts of North Africa alongside the Desert Rats against Field Marshal Rommel's troops. The final mission in the British campaign sends you to the bombed-out houses and hedgerows of Caen, France. After you're done with that, you'll play as an American corporal in Europe. Yes, you will be doing a D-Day landing, but not on Omaha Beach or Utah Beach, which you've probably played several times before. Instead, you'll be scaling the sheer cliffs of Pointe du Hoc as artillery with the Army Rangers. If you already thought rock climbing was an ""extreme"" sport, try doing it with artillery and machine-gun fire raining down on you.Each of the game's 10 missions is broken up into a few different stages. If you play the game on regular difficulty, you could blow through it in about 10 hours. Ratcheting up the difficulty a notch makes the game much harder and more tactical (this is probably the experience the designers intended). Since you'll be creeping and peeking more carefully through all the encounters, you'll lengthen the campaign significantly, and enjoy it more.I seriously can't recommend this game enough so please...just get it!!!!!! :D			",32,0,0,3,2,0,2

AND WHEN I TRY TO SWITCH ON MULTIPLAYER, FREAKING BLACK SCREEN DUDE, so, if you want this game for multiplayer and you got windows 10 DON'T BUY IT, what a waste of my money, if someone can help me, i appreciate that.

												Have you not played the SP for CoD 2 yet? It's excellent, get this game.Do you want to play CoD 2 for the MP? Unless you like the idea of nearly every server having oodles of modifications that make it barely recognizable any more, then avoid. There are barely any pure/non-mod servers, and they're never populated. In summary. Come for the SP, leave because of the ridiculous amount of quake-ified or modern warfare-ified servers that run crappy custom maps yelling M-M-M-MULTI KILL in your ears.I really wish I could give a ""Mixed"" rating, but I bought this game to relive the multiplayer, and I got nothing but disappointment. Hence I'm giving it a ""Don't recommend"" purely from my point of view.			",230,35,4,10,12,0,17

												!! IMPORTANT !! The Game is good, but STEAM does not work well with MAC and PUNKBUSTER, if you like me have a MAC, understand that most multiplayer servers will NOT be playable, you will be automaticly kicked after a few minutes of joining. This game was worthless for me on STEAM, and i was unable to get a refund due to to many attempts of trying to get it to work. So Call of Duty 2 is great, but Steam made a mistake not explaining that Multiplayer is for Windows users only. Do not buy this game if you have a MAC and expect to play it online!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even if you’re craving that 2005 medal-of-honor WW2 FPS, you’ll find that the rose-colored glasses you’re wearing are smudged with endless grenades, soldiers that were olympic shotputters and marksmen, and AI with a family tree of glue huffers and the visually impaired. There were countless instances where enemy Jerries would walk behind me and gank my bum while friendly soldiers that were behind me didn’t even stop to shoot them. In numerous other instances, they have no problems running right past enemies. Aside from that, the first two CoDs (including the expansions from 1) were not centered on a real story - it was a collection of finding people to bring them back to a disclosed location, clearing out cities and defending them, and blowing stuff up because Uncle Sam/Mother Russia demands it. Sure, there are characters (and if you listen very closely, you can hear Nolan North) that are throughout the series, but it barely maintains the jollies.Little does, in fact. Environments are quite bland, but I’ve heard nothing but good things about the multiplayer. But since I jumped into CoD at 4, where maps were larger, more detailed, and had a vast array of weapon selection and customizations, I’ve just been spoiled and have always looked down on games that didn’t have that. That is why I have to say that these games, along with purely FPS games, do not age all that great. The only people that will truly appreciate the purchase of this 10+ year old title are the nostalgics who want to jump around on old MP maps and fire the 3-4 bolt action rifles to make their 10-14 year old selves proud. Especially not at ten dollars a title at a mere 50% off discount. If you think there’s a story you missed, there isn’t. The only narrative present is how stingy IW is with their discounts.

												The first Call of Duty with the ""you are hurt! take cover"" bloody screen and no posibility to save the game on demand. Developed on the first iteration of the IW2 engine, it provides a visually enhanced experience for the ww incursions. Gameplay-wise there are a tremendeous amount of scripted moments. The game expects you to do all the hard work, regardless of how many squad member fight along side you on each mission. The squad members will constantly shout and yell for incomming grenades, after that they'll brazenly sit on them/near them or they'll act as terrible soldiers, missing their targets all of the time, unless the script says otherwise. I am writing this after multiple failed attempts on final stand of the second campaign (according to the online wiki there are 3) and also thinking to resign, because of that final stand sequence where the game transforms into Serious Sam and the squad members are completely useless. The squad members with their inept AI clicked the ""uninstall"" button.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had some fun with this game, I thought it was more arcade than COD 1 was but oh well.  And then I got to these missions where there were these panzershrek guys that would spawn and would be immune to anything that you did to them and they'd destroy your tanks and kill your teammates and that ruined it for me.  NO MATTER WHAT, they should not be programmed to not die.  That's unrealistic.  COD 1 feels so much better, you try not to take many bullets.  In this game it's impossible not to be shot a lot, so you probably get shot like 100+ times and just keep regenerating the health.  This is where they took off the 3 main guns and 1 sidearm mechanic.  So you either have a main gun and a pistol, 2 main guns or 2 pistols, etc, it's just stupid.  Everything was annoying, it didn't feel like you were a team like in COD 1.  In COD 1, you felt like everyone was doing their part, in here all your teammates die except a few main characters.  Everyone else just dies no matter what.  Oh yeah and SCREW THOSE FLIPPING PANZER ♥♥♥♥♥es that are invinsible!EDIT: I decided to go back and play it some more, I got to the American campaign and it got A LOT better.  I mean a lot better.

												Cynical contract filler from a studio that couldn't be bothered.  That's not hyperbole, that's the honest truth.  Infinity Ward didn't want to make this game at all so from phoned-in briefings (simple text and Military Channel excerpts) to phoned in map designs (recycled ideas from Call of Duty 1 and lots of linear corridors) to a whole litany of design decisions deliberately intended to get the game out the door as quickly as possible in order to fulfill their obligations to Activision so they could move on to the game they did want to make - Modern Warfare.However, this game is worse than all that; it clearly jumped the shark.  Regenerating health, whack-a-mole play, loss of selector switches on select-fire weapons, smaller arsenal compared to previous games, worse map design, plot holes where any plot exists at all and a near total lack of any characterization set in place all the trends that would see the series become the object of near-universal contempt from PC FPS enthusiasts while its increasingly juvenile and insufferable fanbase became the object of universal contempt from everyone else.Avoid it like the plague it set in motion which has only just begun to roll back.  Stick with the first game and United Offensive which are superior in every way that counts.			",211,21,0,38,18,0,27

												Not feeling this one. Call of Duty, the very first one, has better gameplay despite the outdated graphics. I would rather suggest playing Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and its expansions over CoD2, it has way superior WW2 atmosphere. Sadly, it isn't on steam.EDIT: Ok, Im going to have to differenciate the campaings. While the Battle for Caen is simply amazing with great atmosphere and team spirit (despite AI), and very challenging, D-Day and most of the battles in the African desert towns are a scripted mess. Then again, the african tank mission is too easy, but fun. I wish there was more in the style of the Battle for Caen - which reminds me of  Medal of Honor: Allied Assault :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game tells us about adventures of three mutants with superhuman ability to fully and rapidly recover from any injury or ailment. They also have built-in grenade indicator - because grenades are their most fearsome enemies. Your teammates are capable of insta-spotting the MG42 machinegun and they will always tell you if there is one (and there is ALWAYS one so every fight they shout the same phrase about it). The game looks pretty good, supports 1920*1080, has some nice effects (especially hot air in the desert).I cannot recommend this because it is just boring and you can complete all three campaigns in 5 hours even on hardest difficulty due to regeneration and BLOODY SCREEN. Even your tank will regenerate if being hurt. There is no reason to play that after CoD 1 and United Offensive.			",523,145,25,56,47,5,65

												The campaign of this sequel is just plain repulsive. Not only are characters dulled, but there will be spouts of intense challenge, where one may be repeating the same action at least five times until he gets lucky. The campaign as a whole feels incorrect and biased; it causes more disgust than fun.The multiplayer is OK due to more mechanics than the single player (???) and a good modding community. However, I believe some servers on this game's multiplayer are perfect examples of how over-modding can ruin a game.All in all, this game doesn't come close to the first Call of Duty and its expansion, although may fair better against more recent Call of Duty games (not much of a challenge there). Don't be fooled by the improved graphics. It just isn't better.			",252,29,5,40,39,2,57

Unless your running windows xp don't buy this game.  : (      If you find a solution please comment. Thanks.			",18,0,0,0,4,0,2

												If you're looking for a game that will run better on your older Mac, keep looking. Yes, the framerate is a bit better but the gameplay is just lacking compared MW2. Spent $20 and after 20 minutes of multiplayer regretted the decision.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't expect much from a 2005 game but I also wasn't prepared that one of the most loved war games would be so blank. It's primitive even for the year it was released in with pretty much nothing besides the WASD controls, jump, crouch, aim and shoot. The graphics are outdated, yes, but what strikes me is how uninspiring and repetitive the environment feels. Throughout the game i felt like I saw the same houses and ruins over and over again. The backstory offered as much as I expected from it but only in one chapter, during capturing Hill 400 did I feel any connection with the character.All that set aside, the biggest disappintment for me was that the game offered no stealth support. The levels were built in a way that the only way to advance was to storm a rallypoint and then hold it for a short time. Sniping out enemies from the distance proved to be a waste of time and ammo since new ones spawned immediately.With all the game has to offer i can't imagine I would have been impressed even back when it came out. My opinion is that it's just not worth it. Least today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disapointingly boring and lackluster. After playing Call of duty WAW I expected this game to be fun, sadly it's not. The guns are not satisfying or fun to use. The AI is stupid and hardly a threat. Never feels like a war, and I can tell its trying but it almost completely lacks those epic (When I say epic I mean it) moments that COD WAW had. Excluding the very beginning of the D-Day mission. Its not a horrible game but its not a very good one either. If your looking for one of the good cod games go look at cod waw. Its the same price and there's a lot more there. Even not compared to cod waw the game still isn't great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the most unrealistic world war 2 first person shooter ever made for all I know.  I wouldn't be surprised if I learned that was their objective in the first place.  I don't know about other people but I find insulting and degrading hearing: ''We're all that's left''(maybe a dozen us soldiers defending a bunker we just captured) and then killing hundreds of german soldiers and then winning the mission.

												Back, during the DVD & CD times I've played this game on clan base for hundreds of hours.Today, it brings back gaming memories and a certain feeling of. ""Okay, that was top nodge back then.""For today FPS standards it's not that good, but you shouldn't approach COD2 like that.It's a game from the past and back then it was good. Top of the line.So what does a modern gamer get with this game?-Fluid controls.-Fast action.-A nice selection of weapons.-Okay A.I.-Outdated graphics, but still acceptable.-Many MODs (Also BOT mods for Co-Op TDM/DM etc.)-Custom maps to enhance the game value/timeDownside:-No German Campaign.-History rewritten. Most of the things in the game are spit out by a propaganda machine.-The steam version does NOT start most of the time, but if you use a No-CD patch it will run just smooth.Should you buy this game?Well, if you're into WW2 history & weaponry yes. Otherwise you're better of with a more modern shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is without a doubt my favorite Call of Duty ever :D.  I love this gamem I have been playing it since it came out in 2005 and it has never ceased to thrill me. This game has unlimited replay value because every time i play it i find new ways to do so.  I love this game because it always draws me into the action, it is truly cinematic, i don't feel like i am just playing the game, i really feel like i am there with my squad and we are kicking some German butt! I love the music as well in this game. I love that it has multiple objectives and that i am the one leading my squad instead of in the later Modern  Warfare games i am being led around by the nose being screamed at to shoot here or shoot there or follow this guy or that guy.  In COD 2 my men follow me and  i am the one in charge and i decide the pace of action, Call of Duty 2 feels like my game, i am the star. The later games lost that magic that this game has.  The graphics are fine, it is not all about the pretty textures, it is about this games ability to draw me into the action and transport me into a different time and place where i can be a hero.

												It's Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers in one single, cohesive story! Too bad the game lacks a coherent story, with multiple story parts that don't really tie in with each other, for example fighting as a an american soldier next to the Brit or vice versa. This is though understandable by the technology at the time, and instead it makes up in graphics, dialog and sound effects. It's undoubtedly one of the longest single story campaigns in the CoD series and any other WWII game for that matter. One could only hope for a remake with the likes of CoD world at war, until then: this game gets 3 French beaches out of 5!			",184,33,10,8,11,1,31

												The peak of WW2 shooters when they were the rage.Further refining the WW2 formula, this game represented the apex of the genre just before the market became overcrowded and WW2 started becoming stale. Single player was great, but not as mind blowing or original as COD1.It was a PC killer at the time, and was the last COD whos multiplayer had a pure ""skill-to-score"" mapping suitable for competitive-level play. The controls were ultra responsive, and I beleive there are still a small handful of active servers and clans that continue to play it. ",244,8,1,19,7,1,25

												I was surprised by the jump in quality from CoD1 to CoD2, #2 is such a leap forward that it crystalized everything in the single player which all future CoD games would follow.  The formula is all here: you play multiple random grunts, with continuous side characters who are invincible (unless you kill them), an emphasis on cinematic, high-octane action scenes, regenerating health, highly funneled navigation paths, and repetitive shootout encounters where hordes of cloned opposition troops sit in defensive positions and plink at you 'till you whittle them away. The formula is so well worn that my interest was only held in the environmental details that separated one battlefield from another.The big problem with single player is you're always aware you are playing a GAME, with game conventions, but the game demands you suspend disbelief and play like it's real.  It doesn't work and it gets tiresome when you know other games let your skill have greater impact on the events.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

												I wount tell you reasons why this game is awesome and why you should definitely get it. Instead I will say to you, that this game is just a masterpiece and a CS copy. Yes, its a copy of one of the greatest Videogames of all time, but its a good copy. It has his own mechanics and Ideas and is mainly focused on slow and tactic gameplay, for example: You can't run (like in CS), you cant Walk or jump while shooting (like in CS) and the strongst weapons are rifles w/ and w/out scopes. So peaking carfully, having good aim and playing tacticly (is that a word?) is important as hell. Its propably the best living CoD out there, because the Master Server of CoD4 as well as many ""cracked Server Lists"" also went down.Also another downside of buying it now, is that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Activision cancelled their contract w/ evenbalance/the guys who made punkbuster and now there won't be any new updates coming for all CoDs... That sucks, cause now you may meet some cheaters online, but hey I havent met any so far...I have only played a few hours and already write a review, that might be stupid for some, but I can tell that I have seen everything already what the Game has to offer, exept the whole Singleplayer. But as far as I can tell, the Singleplayer is pretty good 2 (who buys it for singleplayer anyway? ;D ).So yeah... Buy it as long as it still lives, because its one of the best Competetive Shooters ever made... Thx for readin this crap and have a good day :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I only have a few minutes playtime registered in Steam, because I only recently got it for Steam, so on with my review:This game still has it all, atmosphere, difficulty, great graphics (for its time) and a superb story mode.It's very much split into scenarios that you pick from the menu, but I quite like that and CoD2 has been the one CoD of all the ones I played that convinced me the most story-wise.I think even today's CoD games are mostly well worth getting, to some extend, but CoD2 without any hesitation.CoD 1-4 are CoD titles that don't need to be compared against the newer ones, maybe 4 a little bit yes.There's something siginifantly different about WW2 technology and the stuff you can find in the later games of the series, naturally, so if you prefer a good shooter over a shooter with a lot of other goodies added (which is neither merely negative nor positive in my opinion) then the older CoD games are definitely for you.No remote controlled air strikes, no heartbeat sensors, no fuzz, just good old raw shooting, fragging, blowing stuff up and front battles.If you are just somewhat considering to pick up CoD2, do yourself the favor and go right ahead.Some of the best game time I've ever spent on a PC game. :)			",309,100,36,23,42,3,35

												Call of Duty 2 is one of the best games in the series and for good reasons. While overused by today's games, the regenerative health system introduced in COD2 is balanced in a way that allows the action to keep moving in an exhilarating pace. This new health system prevents the frustration of getting hit by a stray bullet and having to backtrack through the level to find a health pack. The new enemy AI has been upgraded to balance the lax health system. Enemies use grenades to flush out stationary players, flanking tactics to overwhelm defenders, and melee charges to elminate invaders. Players are taught to enter buildings with caution, as enemies are known to hide around corners for a lethal surprise. Smoke grenades have been introduced to allow the player to cloak their advancement through open areas that are defended by enemy machine guns. The objectives, though scripted, are varied enough to spread the work load to your teammates from time to time. At certain points, teammates will use machine gun placements to help defend an area or use smoke grenades to help advance. The player still has to do the majority of the objectives but little moments like those give the idea that the war was won with team effort a little merit. Call of Duty 2 is by all means not a realistic war game but it is a war simulator. The COD series never strived to be realistic war games, with or without regenerative health. However, they do illustrate their levels based on history, veteran accounts, and photography. COD2 provides the player a way to experience the war in a way that you would expect from a war film. You do not have to subject yourself to the real emotions that war presents but rather the story it leaves behind. In reality, war is filled with dirt, mud, smell, blood, tragedy, sweat, and believe it or not, boredom. A realistic war game would have the player dig foxholes for hours and wait in the rain for something to happen. One of the quotes in the game tells the player not to take it seriously because ""war is delightful to those who have not experienced it"". The game instead chooses to highlight the bravery and sacrifice soldiers had to sustain to complete their missions. Even though you do not know any of your teammates personally, visually, watching them get cut down by enemy fire is still a disturbing when you stop to think about it. Much of the enjoyment from this game comes from stopping to think about it. The levels are not 100% historically accurate and they never will be, but they do provide enough details that allow the player to look up these stories if they are interested.The overall story structure of the game is quaint, which is a huge contrast to the newer games in the series. COD2 is composed of missions spanning across the Russian, British, and American campaigns in World War II. The missions are fairly simple, fix a telegraph connection, retake a town from the Nazis, eliminate enemy mortar positions, etc. The tame nature of the missions does not make the game a chore to play however, as each mission is given an interesting historical backdrop for the player to engage in. Even though the game was made in 2005, the visuals make great use of particle effects for smoke and gunfire, lighting on wet surfaces during rain, and textures for battle worn clothing on soldiers.Call of Duty 2 does its job of being a sequel extremely well. Even today, other war games are still trying to recapture the style of it. The excellent quality of music, visuals, gameplay, and pacing just works in COD2 that makes it unique in the series. It is one of the last games in the series that does not have a central story aside from doing your job as a soldier. It is by all means not a realistic war game but COD never was trying to be. COD works best as an entertaining video game that uses historical battles as inspiration and structure. Infinity Ward wanted to make the player interested in the history behind these levels and at the same time, entertained by the gameplay in them. No one will ever be able to fully replicate wars in games and that is fine. No one should ever have to experience real war. In reality, war is not clean nor straightforward but it is nice to play a war game that showcases the bravery and triumph rather than the tragedy and loss. It is escapism sure, but you can say that to many other video games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the second or third best installment in the Call of Duty franchise, I haven't been as satisfied with an FPS shooter game in a while as I have with Call of Duty 2.  Graphics hold up rather well after ten years, and the action keeps you going almost as well as Call of Duty 4 did, despite not getting to know the characters very well (Except Captain Price that is).  Knowing your history of World War II especially raises whatever investment you may have in the levels you shoot through.  In simple words, worth every penny, now enjoy shooting the fascists!

												Let me know I have beaten this game for my Xbox 360, so don't mind the minutes.CoD 2 is an amazing game. It is sandwhiched between the 2 bad CoD games (1 and 3). But this one is just fantastic.AI- To be honest, the AI is very poor in this game. They are just plain bad and will run out of cover to kill you even though you can just shoot them. It was made a while ago but it is just generally poor. It is bothersome. Also your teamates can trap you sometimes. That doesn't help when you die for accidentally kill a comrade.Soundtrack- It is mostly used during the end of a mission at the ""final fight"" and it is very good.Story- I like this story very much. It is about a Russian soldier fighting in WW2. That is it but the characters are quite likeable.Maps: The maps are fantastic. They are so well done giving you situations that will be tough and a lot of fun. They are very hard to describe, but you'll know what I mean when you see for yourself. The maps are some of the best in CoD history. But in some missions you can skip little parts. At one point in mission 2, if you walk into a stall and activate the radio at the right moment, you can skip a bit of the level. This can also be done in others.Overall, CoD 2 is an amazing game. I highly suggest you buy this even for $20.9/10			",72,1,3,0,7,1,6

												The price is really high for this kinda game it should be 10 bucks or less.This is a sensible sequel to Call of Duty released back in 2003 and when sequels really meant something. And this was also from the era they didn't release a new COD every year.In this game you'll fight as Russia, British and American soldiers in the frontlines of WWII. The Soviet campaign is mostly kicking Germans out of Stalingrad, the UK campaign is mostly in the battles of North Africa which was refreshning to see for a change. US campaign is yet again about Normandy.... Don't game designers get boring doing D-Day again and again? I mean it was important but I think they should get some new battles. The US campaign climax is crossing the Rhine which was nice!And the multiplayer is balanced and fun. Except no vehicles like in COD:UO. But the game is a masterwork of a genius back in 2005. The graphics back then were stunning, similiar to F.E.A.R (2005).I had no issues playing the game on Windows 7, so feel free to buy!Protip: Buy the warchest of Call of Duty. You get all the games for 30 bucks (otherwise it would be 20 bucks per game=60 bucks)10000000/1 would kick nazis out of Russia and North Africa again			",97,1,0,4,2,0,5

												Well, it's 70 years since WWII came to an end, thought I would give this 10 year old game a review. Based on a newer engine than the first Call of Duty, this game brings something more than before. Great environments; varying weather, like snow, rain, fog and smoke for its time. Watch some footage before and after missions. Improved engine helps with manoeuvrability. The first few Call of Duty games really brought the exposure of WWII, so if you want a good history lesson, you can start with those.You start off playing missions for the Soviets, then the British, then the Americans. While playing this game, again I tried to opt for the fallen Axis' guns. Thompson could carry 20, while the MP40 could carry 32; which SMG would you opt for, especially when sometimes you have 5 enemies in 1 go? BAR can only carry 20 too.Now while I can write a whole heap of + points for this game, the above generally state them all.There are some gripes I had with this game, which did carry out into the future games:- Automatic health regeneration. This has made the campaign easier, but it also meant big kill streaks in Multiplayer if you were versing a bunch of scrubs.- Last Stand. Why did they bring it so once you are low, you can use this perk to shoot with a sidearm on the floor. Why?Multiplayer was strong back in the day, until about 6 years ago. Not now.All in all, I really liked this game back in the day. It's great. Multiplayer is kind of dead, depending where you live. Is this game value for money? Probably not at this stage, at a sale it should be okay, keeping in mind that the campaign can be completed around 6 hours.			",178,13,20,28,6,0,11

												Probably the second or third best installment in the Call of Duty franchise, I haven't been as satisfied with an FPS shooter game in a while as I have with Call of Duty 2.  Graphics hold up rather well after ten years, and the action keeps you going almost as well as Call of Duty 4 did, despite not getting to know the characters very well (Except Captain Price that is).  Knowing your history of World War II especially raises whatever investment you may have in the levels you shoot through.  In simple words, worth every penny, now enjoy shooting the fascists!

												Well, my first call of duty game I ever played and one of my favorite games in my life, a part of my chilhood is this game and still one of the best from all the saga for me. Excellent and long campaign, playing like U.S in Europe, Great Britain in Africa and Russian in Russia (from all I can remember from the campaign) and  mission with the tank  is really cool. The multiplayer is simple and really funny, u can stay hours there.Simply love all from this game. 100000000000/10			",123,17,4,10,3,0,8

												I wount tell you reasons why this game is awesome and why you should definitely get it. Instead I will say to you, that this game is just a masterpiece and a CS copy. Yes, its a copy of one of the greatest Videogames of all time, but its a good copy. It has his own mechanics and Ideas and is mainly focused on slow and tactic gameplay, for example: You can't run (like in CS), you cant Walk or jump while shooting (like in CS) and the strongst weapons are rifles w/ and w/out scopes. So peaking carfully, having good aim and playing tacticly (is that a word?) is important as hell. Its propably the best living CoD out there, because the Master Server of CoD4 as well as many ""cracked Server Lists"" also went down.Also another downside of buying it now, is that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Activision cancelled their contract w/ evenbalance/the guys who made punkbuster and now there won't be any new updates coming for all CoDs... That sucks, cause now you may meet some cheaters online, but hey I havent met any so far...I have only played a few hours and already write a review, that might be stupid for some, but I can tell that I have seen everything already what the Game has to offer, exept the whole Singleplayer. But as far as I can tell, the Singleplayer is pretty good 2 (who buys it for singleplayer anyway? ;D ).So yeah... Buy it as long as it still lives, because its one of the best Competetive Shooters ever made... Thx for readin this crap and have a good day :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back, during the DVD & CD times I've played this game on clan base for hundreds of hours.Today, it brings back gaming memories and a certain feeling of. ""Okay, that was top nodge back then.""For today FPS standards it's not that good, but you shouldn't approach COD2 like that.It's a game from the past and back then it was good. Top of the line.So what does a modern gamer get with this game?-Fluid controls.-Fast action.-A nice selection of weapons.-Okay A.I.-Outdated graphics, but still acceptable.-Many MODs (Also BOT mods for Co-Op TDM/DM etc.)-Custom maps to enhance the game value/timeDownside:-No German Campaign.-History rewritten. Most of the things in the game are spit out by a propaganda machine.-The steam version does NOT start most of the time, but if you use a No-CD patch it will run just smooth.Should you buy this game?Well, if you're into WW2 history & weaponry yes. Otherwise you're better of with a more modern shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me know I have beaten this game for my Xbox 360, so don't mind the minutes.CoD 2 is an amazing game. It is sandwhiched between the 2 bad CoD games (1 and 3). But this one is just fantastic.AI- To be honest, the AI is very poor in this game. They are just plain bad and will run out of cover to kill you even though you can just shoot them. It was made a while ago but it is just generally poor. It is bothersome. Also your teamates can trap you sometimes. That doesn't help when you die for accidentally kill a comrade.Soundtrack- It is mostly used during the end of a mission at the ""final fight"" and it is very good.Story- I like this story very much. It is about a Russian soldier fighting in WW2. That is it but the characters are quite likeable.Maps: The maps are fantastic. They are so well done giving you situations that will be tough and a lot of fun. They are very hard to describe, but you'll know what I mean when you see for yourself. The maps are some of the best in CoD history. But in some missions you can skip little parts. At one point in mission 2, if you walk into a stall and activate the radio at the right moment, you can skip a bit of the level. This can also be done in others.Overall, CoD 2 is an amazing game. I highly suggest you buy this even for $20.9/10			",72,1,3,0,7,1,6

												I only have a few minutes playtime registered in Steam, because I only recently got it for Steam, so on with my review:This game still has it all, atmosphere, difficulty, great graphics (for its time) and a superb story mode.It's very much split into scenarios that you pick from the menu, but I quite like that and CoD2 has been the one CoD of all the ones I played that convinced me the most story-wise.I think even today's CoD games are mostly well worth getting, to some extend, but CoD2 without any hesitation.CoD 1-4 are CoD titles that don't need to be compared against the newer ones, maybe 4 a little bit yes.There's something siginifantly different about WW2 technology and the stuff you can find in the later games of the series, naturally, so if you prefer a good shooter over a shooter with a lot of other goodies added (which is neither merely negative nor positive in my opinion) then the older CoD games are definitely for you.No remote controlled air strikes, no heartbeat sensors, no fuzz, just good old raw shooting, fragging, blowing stuff up and front battles.If you are just somewhat considering to pick up CoD2, do yourself the favor and go right ahead.Some of the best game time I've ever spent on a PC game. :)			",309,100,36,23,42,3,35

												I was surprised by the jump in quality from CoD1 to CoD2, #2 is such a leap forward that it crystalized everything in the single player which all future CoD games would follow.  The formula is all here: you play multiple random grunts, with continuous side characters who are invincible (unless you kill them), an emphasis on cinematic, high-octane action scenes, regenerating health, highly funneled navigation paths, and repetitive shootout encounters where hordes of cloned opposition troops sit in defensive positions and plink at you 'till you whittle them away. The formula is so well worn that my interest was only held in the environmental details that separated one battlefield from another.The big problem with single player is you're always aware you are playing a GAME, with game conventions, but the game demands you suspend disbelief and play like it's real.  It doesn't work and it gets tiresome when you know other games let your skill have greater impact on the events.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

												Maybe this is the best game ever made, but at least it's the best Call of Duty ever made.I like the entire series, but this has all the good stuff. Call of duty is for me all about gun skill and that is all that matters in Call of Duty 2.This game resemples call of duty for me. I like COD4, WAW, MW2 and BO, but they all have overpowered and underpowered weapon classes, while in COD2 everybode has the same so it's only about your skill and that is all that should matter in a multiplayer game.10/10			",176,13,3,8,11,0,20

												This is a COD incarnation that led way to all Modern Warfare triumphs. Today, even though it may seem highly dated and out of place it still has some kind of charm for me. That’s probably because I haven’t played any other WW2 titles (apart from trying to play World At War but… let’s end it here for reasons you surely know). It’s not just that, though — I like it because I’m fond of the atmosphere, the glimpse of *that* world, the… story. Still recommend it. 7/10			",36,2,5,2,2,0,3

Memories of the original call of duty which I used to play as a kid, the game i replayed endlessly holding the cd dear in my cd folder...that precious memories were brought back by this sequel...before call of duty derailed and went into the futuristic terrorist shooter it had becomed...obsessed with only graphics over substance. I played the other ""call of duties"" but only this is the real call of duty....The rightful sequel.  And the music....man they should just use this music for all war movies and I would watch them.

												Well it introduced regenerating health, which speeds up the gameplay however it does make it slightly easier if you take a slower play style. That said it's got excellent level design, and as an added bonus has dialogue that actually made me laugh because it was funny, not, as many more recent games in this series have done, because it was poorly written.Right next to Call of Duty 4, this is probably the most iconic game of the franchise.

												No cows were harmed in the making of this review. Its amazing how great this game still is. The graphics are a pretty big improvement over the first game, and it still looks surprisingly decent for a game that came out in 2005. The game play still holds up pretty well, and the campaign is a lot better than Call of Duty 1 (imo). Unfortunately, like the previous game, there are some parts that can feel a bit repetitive.My only con is the lack of a manual save feature. Having to go back to a previous checkpoint after a constantly dying during a hard part of the game was very tedious. As for any bugs, the only one I encountered was a crash when I tried to change some video settings before I started the campaign. It only happened once, and it could have easily been a bad graphics driver on my end. Call of Duty 2 is my personal favorite in the entire series, and it was fun to play this game again after so long. It was especially great to experience how the series was back in 2005 before it ended up into the juggernaut that it is today. I highly recommend Call of Duty 2.			",289,42,5,25,13,0,24

												Before you consider my opinion here's some context > I picked this game up on a sale for $10> I have no nostalgic ties to Call of Duty 2 > My first COD was Modern Warfare 1> I'm just sick and tired of the annaul Dude Bro Shooter that COD has succumed to.> I have not played United Offensive or The Original Call of Duty > I'm playing this game with a steam controller bc there's NO GAMEPAD support. (Works well with Gryo on ADS)   Ok so this game is alot of fun, there's no cutscenes which is nice bc I'm kind of beginning to not care about narratives in games.   Regardeless of the fact that this game is 10+ years old, it has a phenomenal atmosphere and a great respect to it's source material (WWII), way better  than World at War (COD 5 felt way too emo).  I'm currently in the British Campaign, I just finished the Russian missions and after that I get to kill some facists for Uncle Sam. If you have an urge to play this game to see what Call of Duty used to be, I reccomend you pick this up on a sale, $20 is a little steep. ",69,1,1,7,3,0,1

So far I've only played the campaign as I can't get multiplayer working, but it is very good.Prepare for a headache to get the multiplayer to actually launch if that is your primary purpose for getting this. At least for Windows 10, I am stuck with a black screen when launching the multiplayer menu. I've tried a few things (Ran as admin and compatibility mode for XP service pack 3) but nothing seems to be working. On top of that, my system gets completely stuck upon launching it (not even task manager can close it) so I have to reboot everytime I try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game itself, it is not one of the greatest shooter ever, not even close, it is not even close to Medal of Honor: Allied Assault so forget about old school shooters such as Quake, Doom, Redneck Rampage, Duke Nukem, etc etc...But it is indeed a great game that should be played so much more unlike the recent Call of Duty games (since Call of Duty 7 AKA Black Ops).Is this a gem? No, probably not but it is a pice of art, less valuable than a gem but valuable enough.The first one is still better but this one is worth being played if you forget about a few flaws such as:Health regenerating.No sprinting (even if it was in Call of Duty's expansion ""United Offensive""), not a big flaw but it would have been good.Pretty easy even at the highest difficulty, Call of Duty was also very easy even at the highest difficulty but this one seems even easier, that's the case for me at least, having played difficult and hardcore games, this one seems like a baby game even at the highest difficulty to me.But the game is still fun after all, it has a good campaign, perhaps not better than World at War but it has great maps.The graphics are really good for a game of that time.8/10 ",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												I was surprised by the jump in quality from CoD1 to CoD2, #2 is such a leap forward that it crystalized everything in the single player which all future CoD games would follow.  The formula is all here: you play multiple random grunts, with continuous side characters who are invincible (unless you kill them), an emphasis on cinematic, high-octane action scenes, regenerating health, highly funneled navigation paths, and repetitive shootout encounters where hordes of cloned opposition troops sit in defensive positions and plink at you 'till you whittle them away. The formula is so well worn that my interest was only held in the environmental details that separated one battlefield from another.The big problem with single player is you're always aware you are playing a GAME, with game conventions, but the game demands you suspend disbelief and play like it's real.  It doesn't work and it gets tiresome when you know other games let your skill have greater impact on the events.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers in one single, cohesive story! Too bad the game lacks a coherent story, with multiple story parts that don't really tie in with each other, for example fighting as a an american soldier next to the Brit or vice versa. This is though understandable by the technology at the time, and instead it makes up in graphics, dialog and sound effects. It's undoubtedly one of the longest single story campaigns in the CoD series and any other WWII game for that matter. One could only hope for a remake with the likes of CoD world at war, until then: this game gets 3 French beaches out of 5!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The peak of WW2 shooters when they were the rage.Further refining the WW2 formula, this game represented the apex of the genre just before the market became overcrowded and WW2 started becoming stale. Single player was great, but not as mind blowing or original as COD1.It was a PC killer at the time, and was the last COD whos multiplayer had a pure ""skill-to-score"" mapping suitable for competitive-level play. The controls were ultra responsive, and I beleive there are still a small handful of active servers and clans that continue to play it. ",244,8,1,19,7,1,25

												Maybe this is the best game ever made, but at least it's the best Call of Duty ever made.I like the entire series, but this has all the good stuff. Call of duty is for me all about gun skill and that is all that matters in Call of Duty 2.This game resemples call of duty for me. I like COD4, WAW, MW2 and BO, but they all have overpowered and underpowered weapon classes, while in COD2 everybode has the same so it's only about your skill and that is all that should matter in a multiplayer game.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More of COD 1, but not as much fun. If you like COD and you missed this, it is worth picking up. There were many more frustrating moments in COD 2. The most prominent issue was with my troops running in front of me while I am plugging away with a machine gun. I am going out on a limb here, but I am pretty sure training (or common sense) involves NOT running in front of someone firing a machine gun. I would also get into a good position to shoot, only to have my own guys run up and block the shots. Sometimes my troops would be running alongside German troops, neither one interested in shooting at each other. If I could have turned my troops off and went it alone, I would have liked that better. The other frustrating AI issue is that even though someone is on a machine gun 300-400 yards away, I peak around a corner to take a shot with a sniper rifle only to be hit with machine gun fire immediately. I know that the Germans were accurate shooters, but come on! A lot of times I found it easier to just rush positions and shoot the enemy point blank. That's not fun. I just played through COD 1 before this, and I don't remember any of these issues of frustration with COD 1.That being said, it is a solid game overall, and highly recommended for the WWII military game lovers. I just wouldn't get this instead of COD 1. If you have not played either COD, get them both. And for accurate WWII action get ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"".			",424,213,9,52,22,3,81
