												Not many people have played this game...but it's actually quite good, and deserved more attention than it got. The interaction between the characters is strong, stronger than most, with each having more inward depth than your typical ""action heroes"" in fantasy, and E'lara especially is one ofthe few female elven characters who isn't simply a flighty songbird who needs help constantly, without going into the super-strong ""I am a man with boobs"" territory. Gameplay is third person action/shooter, each character has a melee weapon with shield, and ranged weapon, with E'lara's ranged being stronger and Caddoc's melee being stronger. Melee is the weakest part of the gameplay, but the graphics, exploration and side quest aspects, character interaction, and general story is fairly strong. One or two quick sequences ruin parts of the game, like running from a giant spider where you only have a two second window to evade it or die instantly, and have to do multiple short sequences...But it is otherwise a very good game, worth a playthrough, and Bethesda/Zenimax are one of the few publisher/developer combos worthy of your money anymore. From the people who brought you Elder Scrolls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A surprisingly good game. It's not amazing, but I would say it's very competent. It succeeds at accomplishing exactly what it aims to: Create a cool game with an interesting world and compelling co-op mechanics. The characters are intriguing and often funny. The game doesn't hand-hold much, especially on side quests. The game is difficult, punishingly so. This game will kick both your asses, and you will be so tempted to drink the sleg. I recommend against it.Also wins the award for having a completely meaningless title. This game has nothing to do with being hunted or a demon's forge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What an epic underrated masterpiece.If you're familiar with InXile games like Bard's Tale, you will feel right at home. Although the game lacks a bit on the graphics side, it's still charming and have a very well built and beautiful scenery. The very atmospheric aesthetic of the game is very pleasing and will make up for the sharp polygons and not so great textures. The gameplay is simple, solid and straight to the point, you can change between the two main characters from time to time. You can customize for magic or melee, and which type of each along the way, constructing a more ideal personal play style that you enjoy more. The dialogue in this game is simply amazing, very well crafted, character building is also great, the relationship between the two are very fun and funny to watch, and it doesn't get in the way of the gameplay, you don't need to stop playing to watch a boring 5 minutes cutscene all the time, the dialogue is short and well spaced in-between throughout the game and also happens as you play, really smart game design. The story is great and captivating, and the dark fantasy theme really draws you in into the game's lore. And depending of your playstyle and choices you make throughout the game, the ending veries, this is really, really cool.The game feels epic and plays epic. The dialogues and superb voice acting will make a very fond memory. If you love the dark fantasy genre and good and fun combat mechanics and a smart game design in general, Hunted: The Demon's Forge will give you an epic time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hunted: The Demon’s Forge is an action hack and slash game. Developed by inXile Entertainment and published by Bethesda, releasing on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC in Mid-2011. Gameplay in Hunted can be done either single player or co-op, whether it is online, or split screen. You play as either E’lara or Caddoc. E’lara specialises in using range weapons whilst Caddoc is the sword and board of the pair. Both of the characters have access to casting spells but these play a smaller part in the combat than you would think due to mana constraints. The hack and slash type combat system is really fun, and the range combat is even better. As you kill enemies they will drop fragments of shards, collect enough shards and you will get a skill point. You can use the skill point to purchase new abilities and upgrade the abilities as well. By the end of the game you will more or less have all of the skills so it doesn’t matter too much which you pick initially.  If you are playing the game solo, you have the option at checkpoints to change which character you are in control of. In general, the computer AI is fairly intuitive at using your partner, helping you in battle etc.I played Hunted on 4k, with graphics ramped up to max, and it does look really good. The environments you are fighting in, the backdrops and character models all look very impressive. What I was a little let down by is the animation. It just seems to of been done very lazily, using the wrong animation at the wrong time, such as when you are moving through a narrow hole that has nothing above your head, the animation that is used, is clearly just the stock “Generic animation when moving through object” as the characters will show hand movements as if they are holding objects above their head. It just felt really sloppy and looked very unprofessional at times. Other than the animation, the visuals department of Hunted is better than average. Whilst the game has voice acting, the male actor doesn’t quite hit the right notes for me. Feels very generic meat head style and sometimes the words don’t quite match up with the character’s mouth so again, an animation issue.  E’lara’s voice actor is slightly better, but again the issue with animation crops up again. Sound effects for weapons are really good though. Soundtrack is somewhat forgettable, even now after just completing the game, no music seems to have stood and stuck in my head.I started out the game on the medium difficulty level and found that to be too easy, so I restarted and put the difficulty on the max setting, and this really does give you a challenge. You really have to make use of every single potion drop, every ounce of mana and above all else, make use of your characters roll ability. I can’t help but think it would still have been really easy had I been playing with another person rather than the AI though.Whilst you are exploring the dungeons, caves and fortresses, you will find weapon wracks, depending on which character you are in control of, if you destroy said weapon wrack, you will get a piece of loot which is relevant for your character, so E’lara will usually get a bow, and Caddoc will usually find a sword or shield. The looting aspect of the game is probably one of my favourites, because well; who doesn’t like loot in games? Whilst the weapons and armour don’t have massive amounts of variety on, you normally only get two stats. For your bow it is usually speed and damage, same for swords but you can also get armour plated shoulder pads which adds a bit extra armour stat on for your character. I finished Hunted in just over nine hours.  I found that to be an acceptable length, whilst I wasn’t bored at the end of the game, I didn’t have a craving for any more though. The story is bland and very forgettable. There is a small amount of character development, but because they are both so generic in their stereotypes, I found it very hard to care about either of them.  There is a high replay ability factor with this game though. Having only played it on single player and I focused my time on using E’lara, I could quite easily replay the game and get a whole different experience just from using Caddoc. You can also get probably at least one more run throughout of the game on co-op mode too. So you can probably reach about 25 hours’ worth of content if you push it. Technically, there were a few problems. Like I said above, I was playing on 4k resolution with graphics ramped up to max. Whilst playing I noticed there to be a significant stutter in the game when you are entering a new area. At first I thought it was purely a resolution thing, so I dropped it down to 1440p but it was still the same, so I tried again to 1080p and the stutter was still there. I even turned down all of the options to minimum and the stutter still existed. So to put it shortly, I am not sure what causes this stutter, given that you are changing areas quite frequently you will suffer from it a lot too.  Another issue I had, was the camera when your character is sprinting, it just jolts up and down all over the place and actually gave me a head ache because of it. Luckily you don’t need to sprint that often thankfully. To sum up, Hunted: The Demon’s Forge has some nicely presented game play and mediocre visuals. The story is forgettable and voice acting is on the poor side of the scale. Overall, it is merely just an average game. Yes it is 5 years old at this point so take all of this with that into consideration. If it weren’t for the fun game play, I would have put this down as a negative review, however I will purely just recommend Hunted: The Demon’s Forge for purchase only when on sale. The game is retailing at £9, 99 but there are much better games of this genre out there for that price.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												the negativity at this games release hailed from people expecting something neither the dev-team nor the publisher of this glorious dungeon-crawler-pearl never promised. people expected another open-world-rpg ala Fallout or Eldar Scrolls.people saw ""Bethesda"" and simply jumped to conclousions. that out of way:Hunted is an amazing game.it's visual quality holds up pretty good, even today. the art-direction is more a dark/gritty type of fantasy which looks a) fantastic and b) gives this game a more mature touch. in some aspects the art-direction reminds me of Gears of War...yes sounds strange...Talking about Gears of War -> Hunted is pretty much a fantasy version of said game with more rpg-elements and loot.Combat feels great, no matter if you're takin cover and shooting enemies from a distance, blasting them with spells or hacking/blocking in melee range controls are always responsive and feel fluid. which is a good thing, cause apart from solving some simple puzzles or listening to great npc-dialogue you will be fighting most of the time.Inspite of the end-of-days Gears of War setting Hunted does feel like a classic dungeon-crawler come to live. But what sets this game realy apart from a simple action-game with steller production quality is the way the game is set up. Your basicaly never alone, the premise is two people and the game sticks with it. the great thing about this is that the AI doesn't suck, yes sometimes (realy seldom) there's a little path-finding issue, but in general you ""feel"" like playing with a another person, no matter if it's combat, exploring or a riddle your team is solving.The story centers on those two and is actualy not that bad, it's not the grand scheme of things which is important, but their relationship. you will chuckly hearing some their pockin at each other, you will feel attached to both after some time. especialy when playing singelplayer this game provides an amazing expierience simply from the fact of your companion. i've never played a game where my ai-companion felt that much alive/real and that is taking never Bioware games into account.Overall:-still realy good visuals-fantastic soundtrack, great voiceover (english)-tight controls, polished combat-an interesting story, which is more suited for mature players, both mainchars are not ""heroes"" and they show a real lack of empathie for anyone but themselves (which is a fantastic setup and i did love it, but not suited for minors)-an interesting gameworld and a great sense of exploring/dungeoncrawling-in general a great sense of polish and budget-one of the best integrations of an Ai-companion -creat two player co-op (but since game-spy is down you will have to read up on gettin co-op started)way underrated simply cause people expected something completly diffrent than the dev always promised. Hunted is like  one of those great old-school arpgs, immersive stroy and gameplay but not sporting a open world setting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hunted has its flaws and bugs, but what lies beneath is a great hidden gem of a game. For the best experience play this game LAN Coop.Hunted currently does not support online mode due to Gamespy shutting down, however it is available through LAN.I only bought one copy of this game and I was able to play with my friend on LAN, by using one of the computers in steam offline mode on the same account.

												I feel like Hunted: The Demon's Forge it's a slow burner. The more you play it, the more you enjoy it. There isn't much in this game that it's remarkable, but in all I can tell it's a good experience. To put it short, its an action packed dungeon crawler. There are some puzzles and secrets, also you can ""collect"" Lore pieces, wich tell you the full backstory of the game once you gather them all. The interesting part about those lore pieces is hearing the story told by nobodies and simple people (often no so simple).On sale its a total win, even if it isn't that expensive.

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.I think people were expecting some kind of deepish Action RPG, it is not, there are RPG elements, but what you get is waves of enemies, a decent AI in solo mode and a game that I find fun and addictive. A few first-day bugs yeah, as always, but nothing too serious. The graphics are a bit of a mix going from really good to average. If you expect this game is all about action with a hint of RPG and with a touch of Gears of War in the mix you will really enjoy it.This game is all about survival combat, sweeping from room to room or covers to cover (aka. Gears of War). You won't drink endless red potions and mash buttons until you've revealed an entire dungeon map only to retrace your steps to find the key you missed.Overall: Pick the game up and do not expect any revelations that will change your life. Just enjoy the atmosphere and the combat.			",1949,754,75,171,243,17,313

												Start off by saying the game is very linear, very linear. The game will have you walking a straight path and have you take occasional little side path into alcoves, which normally contains special loot. The loot basically consist of axe, sword and bludgeon weapons for Caddoc.  E'lara the elf will have different verity of bows, ranging from fast, medium and slow. Both character shares similar shield types. The game reminds me of Skyrim, as if its in the same universe. Combat wise the game exceeds that of skyrim, where i found my self wishing Skyrim was this intense. At some point the game feels sort of gears of war'ish, as if the game was inspired by that series. Hunted has a small cover based aspect to it, similar to gears. The cover aspect personally doesn't make you feel safe as you do in gears.  The chemistry between the two characters is decent. No sexual tension, no forced sexual relationship, being the two characters are male and female. The relationship between the characters is pure business and professional, which i like. The game was enjoyable, though the game has some limitation. i felt as if more could be done about the character building, its very limited. As liner and as limited as the game seem, its still quite enjoyable, especially after playing the mounds of games that encourage you to explore and side-venture away from a games story or path.

												I was actually pretty surprised about this game slipping my notice for so long. For the buck you get pretty solid 3rd person action game, yeah there's not really much of an rpg in there. The main story isn't something that will that will blow your mind and will last about 10 hours if you run through plus I got really caught in looking for secrets and it was pretty satisfying. What really made it for me are the 2 main characters, funny dialogues, nice music, models and environments look good ... shame coop is still under gamespy therefore not working (maybe hamachi or alike would work but I haven't tried that) and once steamworks takes over I'm pretty sure I'll replay this with some friend.

===This game no longer supports online co-op play as of the termination of GameSpy in May 31, 2014.====""Hunted is running through dungeon, killing monster with really cool swords, really cool weapons and amazing spells and magic special effects. It's a modern, co-op, cover-based, action game set in a rich dark fantasy world."" - Matt Findley, President of InXile Entertainment.Although Hunted: The Demon's Forge may seems to be flawed and lacked in polish in many ways on the surface because its developer was focusing on the other bigger and more anticipated title of theirs, the core of Hunted: Demon's Forge capable of delivering is still considered to be the best by many co-op game players and dungeon crawlers across the world.There are many dungeon games out there - but none of them are quite like Hunted. Hunted has pretty much every good traditions and classic elements of the old school dungeon game such as riddles to solve, secret areas to explore and enemies that dungeon fans would expect to encouner. But with a big guy with sword, elven lady with bow and vicious creatures like minotaur and dragon. Hunted instead of being just a big cliché all over again, rather - it is more like mixing these clichés together in a dark fantasy world - and then throw it back onto your head with the qualities of modern platforms and human designs.After all, Hunted may be far from perfection in terms of presentation, bug-free, PC optimization, gameplay diversity and replayability. But this is also exactly why the sequel of it will be so promising and worthy after we see how good these things together turned out to be in the actual gameplay of Hunted. There will be just you, your partner; simple yet solid gameplay mechanics and a ton of straight forward hack-and-slash actions. And I just can't wait for a better sequel that unfolds the upcoming journey of our lovely mercenary pair - or - perhaps more like couple in blood, sweat and sarcasms.Recommended for dungeon srawlers or anyone who want some simple intuitive action gameplay. Better to play with a friend.----------------------------------------------------------------------------- For in-game actions: Even through a yet perfected and limited combat system, you can still tell that's how fast-paced hack-and-slash melee actions should be like in a thirdperson action game. As for bow and arrow, casting devastating magics and the boob jiggles whenever she bend over to pick up the money, those are extras. *Sorry, there aren't a ton of button smashing during cutscene in slow motion.- For overall presentation quality: Small detail in the environment may proves to be raw and very under polished (even at max settings.) But the voice lines as well as the interactions between our couple in the game tend to make you giggle and care less about these picky dissatisfactions.			",115,3,0,4,1,0,5

A basic but adequate upgrade and magic system make this a really good game to have in your library and when its on sale you cannot go wrong with a fine game like this at all.and that elf is so damn sexy i dare you not to keep changing your camera view as you perv away at her fine♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hunted: The Demon’s Forge is a linear third-person adventure game featuring sword & shield combat combined with cover-based archery sections. Production values are high – voice-acting, music, and graphics quality (Unreal 3) are good – but can’t make up for how boring the game becomes. Travel by corridor, enter an arena, fight a horde of enemies, rinse, repeat. There are a few side-dungeons and puzzles which add much-needed variety (and are well-designed). The story is your standard snarky-adventurers-battle-orcs affair, but it never goes into too much depth, almost as though it’s only there as an excuse for the gameplay. Never a good sign. Oh, and if bikini warriors are something you like, one of the player-characters easily qualifies. If that’s the kind of thing that annoys you, well, prepare to be annoyed.Designed to be “king of co-op games,” co-op unfortunately doesn’t work since Gamespy was shut down. I’ve read in the forums that third-party apps will still enable cooperative play, but this seems hit-or-miss, and I haven’t tested it myself. Played solo, the campaign works well enough; your companion has plenty of health (though not invincible), and if powers are used consistently, the combat is easy. There is one tomb that bugs unless you play as the elf (as I discovered), and you can only switch between characters at specified points, and not at will (something that other co-op games manage without trouble). Magic feels a little cumbersome to use. Select the desired power using numbers 1-4 on your keyboard, and press Q to use the selected power. Why not have the number keys also use the power? It’s an extra key-stroke that isn’t appreciated in the heat of combat. There’s a rudimentary skill set and level-up system, but I collected so many points that upgrading was never something I thought much about.Hunted: The Demon’s Forge is easily a $20 game if everything works as advertised. That it is for sale at a list price of $5 indicates to me that Bethesda is aware of the issues but can’t be bothered to fix them, so the game is sold at a perpetual 75% discount. Worth a purchase IF you can get the co-op to work. For most of us, though, the time of Hunted: The Demon’s Forge has passed, and it’s not worth the asking price. Get it as cheap as possible if it tempts you, but be prepared to quickly move on to something else.Total size on my hard drive: 11GBNote about the final boss: The archer-player needs to shoot the boss in the heart, while the sword & shield player protects the archer from spawning enemies. When the heart-bar is depleted, the archer-player needs to shoot the enemy spawns, while the sword & shield player pushes on some columns. This will need to be done three or four times. Played in co-op, I don’t doubt it would work fine. Played solo, there is no way to issue orders to your companion about what (s)he should target, making victory rely on luck as much as skill. Frustrating.			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												Hunted: The Demon’s Forge is a fun Co-op play. Online is dead (RIP GameSpy), but playing over LAN works pretty well.  The gameplay is your standard Hack n Slash, but when you switch to a range weapon the gameplay changes to a Gears of War style cover shooter. I really enjoyed that mechanic, giving you options in each battle. Granted one character is far better at ranged, and the other is a tank in melee. The enemies drop weapons for loot. You can carry three weapons at any given time as well as a shield, and armor. Each weapon has a few few basic stats, damage, durability, and item quality. Each character has weapon and battle magic powers wich can be leveled up, I wish this system was a little more in depth. The foes you encounter are your standard LOTR variety with different names. During the campaign you retrieve gold wich unlocks resources that you can use in Crucible mode. Crucible is basically a user created Horde Mode. It adds to the replay value, and is a fairly decent level creator. I only wish it was possible to share your levels over Steam. The music is really on point with some of your standard medieval gothic tracks, think of the soundtrack from Conan the Barbarian and you get the idea.

												Doesn't even work right out of the box now that Game Spy is offline.  Allegedly setting an outbound firewall rule will allow the game to play (single player only) but this was not the case for me, nor will I disable my network connection to play a game.   Wish Steam would have either patched it, provided a HowTo, or warned me before I wasted my time downloading and installing it.  If I had purchased it instead of getting it as part of a pack last summer, I'd be very angry.Too bad, looks like it might have been a fun game.			",36,0,0,4,1,0,8

												A dark fantasy hack-and-slash spin on Resident Evil 5 by inXile (The Bard's Tale, Wasteland series), successfully integrating featherweight RPG mechanics, cover shooting and a rogue-like weapon loot system with the classic co-op friendly* format. Add in a gorgeous Elven rogue, solid art direction and a fabulous voice cast (Lucy Lawless, Laura Bailey et al.) and you have Hunted: The Demon’s Forge, an unfairly scrutinized hidden gem abandoned much too soon; supremely underrated in most aspects.*Will require a third party tool these days due to termination of all GameSpy services.

												This game have one of the best coop AI that I have seen. It's not perfect, as will get silly in certain areas, but it helps you in combat without taking over or being a burden. Just the right proportion.Keep in mind that you will be playing with mercenaries that have a funny relationship. So, they are anti-heroes and will be silly with each other. Some players might get disappointed because is not another ""the chosen one save the world"" type of story.And the locations will be destroyed and villagers will be suffering. Because evil is doing its part. Yet, great scenery!Plenty of secret areas to find, and the game takes long to finish. Plus, you can make your own maps.One more thing, despide you carry only 2 types of weapons (a melee and one range), you have 3 different skills for each character, and 3 attack magics that can also be used to buff your coop partner.It's saddess me the though that I won't see a sequel for this fun game.

												If you plan to solo play this, it's a boring game - you'll find yourself running from point A to point B while blindly smashing the attack button when in combat. But this game was designed for the co-op mode, so I would imagine this game to be fun to co-op with a friend, but in my experience any game with a co-op mode is fun to play, even those games that are terrible (e.g. this game).

												An entertaining dark fantasy hack and slash shoot em up. You follow a duo of mercenaries - E'lara, a rather scantily dressed elf with sick bow skills, and Caddoc, a buff-looking guy who loves to fight upclose and personal. Each one has their own style of fighting, with E'lara having a preference for ranged combat and Caddoc melee combat. The game lets you swap between them, so you can try them both out at various times and eventually settle for whoever you enjoy playing as more. Only thing I don't quite understand is that you can't swap between them whenever you want. Usually in games of this nature, the swapping is done at the press of a button, but here you can only swap when interacting with specific shrines.The combat is pretty fun and is very abundant. There is some variety in enemies and challenges presented and some fairly interesting boss fights. As you get through the game, you can learn some special skills too by unlocking them with magical crystals that you find in your travels. E'lara mostly has different types of arrows (exploding arrow, freezing arrow, and armour-piercing arrow), and Caddoc has brawl specials (powerful ramming, rage mode, and levitating enemies), and in addition to that, both can also learn various forms of magical spells.The story is ok, and though there are a few twists and turns present, it's mostly on the background and just gets you travelling between the locations and change the scenery. So if you're looking for a narrative-driven experience, you might be disappointed, but if you enjoy some fast-paced fighting with plenty of one-liners and witty dialogue exchanges, then you should enjoy it. Visuals, presentation, music, and voice acting are all pretty good and do their job. I think the whole setting is done pretty well. It's what you'd expect from a dark fantasy. Lots of grim-looking and ominous locations and horrendous (in a good way) creature designs. The levels are straight-forward and linear for the most part. There are occasionally interesting puzzles thrown in as well which change the pace a bit and get you exploring the area a bit.Overall I'd recommend this game. It's a fun way to spend a few hours and unwind. No over-complex mechanics or difficult decisions. Just fight some enemies, listen to witty dialogue, and enjoy the ride.			",267,51,3,33,6,0,17

												Great game.  I discovered it a bit after it had already come out so some might think it would be dated, but the gameplay and graphics hold up.  It quickly became addictive.  Needless to say, the female character you play as part of a team is not hard to look at.  The story line is engaging and the combat style is fun with variations to choose from like range, melee, and magic and a talent system to let you choose what you want to excel at based on preference.

												This game was moderately fun, I suppose. Decent controls, action, fighting style...great co-op, but when Gamespy or whatever it was using to do online work closed down, it's become impossible to play with others online, which honestly was the biggest redeeming factor to this game. If you can play it local Co-op, great, but without the online Co-op it's just average. Forget any memorable story, characters, action, gameplay.. it's forgettable, minus the gameplay which is just ""Decent"", so unfortunately, it's a no-go. There are better co-op action games out there that still work online.			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												Some games manage to slip under the radar, barely noticed because they are low profile or poorly marketed. Such is the case of Hunted: The Demon's Forge. Totally slipped under my radar not even doing a blip in passing. I discovered it only during a Steam sale and then a bunch of reasons pushed me to buy it. First, it was cheap, second it features one of my all time favorite video game female voice actress and then there was curiosity because the whole thing was developed by Brian Fargo's company inXile (and no, the skimpy outfit of the female protagonist was not a factor... well, barely).For those who don't know him, Brian Fargo is the mind behind the Wasteland franchise (most notably the recent Wasteland 2) and the original Fallout games (1 and 2). So when you relate Brian Fargo and PC games the first thing that comes to mind is ""serious isometric hardcore RPG stuff"".How does Hunted: The Demon's Forge fits in this conception? In absolutely no way. Not even close. It's not a RPG (despite featuring a skill tree) and although it could be in some regard qualified as ""hardcore"" it's certainly not isometric... nor serious. The closest description could be third person hack and slash/shooter with a RPG-ish veneer and a side of puzzles.But what it is above all is a fun way to spend time.The game is designed to be played in co-op, although it can perfectly be played in single player with little fuss with an AI handling of your partner OK although not terrific. Additionally to the main story, there are secret objectives, detours that can be found by going sideways. These involve puzzles, sometimes relatively hard ones;  and generally feature rewards that even if not necessary to complete the game can help.Hunted is a simple but fun game. Sure it won't gain any GOTY award nor be remembered as a major game 10 years from now but it makes for a fun diversion. And being fun is always a good thing for a game.			",243,87,0,23,13,2,14

												Two poorly dressed mercenaries attempt to make some money, fail an intelligence test, fight their way past hordes of demons despite the constant distraction of jiggling breasts, a shiny bald head, various phobias, and personality disorders, but in the end, still make no money.It's actually not a terrible game, despite the metacritic score. The current Steam score of around 70% is more fair, I think. And considering its current single-digit price, it's hard not to recommend if it interests you at all.I've only played a few other Inxile games, but they seem to follow a trend: full of heart, mostly-competent technical/artistic merit, but gameplay mechanics balance done by a middle school kid.Granted, it only affects perhaps 20% of the game, but they tend to be the bigger fights, so it can be annoying. Annoyances include:- pixel-perfect aiming, but they give you a circle aiming reticle- enemies tend to move erratically, which is not great combined with the above, plus arrow travel time- a number of enemies have stun-lock or juggling attacks, at which point the only defense is to hope to get lucky with a dodge (no i-frames), or simply use a potion.- ""challenge"" tends to be of the formula: spawn lots of enemies, spawn the strongest enemies, surround the player. Pretty ham-fisted.- a few times, goes for one of the worst action game cardinal sins: unlimited respawning enemies.- literally pitch-black areas sometimes. Gamma adjust option doesn't work; no fix for this, as far as I can tell. Only light source tends to be lighting your weapon on fire, which goes out after you use it too much (at least as E'lara, the elf). Seriously stupid idea.- AI companion seems to go out of their way to deliberately block your path and shots, and even seems to mock you with various voice lines.That said, once you know how to deal with these, it's not so bad, as the two characters are given plenty of skills to use. Your AI-controlled partner seems to have pools of health and mana, so equipping them with skills is actually quite helpful. The infinite spawn segments aren't so great though, depending on the skills you have equipped and the difficulty level. Playing this game on the harder difficulties seems like masochism.It may sound like there's a lot of negative points, but if the game description and screenshots interest you at all, you'll probably like the game just fine. It's just that the gameplay mostly seems to feel like trying to exploit the enemy AI's dumb behavior rather than out-skilling it. Then again, sometimes it can be fun and powerful-feeling to mow down a bunch of enemies.Good points include:- decently long campaign for an action game; took me about 15 hours.- decent replayability; can play through with (or freely switch between) two characters, use different skills, or even the different character/weapon skins (more on that below). Plenty of stuff to look out for, which can improve abilities.- Fairly entertaining banter between the two mercs that reminds of Gimli and Legolas from the LOTR movies.- Surprisingly meaty side quest treasure hunts that are a lot like the newer Tomb Raider side areas, but possibly even bigger. Probably one of the best parts of the game.Final note: This game uses/used GameSpy for multiplayer and DLC redemption. GameSpy was shut down, and so this game has no official multiplayer support, nor can you redeem the pre-order DLC codes if you bought them. However, there are some work-arounds for multiplayer, although they look like a pain. It's also possible to download an existing save that has the DLC enabled, if you wish to play as Seraphine or use one of the other skins. Check the forums for more info.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												25 ROOMS OF HELL.If you didn't know much about Hunted: The Demon's Forge and just went on appearances you'd probably figure it for an outdated RPG. But that misleading assumption is quickly replaced by the realization that this is a hack 'n' slash game, layered with adventure puzzles, third-person shooter mechanics, and only the slightest of RPG elements.This game meets a level of playability and fun that makes it easier to forgive flaws. The uptight “85 and up” crowd won’t want to bother, but the rest of us know they’re missing out on something really solid.			",1115,382,38,118,94,13,163

												A very cool and unique co-op game.  More like a sleeper hit.  Probably didn't do so well since Gamespy shut down and that is what this game used for multiplayer connection.You can however get around this since games with LAN support can use a program like Tunngle to continue playing co-op games no longer supported by Gamespy (again, they need to support Local Area Network [LAN]). It may be a little frustrating for users who are not very familiar with networking but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy.The game is not completely without faults as it will sometimes crash near the end of the level (or the start of a new one) randomly.  This seems to happen mostly if you're playing the game for long periods of time.  Since the game can be bought for cheap (right now on a steam sale for $1.64) you really can't go wrong.The graphics are good, the gameplay plays like a 3rd person hack/slash/shooter.  The controls can feel a little wonky (I used keyboard/mouse) and the user interface could be MUCH better but all in all you get used to it and it's fine.			",496,119,2,61,11,2,20

												I remember this from way back. I have the feeling I rented it from Blockbuster so never got the chance to finish it. Its a pretty cool Dungeon Crawler bought to us by the folks at InXile before Wasteland 2 was a twinkle in their eye.You have 2 characters you can change between at various points who are your meatshield Caddoc and your ranger E`lara. They can both have a mix of upgraded abilites for their main weapons or elemental magic (ice, fire and lightning). The graphics and sound design are suitably gloomy and the banter between the 2 main characters can be quite amusing at times.As you travel throught the environs of the game you can pick up better weapons and armor some of which have added damage such as poison bows or freezing axes. Swapping between bows and melee weapons is a breeze and there is plenty of cover to snipe with your bows when needed.If you like action RPGs then I really cannot recommend this enough. I just bought it for £1.99 on sale, but even at its normal price it is a steal :)Go crack some monster heads today :)			",149,17,2,33,5,0,22

												For $2.49 on sale you can't go wrong with this one if:You like dungeon crawlingYou like being able to play as different characters.You like great visuals with spellcasting and powering up spells even more.You like searching for hidden areas and better equipment.You like solving puzzles and discovering side-quests. You enjoy humorous in-game banter and dialog. You like to play games in stereoscopic 3D. The Unreal engine works great and I can max out the graphics since this came out years ago on PS3. It was probably once a $49.99 game but this game was a hidden gem for me and I'm about halfway through it with 13 hours or so on the clock.. My internet went down so it's only showing around 3 hours.One single complaint - your companion is constantly getting in the way and you have to shove them around A LOT to get where you want to go. Not sure why the AI wasn't programmed to move out of the way of the direction your facing but the companion will follow you into little nooks and dungeon crannies making it a chore to get out. The game grows on you if you give in an honest chance and for $2.49 it's completely worth it even without co-op play.			",231,29,6,32,6,0,11

There are some tactical choices to be made in combat, but otherwise don't expect more than a hack and slash game.I absolutely love that enemies do solid damage, and you can't just run around and soak some hits while fighting. Potions are limited, so how you approach combat is important.My girlfriend and I have been enjoying this for a few hours, and look forward to playing more.Playing Coop makes the game infinitely more enjoyable.- Good voice acting- Higher than normal production value- Moderate skill customization- Amusing banter between characters- 8/10 visuals			",111,5,0,21,17,0,15

Multiplayer allows you to play on LAN also unlike most, if not all, today's game that require Internet connection to play multiplayer. 3. Difficulty settings are perfect. Raise it, if you think you have become expert. 4. You can't just run into enemies and smash them. You will get killed immediately. So approach wisely with using ranged attacks or close combat.5. Create your own maps and play them. Place enemies wherever you want.6. Game is of good length. Played 5 hours and completed Chapter 1 only. Contains 6 chapters. Maybe I played slowly, but still gameplay is of good length. You can replay any level with your friend later on if you like, so replay value is also good.Definitely recommended.			",45,3,0,5,0,0,0

												Fair game, but under the radar--and probably justly so? Hunted: The Demon's Forge is a game that lets you choose (and swap) between melee hack-and-slash or shooter, and employs a smooth combat system and a beautifully textured world. There's a certain thrill factor that makes the game quite enjoyable.However, the game does have some pitfalls: The objectives are very linear. There are a few secrets or side-quests here or there but nothing that actually makes a difference in the long run. Between zones, the transitions get very obvious and repetitive after a while. The storyline is okay at best. The graphics are sweet--but the character depth isn't.			",63,12,2,9,9,0,9

												Hunted is dark and gritty looking, pretty good action adventure that either is a 3rd Person Shooter (playing as the elf girl) or a hack'n'slash (playing as the human guy). The action is straight forward and fun, the levels are huge and varied enough to keep you playing on. Even though there are some issues, that is some graphical glitches and the fact, that Caddock (= the human guy) could have used more varied attacks i.e. combos, I had lots of fun progressing through the game.

												Hunted is a very nice third person fantasy action game. It's not revolutionary but it does what it does very well. Graphics still look very nice. Combat is fluent and entertaining. There are also some light RPG elements to keep things interesting, e.g. character development and loot.I particularly liked that you weren't stuck with one character. You can switch between a ranged and a melee char at checkpoints. The one you didn't pick is controlled by a reasonably competent AI. The frequent voiced-over interactions between these two characters during missions were also quite entertaining and funny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A true sleeper Co-Op game that my dad and I played through. Even though we picked it up on a steam sale it was still a pretty great game with quite the plot twist at the end. Ultimately I wish that more games would have more bow play like this game does.			",46,1,0,8,1,0,13

												Good game. The characters are a bit simple and surely stereotyped. It seams at first that the story is not so good, but it becomes better while playing the game. The gameplay is simple (to say not frustrating like other PC games I have played before). I finished the game in approximately 10 hours. I had much fun playing it. (Note : Works on Windows 10)Bon jeu. Les personnages sont un peu simples et très stéréotypés. À première vue, l'histoire ne semble pas particulièrement intéressante, mais elle le devient au fur et à mesure que nous avançons dans le jeu. Le gameplay est simple (contrairement à d'autres jeux de PC aux contrôles parfois frustants). Le jeu se termine en environ 10 heures. J'ai beaucoup aimé y jouer. Note pour ceux et celles qui jouent au jeu en français : Le doublage n'est vraiment pas à tout casser... (Note : Fonctionne sur Windows 10)			",23,0,0,10,0,0,0

 GoW Fantasy Game	game is really fun reminds me of Gears of War series but you are in a fantasy world and have a sexy elf you can play as :Druns really well on my laptop which makes me even more happy. i can get 60fps maxed so the graphics look really nice only on chapter 2 atm so the story, i can not tell you how good it is but i can tell you up to chapter 2 at my location the story is well made. you run like you do in gears of war and take cover the same way, there is a boss in this game that looks like the big guy you ride in GoW when you are in the locust hive. thats another thing the demons you kill look alot like locust which i find cool but they are more mean and will actually go after you unlike GoW enemies.olist] Graphics: 10 Gameplay: 10 Story: 10 well atleast at the point im at Voice: 6 needs more chatting the 2 main characters use Controls: 5 alittle confusing still Ordered list[/olist] ",354,52,9,83,35,0,52

												A classic dungeon crawl featuring a brutish hack and slasher and a sexy ranged elf DPSer.  I played through the game in single player (took about 17 hours), and I really enjoyed it.  The combat mechanics and power ups were decent, the voice acting was excellent, the characters were genuinely interesting, and the story was also good.  The difficulty was manageable (I died once on Normal) and ramps up nicely with a few battles that require a little thought.  There are the usual secrets and ""lore"" moments for those that like the little details.  It also supports nVidia 3D Vision with a few small tweaks.  Also there are ample opportunities to switch between the players, and the AI is decent.On the negative side, there are issues with the Co-op play.  I did not play co-op so I cant comment directly on that.  Also the lip sync is a little wonky.  Good weapon and armor updates are fairly rare and don't really alter your character's appearance significantly.  Also some of the abilities don't seem very useful.  I would say that I don't feel compelled to do another playthrough.However I paid less than $5 for this one and it was worth every penny. ",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												Hunted Demons Forge is a pretty fun sadly single player linear action rpg. It offers minimal choices in interactions like which character you want to play as, picking up random weapons which may or may not be more powerful and drinking from these fountains that contain silver blood that pretty much gives you temporary god mode and super abilities. **SPOILER WARNING** other than your first interaction dont drink from them ever again, it affects the main story and ending(s). Other than that its a fun tough game to play. If I recall this is one of those sleeper hit titles that sadly didnt get far.Story - Fair and a bit weird at times. Combat - 3rd person over the shoulder Unreal 3 engine based.Weapons - hope you get lucky to find some decent weapons lying around, if not aim for the head or learn to dodge.Score - 7/10			",492,55,16,76,18,0,42

												First thing - coop works, you just need to install hamachi, select LAN, and it runs with no problems.That said, Hunted is one of my favourite games, and a severly underrated title. I have bought it initially for Xbox 360, and completed it later on PC before it was released on steam. It features two very likeable characters, a pretty good story for this kind of game, and runs like the first Gears of War - basically a few nights out moving through dark, atmospheric places. It has very nice optional puzzles and secrets, quite a bit of lore, a dungeon crawling mod so that you have things to do after you've beaten the campaign, and a dungeon creator to make your own challenges. The graphics are uneven, but mostly fine, the skill tree is a bit too simple for my taste but it gets the job done (and your abilities complement the ones of your partner - the archer freezes the enemies for the warior to destroy, etc.), and there isn't a lot of loot but it's all nice and shiny. It is the story, the atmosphere, the cover based gameplay, the funny coop shenanigans, and the two nice protagonists that made me complete the game nearly three times. For me, it's better than LotR: War in the North. I didn't get any noticeable bugs.It is fun both when played solo, and in co-op. It definitely deserves an 8/10, or a 9/10 if played with a friend. Just get hamachi to make it work, it is easy and will take you 20 minutes max. Both me and my gf would love to see a sequel. It's a great game to play with your loved one even if she isn't too keen on games.			",34,3,0,8,2,0,11

												Hunted is a decent action-shooter following the story of two mercenaries, E'lara the elven archer and Caddoc the Swordsman out to make a fortune as their adventure takes them though desolate towns. ruins, dungeons and forests. The gameplay is pretty standard action fare, both characters carry a melee/shield combo and a ranged weapon  and these can be switched on the fly. They also have access to additional magic and skills that can be upgraded as the game progresses via finding crystals. Combat is quite good initially (especially using the bow with E'lara) but does become quite repetitive as you move through the chapters with each enemy encounter being similar to the last. Puzzle's also suffer the same fate. There are a few occasions when some set pieces are thrown in to try and add some variety such as forcing you to run rather than fight or defend an area with a ballista, but these are not enough to make up for the other shortcomings. Overall the gameplay is not bad but not great either. I recommend playing with a friend in co-op if possible as this does make it more enjoyable. Now for the stronger aspects.. Firstly the characters! These two are by far the strongest element of this game. They are entertaining and are permitted some character development as the story unfolds. A particular highlight is the banter between the pair that's littered throughout. The story itself was interesting and kept me playing to the conclusion (of which there are 3 endings) and there was a lot of potential in the world that has been created here, although that potential is never fully tapped into.Overall I still give this game a recommendation and as it can be found online for under £10 is worth a run through for anyone looking for a dark fantasy fix or some co-op action (or both!).Score:Playing Solo 6/10Playing Co-op 7/10			",171,96,0,16,4,1,14

												Takes a lot of effort to get it up and running for co-op play, but it's definitely worth it. I can't say it'd hold my attention as a single player, but it's great fun with a friend! Does require hamachi or tunngle to run properly, and a lot of playing with it to work. If you want to play co-op, don't set the block in your firewall as others recommend to get the game to run. Instead, disable your internet connection until you launch the game and reach the main menu. Alt-tab and re-enable your itnernet connection and set up hamachi/tunngle and you should be able to run a lan game. Worth all the hassle in the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fast-paced action RPG with very challenging enemies, puzzles and dungeon explorations. There isn't much customisation involved and you get to choose only one of the two characters in the game, both are very amusing to play with, and both come with melee and ranged weapons together. I haven't noticed any major bugs or lag issues with the game, and there are plenty of people playing it cooperatively online so you won't be alone. Only problem with the game is that it's awfully linear and the character progression is limited to the game you're playing at that moment, meaning you don't get to keep your character but its saved in the savegame of the host. The game is not worth the launch price but it's quite cheap now and very well made. It uses Unreal Engine, has great voice acting and very fluid and easy controls. No need to hesitate if you're interested in all that with a low price like that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great action adventure game! I highly recommend playing this game with a friend via Evolve (great Tunngle/Hamachi alternative).You can play either two mercenaries: E’lara or Caddoc battling through a dark fantasy world in order to make ends meet. You can level up and specialize your character, so he or she has a unique edge in battle. Besides taking down enemies with bows and arrows or swords and shields you can also use magic on your foes. There are points of the game where you have to solve puzzles and you’re separated with your buddy, so it all relies on teamwork.I don’t see why I shouldn’t recommend this game. I had fun! The UI however is VERY tedious, but that's the result of a multi-platform game - that's the only negative thing really.Peace. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I expected nothing much when I started playing, but I really enjoyed this.Depending on which character you play, this is either a cover-based 3rd person (bow-)shooter or brawler, in a beautiful (if very dark) fantasy setting.Combat is solid, enemy variety is good, and the AI partner is very competent. Visuals and music are great and create a dense atmosphere. The story is good, too, with a couple of  surprising plot twists, and is delivered _very_ well. I found the main charcaters to be very likeable, and the banter between the two is often hilarious.Single player playthrough took about 20 very enjoyable hours.Didn't try co-op or multiplayer, so I can't comment on that.7.5/10  would buy again			",675,270,22,139,67,7,142

												I had never heard of this game and gave it a chance as sale for 2.49 - and I am glad for it. Tried it out at 11 in the evening and could not stop till 5 in the morning (just one more corner, only a quick peek at what comes next, ...). The graphics look really good even for a 2011 game (the dungeon under the city for example feels very natural and has very atmospheric lighting) and the level proportions are right. The music and sound effects are absolutely fitting and the dialogue between the two characters is funny and fits to the levels and game situations. And did I mention that you get to turn ugly orc-like creatures into pin cushions with your cynic, half-naked, tattoed, fast-firing elf amazon, while your companion keeps them at bay with broadsword and shield? Well - go get it, then!(Note - I played solo only, cooperative mode is said not to function any longer. No loss imho, AI plays well enough especially if you play the elf and the AI handles the brute as blocker.)			",50,11,0,5,6,0,10

												That was a lot of fun. Sure, it's not going to replace any of the greats, but it's a dungeon crawler with a murder hobo party. Their banter is entertaining, and while the combat is repetative, it's fun, so that didn't really bother me. The only thing that really bothered me was how dark it was a lot of the time. Turning up the gamma makes it look terrible, but sometimes you have to. 7/10.			",187,39,11,14,16,1,9

												First of all, I really like the game. Second of all, I got this as a gift to play CO - OP online as advertized. And the latter is from difficult to do, next to impossible, since the lazy creators of the game's company don't bother to add a patch for 2 frikkin' years now that gamespy has seaced operations, to move to a working service for the online multiplayer co-operative action to function. Therefore, I don't recommend this game, untill this is fixed, which doesn't seem like it's gonna happen any time soon, or at all. Third of all, I have to say that I will stop buying or ask as gifts any game from Bethesda unless they show some courtecy interest about the wellfare of their customers, like me and my friend you bought two copies for 40$ and didn't got delivered the fun he and I was supposed to have.

												I'm having so much with this game. Sure, it has its flaws, but the gameplay is fun and the loot and hidden areas/items give me incentive to keep playing. It's quite addictive. The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen but they get the job done (they can be very moody) and areas show enough detail and variation to keep things fresh. The main characters are a bit dull though, which is a shame. I enjoy playing with the elf more than with the human, but I'm sure the game was meant to be played with the elf as well as the human, so I guess that's a (small) flaw (I don't mind actually). The loot is random and there isn't a whole lot of great items but it's a great feeling once you find a better weapon. Also, rescueing people is a cool idea and I'd like to see more games implement this (where you actually have to shoot the ropes to save them and not just press a button to automatically save them). Cool story as well ! A solid 80/100 for me. Is it worth €50 ? No. €25-30 ? Yes ![Rating: 82/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are so few good co-op games and this one was surprisingly fun!Granted, there are a few problems and you need to stick with it for a little to get to the point where you are comfortable with the awkward combat system. The grafics are nothing special and neither is the story. But the voice acting is amazing and the banter between the two main characters made me crack up so hard my belly hurt (; The two characters are carrying the game and are fantastic. The environments are varied and the way the two of them compliment each other in combat is really well done. The creepy quest giver and the ominous substance which you have the choice to take and make your life easier or leave becaus eyou do not trust it (like me), actually manages to give some weight to the story. It took me a few tries to get into this with my partner, but once we were hooked this was a stunning game with lots of variety and some not terrible puzzles and dungeons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am very pleasantly surprised by this game. So much so, that I feel comfortable giving it a positive riview despite the fact that I have not gotten so far into the game.While the graphics were not above average even when it was published, this is only a minor flaw, outshined greatly by the story and character. The two protaganists are fun to listen to interact, and are thankfully not the standard fantasy trope of wild yet wise elf and impulsive yet stoic human. Caddoc (human) and E'lara (elf) almost give the impression of an affectionate married couple, bickering good-naturedly with one another yet always supportive. The characters are flawed, real, and interesting. Few games do character interaction better. The story is darker and grimier than most fantasy, which contrasts nicely with the character's general optimism. The player is given the impression that if the characters were not so, that the darkness would swallow them up.The game does not have heavy RPG elements, but what there is have been done competently. The voice acting is done well.The control scheme leaves a bit to be desired, and navigating menus is clunky. If you enjoy lore scraps in the vein of Dark Souls or Victor Vran, this is the game for you; however, certain 'entries' such as monster lore appear to one-time shots with no way to go back and view after the first time, and it is easy to miss it entirely.Hunted is well worth the purchase, particularly at its current price point.

Would have been better if it were half as long though as the second half becomes a real slog to the finish line. Overall I'd recommend it on sale if you want to kill 10+ hours on some fairly mindless combat.			",542,137,5,91,28,1,54

												This one is a definite no. As others have said there's no online anymore, but we had tunggle set up to use the LAN so I'll consider that a minor issue just mentioning it incase it's more of a problem for others.Even though there's magic, ranged and melee characters are basically stuck in one role. The warriors crossbow sucks, and the elfs melee equally so. Expect to stay in the one role if you're playing that class. There are set points (purple crystals) that you can switch characters. The magic largely sucks too, there are 3 unique spells for each class then 3 they share. During my time playing there were only 2 worth using and the others are just pointless wastes of mana. The warrior only gets 3 different weapon types: Sword which is fastest and weakest, axe which is middle ground, and club which is highest damage but slow. The speed makes more of a difference in my opinion so again 90% of the game with a sword made the combat have almost no variation to it.The systems are super clunky. The enchanted weapons have set amounts of charges, so they'll do really high damage for about a single fight then usually drop to worse damage than unenchanted items. The shields have durability which gets eaten away very quickly with blocking making them feel like they're made of cardboard. Some shields have armor stats with them and there's a single slot for armor (a pauldron of all things) but the game gives no indication of what armor is worth and it seems to make very little difference. Magic can only be leveled at special white cricles but since magic is so bad it feels pointless to limit leveling it up. There are collectables that feel like a chore, like deathstones that gives background story but since you'll care so little about the story these are pointless, people you can save which serve the same purpose, and gold. That's right gold is a freaking collectable! We were picking it up hoping it would help us when we got to buy something but no, it doesn't do anything it, just fills up a bar in your menu. Also you can only hold at most 3 of every potion type, this means you'll constantly alternate between having almost none to being surrounded by potions you can't pick up and have to leave behind to go through the next gate. There are also executions in this game but they are also worthless. The only people you can execute are basically dead anyway, so doing the execution would just waste time when you could've just hit them one more time. This is especially true if you're using a slow weapon.The graphics aren't great. The voice acting isn't either. The dialog is terrible, rather than two mercenary partners they end up sounding like 2 people who are forced to be together by some common goal. They say maybe 3 mildly funny things through the entire story. You'll also constantly pass people standing off the the side talking to themselves in a loop of dialog which adds nothing to the game and gets pretty annoying half way through. The story is trash *Spoilers* Some dragon hunter gets corrupted by sleg (the child of soylent green and mercury), leads some orcs to war and you stop him, bad ending if you drink sleg during any of the survival fights, good if you don't.Lastly, the game is painfully linear. I'm fine with linear games, especially ones that focus on story, but this game basically pushed you through it. Constant sections that are a few feet long at best. There was always a tiny ledge you couldn't climb after you jumped or a door it wouldn't let you go through again that would stop you from back tracking even the slightest bit. The result makes you feel like you're just passing through a bunch of ready checks since you can't proceed through them without your partner there and they're LITTERED throughout every map. This discouraged any attempt to explore since you could rarely go anywhere off the path. The rare exception was the 4 ""Puzzles"" and these are puzzles in the loosest sense. They usually consist of finding something to open a door than solving how to open the door. Then they would end with a skeleton fight. Completing the first 3 lets you do the 4th one and doing the 4th gives each character a weapon. Excluding bosses there are only 3 types of enemies, orcs (wargoth); minotaurs; and skeletons. The orcs would use bows and had one special one that used magic but mostly all enemies are just melee of slight variations (Armor/no armor, sheild/no shield, duel wielding). The boss fights are terrible too, for example one is a spider you just run from until you reach a balista and shoot a rock so it falls on it, and you're done.P.S. this game glitches too. The last boss involves pushing down pillars that heal him whenever he tries to use them. We could easily have done this but it took about 4-5 tries because the game refused to let me push them down. Some animations bug. I tried pushing a cart and my character looked sideways instead so it didn't give me the push button mash prompt. When I finished a melee chain I would sometimes teleport to the other side of the enemy I was fighting. The most common glitch was with the door based ready checks. One person lifts the door and the other goes and helps lift it the rest of the way, but maybe 30-40% of the time one of us would move into position like we were going to lift it but wouldn't, then they'd just stand like that for a while until they set the door back down and we could try again.All in all this game isn't worth it in my opinion. I got it on sale and only payed $3 for 2 copies of the game, but there are so many problems with it it's ridiculous. You won't be missing anything if you skip this one.			",141,15,0,21,16,0,11

												The key to enjoying Hunted: The Demon's Forge is playing with an Xbox controller. I found the keyboard controls a little miserable. At the time I didn't own a controller and the bad experience with keys and mouse colored my opinions of the game unfairly.  The gameplay is fast-paced and the streamlined upgrade system is refreshing. Levels flow well and the hidden dungeons are a lot of fun.I'm sure the co-op is good, but I wouldn't know. So far I've squeezed a fair amount of enjoyment being Caddoc in the single player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had this game in my list for quite a while now and finally decided I'd give it a try today..except I couldn't even get past the splash screens that the game starts with, so, after validating my files, trying 10 times in vain and checking the internet, I've stumbled upon the 'problem' ;Multiplayer support was originally provided by Gamespy, which shut down on May 31, 2014.  As a result, Hunted: The Demon's Forge can crash or freeze while it is searching for the Gamespy servers and waiting for them to respond.The workaround which allows the game launch requires that players temporarily disable their internet connection before starting Hunted: The Demon's Forge.  Once players have access to the main menu of the game, they may re-enable their internet connection. And as thus, the game is rendered unplayable because I'll be damned to throw out my internet even if just for a minimum amount of time, and if, after all those years, this still isn't fixed, I doubt it will and as thus can be discarded.-1/10			",155,24,0,37,23,1,22

												Although I've never played a 'Souls' game, I have seen videos and watched it being played. This game seems like a very lite version of the Souls game; dodge, roll, strike, move in and out. It's a fun experience and fairly challenging as well. I played the game solo and had fun but it can be played co-op and I imagine that is the ideal way to play. I can see this being a very fun coop play through. While the combat is fun, the magic surprised me the most. Chucking fireball grenades is immensely satisfying when you take out an entire group of enemies. There's some support spells as well, so it mixes things up pretty well.The game can get a bit on the repetitive side, but I think that was due to me playing it in extended sessions. My playtime (8 hrs) could have easily been doubled if I had done some exploring and done some of the optional quests. There's more content to this game than I was expecting. If you don't do any side stuff like myself, the game is pretty linear, which I don't mind, but is worth noting.I bought it for $5 and am pretty happy with that purchase. If you can grab it around that price or even a little higher, I would certainly say it's worth it.P.S. - Don't drink the Sleg!!!			",315,121,0,22,8,2,8

												I can't remember when I bought this game, but I hope I didn't pay that much for the privilege. At best I can say it's an unexceptional brawler. It lacks any and all flair; it's all characterless and generic grimdark fantasy, with a 'roid-pumped hero and unnaturally buxom heroine as the leads whose main goals in life seems to be taking all the obviously wrong and bad choices that life throws at them. The combat is unexciting, with a lack of interesting combos and sluggish movement that drains all the energy from the fights. Fortunately, the enemy AI is equally as moribund. Unfortunately, your AI partner isn't any better, rarely backing you up and far more often just getting in your way. Simply navigating the level is a chore because your team-mate is constantly in your way. The game was obviously intended to be played as in co-op and little was done to make the single-player more entertaining. Even taking into consideration its age - the game was released in 2011 - Hunted fails to impress with its graphics either; it looks like a game from 2005. It's a dull, unexciting game in every respect and not in the least bit fun. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game. Everything I heard about it was mediocre, and while I can't really disagree, the game was enjoyable all the way through. The graphics are not the greatest. but the texture work in this game is actually rather impressive at times. The music and sound are well-done too, although I had a strange bug where the sound effects (not voice) were WAY louder than everything else. The sarcastic dialog back and forth between the characters was pretty hilarious at times.The gameplay was very frustrating at times though. When you get hit by enemies, they stunlock you for a decent amount of time, making it almost guaranteed that they'll hit you again. In parts with a lot of fast-moving enemies, it is entirely possible to get more or less trapped by a group of 3 enemies. It is extremely frustrating at times. The boss fight with the dragon was particularly bad.Speaking of boss fights, a lot of the ones you encounter throughout the game will come back many times over in future battles. It's kind of a cheap mechanic.Controls work pretty well, but if you play as E'lara, sometimes it can really seem like the bow aiming is punishingly difficult. Not that it's hard to aim, but that you'll be aimed dead-on in close range, and miss over and over and over and over. It's particularly noticeable against the stupid little spider enemies, which by the way will demolish E'lara.The AI is absolutely horrible, too. I played mostly as E'lara, and the AI-controlled Caddoc would refuse to engage tough enemies with melee, so they would chase me down and destroy me. Also, he would repeatedly run ahead and smash open the enchanted weapon cases, so I couldn't get the weapon inside. I understand that he needs weapons too, but it would be nice to have the choice in my hands.The little events where you and your partner both have to hit a button and ""traverse"" an area, such as opening a door or jumping over a pit, are incredibly arbitrary and stupid. For the most part it's not a big deal, but the first few times you miss an explorable area because you can't backtrack will annoy you.The game is decent overall. Definitely has its problems, but if you're looking for a co-op adventure, you can pick this up for cheap enough now that it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was in the business of finding a fantasy RPG coop game to play with my gf.I was able to successfully get local coop (through LAN) to work. Others who are trying this will need to be in the same network, of course, and you will also need to ensure you have disabled your Windows Firewall and/or Firewall (or instead of disabling, to allow the game access to go through it).The game was fun for us for the most part, but we have not played it in awhile since the last time we played. We also have not completed and beat the game yet. The game becomes more difficult to survive the further you get (naturally), so you need you and your partner to be familiar with the controls (which have been ported over from console, unfortunatly).So, the game <i> IS </i> fun (for us and perhaps you) <i> as </i> you are playing. Once you stop playing, go to bed, and wake up the next day, you may think of how fun the game is and want to play it soon again with your gf, but after a few days pass, you may forget this title a little bit. Later, though, it may pop back in your head and you might wish to pick it up again to finish it.But keep in mind, if you decide to purchase this game, you will probabably have difficulty connecting to people outside of your house/LAN. I had nothing worse than simple troubles trying to connect via LAN to play with with my gf, though, and it was fun while it lasted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So this is basically Gears of Dungeons & dragons.if you like action games, great shooting mechanics, decent melee (i honestly just stink at it i think) Ive only played Caddoc once, I prefer the Elf as using the bow is really tight knit, controls are good. the Setting, I think is really good. I especially like the  first level, after the tutorial. Speaking of which, the action is constant, you may spend a mere 45 seconds checking corners and and looking for secrets. the inbetween scenes of levels are seemless, to me at least. cutscene to game, load times are super short, good auto save. on top of that, the partner A.i. is the worst ever. I mean so far hes only taken one thing from a weapon rack. I dont even know what it was. since that moment i got worried about it but hes never done it since. anyways...look mates. the game is flippin 5 dollars. and 2 hours is more than enough time to decide if youll play it or refund it. You have so little to lose here an a great solid action game to gain.			",144,2,0,19,3,0,2

												I really like fantasy/medieval styled games, they just are so right to me and I had never heard of this game until I saw it in my que one day. I looked at it and decided to buy it with my brother cause it looked sick. It's awesome. Co-op makes the game super enjoyable, even though it doesn't work sometimes, but yeah. The combat isn't repetitive, just difficult with lots of enemies. For some reason the game has really big difficulty spikes that make you hurt until finally you figured out how to deal with it. Once you get how te game works and how to counter the different enemie, you are all set. The ranged combat plays almost like resident evil revelations, just the way the movement and camera works, and melee combat is similar to darksouls. It is definitly worth the $6 or whatever it's and is quite fun to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review needs to be written because everyone seems to love it and I bought & got screwed merely because of all the positive ones.1. This is a terrible console port and the controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't let anyone tell you differently.2. The animations are clunky and melee hitboxes are♥♥♥♥♥♥(as in all terrible console ports).3. The characters are, quite contrary to what some of the reviewers are telling you, one sided and boring4. !!!!!!!! THE CO-OP DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT HAMACHI/TUNNGLE SINCE THE GAMESPY SERVICE THAT IS REQUIRED  TO USE IT NO LONGER EXISTS (thus you should consider acquiring this game via a  CERTAIN BUCCANEER BAY PAGE if you want to play it for co-op, because the official way simply does not work).I've had my share of flawed gems in my life time. This one isn't one. I actually bothered to write a review on how terrible it is- I got it on a huge discount and I still feel like I got screwed.Also everyone involved into not telling other people what this game really is and that the service for co-op isn't down- ♥♥♥♥ you.

												5/10The Good:This is a very beautiful game. The graphics are very pleasing for the characters and the architecture. The level designers should be given top marks. There are lots of secrets to explore and find along with plenty of change of scenery and triggers along the way so that each enemy encounter is different, and exciting. The design of the game is really quite nice from the skill system, and how you upgrade them to a solid quick combat moving from ranged to melee with ease.The Bad:Who ever did the lightning did a terrible job, there are huge areas of the game that have zero lighting at all so you just bump against walls and hope you find your way through, even with gamma turned all the way to the top. There is an a ton of bugs that I encountered in my 2-3 hour play time which was mostly pertaining to my companion not staying with me and getting stuck on terrain or other parts.. and just stood there.  The ranged combat system is working nicely except the DPI is set to super low and it's very hard to get a viable headshot if you are manually shooting. The melee combat system is pretty much useless because blocking is nearly impossible due to no lock on system or it does not allow you to back pedal while blocking to reposition for proper blocking. If you are holding right click to block, and press S to attempt to back up to face the enemy properly, you instead turn and walk away from them, showing your back, giving them easy hits.The design is great, the graphics are great, the level design is great.Lighting is poor, lots of bugs, combat system is poor.5/10 Would not reccomend.

												Thankfully Steam finally put up a DO NOT RECOMMEND.  Matt (Protocol) and I were determined to like this game, but it simply is not possible.I recommend avoiding this game.  The players are underpowered, the gameplay is a mix of confusing and annoying.  I jumped the gun buying this one so I'd have a coop game to play but what a waste of money.  Had I known ahead of time I wouldn't have spent $5 on this dog.  The game has lost track of our coop progress. it doesn't seem to save when you customize your toons so unless you live to the next save point , so if you die you have to re-customize over and over.  The bow takes way too many shots to handle even yard trash mobs, even if you get in a good % of head shots.  The warrior is just a joke as far as tanking ability which makes it almost impossible to do anything more than hide and hit anythin gthat comes too close to the archer.  Ask Protocal about the crashing too!Terrible, terrible game.			",195,21,2,36,10,0,44

The whole selling point of the game was this 'Co-op' mode wich the game does next to nothing to support either in finding you a person to adventure with, to even talking to them on the microphone, not even a chat system! This is 2011 people, not 1991. No ability to jump ( so no turning around and goin back to look for stuff ) No inventory, no character customization beyond VERY outdated 3 tiered skill trees.

												ВНЕЗАПНО годное кинцо от Беседки!  3Д-экшон суть такова... Пользователь может играть нимфоманкой эльфийкой и хумансом недоумком. Если пользователь играет эльфийкой, то эльфийка с эпическими сиськами и соблазнительным попешником в обтягивающих кожаных бронетрусиках. Если за хуманса, то суровая лысина и смищные реплики. Подземелья, руны и деревяные домики, монстры набигают. Можно фапать на эльфийку и озабоченную бестыжую магичку в няшном наряде из местного сексшопа. Я джва года хотел такую игру!Батя грит малаца, хорошо зделоли!			",607,198,27,161,98,13,162

												I remember having fun with this game a while back with a friend, so I picked it up.  That was a mistake.The melee combat is awkward and the shooting just isn't satisfying.  Play LOTR: War in the North instead if you want fun fantasy co-op, and play any other cover-based shooter if that's what you're going for.It does get points for its dark fantasy aesthetic though.

												This is one of those games I didn't finish. Lots of potential, bad execution.For a game that is better enjoyed with co-op, trying to connect to another player was laborious and required some router fiddlying that shouldn't be needed.The world felt quite generic and I just didn't get sucked into the story.

												good idea, shoddy execution. I had hoped this game would get better with time / work but it seemed to be abandoned right out of the gate almost, inXile have shown they can do much better and I would recommend you go get one of their other titles such as wasteland 2 which shows thissadly the massive amount of promise that this showed just didn't eventuate, story wasn't bad and characters at least were somewhat interesting gameplay was horribly boring and repetetive for what I played of it			",419,82,0,88,32,3,82

												The game fails to get past the main menu on my gaming desktop & laptop. It just crashes, hours on forums looking for a resolution yield no results. Had to run the game on one of my older rigs.Steam falsely lists this game as Co-op. However the GameSpy servers that hosted this no longer exist, so co-op does not function, even local LAN. This is unfortunate, could have been a fun game… This just goes to show steams quality control has degraded over the years…Buyers beware. ",77,13,1,2,2,0,4

												Hunted is pretty much the high-fantasy equivalent of a corridor shooter. Kill everything in the room, rinse, repeat. You'd think that a game with plenty of action elements would have good combat mechanics right? Nope. Good luck fighting in melee without floundering around like a cocaine addicted monkey. The story is generic for the genre. Bad guys appear and do bad guy things. Brute Male Protagonist A and Catty Female Protagonist B go on epic quest to horribly murder bad guys. I gotta admit though, I enjoyed some of the banter between the two playable characters. But even comraderie doesn't stop the game from being sub-par.			",55,2,0,11,1,0,4

												From the trailers, this looks like an intriguing game. However, do not get sucked in like I did. The game is ment to be played in co-op, because playing solo will just be a frustrating experience due to the lack of intelligence in your AI companion. Playing co-op makes it a bit more enjoyable, save for the enemy AI being dumb.4/10 solo, 5/10 co-op.			",22,3,6,11,2,1,4

												Hunted: The Demon's Forge is not a terrible game. It's just not a very good one either.Even with the things that it does right, I cannot bring myself to recommend this title at it's price point when there are far better games for equal or less money.Save your money and buy something better. Hunted: The Demon's Forge is nothing to write home about and it's not worth your money when there are so many other fantastic titles out there.			",143,26,2,21,11,0,30

												I might play it more to give it a more well-rounded review, but my first 20 minutes yielded:Extremely shallow western-fantasy tripe with butt ugly, listless art direction and music.  The dialogue was very amateur western-fantasy tripe with nothing but freshman snark upon snark (read: may be fun/funny for those whose primary language isn't English). The engine feels cobbled together.  Vsync doens't work correctly.  You can hack 'n' slash 'n' shoot, but it's just mashy with super generous lock-on auto-aim.  You can turn the auto-aim off in the options, which would probably be best for m&k players.The only positive I can say is that the overall plot seemed promising in a b-movie kind of way.I know this game was anticipated by many, but I just can't recommend it.Uses Gamespy for multiplayer.

Teal DeerDevelopers: inXile Entertainment Publishers: Besthesda SoftworksInitial release: May 2011Genre: Action, 3rd person shooter(TPS), Co-op#Worth/NotWorth: #MedicoreAndBoringNotWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI have a soft spot in my heart for certain B-tier action titles. Hunted seemed it would be that cheesy generic game that was so dumb it was endearing. Turns out, its just dumb. Hunted is a cooperatively based action adventure. One female elf and one human male. I played it single player and made no attempt to see what it was like with another person. My guess is not much improved.Mechanically, its poor; the ranged combat has trouble with hit detection and the melee combat feels sluggish. Its linear, hallway into arena combat. Rinse an repeat. The voice acting is less than stellar. I swear to you I was less than 20 minutes in and the same audio had repeated 3 times.  Another odd thing is the puzzles sometimes require a specific character to do them but you can't switch on the fly between them. You have to do it at a crystal and the game seems to make a big deal about it. Making some of the puzzles quite literally pointing and telling the AI to do it. The AI is also very fond of getting your way during combat. There is also some dialogue recorded for such instances when the characters end up smushing into one another that is VERY annoying and down right cringey. THE GISTI'm not sure why so many positive reviews. I mean, its at best functional. The story is immediately forgettable and the mechanics work to the degree that if you were to drop a bowling ball from considerable height, its likely to make a loud noise when dropped regardless of what surface it hits; but you probably don't want to hear that noise.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,94,7,96

												A game that doesn't neccesarily do anything terrible but also doesn't shine in any aspect. It can be considered mediocre across the board which ends up resulting in an underwhelming experience overall. While it may have covered a slight need for co-op focused action games back when it was released there are plenty of superior alternatives nowadays that better deserve your time.
