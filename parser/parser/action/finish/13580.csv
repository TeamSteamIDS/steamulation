												BAD Pc Port of a Decent Game...Double Agent is probably my least favorite Splinter Cell game so far (comparing it to 1, Pandora Tomorrow, and Chaos Theory). Still, it is a good game if you can find a way to avoid all the game crashes and glitches. It's too bad the pc port is so terrible. This is the first Splinter Cell pc game that I've had problems with. I made it halfway through the game with about 10 game crashes. Also, sometimes i run into a glitch where an invisible wall randomly appears in front of me to block my path. The safe-unlocking minigame is bugged as well. It took me a while to figure out that you have to have your movespeed set to 2 mouse-wheel ticks higher than the lowest in order to open a safe. Otherwise, the sensitivity is REAL high. If I look past the port problems, there is a good game here. The missions provide decent environment variety. They added in a double-agent objective mechanic where you can choose what objectives to complete. Your decisions affect your trust with the Agency and the Terrorists. This is probably the most stealth-heavy title in the series so far, but it doesn't feel satisfying. Chaos Theory felt a lot better. The visuals also look worse than Chaos Theory for some reason.Unfortunately, I don't think I will finish this game. I decided to quit halfway through because of all the game crashes and the inability to disable intro videos.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is great, I recomend playing it if you haven't already, as it is the best game in the series IMO.Then why don't I recomend this?  Well,  IT'S A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PORT!   It lacks any substantial graphics options even after patching the game through ubi's website, it has inconsistant controler support (I couldn't get either of mine to work but read on forums that people got their's working), keys aren't rebindable, but most importantly,  THE LIGHTING IS BROKEN!  A workaround/fix exists (see below), but that still doesn't change the fact that a stealth game that usualy relies on  light-dark stealth shipped with broken lighting.UPDATE:  I have been informed that you can use an official xbox controller on the game, but not any third party ones (which are both the ones i have).Here's the fix: http://withinwindows.com/blog/2011/07/31/make-splinter-cell-double-agent-playable-on-pc ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PC version of this game is broken as F$%#. I never could get it working. I even have an old XP gaming rig just for older games like this and it still would not run on that one. its a shame because I thought this game was pretty alright when I played it on my 360 a few years ago. Just glad I got this on sale, but sad it was before valve offered refunds.Edit: well I finally got this game ""working"" for the most part. if you have 2 monitors hooked up unplug/disabled the second one if you are getting crashes on start up. even though I was able to play all the missions (except the prologue mission because my game would just crash to desktop after the credits rolled.) this game was still buggy as hell. lighting was broken/missing, it was odd I want to say it was missing shadows in a lot of areas or areas were really bright and washed out yet I was in the ""hidden state"" as the AI patrols passed me even though it was bright as day and I was completely viable. I want to say this was a bug but with Ubi PC ports you never know. other issues I had were lots of random crashes at load screens and whenever I dropped a body I was trying to hide i would take damage from it and any knocked out AI next to where I would drop the body would die from taking damage from the one I just dropped. overall I would still say pass on this game because of how janky and broken this port is on PC.

												I've had my fair share of bad ports on PC, however this one is... well, I can't even describe how bad it is. Let's start at the beginning. While the previous game of the franchise - Chaos Theory (yes, yes, one of the BEST stealth game of all time, however I won't go into further detail now) - got an update (1.05) to run in widescreen resolution (up to 1920*1200), this game did not, so you have to do some .ini tweaking to get the desired one. Since we're at tweaking, there are couple of options in the .ini which aren't even present in game (for tweaking and issue resolving I recommend this page: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Splinter_Cell:_Double_Agent ). Even after you've done everything in your power to make the game a bit better, the shadows frequently flicker or just outright don't appear.Then comes the sound: sometimes after loading the game, the game won't display a huge number of sounds (but you can still hear Sam's breathing, steps and muffled/glitched gun shots).Then comes the loading issue: the save system is abysmal, you have 3 spaces to choose which one you'd like to load from / save to, you can't rename your save files (maybe you can, but I got so frustrated with the menu that I'd rather used the quicksave/load option) and sometimes quicksaves just outright disappeared. This usually happened when the game crashed, I reloaded my game using the ""Continue"" option which did load the quicksave file, however after wanting the quickload said file, I couldn't. What?!I've written about the menu and how bad it is, but why you ask? Sometimes you can't navigate it with the keyboard (moreover it defaults to WASD rather then the arrow keys, but whatever), the mouse is janky and you can't use your mousewheel while browsing your save game files.The OPSAT (Sam's ~infobar on his wrist during the game) is also equally bad, has all the problems just mentioned.""Okay okay, but how's the game play?"" You might ask. Well I could have gotten over all of the above, if only it was good or at least not as bad as I've come to know it. One word: awful. The controls are sometimes unresponsive, Sam just doesn't want to grab that ledge or crawl into a ventilation system no matter hard you try (like he's also fed up with the whole game ""Nope, not gonna do it""). More often than not you get stuck on some random object which can also lead you being discovered or just missing your chance.I might have missed some issues because there's plenty and I didn't write any of it down, all of this is just off the top of my head. A real shame though because it was a great idea executed so poorly...So the question is: would I *recommend* the game? NO. If you like Splinter Cell, just skip it, if you're a ""hardcore"" SC fan, then you might, only might, want to give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[4/10]    As much as I'd love to finish this game, I don't think it will even let me. The game crashes almost every mission for no reason, quick saves will randomly decide to not load, the entire game just freezes during certain loading screens. Also, the game looks awful compared to previous games in the Splinter Cell franchise, which is odd, considering Chaos Theory was absolutely gorgeous for its time, and still holds up to this day. Sometimes shadows won't even render when the level loads, making the whole stealth mechanic extremely awkward. Being a huge fan of Splinter Cell, it's really unfortunate that this game is unstable, to the point of freezing my computer. I could only recommend this game to hardcore fans of the Splinter Cell franchise. I will attempt to finish this game, and if it gets better, I will edit this review. Until then, this still stands.[EDIT]So I've finished the game. The bugs and glitches are still present, no suprise there, but there was one specific bug that stood out amongst others: a game breaking bug. After completing the final mission, a cutscene is supposed to play, the credits should roll, and you are rewarded with a bonus mission. For me, and many others, this didn't happen. The mission would end, and then cut immediately to an overhead scene of the level where you are unable to move and unable to quit properly. (you have to enter the Task Manager and end it manually.) Aside from the awful technical issues, the gameplay and story are some of the best in the Splinter Cell series so far. It takes place shortly after the events of Chaos Theory, in which Sam must pose as a criminal and join a terrorist force in order to destroy them from the inside. The game has a ""trust meter,"" in which you have to complete objectives for the JBA: the terrorist force, and the NSA: the good guys. Due to trust being a factor, the game forces you to enter in these moral gray areas just to keep the trust of the enemy. While in the base, you have the option to research and spy on your allies/enemies to learn more info about them. This information will assist you in traversing the base as well as unlock special items for your missions. As with all previous games in the franchise, it is all based on stealth and using gadgets as well as the enviornment to your advantage to accomplish your objectives. If you've played a SC game in the past, you know what you're getting yourself into from a gameplay perspective. Summary: Splinter Cell: Double Agent is a fantastic game form a gameplay and story perspecrive, but it is hindered by so many techinical issues that it is not worth the purchase, at least not on the PC. I have heard that the concole version is much better, so if you would like to play this game, play it on the Xbox, PS2, or PS3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know that feeling? When you get a game you saw in a LP and which seemed good, a game even your friends and relatives told you was good, and when you finally get your hands on it, you realise it's absolutely terrible?Well that's my Double Agent experience for you.Let's start from the top. The game has an unskippable super long intro, one you must endure every time you boot the game, but also every time you come back to the main menu for some reason. Loading times are attrociously long for a game that old, especially seeing how good and new my computer is.Controls are bad, especially the ""new"" water controls. You also no longer can grab an opponent on stairs, despite the fact you could do it in Chaos Theory, and that game was a lot older. Somehow the elevation slight difference mess up with the prompt.The game is crash heavy. First I had a bug where the game automatically loaded my last save without giving me the main menu, which always crashed said game until it stopped to do that for some weird reason. Then the game crashes every single mission change. In multiple parts missions, it crashes at zone change.The HUD that was so convenient in Chaos Theory is completly gone. The new system is too simplistic and vague and seldom helps.The PC version smells like a terrible port. It's choke full of bugs. If your remap your keys then try to rename your profile, instead of using your normal keyboard, it will change every key you remapped to its new equivalent. For exemple if you put couch on ctrl, you will need to press ctrl to write a C, because the original key for crouch was C... The safe cracking game is horrible because it was obviously designed with a controller in mind. Not only that, but there is a crippling bug which prevents you from moving the gears if you don't raise your speed to max. On some missions, bodies will get detected even if they are hidden and there is no one to detect them. On others, you will get your stats messed up, like one mission dependant kill which will somehow count as two kills... Ennemies see you with their butts. The particuliarly huge offenders being snipers, who are similar to the ones in the very first splinter cell in terms of complete bull. It's especially obvious on some missions where you can watch a video of someone playing on hard and doing something on console, and not get seen, while you do the same thing on easy on PC and will get noticed(Shangai mission, the guard opening the vent when you're hanging from the ledge).Controls are klunky and overall unresponsive. Jumping is particularly awkward, but any kind of ""platforming"" is terrible. You can't rename your saves, so identifying which one is which is a nightmare. Besides the system is so bad if you select a save with your mouse to overwrite, you may overwrite an other save. Only the one in the middle of the list is the one affected, even if you selected the top or bottom one. And yes, this can cause you to delete a very important save. You can no longer use the mouse to press the key on a keypad to enter the code...The list goes on. It's like a HUGE step backward from Chaos Theory. It's just so bad I can't focus on the story... I just can't because every enjoyment I could have is ruined by thoses crippling problems. And like I said, they all seem to share the same origin: Being a terrible console port. It's just a wonderful exemple of ""When Ubisoft started to really decline"". This game is pure pain, and I recommend to anyone to stay clear from it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summed Up: A really awful port to an otherwise pretty fun game. Buy this game on any other platform and you'll have a fun time, but avoid the PC version like the devil.In-Depth: I'll start with the game itself. It's not going to be anyones favourite Splinter Cell as, quite frankly, it's one of the more linear and demanding of the series. Gone is the option to play the game your way and still get the best score if you complete the objectives; now the game ranks you on stealth. It provides penalties to how many guards you knock out/kill, locks you break etc. Meaning you have to basically be a shadow to get the best score. This is a fair idea, but the problem is, the level often throws enemies at you you HAVE to move out the way, or you have to do something ridiculously convoluted to get them to move; which just takes up way too much time.Also introduced is the trust system; a fine line you have to take between both the terrorists and your employers. Alot of people were kind of iffy on this, but I honestly liked the idea. The main issue stems from the fact it's completely pointless. There are enough side objectives and such that you'll honestly always have full trusts 99.9% of the time; even on hard mode where you lose trust more and gain less. If they had made it much more imperitive to the game and maybe had it so you gained rewards from having certain levels, or even something as simple as dialogue change, it might have been  a worthy addition. As it stands, it's just kind of there; a nice idea that dosen't realise it's full potential. As for the core game, it's pretty much Chaos Theoy's mechanics again. This is fine as, in my opion, Chaos Theory really got it right when it came to the stealth aspect and design; n both games have a nice, easy to navigate ingame inventory, the layouts easy to see etc. One major gripe thought is that they changed the stealth meters; as in, they no longer exist. In Chaos Theory, they had two bars which showed your visibility and sound. This was useful as it indicated how alert enemies where sound wise and indicated clearly how sneaky you were being. In this game, you have a light, that's it. It's green when your safe, yellow when not, and red when spotted. The problem is, while it takes into account shadows and does change when enemies are more alert, it never shows how much noise your making; which can be a HUGE problem if your next to an alerted enemy and want to sneak past him QUIETLY. But, that aside, it is for all intents and purposes just more of Chaos Theory sanded down. Back handed as that is, I'm not complaining at  a few more levels.Now for the crux of the problem; the PC Port. The best summary would be 'A glitched up mess that everytime I play I find another'. The most common one is random crashes and lost autosaves, but there are weirder ones. Lost sound, not gaining your bonus equipment, a door not supposed to be there stuck in another door (Yes, that actually happened), do I need to go on? Not to mention graphically, the game just looks off. There is a guide to tweak this on steam, but the fact you HAVE to do this is pretty appaling; without the tweaks, the game looks... well, off, it's hard to explain, kinda like the world is slowly falling away pixel by pixel in the background. There are alot of things in this port that just make it dissapointing, and I really tried to look past them. But the bugs really were the final straw. Avoid the port like the devil, patches have been known to exist, but wether they work is apparently 50/50. Go buy another version of the game elsewhere; you'll be glad you did			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played through Double Agent on DVD shortly after it was released on PC. Somewhere near the end of the game (in one of the Kinsasha-missons), I got stuck. Everytime I tried to load a safe, I would spawn under the map, resulting in Game Over. When I recently discovered Double Agent on Steam, I picked it up. I was hoping that they fixed at least some of the bugs and I would finally be able to play through the story. Unfortunately, I was wrong.The engine is very buggy. Sometimes there's no sound, sometimes you get stuck. Many times, the game will crash when saving or loading. Saves are very unreliable: they either disappear or just don't work.The stealth isn't great. The levels are rarely dark. The sound- and lightmeter of the previous game(s) are replaced by a big light on Sam's back. That light indicates if you're hidden, not hidden, or spotted. It doesn't always work: often you're supposedly hidden, but a guy at the other side of the map can still spot you. Sometimes you're not hidden, but there's a huge snowstorm going on and a guy on the other side of the level still raises the alarm. Especially on ""Hard""-difficulty, not getting spotted is VERY strict.The interface is ported almost straight from the console-version. The inventory and interactions are kinda slow to use, as you have to cycle through them. There is no way to bind different weapons or gadgets to keys on your keyboard. You can't just plug in a controller to play this game. One positive note: you can use the Steam Controller set to KB/M-bindings. That works pretty well. The options in the menu are very limited. You can select ""Normal"" or ""Next-Gen"" graphics, and resolutions up to 1600x1200 pixels. Not all keybindings can be changed. The list of saves is very short, so you have to scroll a lot (and as mentioned before, the saves often don't work).There are some good things about this game, too. The story is arguably the best part of this game. The undercover-aspect is a fresh approach which works well enough. There are some very interesting locations, and they often look well (for their age). And finally, it is more Splinter Cell.If you are a die-hard Splinter Cell-fan, you might be interested to pick this up. But be warned that the experience might be troubled by technical difficulties or can be plain frustrating. If you're new to series or only a casual fan, check out the other games like Chaos Theory of Blacklist.=====TL;DR=====+ Story+ Locations+ Undercover+ Splinter Cell- Interface for controllers- No support for controllers- Unreliable saving / loading- Very limited menus- Many crashes- Many bugs- Average stealth:* It's barely dark* Enemies are super sensitiveConclusion: Double Agent is a very bad port which suffers from many bugs and is often frustrating. Only get if you're a very big Splinter Cell-fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only buy this game if you're ready to spend a lot of time going around bugs and crashes! Playing on genuine Windows 7 64.* On JBA HQ level, one of the door is impossible to open (no action panel), which makes it impossible to get one of the secondary objectives without ""cheating"" using noclip mode.* On most of the Shangai level, the game crashes when you try to save!!* In game, I can only use the quick load function. Trying to load a specific save doesn't work. Workaround: Kill yourself and then the load menu works.* ALT-Tabbing out of the game makes it crash more often than not.* Sometimes the game crashes randomly (thankfully quite rare).* Loads of graphical glitches. Anti-aliasing doesn't seem to work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice otherwise (after ini-file edit to enable better graphics), but loading the save games didn't work for me at all. And this game crashes alot, so frustation level can be high especially when the save games won't work and you have to start beginning of the mission sometimes.I also heard that the best version was only for PS2/Gamecube/Xbox. So if you happen to own one of those systems, might be better option to pick that up instead of this.Oh, and if you run into a bug before the credits roll, change the game resolution to lower like 1024x768 and the ending will trigger.

												A buggy mess that barely runs on PCs. Experience the thrill of editing .ini files and having the game crash on you 75% of the time when loading between levels. I was somehow able to get the game to crash when switching between weapon attachments on the tanker level. And at the very end of the storymode if you've edited the game to support 1920x1080, because it doesn't natively, it will freeze. The only way to get around this is by setting the game to a resolution that it actually supports. How the hell does it not support 1080p. What a piece of trash.Chaos Theory really was the pinnacle in terms of stealth for this series. Instead of keeping the perfect light and sound meters, they decided to just completely remove the sound meter, and attach a traffic light onto Sam's back, to let you know if you're hidden or not. There are plenty of instances in this game where you should be 100% hidden, but because of the terrible lighting system they opted to use for this game, you're not. There is no absolute darkness in this game and for that reason I never found myself having to use the trademark goggles. The Stealth in Double Agent is a joke.Lastly, you can look forward to suffering through a nonsensical barebones story that will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth after it's over. In some alternate reality Ubisoft didn't hire a b-team to crap out this game and instead allowed the Chaos Theory team to port over their version of Double Agent once the 6th gen one was out. This version (the 7th gen) of Double Agent is where Splinter Cell died. Rest in peace.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this in a steam sale with the other Splinter Cell games. After really enjoying Chaos Theory, I had very high hopes for Double Agent.  The first sign of trouble was the game did not support 1080p.  Chaos Theory from two years prior did, but Double Agent did not.  Instead, I was stuck with 720p.  Double Agent suffers from bugs and graphical issues throughout the game.  The lighting engine went from being very powerful and realistic to downright terrible.  The designers also removed fun features such as the sound meter and degrees of light.Everything has been dumbed down in this game.  To make the UI more minimal, the light meter is now green for hidden, yellow for visible, and red for spotted.  Half the time you'll be standing in total darkness and have it still be yellow.The PC port of Double Agent also crashes horribly.  Expect it to freeze up when loading requiring you to restart your computer.  Like previous Splinter Cell games, it lets you save wherever you are in the level.  Unlike previous Splinter Cell games though, there is no way of sorting your saved games.  So expect to have to dig through all your saves when you are trying to find the one you are looking for; there is no way to sort them.Lastly, the gameplay is horrendous.  Half the missions take place during the day and are better played like a first person shooter than a stealth game.  Just shoot everything, don't bother with stealth.

												Anyone who respects the plot and cinematic appeal behind original Sam Fisher will appreciate this installment for its genuine one-of-a-kind qualities. When I was younger, I was astounded at seeing Sam like never before and divulging in his world as a double agent; replaying this game allowed me to fully appreciate the detail that was put into the old Splinter Cell series. This isn’t the new Fisher with a kid’s voice and superman agility; this is Sam at his finest in a world that, in this gamer’s opinion, flawlessly assimilates secret agent movie and video game into one body. While the Steam version of this title isn’t without its programming flaws, I still respect Double Agent as the greatest Splinter Cell and honestly believe it was the first and only of its kind. If anyone is on the fence about playing this game, please give it a chance and, if you do, take the time to EXPLORE EVERYTHING! It’s challenging, but each level is timed just right to do everything you need and more.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After finishing SC: Chaos Theory, I wanted to go for a newer game in the series. I thought it would be so FUN. But... it's such a frustrating game from the very first seconds after you launch it.-You have to manually edit .ini files to get a desirable resolution and fov.-The graphics looks like sh*t compared to Chaos Theory (even tho the animations look more refined). -The night vision and termal vision are so badly done. Visually It's such a downgrade from the previous games.-In-game controls are so dumb, especially the rotating action menus (when you want to pick up a body, use the computer, switch the lights and so on).And then the game crashed. I think I'm done with this one already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Besides being a terrible PC port with crashes, glitches, long loading times, bad performance and requiring you to actually manually download a patch, this game feels very incomplete (it's the 360 version after all) leaving many plot and character development holes, a morality system that barely does anything, and a terrible ending which is just audio over the credits. It's a very unsatisfying game. If you really want to play Double Agent, get the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube version, which was made by the Chaos Theory devs and it actually feels complete. Also you never get dubs in this game. Not recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrible port from console to PC don't get it. Another one of Ubisofts crap buggy ports which you can buy from steam without knowing that it has tons of issues crammed into it.Personal experiences:- UI menu's and mouse controls horrid especially on the 3d map.- Levels of speech between NPC's sound unbalanced on rare occassions.- Game crashes when trying to save the game 'RunTime' error during Shanghai level including saving on automatic checkpoint.- AI bug out and become unresponsive and paths become broken quite often.- Checkpoints to load the next part of the game sometimes do not execute. Including the completion of the final mission.- Intro audio to West Africa mission does not have audio, nor was there any sound effects, ambience enemies voices etc.- Sometimes game will crash between loading screens on missions.- Sometimes game will crash when trying to load a save game.- No support for HD resolution or AA without 3rd party mod - very dated.- Can't load save games from menu sometimes either, just refreshes the load menu.-  No ability to delete save games from the menu.Despite these issues I had fun with the game itself, it ran smooth, the ingame keyboard and mouse controls are responsive but can be a little twitchy at times. If you are really wanting to play the series and don't want to skip this one I reccomend that you download an 100% completion save game so that if there is any major issues preventing you from playing a part of a mission you could just watch the remainder of the mission on youtube then load the next chapter.

												Features-Third Person -Stealth-Story Rich-Long Missions-Some Missions Are Complicated Such as Puzzles -Some Mission you have to find ways to get to the next area to advance-Unlockables-Slight (Very Slight) Replayability-Online CO-OP Mode With Seperate CO-OP Story. (Online Servers are Shutdown)You choose the Pro's and Con's here becuase some people may argue about which is a pro and con and which is'nt.Summery Review: Splinter Cell Double Agent is a Third Person Action Stealth Shooter Released in 2006 as part of the Splinter Cell Series by Ubisoft and Tom Clancy. Splinter Cell Double Agent has alot of improvements from the previous title Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. The first really big Noticable Change from the previous title Chaos Theory is the graphic's. Splinter Cell Double Agents Graphics when it first released were updated from Chaos Theory but games grow old and with age comes with updates. Several of said updates added significant improvements to graphic's and added more options than before. Some other changes include new animations being added, more stability for modern system as well as compability for out-of-date systems (If your computer really is that old). Next thing players are gonna notice right off the bat when first playing Double agent is the length and difficulty of the missions. Double Agent Contains many things that no other splinter cell has one of them being the extreme length of the mission. These missions can be very comparable to the missions we seen in the original splinter cell and may take 40+ minutes to finish. The AI has gotten Tougher in this title and I found it hard to complete missions and playing on the hardest difficulty seemed nearly impossilbe due to the AI's ability to seemlessly shoot you through the wall but that is made but for by it's ""Call of duty Style"" 1-3 Shots results in the player dying. The game will get you through about 11 hours of total gameplay before beating the story I have owned this game for years and always find myself going back and restarting the game just to find that one area I never discovered or could never get into because it always seemed near impossible to get into without getting killed or detected. Replayability is also fun to find those computers that you may have missed or forgotten about with some splinter cell lore contained. One thing Splinter Cell Double Agent Introduced to the splinter cell Series in Unlockables. Unlockables in splinter cell double agent is obtained by completing ""Star Objectives"" which are usually optional objective but completeing them unlocks equipment that give the player an advantage in there undercover black operations within john brown's Army"" Splinter Cell double Agent did include a CO-OP Mode with a Seperate story portrayed by the two characters from the previous splinter cell co-op Story mode but the servers were shutdown and the mode is no longer available. There is a feature in this game exclusive to double agent allowing the player to make story effecting decision's. Such Decisions will effect the Trust Meter between the NSA and the JBA. If the player allows one of these meters to expire the mission fails immediately until the player increases the expired meter. During the Beginning of the Story another Double Agent Exclusive Feature is found in the game which is Snowy enviroments. During the Beginning of the game Sam is given his ""First Real Test"" mission by the JBA and is taked with hijacking a supertanker Somewhere within Northern Russia and the Entire Mission is a Snow Enviroment where the player has to navigate through a blizzard and a white out which can be very difficult even when using the Goggles. Continuing on with the double agent exclusive feature, Underwater enviroments and combat. In Splinter Cell Double Agent we find a feature that is not in any other splinter cell that allows the player to swim around in water and submerge under. During the Mission to Hijack the Supertanker and the Very First mission in Island the player has the ability to surface but will be blocked by frozen water and has to cut through it to reach the surface. If there is an enemy on the ice above the player, the player has the ability to grab through the ice and pull there victim under and stab them to death. If the Victim is on an ajacent Shore by the frozen water or unfrozen even, the player also has the ability to take care of them this by pulling them off the shore and under the water.Conclusion: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a pretty dated game from the Early 2000's but The game introduced alot of feature we see in Splinter Cell Conviction and Blacklist. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Contains many things only seen in Double Agent that I would like to see in future splinter cell titles. The Game has excellent graphics for its age. The difficulty for this game is a bit much when going into the hardest difficulty settings due to the AI being able to shoot through the walls at the player. I recommend this game I think its an excellent title and I think it brought us some great features that we see in modern titles and future titles. Some Exclusive Features such as the ability to use water as cover and a means of killing your enemy id like to see in future titles. I had alot of fun beating it years ago and still do today.

												YES, like every1 says, the port on steam is pretty much unplayable... which is a shame...STAY AWAY from it, find a copy for 360 and a console to play it, or better yet, play the original version (ps2, xbox, gc or wii... which is a completly different game ), that may look less appealing visually than this one, but is WAY BETTER than this beautiful empty shell in every single aspects by a country mile...Otherwise, the game had potential, i truly enjoyed it until i reached Shangai and then JBA part2 where i gave up cuz the game was utterly broken...

												Splinter cell double agent is my favourite game in the series. Its the most fun ive had in a splinter cell game and the most memorable (ive played and beat them all). It tries something new and succeeds at doing so. It has the best story in the series and the only good story imo and the whole trust system is fantastic.The JBA base missions are so intense. This game get too much hate and i feel its a very underrated gem. I just wished the game didn't crash on me so many times this pc version is unstable and the graphics in this version isn't very good, play it on console if you can. Even though i had more fun playing this game then chaos theory i can't say that its better. Chaos theory is the best splinter cell game i just like double agent more because it has its own charm to it that appeals to me more. I gave chaos theory an 8 and i cant score this game higher because it isn't a better game. 8/10 (Great)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been a fan of the Splinter Cell series ever since it was released, and I have played and owned all of the games (except for Conviction - I draw the line with what they did with their DRM). Personally, my favorite game is Splinter Cell Double Agent. Granted it took me a very long time to get it up and running on my computer, (it certainly is buggy - be prepared for that) I still feel that the story line and the unique gameplay experience was the most enjoyable that I had throughout the series.I just wanted to put my two cents in there for those of you who might be considering buying but have been put off from all of the comments across the web. Make no mistake, the game is certainly buggy, but if you look carefully you can find guides to help you get it running. For around $3.50 I would certainly say you should pick it up. If you do, you're in for a pleasant surprise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning! The port is quite bad. Very long loading screens, poor graphic options, some graphical issues (in the tutorial area the bloom was so high I couldn't distinguish walls from floor - the whole thing takes place in a assassin's-creed-like digital while room,) and the game would freeze by the end and refuse to play the final cutscene until I changed my resolution. The controls worked just fine with keyboard and mouse in previous installments but they don't work well in this one. Movement feels clunky and some minigames (like safecracking minigame) have some serious issues.The game itself is a mixed bag. I wish Steam would have a ""maybe"" option for recommendations. There were quite a few frustrations. Instant failures are common and it is not always clear where can you go and were you can't. The levels are still pretty linear with a few exceptions. The theme though. While it is still a Splinter cell game and you will sneak a lot this time you are a double-agent breaking the terrorist cells from inside. The biggest addition is the trust meter of both Terrorists and Echelon. You need to keep both factions satisfied otherwise you loose. It makes the missions more tense as you get multiple objective from both factions (often conflicting with each other) and you have to choose on fly which ones you can afford to skip. This system also rewards skilled players. For instance killing innocents will couse the Echelon to be displeased with you, therefore players ability to stay hidden and avoid contact with the enemy is rewarded. My favourite part of the game ere the semi-sandbox levels which take place in terrorist hideout. In these the player is given a main and sideobjectives from both terrorists and echelon and has around 30 minutes to complete as many of them as possible. It is a great idea which works really well and uses Sam's stealth ability in a very organic way.So yeah, I think it is an interesting game and it is a worth a shot when caught on sale. It does have a lot of issues though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that amuses itslef with crashing every 10 minutes. It's stealth mechanics are so broken that I don't even know where to start.For instance, you're on a map in some antarctic setting, it's a snowstorm. Everything is white, you got a sight range of aproximatly 15 meters and you are wearing white camo clothings. And the enemies still spots you at 50 + meters away, using eyes only.But then again, what did i expect from a stealth game that doesn't even show you the shadows of object? (because clearly the snowstorm problem above could have been solved if i actually clung to the shadows of that tent...)I've honestly spent more time in the loadingscreens than playing the actual game.Don't play it even if you get payed to do it.

												This is probably the only review that I'm writing that I wished had a neutral button. This game has some positive moments and negative moments. Here is the positive things about this game:+ Trust System+ Weapons+ Gadgets/ Gadget Upgrades+ The Shanghai mission+ The CharactersNow here's the negative things about this game:- Crashes a lot- Buggy small areas of an environment- Buggy Gadget Unlockables-  Killing Lambert is the canon choice whether you wanted to do it or not. (I mean I didn't want to shoot him and I wanted to save him but Splinter Cell: Conviction assumed Sam Fisher shot Irving Lambert which in a way screws up the storyline.) All in all, this game looks great graphically but story-wise it kind of fails and flops on its own. Like I said before, I wish there was a neutral button for reviews on games that were meh instead of good or bad. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big fan of the splinter cell series, but this game is actually trash.  I bought it not knowing that the original Xbox version is actually an entirely different game, that is not trash, and can actually run without crashing, unlike this version.  The controls are kinda weird to start, and the lighting system in it doesnt seem to work at all.  Enemies can see through walls in some missions, making 100% stealth quite frustrating.  Sometimes doors (that are entirely necessary to go through to complete the mission) don't work at all, and I had to either restart the mission (if that worked) or wait until an enemy somehow manages to open it.  Other than all the bugs, the storyline isn't actually at all good, so I have no idea how they went from chaos theory to this.  To top it all off, at the end of the game, the game crashes before the last cutscene can play so you don't actually get to know what happens.

												It's a nice game, with good game story. You definitely should play Double Agent, if you played other Splinter Cell games. But it's a collection of bugs. First of all, i had to manually install Directx 9, and 1.02 patch, or the game crashed at start. Often at the loading screen it just crashes, so you have to save your game very often. Even if you save, when the game crashes, sometimes it corrupts the save, and the game files. When this happens, you should verify the game files in Steam. That helps. After the last mission, it freezes. You have to set the resolution to 4:3, to continue the game with the bonus map.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was the precusor of Assassin's Creed: Unity disaster. Good game that was ruined by ham-handed developers. Version for Xbox 360 and PS3 is much better than this mishap, not to mention Xbox and PS2-version.Be ready to accept that you can not achieve 100% stealth rating in the first mission, in Kinshasa and in the last JBA-headquarter mission. It's impossible because of bugs.Multiplayer is not work anymore, the game just crash to desktop.I still like this game though, but only Splinter Cell fans can consider it worth playing and struggling with bugs and bad controls.

Multiplayer is no longer supported(despite clearly stated otherwise on it's store page). If this game wasn't on sale, I would have never bought it, and if I knew what I knew now, I still wouldn't have bought it for 99 cents. If it wasn't so cheap, I would have fought tooth and nail for a refund. Knowing steam, that would have taken me a few hours with their shi*ty support. F*ck Ubisoft. F*ck Uplay. And most of all, f*ck shi*ty ports from consoles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can't recommend this horrible port. It has map that is very hard to control, graphical glitches, even got stuck in the corner at some point. Also had issue where f8 stopped loading my last quicksave, but last straw was when i got into cutscene where major part of the sound disappeared and i could only hear my own footsteps. After that cutscene dude was talking to me but i couldn't hear a thing and after he finished i couldn't do anything. could not control with keyboard or mouse, nothing. Game itself is fun to play, maybe even more fun than chaos theory, but these bugs and glitches ruin whole experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I  care less of the graphics, the gameplay looks good. But I am unable to proceed if this keeps up, please fix this and I'll change my reviews. But considering this is a old game, it might not happen, so therefore my review stays. Sorry, I just prefer a game that I am able to play without issues and normally I wouldnt mind if I am able to change controls on ANYTHING and not get frequent crashes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the wrong version. The screenshots and trailer advertise that it is the same as the Xbox Original version. However once you buy this game you are quickly hit with disappointment as you realize this is the Xbox 360 version. These screenshots and the trailer are false advertising as the PC version of this game is not what they suggest. Very disappointing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You should only get this if you're a hardcore Splinter Cell fan and are willing to look past some major bugs and other flaws.First of all, you'll notice that Sam finally took some diazepam before each mission, so your aim is actually steady for once, and not more unstable than a retired old man hooked up to an iv of sherbert. So the aiming has definitely improved and you can actually take people out silently with one shot without first missing five times, then alerting everyone from here to Timbuktu.At least some of the levels are decent, and some are meh, then you have the reoccuring JBA levels where you are given a timer of about 25 minutes or so, and in that time you can complete objectives for either the NSA, or the JBA. Usually at least one of these objectives is more or less mandatory but if you sit on your♥♥♥♥♥too much and not complete anything, you will lose trust with whichever side you were sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥for.Oh yeah, this game has a trust system, where you can choose which side to stab in the back and then get a different ending and certain cutscenes are different :D! Some objectives in any given level can gain trust for one side and reduce trust for the other, and if you lose too much trust for either side, its game over.Well I guess I should mention those bugs now, well for me anyway; some of the safecracking minigames would just act like my keyboard was dead or something, and it wouldn't react to my input  whatsoever, so I had to skip them (Good thing those particular safes were optional) and lose a staggering amount of trust for the NSA, nearly causing me to get a game over. Also at the ending cutscene where some guys break through the ceiling windows, they just stand around, staring angrily into the next room where Sam was, doing nothing, and the soldiers would just randomly move around and glitch up and down stairs and whatnot (What a fitting, hilarious ending to this glitchy mess of a PC version of a game), so I couldn't actually see the credits and the ending, so I raged out of the game and just watched the ending online.It's kind of ridiculous how the other two earlier Splinter Cell games on steam work just fine but this, the more recent one, is a good bit broken and glitchy. Either way, they should have this♥♥♥♥♥♥patched, period. And not have us get a third party patch or go on their site or whatever, it's just plain annoying.It's not a terrible game but I just wish it wasn't a glitchfest of a PC port and the game did certain things better.This is definitely my least favorite Splinter Cell game, right next to Conviction.

												Some games do not age well. And Splinter Cell: Double agent is a great example of that. There is a lot of things wrong with the game and not many that were done right. I finished the game but there were times I thought about not trying to.Lets start with bad then shall we.The game crashes. And it crashes a lot. And there is no pattern just when will it crash. Sometimes in the middle of the mission, sometimes on mission load, sometimes on intro or outro of the mission. And sometimes it works just fine for an hour or longer. But on other times crashes after ten or fifteen minutes. Quite annoying. And once you decide to exit game, it can freeze itself forcing you to restart the windows in order to regain control.The graphics are aged and it shows. Fact that highest resolution is 1600x900 does not help either. To top that the first mission is really ugly which makes matters even worse at first. You get used to it later on and it's not that bad as the first impression.Audio seems fine most of times. Though lack of subtitles is extremely annoying. This was almost a reason not to play the game. The game does not introduce itself very well. It lacks that modern tutorial/guide style so present everywhere. This is somewhat refreshing but leaves a lot for player to figure out. Some things I've learned on almost ending missions. But the lack of waypoints saying exactly where to go was a bit of back to the roots trip. When you actually had to figure stuff out instead of going after the flashing blip. The story is rather bland. The start of it a disaster I would say. It gets a bit better later on but it is not to original or interesting at that. Mechanically it's not too good as well. The three vision mode, night, head and electronics are pretty much useless. I don't think I used them even once in a meaningful way. Shooting and combat are bad. Most annoying thing being - why the hell is a pistol more accurate than a rifle? I mean really. Grenades are useless as well.As a stealth game it fares much better. Sneaking is satisfying as much as stabbing the guys in the back. Most of the missions can be completed by remaining stealthy which is nice. Safe cracking is a nightmare though. The controls for it are terrible.That should be about time to tell something good about the game. So what it does going for it are pretty well designed levels and missions. They're interesting and challenging. Some of them are approachable by different ways I guess though it's not the same amount of freedom as Hitman games for example. Also the JMB headquarter levels are very nice - especially with the trust mechanic. This is the only part that makes the game worth playing. Time you are given to complete some additional objectives really adds to the double agent atmosphere.Overall I'd say 6/10 if you disregard the crashes. Not really something I can wholeheartedly recommend though I've played worse games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is pretty buggy. From the Kinshasa mission onwards I could not quick load without crashing the game so I just resorted to playing the rest of the game with the invincibility cheat activated. I'm sorry. Elsewise, the game was engaging and entertaining.I thought this was the second game in the series but it turns out it is the third so I'm playing them out of order...The gameplay has changed from the first. Most notably, to me anyway, the contextual action drop down menu in the top corner is gone. Now you have these large action icons that pop up in the middle of the screen when you want to interact with anything. I found this a little annoying and, admittedly, console gamey in a bad way.

												6 out of 10This is the 4th episode in the Splinter Cell series.  You play as Sam Fisher, an operative in 3rd Echelon a top secret NSA black-op outfit.  Its all about stealth, not so much on killing. If you haven't played any Splinter Cell game yet, what?  Where have you been.  These are great games.  However, you should not start with SC Double Agent. This game is for SC veterans who want to do it all.  I started on this game three times.  Only the last time did I bite the bullet and stuck through.  Unfortunately compared to the previous SC games this one is slightly disappointing.  The good: 1. Decent stealth based action.  Shooting is not what its about and the shooting system has never been a strong point in any SC game - it is very static. The bad: 2. Where is the luminosity meter?  Knowing when shadows are enough to cover you is a guessing game. 3. The choices you make have no discernable impact on the game.  Only the cut-scenes. 4. What is the story all about?  Some people want to blow up the USA, but why? 5. The characters are as thin as wet paper.  Sam's daughter is killed off at the start, why? 6. You unlock lots of equipment.  When do you actually get to use it? The ugly: 7. Horrible stability issues.  My game crashed about five times per mission. 8. Character model getting stuck in the scenery. Dam, in retrospect there where not many good points.  Thank goodness the game is relatively short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ubisoft tried changing a few things with this new Splinter Cell.Some changes were good but are changes always accepted?Might changes have ruined the saga?First of all,the story is awesome!First Splinter Cell with a really tensioned story!It's worth your attention!Second of all,the graphics were stunning!I don't how stunning they would be now,but comparing them to the old games' graphics,they were really beautiful!Third of all,the morale system was cool!It really makes you feel like a double agent!On the other hand,Ubisoft has eliminated some of the basics of the franchise in this game.This annoyed very much the old fans and sometimes me!In addition,it's VERY VERY VERY BUGGY and it CRASHES A LOT!It drove me crazy!All in all,if you're very patient and you want to start the playing the series with a more recent game,you can give it a try!

At times you'll be standing in full light and apparently the game will think you are in complete darkness, and at other times you'll be standing in the darkest corner of the room and the game will treat it as if you're in broad daylight.

Worthless piece of junkFirst time I ever make a negative review, but boy does this joke of a game deserve to be thrashed: Awful game mechanics. Terrible graphics. Frequently crashes. Crashes are so severe that they freeze the entire screen and force you to reboot your PC. Makes Scrabble look like Goldeneye 007.I'm not one to resort to strong language in polite society - and I want everybody to know I'm not angry at all as I'm typing this - but seriously: ♥♥♥♥ that game.-10/10Purchase at your own risk and peril.

												As a hardcore Splinter Cell fan growing up with the series I really can say this is the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game ive ever played. The worst port of all time gives you wonderful glitches every 15 minutes that makes you restart the game, not to mention the crap controls, horrific story (old gen version is sooo much better), and level design that instead like other splintercell games would take me about 45 minutes to 90 minutes per mission going through first time, i beat all mission in about 10 to 18 minutes going first time in this game. Even the last mission gave a crappy very easy (on the hardest difficulty) level. The only thing hard about this game is avoiding all glitches and figuring out, that to stop the glitch upon Fisher getting arrested in the last mission and the game freezing, is to turn the resolution to the smallest for the game move forward into the last cutscene. Also every you alt tab it either crashes or takes ♥♥♥♥ing 5 minutes just to load back in. Not recommended 2/10 would not play again.Hell this game was worst than Blacklist and its basic story, and Essientals combined.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourite splinter cell games done wrong (this is the PC port, if you buy this on console its 100% better) Pros  + Sam Fisher+ Being a splinter cell game Cons - A lack of display settings (I had to manually edit .ini)- Sound doesnt work if installed on a HDD thats not your C:\- Locked on 100fps (and I doubt it can handle more than 30)- HORRIBLE controls (I had to physically read all controls to see how to walk)- Animation and Texture glitchesI would say if buy this on sale, but no this is not even good even if its a game given free to you. This is very bad port and even if you have a controller you still have to deal with the 99 other issues it has. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is flawed from Steam because you can't unlock any gadgets to actually use (glitch). Also, safe cracking is glitched and you'll have to be in run mode in order to do it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Splinter Cell is without fail or question my favorite game series by far. I have been a fan since the first SC game which I had on PS2. Sam Fisher is the most efficent and effective spec ops soldier ever created imo. I am definately more into third person gaming and the mix of stealth and action in these games is unmatched. You have so many tools of the trade to utilize. The Double Agent game offers so many choices for Sam, eah leading down a different road to who he is to become by end game. It is definately recommended by me. The story of Sam Fisher just keeps going and he never skips a beat. Great game, great franchise, great hero, another A+ without a doubt...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

General GameplayTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent is a third-person stealth game, where we infiltrate a criminal organization to destroy it from the inside. We have some major choices that change the ending making the story way more interesting than the previous titles.The controls are the same as previous titles.It's way harder to stealth your way through the missions, there's even some missions on daylight, something new in the series.The Manual Saves option where we can save anywhere, make the game less frustrating.Gameplay Rating: 4/5EngineUnreal Engine 2.5Graphics OptionsIt's extremelly disapointing that the game only supports 4:3 resolution, considering the previous title had widescreen support.At least we finally have V-Sync and Anti-Aliasing available, and Windowed mode is back.Graphics QualityGame looks awesome ignoring some ice/water problems, had a good boost in quality overall.They also fixed the animation problems that were present on the previous title.PerformanceGame runs fine, but it's hard to say how well it runs on inferior hardware.Engine Rating: 3/5Overall Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs). If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Double Agent is an ok game, not good, not bad, just ok. The main reason for this is at when it was released for PC and Xbox 360, Ubisoft, for some reason, decided to change the gameplay and story from the PS2 and Xbox game. My advice is to get your hands on the xbox or PS2 version, since this game is a lot different from this one. You have the good old gameplay from Chaos Theory, and the story actually makes sense.

You have a better chance buying a copie for the ps2 than trying to fix this game. Which is what I ended up doing. And underneath all that glitter and make up is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child who just wanted to be like his brother before him. 6/10 - Unless you can withstand it, go for it. P.S.

												I know this game has a bad rap - but, it is actually really quite good.First of all, push through the first level - it's OK, but there is no story going in, and it doesn't really guide you at all.Secondly, the UI sucks, which is a shame, but if you push through, it's worth it. Furthermore, just map all the keys as they usually would be for other SC games, and it helps.Finally, when you crack safes, the mouse-scroll determines how fine-tuned it is (like walking->running), but if it's too fine, the pins don't even move. Looks like a bug, but all you gotta do is scroll.Seriously though, once you get past the first level (also, don't do the training), the story picks up a bit, and it actually is a sweet SC game - I would say better than Conviction, and close to equalling Chaos Theory.Do play.

												I played this game very late compared to its release date, so the very poor graphics threw me out a bit.I always wanted to resume in the series though, and I was not disapointed. I bought a controller for my PC only to play this game. The gameplay is as expected, the environments are varied, the story is interesting. The parts in the base, even if somewhat repetitive, were exciting and playing through the most difficult part filled me with anxiety. Overall, the game was an interesting continuation for the series, even though it didn't have the charm of Chaos Theory (but I played it too late to enjoy the graphics, so there's that). I recommend it, but only if you want to play all the titles of the series. Otherwise, there's no need to: just catch up on the story with the game wiki and play the most recent entries.

												Ubisoft Shanghai developed this game and they don't know how to make a Splinter Cell game.The interface is stupid. No way to tell whether Sam is hidden in the shadows or not. If you think he is covered by the lack of light, expect guards to say, ""Did I just see something?"" and investigate. Hiding in shadows is a feature that's almost non exsistant in this game.The context user interface sucks. It's slow to use because you don't scroll, you control it with your directional keys and to cancel it, you have to press a directional key to go to ""cancel"". Wow Ubisoft Shanghai; very good job.The hud is almost non existant. To go through vents or climb to areas, the game doesn't tell you or let you know that you can and cannot go to some areas. Guards spot Sam too easily and there aren't many areas to hide in. Guards can see through walls and objects. If you use cover and hide behind a wall, or whatever, a guard will keep saying, ""Did I just see something?"" and investigate. WOW! Do they have eyes that have thermal vision?I think the most frustrating thing is, the game is bugged!! In the second visit to JBA's HQ, I encountered 2 bugs;#1 a guard kept seeing a ghost and walking towards it. He actually may have heard a door that kept opening and closing by itself (strange). I won't tell the location in case you haven't played it yet because it's where objectives can be completed but he prevented Sam from getting closer to completing his goals and the only way I could make the spy complete them was to cheat using ghost mode to escape quickly.#2 A door that Sam had to go through was unable to be opened and I had to cheat to get through.Saves are useless because they cannot be loaded unless you load them from the menu. It takes so long for this game to load anything.Oh yeah, goggles are almost useless in this game. Nightvision will never be used because the game is too bright, thermal vision can hardly detect heat and wave vision will be used only sparingly.Because of the bugs and crazy AI, the game is too hard to get 100% on every mission even on Medium. The only ones I got 100% on my first playthrough were the JBA HQ missions.What a waste of time and money making this. It could have been much better if Ubisoft Shanghai wasn't involved. I would still recommend buying this if you don't care for getting the best score for every mission on your first playthrough and just playing it casually.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
