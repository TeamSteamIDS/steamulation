												Incredible and cute puzzle game! You can play it alone but i'd honestly advise to play with a team mate. The coop is much better and funnier. Some puzzles are a bit tough sometimes, but a good teamwork can solve any of them. It's a typical ps3 indie game, original, fun, cute, relaxing. Just awesome if you want to have a great time! I strongly recommend it :)10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Co-op Puzzle games ever to be created (It's up there with Portal 2), true Co-op in which you HAVE to play cooperatively with another person in order to move forward in the puzzle, and alot of time you both will need to be in sync too.The puzzles are challenging and very creative (again, up there with portal 2) and it's a great fun figuring the solution with a friend (especially if you two are on voice chat).The music and Art design are both very good too, the only minor problem i had with this game is that the camera can be abit clunky at times.I'm really enjoying this game right now playing it with a friend, bought it at a retail 14$ for a 2 pack and i think it's fairly worth it, on a sale it's a steal.

												 Ibb & Obb offers an AMAZING art style I have never seen in any other game. The puzzle design is brilliant and difficult if you play it by yourself. (I recommend playing it in co-op mode, it will be easier than you think), It reminds me to Thomas Was Alone with a crazy gravity system (similar to Portal).  The soundtrack is enjoyable, relaxing, soft and makes me want to buy the OST. The gameplay is a little confusing once you start playing, but you'll handle it later. Going back to the puzzles: although the puzzles are brilliant, once you have reached the fourth level, it will give you an instantly headache. The good: ◘ Relaxing, and quiet soundtrack.◘ Amazing art style ◘ Great puzzles ◘ Good gameplay quality (I recommend you to play it with a controller)◘ Amazing PC portThe bad: ◘ THE ♥♥♥♥IN HEADACHES ;_; Ibb & Obb it's a great option to buy if you are looking for a puzzle-platform game.

												TLDR: Great coop puzzle platformer, totally recommended.POSITIVE- It's very easy to get into, and fun to play. - Great minimalistic artstyle, smooth controls and platforming. Good music.- Puzzles are clever and needs team work. - It really needs cooperative work, so will help to improve team communication.- You dont need any controller to play, a keyboard is just enough for both players.- Online coop just works fine just as local coop, so you wont face connection problem when playing with friend through internet.- You can still play it alone but it'll be so hard without friend (so i recommend to get one lol)NEGATIVE-NoneIt's one of the best coop games I've ever seen and totally recommend to pick this up. Full price might be too much, but you can buy it on sale. Suggestion for devs: It would be a great if you guys add a mini extra football mode to just play it casual. I loved kicking those little creatures, it could be a great extra soccer minigame. (maybe a DLC?)			",754,206,27,89,52,8,88

												This game is a delight. It's simple and challenging in just the right amounts. Most of the puzzles stumped us when we first encountered them, but only for a few moments - never long enough to feel frustrating. It's a cycle of 'Whee! Wha...? Aha! Whee!'This isn't something I would normally praise but I also appreciate the lack of a backstory or anything like that. You just drop in and go. It gives the game an admirable clarify of focus: ibb, obb and things that make ibb & obb pop. What more do you need?Good stuff.			",58,22,1,3,9,2,6

												Ibb and Obb is purely a co-op game that has challenging puzzles and the art style is fantastic. This game is for you and a friend to sit down, relax and try beat the puzzles that the game has in stored for you. This game does have a single player feature which requires you to simutaneously control Ibb and Obb. This is very challenging and it can be frustrating at times. The soundtrack is enjoyable and relaxing. I think it suits the game well. I recommend that you buy it and have a go with a friend. Challenge yourselves in this wonderful and beautiful co-op game.

												So I played this for awhile with a friend that bought it for me. It made us feel like idiots, but we had fun. Well, I had fun, my friend got frustrated and ragequit.Some choice quotes from our play session:Friend: I'm too tired to do physics puzzles...Me: Science is super hard, dood. That's why I does arts and voice stuffs.Me: This reminds me of Antichamber, in the sense that I feel like I'm super smart for breezing through like 20% of the game then I get stuck and I'm like ""my brain is a soy nut"".Friend: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!*3 seconds later, I figure it out and do it no problem*Me: ...Friend: Shut up. Just shut up.Me: I said nothing.Friend: I can hear your ♥♥♥♥ing smugness through the microphone.Friend: Wait, hold up, we have to go back for the floating crystal meth.Me: Kay.*Camera won't let us go back*Friend: ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SERIOUSMe: HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAHAHAFriend: gggrrrrrRRRRRRRRRMe: Well, ♥♥♥♥ us, I guess.Friend: Hey, what's that?Me: I think it's a thing.Friend: No♥♥♥♥♥♥ Let's touch it's butt.*We reach it, it's a portal to a hidden stage*Me: Oooh, bonus level!Friend: Awesome, let's do this.Me: Mmk, it doesn't look too hard.*30 minutes of failure later*Me: I think we both need to get checked for brain damage.Friend: THIS IS THE MOST CANCERFriend: Oh, I guess we can get out, there's another portal down here.Me: Yeah, I guess that's the ""I ♥♥♥♥ed up, I thought I was smart enough to do the bonus stage but I'm actually really dumb, please save me"" button.Friend: I can't handle this right now. I need to go play something brainless. Like League.My co-op experience was excellent; I laughed so hard that I had a coughing fit and got a nosebleed.10/10 would ruin a new sweater by bleeding on it again.EDIT: I should probably mention that for maximum co-op enjoyment, you and/or whoever you play it with should be drunk and/or exhausted, the two of you should be voice chatting via teamspeak or discord or whatever you prefer to use and one of you should record or stream it if possible so that your other friends can enjoy your failure and success (but mostly failure).

Almost at the end of the game, there was some lag that made me finish the game by myself. However this game brought me so much fun and challenges due to its entertaining yet quite difficult levels. My only complain about this game is that it should have being longer, having more levels to play, as it was quite short. I recommend this game 100% ",758,185,16,51,51,11,55

												I have a hard time reviewing games tbh. This game, however, is a part of a whimsical challenge attributed to the integrity of the friendship with the person you chooce to play it with. I have decided to play with a person I trust in the game world and not just a random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that wants to tell me what to do. These challenges, with your friend, are overcome through communcation with a mouse-trail of bubbles (or microphone lol) follow by lots of facedesk slamming, frustration, screen cracking, mouse breaking and blood-curdling, nightmarish bouts of war with the developers indirect laughs in your face. It is a brutal level design for each of the areas and even the smartest people lack common sense, I took a while to write this review because, this friend I chose, we both need breaks and a mutual time to participate in this game. It is well worth it and not only does it build onto the integrity of your friendship, but it creates hatred for self; the realization that one is not always the brightest and when you do finally realize something, how hard it is to communicate it.

												Great coop game. Ibb & Obb is a puzzle filled world, where gravity and momentum is what it's all about. Important aspect in this game is teamwork and patience. The moment you die, your partner dies and this can get frustrating at times. The checkpoints however are very fortcoming, allowing you to start almost always from the moment you died. Fun game and beautiful music. If you like the co-op part of Portal 2, I can higly recommend this game.			",911,572,25,173,186,10,133

												One of the most enjoyable co-op experiences I've had. Great puzzles, beautiful art style, cute characters, good music. Get a whole lot of mileage out of a handful of simple gameplay mechanics. You'll find yourself screaming in frustration,  shouting and pumping your fist in triumph, erupting in cathartic laughter as it finally seems you and your friend will accomplish the intricate, difficult procedure you've spent so long figuring out and attempting, only to see your friend make a stupid mistake and ruin everything at the last second.The game only lets you communicate with your online parter by drawing blobby, imprecise lines onscreen. This could be seen as a drawback, but in fact it becomes its own meta-puzzle: how do I explain this detailed series of actions that will involve precise timing, without using any words? You come to develop a rudimentary syntax; you start saying yes and no by moving back and forth and jumping up and down, respectively, or you draw frantic scribbles on the screen to indicate frustration. It's so much more satisfying to solve puzzles this way; you really feel like you've accomplished something beyond the game itself. Of course there are also those infuriating moments when you give up trying to use the in-game language and resort to Steam chat, or even make a phone call and talk through it in real time. And then there are transcendent moments when you and your partner both know exactly what to do without attempting any communication at all. It's also great fun to be a jerk and push your partner over cliffs or into enemies. If I have only one criticism it's that if you're playing with more than one friend (say, one online and one IRL) there's no reliable way to keep track of which levels you've finished with each friend. Like, I beat the game with friend A while I was only a few levels in with friend B, and then I'd start up the game with friend B and some of the puzzles would start to seem mighty familiar, and I couldn't be sure if it was only because I'd already played them with friend A, or because I'd also already played them with friend B. You can reset ALL of your progress, which would have made it easier to kow where I was with friend B if I'd started with them AFTER beating the game with friend A, but I had two games going at the same time so deleting my progress with friend A would have deleted the friend B's progress as well, and it wouldn't have been fair to friend A, either, if we ever decided we wanted to go back and try to get all the crystals on certain levels without replaying all the others. The option for separate play ""sessions"" could have solved this (I always thought having three save slots in the Zelda games was overkill, but now I see the reasoning behind it). But, lengthy complaint notwithstanding, this is really a minor problem.I was lucky enough to get this in a double pack as part of a bundle, but It's definitely worth the full price.

Ibb & Obb		* 7/10No story. No settings. Just Puzzles. End of Review.No, seriously, how can a game like this be so nice? Really, there's no story because it wouldn't change that much, the setting is irrelevant it's more about the art itself. The only thing that matters in this game is cooperative work, and that's because this game is Cooperative only, either local or via servers.So, this is a sidescroll platform and you have to play with a friend as Ibb & Obb. All you have to do is run the two fellas along the world. A world split in half by the ground and you can switch side through occasional portals in order to get past dangers or obstacles. Obviously the other side has an inverted gravity and this is just one of the many little things that you will notice along your runs with your friend as there will be many more obstacles and situations that will require cooperation and teamwork, tight syncronization and creative solution as the more you'll progress through the levels, the more complicated and elaborated the situations will be.The artistic aspect of the game is so minimalistic, but colorful and polished, kind of childish but it's not that kind of dumb childish. It's something relaxing and maybe a bit nostalgic. The music isn't anything outstanding but it's a very nice and light musical accompaniment that will encourage that relax sensation you have while playing this game.I must admit that I kind of get angry when I get stuck with games both for difficulty or unsolvable puzzles, but with Ibb & Obb it just doesn't happen. I stand and wait, I try to figure a solution, a workaround, I discuss with my friend a possible way to pass through and if we just can't figure it out we'll just end our session to resume the next days (with success).+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. This is the only thing that matters: the game is very a very simple sidescrolling platform, where you and your friend help each other to get ahead of obstacles and dangers. That's all. And it's so simple that it's fun. VISUAL ART. As already mentioned this game is very neat, colorful and simple. It's not even 3d and I never felt the need for it to be. MUSIC. A very simple music accompaniment will set a relaxing atmosphere as you proceed the game. The music will never try to get in the way but still can be appreciated.---CONs--- NETCODE. There must be something seriously wrong with the game's netcode because when I play it in coop with my friend sometimes it works just fine, but most of the times it just lags like hell, and sometimes we see each other's character just walk forward until it meets an obstacle or death. The strangest thing is that these situations seems to happen mostly in areas with multiple enemies, and this led us to the point where it was impossible to play from our own places, so I had to grab my laptop and reach my friend to play and finish the game. Unfortunately it seems like no efforts were made for this well known bug. FINAL RIDDLE. The final enemy seems to have just one way to beat it and it relies excessively in timing to the point that we thought that our solution was wrong because simply impossible. Actually we had to do everything in perfect timing not wasting a single step and second. This is not the kind of solution I was expecting considering the rest of the game... LOADING. Well, to say it plainly It wasn't much intuitive to load my progress the very first time, as you always begin your game and you should choose the platforms to jump on to load a map. Problem is: there's nothing written to recognize the map or at least its number, there's just the number of collected gems. MENU SETTINGS. Well, I can understand the fact that there's not much to set, specially for graphics, but maybe it would be useful at the very least the audio levels. Nothing really bad or necessary, but it might be useful.I played this game on these machines:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 ",497,127,12,20,23,4,28

												A very fun platfomer/puzzle co-op game, you run around the world as the two creatures ibb and obb while facing different puzzles and enemies that will keep you intrigued and guessing. Some of the puzzles can deffaintly be a bit challenging, however nothing game breaking. Obviously this game is tailor made for two people to play, however it can be played singleplayer too if you so desire. There's not much else to the game besides the main game, but you won't need much else has there are plenty of secrets and challenges to keep you playing for a while. Pick it up, grab a friend, and you'll have a great time, it's a blast.			",24,13,0,3,1,0,1

												The most co-op fun i have had in an age. The game itself is wonderfully produced and the score is fantastic. Every puzzle rquires you to rely on your co-op partner to solve. Lots of secrets to find too if you are willing to put the extra effort in ( and die 100 times trying ). It has so much charchter though that dying isn't the annoyance you think it would be. It just makes you want to try harder.A must for any fan of co-op games.Straight Up 10/10			",574,272,15,109,98,4,169

												Starts out very interesting and follows a good principle: simple enough that they players always know that they have all the tools they need to solve a puzzle. They also use very frequent mini check points, so you don't have to start a whole level over....But then it digresses into really tricky timing platforming with multiple challenging tasks in timed sequenses and the fun sort of drains off to exaspiration. Put another way, when you know how to solve a puzzle but they needlessly have easy to fail tight timing/positioning things that all have to be done as one continuous chain where either person can fail, and have to do it all over again. I think I'd rather play something else at that point.If you really really love tricky platforming (both pricision/timing and intelectualy challenging), you may really like this game. I liked if for a short while and then hit a point where it felt like a chore and I didn't want to pick it up again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have never wrote a review before but this game is so cute I had to. I bought this in a sale but I would say it's worth the full price as you will have so much fun with it!This is a lovely and fun game to play with a friend or a loved one as it is a fantastic puzzle solver. You will enjoy playing it even more if you use a microphone in multiplayer so you can communicate and help each other to complete the levels. It took me and my boyfriend 20 hours to complete it and to do the achievements. The 'Quality Time' achievement was a lot of fun to do and took a couple of hours to achieve. Both of us enjoyed playing this and had a lot of fun dying throughout due to the varied difficulty. The levels start off simple and as you progress the later ones become frustrating and a little troublesome, but if you keep trying you will eventually finish the game. We both became stuck on some puzzles for awhile but we found the solution by trying many different ways.It is quite interesting and difficult to find all the hidden crystals and obtaining the highest possible score on all levels, but there are guides that can help you with that.In the game you can move your mouse and some paint follows which I thought was an excellent way to show the person you're playing with if you had an idea. Also, when you finish a level ibb & obb do a dance which I found adorable. The whole of the game is bright and colourful, and is worth playing to the end so you can see the final cutscene.After completing the game I decided to craft the badge. The emoticons turned out to be pleasant to use and the backgrounds are cute due to the little characters on them. I will be using these often as they are my favourites.The only negative I'd have to say is that the last few levels were really difficult for me and I made my boyfriend do most of the bits because I couldn't, I probably would have if I practiced over and over. This game involves teamwork if you're playing on multiplayer and patience to finish it. Oh, and another thing, I wish there were more levels!10/10 for ibb & obb! <3			",449,324,6,35,59,5,54

												Ibb and Obb is a fantastic little multiplayer, not too long, and not too short, it  challenges the mind to solve the puzzles.  A fairly relaxing game, there is no time limit, or anything too serious about dying, so you really can ake your time around these levels and get full completion!recommended to anyone who games casually with friends online, the only downside is no singleplayer.

												One of the best made coop games I've played. It's made of intelligent level design, beautifully simple aesthetics, amazing music, and they manage to increase the difficulty level smoothly from more puzzly bits to get you used to the physics and concepts of the game, to a more platformy end that you can manage well with experience.Love it!Definitely a must-play.

												A simple yet challenging game where you decipher puzzles using gravity that flips, foward momentum, various platforms and even the other player. If you want to play a game that keeps your mind ticking over but isn't too intense and doesn't spoon feed you prolonged monologues or hours of cut scenes then this could be for you.This game is really for two players so be sure to have a buddy around.

												I love this game.  Bought the double pack for me and my fiance at Christmas and we just started playing it.  We love it, logging 3.5 hours so far with only two sessions (the first was cut short due to Steam updates, but we couldn't wait to play more!).  This is an adorable co-op game (co-op required, unless you're skilled enough to run both players yourself in local co-op) with fun challenging puzzles.  The annimations are really cute and the level design is excellent.  Every obsticle requires work from both players working together (not idle for carrying). The preferred method of play would be with some one you can talk to either over voice chat or in the same room, communication and teamwork are key.Overall this is a great bonding co-op game and I highly recommend it!

												I just randomly found this game while looking for a co-op or multi-player to play with a friend. I stumbled upon this game and almost immediately knew I wanted to try it. I bought the Friend pack without too much looking into it and my friend and I started playing. I definitely don't regret it and recommend it for anyone who wants a cute, but challenging puzzle game to play with a friend. The colors and background shapes are serene and the soundtrack can be relaxing, but also upbeat. The entire vibe is cute and light, which isn't to say that you won't get frustrated. The puzzles definitely get serious and there are plenty of levels to work through for the price. The double pack is a good deal. There are even little hidden levels to find and conquer. You will want to go through each one more than once to explore and collect everything. I'm only half-way through the game, but I felt the need to stop and write this review because I'm so pleased with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You have ibb & obb, the two characters that use Gravity as a solution to puzzles that they find. I found this interesting since I played it with my sister, we were stuck on one of the puzzles but managed to solve it after 7 minutes xD.It is fun to play Local Game, As im saying, I played with my sister, and we enjoyed it alot.

Very cute and clever puzzle game focusing on gravity and momentum.Several hours of coop gameplay and craziness can definitely be expected. And it really is coop, the teamwork and moments where one of you has about two seconds to live unless your saved by the other make for some intense moments with these cute little blobs.Me and my girlfriend have never yelled so much at each other or a game :D			",181,38,30,20,17,4,31

The game does require a lot of co-op but, with a friend it's very fun, using voice chat would be easier in case people get stuck. The secret levels can be challenging (personal interest, took a couple of hours to do them all), worth playing with a friend who enjoys puzzle co-op, and music is really enjoyable to listen to.

												This game is cute, has great music and challenging puzzles. And you play it in cooperation with a buddy. What's not to like?The puzzles are challenging not only in regard to their solution. They often require both players to perfectly execute several steps in a row, with very little room for error. This can mean that you have already figured out the solution and make it halfway there but then you misstep: Start over. Then, your friend is too fast: Start over. Then, you jump a little too early:  Start over. Then, your friend hits an enemy: You know the drill. Solving a puzzle can get quite tedious.Another issue is savegames: One level took us up to an hour (in the later stages), depending both of how well we could crack the puzzle logic and execute the steps. During that, the game saved our progress just fine; if we failed a puzzle, we'd only be back at its beginning. But whenever we had to quit before finishing the level (or had a desync or just didn't feel like trying the same puzzle for the umpteenth time), the next time, we'd have to restart the whole level from the beginning.Finally, playing it with a friend across the ocean, we found that in-game voice chat was delayed by a few seconds. Maybe it doesn't happen with less of a distance between you and your co-player. For us, it didn't help, what with some puzzles needing near-perfect timing. Towards the end, we thought about using an external solution like Raidcall, but it never came to that.Overall, the game can get quite frustrating.Before this, we played Portal 2, which did a better job of e.g. the savegame issue by having many smaller levels, so if you had to quit at some point, you wouldn't have to replay as much as in this game. And there, when you already knew the steps leading up to where you'd left off, they were usually pretty easy to reproduce. If you're looking for a fun coop puzzler, I'd rather recommend Portal 2.

												The best co-op game I've tried until now. The gravitational twist to the game play makes this puzzle-platformer very entertaining.The colour schemes and backgrounds all play an active role in gameplay - and this effective use of all elements in the game is to be commended.The thing that weren't as on par was the slight lag in the voice chat feature. My partner and I used skype voice chat in order to get faster feedback. Also, it was a bit buggy, and sometimes we would both be over a ledge we weren't supposed to be. Not that we let that go to waste. :PA simple, yet mind consuming & addictive game is perfect for gaming with friends and couples alike.I rate it an 8/10 for overall game play.			",60,26,0,23,6,0,7

												ibb & obb is a puzzle platformer wrapped up in a beautiful and cute art style. Its simple presentation gets the job done. I was never once confused by mechanics as the game introduced them to me by showing me... and I didn't have to read one word. I was, however, often very confused by the puzzles! Which is a very good thing! My coop partner and I thoroughly enjoyed working together to solve puzzles and get the platforming tricks done. It's very satisfying to finally get through a puzzle and get to that party at the end of the level! There were even times when we got a bit snippy with each other because of the level of cooperation needed to get through. If you're considering buying this, just do it. I loved it. It's a perfect game to play with a friend. It was a real pleasure to play this game and I hope to see more from this developer!			",803,368,15,158,80,3,120

												ibb&obb is a really fun and addicting game if you play it together with a good friend of yours. I highly recommend buying the 2-pack bundle and to play with a friend.The game is kind of a physics puzzle platformer. It is self-explanatory, from the first to the last stage you will see new elements being introduced in a way that requires no further explanation. It's intuitive and fun to explore the new elements.The music in this game is a highlight. It matches the clean, calming artstyle perfectly and fits the athmosphere of the stages perfectly. Get the soundtrack if you can, you won't regret it.The replay-value of this game is ok. As long as you have more friends to play it with, there will always be one who you can introduce to this game and trying to get 100% of the crystals and secret stages with them is just as fun as trying it for the first time.What I dislike is that the audio volume resets every time you start the game, it's far too loud. Also, when playing with friends from overseas, the game suffers heavily from lag - not really the games fault, but I found that to be annoying sometimes, anyway.I'd recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet and who has a friend to play this together with. I could imagine that single player is too hard, as you'd have to control both characters at once, but maybe you'll like the challenge of that, too.			",77,2,4,1,3,1,9

I haven't played much, so this'll be very short. Pros This game has a very relaxing atmosphere, and the soundtrack/ambience that plays in the background is very calming.The art of the characters and the levels are amazing and adorable!  I feel bad whenever I accidentally pop one of the little yellow balls.The multiplayer experience is fluid and barely has any noticable lag.  When the small hickups do happen, they're actually quite funny.Controls are very easy and straight forward.  WASD or just the arrow keys.VoIP for online play Cons It's very hard to play online without a friend, in my experience at least.  At July 6th I spend half an hour in the waiting lobby just hoping someone would join, no dice.  July 10th I made a lobby and around the 10th minute someone joined, jumped around and noted how little I completed of the game by jumping on top of some level-achievement showing fellas, and left.  No one joined the lobby after that for about 20 minutes.Get it if you have a friend to play it with!  It's quite hard to play it solo and nearly impossible to get another random player online to play with you, others may have had different experiences though.  I'm sure I've missed some things in my tiny little ""review"", but overall this game is very solid.  It doesn't have any problems opening or closing, has voice chat when you get the chance to play with a random player online, and challenges players to communicate via ingame mouse movement or voice chat to solve ""puzzles"", assuming they want to get all of the points.

Positive:- Simplistic yet beautiful art style- Nice calming music- Simple, functional game mechanics- Gradual learning curve - Difficult challenges- Very fun and fair- Replay value (improve your score)Negative:- You need another playerConclusion:Ibb & Obb is a fantastic puzzle-platformer. It's mechanics and physics are simple enough but the game gradually becomes more complex such that you have to combine these simple mechanics to solve the later puzzles. While difficult, it is very fulfilling to finally solve them.I haven't tried playing this game with strangers online, but I can imagine it can be frustrating if you can't communicate properly (there is an in-game function to communicate with your partner but a voice chat would probably be more useful). Thus I would only recommend getting this game if you have a reliable friend to play it through with you. Still an excellent game though.			",191,40,3,20,12,2,11

												A very fun platfomer/puzzle co-op game, you run around the world as the two creatures ibb and obb while facing different puzzles and enemies that will keep you intrigued and guessing. Some of the puzzles can deffaintly be a bit challenging, however nothing game breaking. Obviously this game is tailor made for two people to play, however it can be played singleplayer too if you so desire. There's not much else to the game besides the main game, but you won't need much else has there are plenty of secrets and challenges to keep you playing for a while. Pick it up, grab a friend, and you'll have a great time, it's a blast.			",670,263,29,56,23,10,129

												Might be a fun game, but lack of colorblind-friendliness was a dealbreaker.The game's puzzles were fairly easy as far as I played, although I didn't much care for the way the two players can quite easily push each other into danger (resulting in many many needless deaths).I might like to play a version of this in the future with red and blue (for example), which would make it far more playable. I love co-op, and I love puzzles, but I couldn't love this.			",1496,602,47,218,175,21,260

												This game is perfect for co-op, especially when you see the price of two games compared to one game.This game looks cute, and I guarantee you, it is. The world, but also the objects and living animals(?), look really beautiful.The nice thing about this co-op is, that you really need each other. I'm not sure if it's even possible to play it alone.Also, the hidden levels bring a really nice touch to the game.The game is hard to play though, it's not easy, especially when you also want to complete the hidden levels, which are even harder than the normal game.What I also like about this game, is that it is developped by two Dutch companies, which I like, because I am Dutch. But even without this I would defenitily recommend this game!i would definitely recommend this game!!Info about the badge and emoticons of the game (NOTE: this is not in the game itself, it costs extra money):Nice about the game, but not really interesting for most people, I guess, is that the game has really nice badges.. At least the level 5 badge and the foil badge. The level badges below 5 I forgot about, so not talking about those. Also, the game has really nice emoticons, that you could get when crafting the badges. Especially the emoticon: :pinkheart:. I had the heart quite some time, then I found out, it's actually Ibb and Obb combined in a heart. This heart is also the level 5 badge.			",168,93,3,12,31,2,30

												The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book filled with marvel, it reflects on a world of dreams and longing where nobody is who they seem.Ibb & Obb is better, you get to yell at your friend when they can't jump three times straight and treathen to take your pc apart if it doesn't start cooperate immediately. I recommend you start learning how to mute yourself right now, and that you have a nice dose of painkillers ready.It also gave me the chance to have quality bonding time with #blueberry and I think that I've grown quite a lot while playing this game. The story is psychologically very deep and makes you really question if you are, in fact, the bad guys. It's a breath of fresh air amongst AAA games. now seriously, i loved this game <3			",12,13,1,12,1,0,1

												This seemingly simple little indie game is so much more than I expected! I have been having an absolute blast playing this game with my friend. It's a similar experience to what we had playing Portal 2 co-op, occasionally hurting our brains trying to solve a puzzle and then facepalming when it becomes blatantly obvious (after you've spent 15 mins trying to solve it of course). ibb & obb actually has us both in tears a few times, just dying with laughter as we repeatedly fail jumps and die to the Studio Ghibli-esque wandering soots.The graphics are PHENOMENAL - the simplicity of it all works so well and the vibrant colours make me so happy. Even the darker levels were executed so well and add to the game: You have just enough vision so that it doesn't hinder you playing (like so many other games where you can't see 2 inches in front of your face) and it's fun not being able to see the soots. Nothing like a spikey lil surprise to make your day eh?Not gonna lie, I normally rage a bit while playing platformer/repeatedly dying games. Like I said earlier I've had the exact opposite happen..I cry with laughter when we keep dying. The whole atmosphere of the game is very zen-like and relaxing, and the gameplay is just so fun (lots of wooshing and sounds are made while flying through the sky) that I haven't raged or gotten annoyed whatsoever..which is great. :)Can't recommend this game highly enough. What're you waiting for go grab a friend! And if you don't have any friends...you should rent one for a day just so you can play this game. It'll be worth it, I promise.			",333,128,10,34,44,6,46

Great game to play with a friend, not so sure about random matchup.

												22 people playtested it and we got soft locked 3 times throughout the game.  Took ~6 hours to beat the game with most secrets.  Every stage was reasonable fun except for the spotlight stage and the final stage which was shockingly horrible.  You literally hold right and die to instagib max speed falling saws then you get to restart and do it again with your new found knowledge of random saw placements.  Just another good idea for a game with sub-par level design.  Also if you spam start + back on controller during the end credits it asks if you want to enter event mode and crashes the game :) fun way to end it after the awful last stage.			",54,5,1,4,5,0,0

												The artwork is very charming, but the game is deigned to be too much of a puzzle with a single set solution. Many mechanics are quite punishing for little reason. I found that they made it all too easy to unintentionally grief your teammate, through no fault of your own.There were some interesting concpts, but some of the puzzles required your coop partner to sit there and watch you as you failed over and over again despite knowing the solution to the puzzle.There are a lot of creative things about this game, but I alsso believe they made a lot of questionable design choices.Why do you die everytime your idiot ally dies?Why is it that for a coop I never feel like I'm working together with my teammate?Why am I always getting in the way of my teammate and greifing them?Why do these puzzles only have one solution to get past them?On the other hand they have beautiful stylization, and what aI believe to be a very pretty communication system that you use without words, But this game is very unintentional.I did however love the pricing for a twopack and I believe that all coopgames should follow a similar model wherein you are required to play with someone else, but an extra copy of the game costs a little bit more.

												Great fun to play, with a wide number of challenging logic and timing-based puzzles for co-op play. A lot of fun with a friend.However, it is let down by substantial, frustrating network issues causing desyncs and strange behaviours. We would have finished the game a whole session sooner if it hadn't been for repeated crashes and desyncs. If you're lucky, you won't encounter the same, but based on my experience I can't recommend the game.			",254,32,9,28,20,3,30

												ibb & obb is a super cute platformer, which is designed for two people to play. Some of the puzzles can be quite easy, yet some can be really frustrating. Single playing is a big NoNo!, as it is just way to hard/stressful to complete some of the more advanced puzzles; so playing with a friend is recommend, as it's so much more fun and super silly at times. So if you are overwhelmed by the games cuteness, love the mixture of dark/magical levels or just love puzzle games/brainteasers; this game is definitely for you. It's a no-brainer =P ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The trailers don't lie: It's just that charming, simple and overall feelgood as it looks to be.The graphics are clean, stylish and minimalistic -  artistically it reminds me of the Roco-Loco games on the Playstation. And the gameplay is just perfect for that sunday afternoon with a good friend, a decent hangover and a pile of munchies.I could go on and write a proper review, but this game has fetched a long list of awards and holds a solid metascore so I won't waste more time on stating the obvious. I'll just say this: If you think the trailer looks like your cup of tea, then go hit that ""buy"" button. It's great.And yes - it runs like a charm on Linux. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very cute and very pretty game that can infuriate the impatient at times. Overall the puzzles are pretty cool and very reasonable, but I got stuck a few times in the endlevels, knowing what to do, but failing for 20 minutes straight. Lag can destroy a persons timing too. I played with a person on the other side of the world and sometimes we had to try a few times because the lag would get the better of his timing.Other than that the world is beautiful and the mousemovements making lines to show the other person what he needs to do is very simple and works perfectly fine. The characters are cute and the music was quite alright. Even though I seem negative about it, overall I really liked this game! I would certainly recommend it!			",181,149,0,19,12,3,12

												This game is challenging yet fun.  Playing with my friend Holy, we took the game head on and found ourselves having no choice but to work together to get through the levels.   Having to collect the coins quickly before they disappear also encourages us to be on opposite sides: so one of us can kill the monster, while the other is in position to collect the coins.We uploaded a video of us playing the first level or so, check it out if you want to see some game-play:

												Simple, tough and fun but with somewhat long-drawn courses. I recommend this game since it has the perfect amount of challenge (= pretty high) yet still remains fun. My partner gently disagrees (I'm surprised he didn't throw the controls into the wall) it requires two persistent players to keep the game moving forward at a general pace. The simplicity of both style and controls are wonderful, the downside is that it gets a bit repetitive after a while. All in all it still remains the easy-to-learn / tough-to-master type of game which I love. Now I only guess I have to find a new player 2.			",54,8,1,3,7,0,3

												Great game. It's pretty difficult when you're playing with someone and they aren't the best at listening, but that just makes it more fun. These days, most games are about random teammates, which isn't that fun, as you don't get to have that old school bonding moment while playing. I feel like this game captures that perfectly. I haven't completed the game yet, so I'm worried that the game will be a short one, but I suppose since it's so good, that will make up for it.Amazing art. Perfect soundtrack. What more could I ask for? A level editor would be like a cherry on a perfect cake ;3Thinking of getting this game? Don't be an idiot. You should have it by now!8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I spent 8 hours on this game with my boyfriend. It's fun, cute, and sometimes very frustrating. However, in the end it's totally worth it. It even has an awesome soundtrack you can listen to while playing. Definitely try to get it while it's on sale! <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game. I have gotten quite far through it with my brother and we have both really enjoyed playing. There is always something new to discover and the puzzles never get stale. There have been a few times we have gotten stuck and had to come back later, which is perfect for a puzzle game because you do not want it to be too easy. With logic, creativity, and determination though you will be able to get through it. The aesthetic of the game is really pleasing as well. I highly recommend.			",27,7,0,4,6,0,6

												A really simple but effective teamwork based game, definitely worth the price for a double pack in the humble bundle.Pros:+Beautiful, colourful art style+Teamwork (Up with portal 2)+Great sound design+Local or online multiplayer+Variety of puzzles at all difficulties+Drawing toolCons:-Not worth your money if you go for RRP price-Surprisingly has framerate drops at times-Not a very long story mode-No steam workshop option for people to create their own level-If you have 3 friends you can't all play togetherOverall views:A very simple,fun, teamwork oriented game that is almost up there with the portal series. I definitely reccommend buying it on sale but for the time you play on it you will be lucky to get 5 hours out of it with multiple playthroughs.8/10			",308,44,1,30,11,3,19

												Highly recommended. One of the very best co-op games I've ever played, probably because it's obviously made to be played with a mate. Even though it can be played alone, it would be much harder and far less fun.Most challenges you'll encounter are incredibly clever, very simple but not at all obvious. It will put your brains to work without getting too frustrating.It's really beautiful in both visuals and audio. The world is very colorful and vivid, the music plays a great part in the game's feels and every detail is carefully polished in both areas.I totally recommend buying a two-pack.

												Okay guys listen. You have a good buddy that you love playing games with? A buddy you maybe played Portal with back in the day? A buddy u played ANY Co-Op game at all with in the past? This is a no brainer. This game is soooooo much fun and such a good laugh with the sillyness of overthinking tons of stuff while the solution is staring you right in the face. You're gonna feel stupid but you're gonna feel stupid together and its gonna be ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Honestly, this game simply takes the price for Best Co-Op game for me ! Easily. This game is beautiful and very simple but difficult at the same time, it will challenge you in a lot of ways and it requires sharp skills and sharp communication with your buddy. 10 out of ♥♥♥♥ing 10 guys seriously, go buy this masterpiece.

												Best way to bond with a friend while yelling at each other or screaming ""It's my mistake, I'm so so sorry!"" The game is super adorable and the puzzles sometimes seem easy at first but are eventually a hell to execute. I wouldn't want another hell though! Sometimes we've been trying a puzzle for almost an hour and the satisfaction to completing it, is the best feeling I've ever experienced. The art style is also amazing, simple but it played with colours, music, even size! It does require strong teamwork, since timing is SUPER important in this game. It's been such a laugh and I will definitely have some nostalgia over this, since now we'll have to find a co-op game as good as this one, and that will be a difficult task! Thank you so much for creating this game!!And by the way, can I tell you how much of a troll this game is? You'll have to complete it to find out, I guess ;) #Weilai			",20,16,0,3,4,1,2

												This game was actually pretty fun. Up until the last level, my online partner and I were having a blast. Then, due to the lag and desync issues present in the game that the devs have been talking about fixing for over a year now, the last bit of joy left this game and I quickly went from enjoying the game to absolutely hating it.  The fact that this game relies on precision timing so much with such prevalent lag issues makes me give this game a negative review.I'd recommend this to players playing on the same computer, however, not to players online.

												ibb & obb might be the most adorable game I've ever seen.Psychedelic colors swirl around the screen, weird geometric characters dance about, parties are thrown for no reason whatsoever; it's just so 'effing cute and I wanted so much to fall in love with it. But playing ibb & obb is like petting a dog and having it bite your fingers off. It's cuteness is equally matched if not exceeded by its degree of frustrating, nonsensical design decisions, to where my head began to hurt so much I'm not sure how I ever managed to complete the trek through hell that was somehow hiding below the delightful exterior.Just to be entirely clear, ibb & obb is coop only, meaning you better have a friend ready and willing to brave its horrors with you before you even press start. And to this point there are some pretty cool ideas buried here, which force you to play cooperatively and make clever use of its main gravity inverting hook. There are two sides to every level, with each flipping your character over like you've cut a hole straight through to the other side of the world and gravity hasn't yet realized.Using both characters in tandem is almost always required to allow both to progress, be it providing a step up onto a ledge or using momentum to carry each other through. It's a fantastic hook but its implementation here is unbelievably hamstrung and convoluted. The camera that has to contend with two characters often going in opposite directions bears much of the blame, often obscuring parts of the environment or even your character entirely as you fight against it to keep moving as it holds you back. The pretty environments come at the const of making levels difficult to even comprehend, often blending so well with platforms or bubbles I needed to float in that I often had no idea they were something I needed to interact with.Puzzle designs, while on occasion genuinely brilliant, are often constructed such a ridiculous manner that numerous times throughout the game I thought we were breaking the game finding their solutions. So many moments are needlessly tedious and absurdly challenging, forcing literal split-second timing which its floaty, imprecise controls make cumbersome at the best of times and a living nightmare at its worst. Each new mechanic introduced only seems to worsen the already overburdened experience, leaving exasperated and fatigued before I was even halfway through. The abundance of network lag (which from what I've gathered is by no means an isolated issue) made parts of the game nearly impassible, as if the game was at last telling me to give up as my character ran wildly around at his own inclination.The dissonance between ibb & obb's truly marvelous artwork and mellow soundtrack and it's reprehensible gameplay is probably one of the most shocking I've ever experienced. It's bewildering and depressing, and I'm still finding it hard to fathom how miserable an experience it was to play when it all seemed so wonderful from the outside.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

It's a fun game to play with a friend, especially if you both just want to kick back and chill in lieu of playing anything too involved.			",630,189,21,67,74,7,111

												The game is awesome. I absolutely love it but, I am stuck on the last level with a buddy of mine, and the game has so much lag and desync, that the Sea Urchen, Nematoads, The black spikey things with White Eyes, get glitched and stuck on my screen when they aren't there for my partner. So we can't beat the level the way we are supposed to, or else we would probably be done with the game. Until it gets fixed, or my internet does, We can't beat the game. But, other than that, the game is FANTASTIC. Love it! Classic!			",99,2,3,3,6,2,7

Posted: February 16, 2015
												I wish I could recommend this game, but there are issues which cannot be ignored. I can't in good conscience say that someone should get this game until they're fixed. I will admit though that some of these issues are due to being disabled, which will result in some hate (because as we know the only people who like disabled people are disabled people), but I need to talk about this.Screen ZoomingI have poor sight, so when the screen suddenly zooms way out I find it easy to lose track of my character, or I'll get vertigo and my precision will be off. In a game with online multiplayer, this kind of zooming is unnecessary and only serves to irritate the player. An online game should use a set zoom (with the zoom level in the options). A pointer could point the position of the other character. This wouldn't really require much extra code as there's a pointer that tracks the other player in-game right now (if one player goes too high off screen, it'll show the position of the player lower down), which makes this even more baffling.If this were fixed for online games, it would make the experience much more enjoyable. As it is, the constant stretching and shrinking, stretching and shrinking, stretching and shrinking makes me feel nauseous. I understand that a temporary zoom to show what you need to do may sometimes be necessary, but just trigger that then have the zoom go away. Or even give the player a 'zoom out' toggle key which they can use whenever they want.But making it zoom and zip around like mad makes it feel like a Ubisoft game where the controls are so often stolen away. This would be a much, much, much more playable experience if this was fixed.CollectiblesI have an anxiety disorder. Whenever I fail to get collectibles, I feel like I've failed my co-op partner. For some people, this is exciting, exhilarating, and fun. For me, it results in my heart racing, pounding, and feeling faint and panicky. That sense of panic will grow and my hands will start shaking. Combine this with the above issue and I find ibb & obb (especially on the harder levels) a genuinely unpleasant play experience.This could be fixed by having an option so that they don't decay. I know that there are some nutty, obsessive cheevo-hunters out there who're hardcore or no-core, so just disabled the Steam achievements tied in with collectibles if the co-op partners agree to turn on the option to stop the collectibles from decaying. That way, it's an option, which doesn't hurt anyone, and the hardcore cheevo-hunters can have their hadcore cheevo-hunting.As it is, though, the decay makes this a stressful experience. Otherwise, it would be a pleasant, enjoyable, serene, cerebral experience. It would be more like Portal 2, then. I love Portal 2, standing around and trying to figure out a test chamber without the immediate pressure of ermahgerd I stepped on a thing, now the collectibles are going to decay, whatever will I do? So I won't be playing much more ibb & obb due to this.Of course, this means that the collectibles will stick around if you die, too. I know, gosh, such a carebear. But I'm an old fart with disabilities, I'm not 15 any more. We can't all be perfect.It just really, really frustrates me because I could see the potential of this as a serene puzzler, it could be in my top ten with the likes of Myst and Portal, but this silly, ridiculous design decision to cause stress and anxiety for no good reason just does so, so much to ruin the game. And it does ruin the game. And it is stupid. And it does stop it from reaching its potential. I just want to shake some sense into the developers, because it could be so much more. It's so close to being an epic cult classic for the ages.Game SyncingThis may not be fixable, but it's a very serious issue. It also triggers my panic in various ways.Way 1:""You didn't get the collectibles.""""Yes. I did. I really did.""""No, you didn't. I saw them explode all over the place and you didn't even bother with them.""""But ... I caught the ball before it exploded.""""Not on my end.""""I did on my end, honest! I caught it!""""Have you seen me ignoring collectibles?""""Yeah, but I didn't want to say...""""Welp, that's a bug.""Way 2:""You need to get rid of this porcupine.""""I did. I did that a while ago, and the collectibles popped out. I saw you get some of them.""""...none of this happened.""""I think it's bugging again. Here, let me come back. Is this where the porcupine is?""""Yes.""""It can't harm me...""""Look, it'll kill me.""""Well damn. How do we fix this?""""Keep trying until it works, I guess?""It took me and one co-op partner some time to figure out that there were syncing errors. I'm very hesitant to play it with any of my other friends as we'd have to go through this again and again, with each new person playing. This isn't my idea of a fun time. The game should at least mention that these bugs can occur when booting the game if they can't be fixed. It causes a lot of friction between co-op partners.ConclusionThis very flawed gem has the potential to become the next Portal 2, one of the best co-op puzzle experiences on Steam, perhaps even the best co-op experience on Steam. But the first of these two issues need to be fixed, the latter should be fixed, but if extenuating circumstances don't allow it, at least warn co-op partners that it can happen to alleviate potential stress.This could be good. Could be. As it is, it makes me a bag of stress with shaky hands. I can't help but dislike it for that. I don't want too. I want to like it. But the way I feel about it means that I can't recommend it.It's great if you have perfect sight, motor control, and no anxiety. It's great if you can put up with the game sync issues without getting stressed. In that case? I recommend it without reservation, go ahead, it's the most fun you can have with co-op puzzling outside of Portal 2. But for anyone whom these may be an issue for? No.No. I just can't recommend this. I want to, but I can't. Please fix these issues so that I can recommend ibb & obb. I really, really want to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is really fun and visually pleasing!Worth buying when looking for a coop platformer that really requires cooperation (not a ""use your friend as a spawn point"") especially if it's on sale.One of the very rare cases of a coop game that gives you a significant discount when buying a 2-pack. Devs who care about their players like that need our support.			",106,32,4,15,7,1,5

												As of my first 1.5 hours, I haven't really appreciated this game much. My co-op partner and I found the puzzles to be minimally challenging for far too long, and I feel like my interest has been lost. Though I really would like to complete the game, I'm not sure that I will find the motivation. For reference, I really like Portal and indie platformers tend to appeal to me, but Thomas Was Alone lost me in a very similar way.On the plus side the aesthetic has a modern, minimalistic appeal and the animations are well done, and that was a big draw for me when I purchased the game. The game controls well with Xbox 360 / One controllers and the game detected them without issue. Those that appreciate the gameplay should find that the rest of the game is quite well made, though the sparseness of the settings menu can be a turnoff.I did experience some tiny framerate issues on my system with a mid-end i5, Radeon HD6870, and a solid state drive, but nothing that significantly hampered the gameplay experience. Though I will hesistate to blame the framerate problem on the game since it could be attributable to a problem with my system, I want to note that this PC runs most other games without hickups and it well exceeds the recommended system specs.Concluding, I think this game has charm and will absolutely appeal to some people, but it was not my cup of tea. Though I can't honestly recommend this game because I didn't enjoy it, I feel that it is absolutely worth a try if you think it might appeal to you.			",333,95,6,44,33,4,48

												I cant really recommend this game to anyone who'd want to play it with a friend.or alone for that matter, read below to find out whyI actually played this game ""offline mode"" for about 2 hours with a friend then he got really bored and we closed the game.Then I restarted it and played in a bit more than 3 hours in alone to finish the game and I almost did.See the base idea is nice, two characters each one depending on the other, each has its own special colored doors to enter through it and help each other reaching the next platform reaching the end.its a one touch death game, when one dies the other one does too, so you restart from the last chickpoint. Whats good The artwork is nice, although not that different, but you get the idea and its nice.Music is good and soothing.World design is simple and lovely. Whats bad -Animations are clunky to say the least, they might not look like it that much but its not perfect.-Gameplay is ok but there isnt really much to do after 1 hour, its the same thing, step on my head so i lift you up to the next place ... etc.-Its really really boring after 2 hours.-There is no story to go on with, nothing really keeping you in the game itself.NOTE I actually found the game easy enough to play it alone until almost the end, wasn't really that challenging ""Not trying to brag"" it just was too easy considering I am playing it by myself, controlling two characters in one keyboard.Its really sad that I really looked forward for this game at the beginning,  but got quickly disappointed when I saw its serious lack of content.I THANK HEAVENS that I got this from a bundle trade, because 11.99$ Is WAY too much for a game that runs out of ideas after 1 hour and can be finished in 4.I am sure people would disagree with this review but whatever the game really is not that good I am so surprised it has so many positive reviews, probably the rewards made people feel the game is better ? I don't know, I usually go crazy for this type of game.I actually got 2 achievements in the game, wondering why they dont appear here, maybe due to offline mode			",684,176,16,69,45,5,48

												I was a bit hesitant about getting this game. It looked like the kind of game that would start off good then become too frustrating and it is always difficult to say whether or not it would remain fun for long enough for the game to be worth getting. I gave this game a chance anyway because local coop games are so few are far between. So how long did it take to for this game to get annoying and frustrating? Twenty minutes… yes after only three levels this game had exhausted it capacity for fun. The game requires a degree of coordination between the players that was way beyond my partner and I. After my partner gave up on this game I attempted to play a bit more on my own but this game has no single player mode, you can play controlling both characters but again this requires a level of coordination I don't possess. There is also online play but if I couldn't muster the required level of hive mind communication with my partner on the sofa next to me then I how am I going to manage it with some random on the internet? So if you are a member of the Borg collective looking for a challenging game to play with a fellow drone, this might be the game for you. If you are looking for a bit of casual fun with friend this is probably not the game for you.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

I tried playing with both sets of keys but that is tricky; unless you're ambidextrous or very very persistent or both, this will probably end up being pretty frustrating and you will not get all diamonds (or whatever those white things are)Single player is definitely a viable way to play though, just tricky. Coop is where to be..			",260,38,11,16,13,3,16

												If you, and a friend are looking for a good time, and a true co-op experience, then Ibb & Obb is for you. The soundtrack is amazing, and the game looks beautiful. 15 levels doesn't seem like much, but don't be fooled the puzzles can be challenging. Just shy of 10 hours, and I see myself playing through Ibb & Obb multiple times! 10/10p.s Level 15, I'm not sure if it is a bug or connection issue, but it gets very glitchy. During the chase some of the ""monsters"" will spawn for one player before the other player making it almost impossible to get past. Only way around was to die multiple times until it was set right.			",199,26,3,14,17,4,13

												The words that first come to mind with ibb&obb are simple, cutesy, and fun. It’s a puzzle platformer that is designed to be played with two people. The main game mechanic is that the world is split across the middle with a line with a world of reverse gravity on the other side. The levels are designed in that you need to work together to solve the puzzles while most of the puzzles are really simple. It’s fun enough that I enjoyed running through with my girlfriend but I could also see myself playing this with a little kid because it’s simple enough for a little kid to play.7/10. I’d say it’s worth the money while it’s one sale. I purchased to double pack for $5.99. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ibb & Obb is a gravity-based puzzle-platformer.Which isn't to say you manually adjust gravity, as with some games, but that the entire game is composed of things like 'slow fall bubbles', trampolines, looped falling (where you drop from the sky after falling off the bottom of the screen), and reverse-gravity wells.Despite fairly simple concepts, the puzzles quickly move from charming and cute and simple, to demanding and clever.Unlike twitch/reflex platformers, once you actually figure out the trick to a puzzle, you're good to move on, which makes this a game more about testing your wit, than your reflexes- though timing is certainly important, as well.Ibb & Obb is one of the best co-op experiences I've had in a while, and I can certainly recommend it-Though there's some things I unfortunately have to point out.||PROS||* Co-op only play guarantees an experience built with co-op in mind at all facets. * Puzzles are based around clever reuses of a small set of objects, presented in more and more complex ways, thus creating a steadily progressing experience where you build off what you've learned from your previous successes, rather than having to start each puzzle from scratch.* Ibb & Obb (the two player-controlled characters in the game) are different sizes. This can have some interesting effects on gameplay, and is actually crucial to later puzzles. It's a nice twist that keeps each co-op partner feeling distinct in their roles. Similarly, the use of color-coded barriers limits which character can progress at points, creating interesting 'how do we both progress' puzzles.* Looped falling can be surprisingly hilarious* You can 'bend the system' by attempting crazy mid-air combos, such as trying to jump off your partner as they loop-fall. This can sometimes provide alternative ways to solve puzzles, for players that enjoy precision-reflex approaches over puzzle approaches. But really, it'll take quite a few attempts to do- though it's quite satisfying when you manage it.* Charming atmosphere, and the most adorable little interactables- that you can actually push into enemies to cause the enemies to change course, or bounce onto enemy killing buttons, or just kick around like soccer balls, sometimes to absolutely hilarious effect. Great little tidbit for more creative puzzle solving, and just general palate cleansing.* The ability to aim for a perfect score, by gathering all the enemy-kill score drops, for the more dedicated completionists.||NEUTRAL||* Secret stages are brutal and difficult to intuit, and may be best skipped by all but the most dedicated mental gymnasts. * This game gets hard. It looks like it's designed for kids, but most kids won't have the patience to complete this kid of game [and if you know one that does, give them a cookie, they're awesome].  This is definitely a game for the patient and the people who really like working through problems until they understand them. If you're into really puzzle-oriented games, enjoy teamwork, and physics manipulation, you're going to probably like this game. If your expectations run toward something more- or less- active in involvement, you may not.* Similarly, puzzles will require several attempts to figure out, and at the time we played, all the walkthroughs were for the console version (which has different stages, see Cons below). Plus side, every time we got stuck and needed an assist, it was us overthinking a puzzle, so there's that. :) Still, patience is a virtue- and one you may need to rely on for this game.Then again, you'll still die less, hate yourself less, and feel far less frustrated than with twitch/reflex platformers, so there's that~* Relatively short. 6 to 7 hours without the last level (see Cons), but that's mostly due to repetition in figuring out each puzzle. The core content is probably 2-3 hours in length, assuming a run-through where you know what you're doing. (Secret levels will of course extend this time a bit further, if you choose to do them.)||CONS||* The last level is broken on the PC port- or rather, several levels got reimagined for the PC port (which is kinda cool) but the reimagining of the last level caused it to be incompletable (which is kinda not cool). The game plays fine up to that point, so if you're able to view the end of the game being a level sooner, you'll be fine- If you're a completionist, this screw-up may drive you up a wall.Especially with given how demanding the prior level was- you can only imagine how awesome this final level could have been..* No mid-level save points, so you're forced to complete a stage to make progression in it.[Each puzzle section within a stage does have its own respawn point, however.]Plus side, once you know the puzzles, you can breeze through if you need to leave and restart- still, this feels like an unfortunate and arbitrary exclusion.* Likewise, this game seems to have low replay value, given that non-campaign-level challenges (ie, secret levels) are all extreme in challenge, and all puzzles in the game are fairly easy to complete once you know how to do them.This is a bit of a difficult game to describe, but if you like undertaking a mental challenge with a partner, and neither of you are the type to get agitated when you get stuck, then it's a fantastic game I recommend highly.As always with co-operation games of this nature, if either person gets easily stressed, expect eventual argument and rage-quitting.Despite that phrasing, it's not an especially frustrating game (in MY opinion), since everything CAN be figured out through rethinking and continously retesting your approach to a puzzle.Still, it's a bit niche in its challenge, a bit curious in how certain things (like secret levels) are approached, and, of course, the last level cannot be played.So..I tentatively give it a 4/5. Seriously, if it sounds at all good to you, give it a shot- and if it sounds at all not good to you, don't. ~.^			",647,380,19,136,44,14,153

												I wrote a lengthy version on gamespot.com, with fancy images. ( http://www.gamespot.com/ibb-and-obb/user-reviews/2200-12659853/ )But to summarize,NEGATIVE POINTS- The controls are a bit cheap, lack the ability to move precisely, which is needed in many situations in the game.Little reason to actually collect the points, more frustration than reward.- Unclear whether the player is in the middle or near the end of the level.- One of the important mechanics blends in too well with the background, making it unclear.NEUTRAL POINTS- Level designing is fairly good but could be much better in some areas.POSITIVE POINTS- Mechanics and concept are neat.- Creating a 2player platform puzzler is not an easy job.- Aesthetics are fitting and look good.- Particle effect on the cursor aids gameplay really well.I'd say 12 bucks is too much for the frustration though, if they simply made it a shorter game (with the quality > quantity mindset), spent some more time on the movement, leveldesign and some clearer indications I think this game would be awesome, but for this, no. I wouldn't recommend it.			",131,5,1,10,9,1,12

												I want to love this game. It's cute, the controlls are tight. The puzzles ARE good. I want to reccomend this game...but I cant.There's a big brick wall of problems here and there. While the puzzles are designed well there are more than a few instances of mechanics placed around the puzzle as if to throw you off of the answer (mechanical level was a big one for us). There is also a DISTINCT lack of button use. Sure the game is jump and that's it, but we had to restart a handful of levels simply because there's no die option. If you get stuck, too bad, restart the whole level. There is a series of levels in the dark where your visibility is limited. We quit here, and are unsure if we will return, the design felt cheap at this point, with synthetic difficulty.			",225,30,5,17,10,0,9

												This game is a preview of Hell. I have never been so frustrated, so nuclear♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥within the first thirty minutes of playing a game in my life. To be fair, it isn't the game's fault, it is my own intellectual incompetence. This game makes me feel like a high-functioning retard. I'm not alone though, me and my co-op partner even looked up YouTube walkthroughs, and the people doing the walkthroughs got stuck and gave up. If you and a buddy profoundly despise yourselves, go ahead and give it a shot. Otherwise steer clear. It looks simple and easy....... it is neither.			",128,39,12,8,8,0,11

												I usually don't bother leaving games a review at all, let alone a negative one......and, it pains me to leave this game a negative review, because it aims to be something very rare (and something I much desire) in the video game marketplace: an age-neutral co-op game. All the other coop games on the marketplace are shooters with blood and guts and the disemboweled souls of little puppies flying everywhere. I was hoping that the game would be something fun to play with young folk. It was excellent until we reached the little black spikeballs of death that chase you. Despite all our combined inginuity and (not too terrible) platforming skills, we could not progress past a certain scene with spiky deathballs that chase you. Was there a difficulty setting we could turn down? Nope. Were there cheat codes we could use to experience the rest of the game? Nope. Could we just ""git gud""? I suppose,  but the goal wasn't to play an intense, twitch-based, control-heavy platformer.. it was to have fun with a friend, and also to solve some cool two-player puzzles (like the gameplay trailer shows.)The little black monster also neatly brought into focus the game's other failings: the controls are unpleaseantly slippery, which exascerbates the precision needed to engage the puzzles and platforming elements, especially perching on your friend's head. Perching on your friend's head is an element needed to solve many puzzles, but for such a pivotal gameplay element, it relatively difficult to achieve. We always needed two or three tries to accomplish something central.All-in-all, from what I've seen, the concept is good, and the art is fairly cool, and the mood is cheerful, but the execution was a fail, because the execution kept us from experiencing the rest of the game. I wish I could reccomend this--I really do.			",52,17,0,7,9,0,19

												This game is not so much a puzzle game as a vehicle for the torment and suffering of hell. I have sinned, I have truely sinned in my life I will admit. However I am quite certain that I have never done anything so horrible as to bring this level of frustration and anger upon myself. If you want to find something to do on a Friday night, I'd recommend that you bash yourself in the head with a hammer rather than play this game. To the rest of you however who happen to be masochist, enjoy the pain that is Ibb & Obb.The game certainly starts out easy enough and being about puzzles, but it quickly goes from simply figuring out puzzles to managing to pull it off. More places than not, I had long figured out the solution before managing to actually apply the hand to eye coordination necessary to proceed through the level. In many places there were challenges that involved precise timing to avoid enemies.The other thing to note however is that this game, I believe, is the only game from steam in which I’ve never gotten a single achievement on. This is of course referring only to games that actually have achievements, but out of the very limited number of them, I managed a grand total of zero. I don’t care though, because I would sooner walk over a field of broken glass then swim through a sea of lemon juice and salt than I would ever play this game again.Edit: I realized after I posted this review that I did in fact get one achievement which I forgot about. The only achievement I got was for completing the game, but I forgot I had gotten it during my mad rush to uninstall this blight from my hard drive. My bad...			",45,10,0,9,3,0,2

												It seems like a nice little game for when you have a friend over.  I really like how WASD is used for one character, and the directional buttons for the other.  This allows simultaneous local gameplay.I imagine the online gameplay would be fun...if other people ever joined online to play. :/The art is simple, but somewhat lacking.  I imagined this to be a visual wonder, but its setup is lacking and more simple than a Flash tutorial on how to animate.  I guess I expect a bit more.Overall I'll give this a 5/10.  Not recommended.			",10,2,0,4,2,0,0

												Tried hard to be modern and artsy, but the 'PhyreEngine' unfortunately does not provide magical tricks to remove online delay, hence this 2p-coop-only timing puzzle videogame falls flat as an online experience. From what other reviewers wrote, it doesn't even work properly via LAN.If it were couch coop only, I'd moan that there's no online MP, but as it stands, I have to moan that the online MP isn't very good. Later levels are just about impossible due to the atrocious lag / delay and random erratic AI behaviour resulting from this.I sure like the comparably cheap two pack offer, but the bugginess / glitchiness as well as frequent reliance more on perfect timing than clever thinking prevents me from giving this game a positive review. Unlike it apparently was the case for other reviewers, my 1.5 hours of playing time did not include 'lightbulb moments' where I was mesmerised by the developers' astonishingly intricate puzzle design. At all. As far as challenging players with pattern memorisation and perfect timing goes, there are various games on Steam that make far far better use of those gameplay elements (SMB, Rush Bros and I assume Electronic Super Joy as well as SpeedRunners).Give this game a look if you engage in regular single PC dual gamepad multiplayer games, or if you happen to have a lot of patience for a game's issues when it comes to playing online with a close friend.P.S.: Voice communication is a must for all but the first few puzzlies. Not gonna be any jolly if you can't communicate while you play.P.P.S.: When you're STUCK SOMEWHERE due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEVEL DESIGN, it's impossible to kill yourself to restart from the last automatic save point. Good job, developers.			",3358,1277,127,343,497,39,548

My partner is teleporting really badly and sometimes the crystals you have to collect are shown as collected for him but splitted on the ground for me, and in the end we didn't get all cause of that.I really hope you can fix that problem cause then this will definitely turn into a positive review.

												Casual coop adventure for 2 people.Players can be both local or online connected (steam friends). This game requires both of players to survive until the end. I can't leave my friend alone when I pass the obstacles or make my friend go first into the danger to die. Most of the gameplay is puzzles, in which I talk with another player about how to deal with tricks. Communication is a large part of what I enjoyed in this game, since some tricks are really difficult and we had to join forces. Nicely made coop gameplay, also it has such neat graphic as screenshots show. And.. if you want, this can be played alone with both hands.			",632,321,16,73,71,9,69

												ibb & obb is a 2-player puzzle platformer best played on the couch with a steam controller.  Most levels are easy enough to beat but tricky enough to keep you interested.  There's almost no mechanical skill to the game; it's all about wrapping your head around simple puzzles based around the idea that gravity pulls you toward the centre (instead of the bottom) of the screen.If you want a fun co-op platformer, ibb & obb is the game.

												Ibb & Obb is a delightful indie co-op platforming experience but you need a buddy to play along with. It's strictly a co-op game, so that means either playing with a good friend or with random players. Like classic platforming, you run to the right and overcome obstacles together, the twist being that you have the ability to walk underneath the floor, parallel to the top. Many of the puzzles and enemies must be solved by using this ability, with one player being on top of the world and one underneath. There have been times where we have been stumped at how to progress thanks to this clever little mechanic. Momentum and jumping physics also play parts in the challenges for you to utilize. The game isn't the longest in the world, 3 hours and more for the secrets and collectibles scattered and hidden throughout. Visually, it's simple, using highly vectored and clean graphics with simple enemy design. You will see alot of back drops and paths being re-used with the difference being colours and ambience. The difficulty is pretty tame until the late stages which then ramps up like a bridge. Not a bad thing but you'll find yourself suddenly hitting a wall and being stuck. Although I have only played with a friend, i can see this being a difficult time with random players. You might have trouble with players who lack patience or rush ahead leaving you behind. There is no in game chat that I know of, with the only intstructions you can give is by moving the mouse around to draw lines and paths if you're trying to show how to progress.Overall, 3/5.

												Very fun co-op game, bought the duo pack to play with a friend. It is more challenging than you would think, and has tons of puzzles to figure out.There isn't an in game chat system (I don't think), but there is voice chat. A good communication tool in the game is the cursor, you can use it to show your co-op partner what to do by showing the path/direction they should go.This game could have a little bit more hints, if you get stuck, there isn't much you can do. (Look for guides?)Overall, would recommend to others to play. 9/10			",23,5,0,4,3,0,0

												Very few games do co-op right. Some have little to no co-op interaction, and the players might as well be playing alone. Some have ""shared lives"" where the less experienced player feels like they're dragging down the team. Ibb & Obb has the best co-op mechanics of the many, many cooperative games I've played.Ibb & Obb is a puzzle platformer. Both players are needed to solve every puzzle, meaning a player is never left out or dragged behind. Sometimes the puzzles require that the players fill specific roles--Ibb. the green guy, is allowed through green portals and Obb, the red guy, is allowed through red portals. The developers cleverly alternate the use of these portals to ensure that no one player always takes the active role in each puzzle.My sole criticism is that Ibb & Obb doesn't have in-game communcation to match the intricacy of its puzzles. Players can only draw colored lines in the air, but they are fairly short and fade quickly. This problem disappears if you're playing couch co-op or are using a mic.The puzzles are excellent and make clever use of teamwork and physics.The graphics and visuals are very pleasing.The soundtrack is amazing and certainly worth owning as well.Ibb & Obb is among the best of the indie, co-op, puzzle-platform, and artsy genres. If you've got a co-op buddy, this game is definitely worth your time.			",526,192,10,64,44,4,102

												got the best friend edition of this game for super cheap and had a good bit of fun with this title. if you look around you can get 2 copies of this game for less then $5. i did have a strange glitch where i seen enemies that my friend could not see but they could only effect me as well. im sure it would have sorted itself out if i restarted the game but whatever. the art is funny and nice looking at the same time. gameplay is nice but after a while some bits will take a bit of thinking to keep going. so im going to give this game a 8/10 cute and fun little mini game. hardly anything wrong with it at all.

												This game was fun in the beginning and me a friend bought it when it was on sale (THANK GOD!!!) I enjoyed the beginning of it and as well as my friend until about 80% into it.  Then the stupid switch gets turned on either the puzzles get exteremly dumb/difficult (hurray youtube!) or the timing gets crazy like you have to be nearly perfect within a fraction of a second.  That's just crazy.  We died on the final part 27 minutes straight.  Just wow...  Looking for a game to rage with a friend?  Then get this game.  If not STAY AWAY.  Uninstalling now...Glad I made videos of this to post on youtube to count how many times we've died...lol			",154,28,1,39,3,1,4

												ibb & obb is a 2-player puzzle platformer best played on the couch with a steam controller.  Most levels are easy enough to beat but tricky enough to keep you interested.  There's almost no mechanical skill to the game; it's all about wrapping your head around simple puzzles based around the idea that gravity pulls you toward the centre (instead of the bottom) of the screen.If you want a fun co-op platformer, ibb & obb is the game.

												Casual coop adventure for 2 people.Players can be both local or online connected (steam friends). This game requires both of players to survive until the end. I can't leave my friend alone when I pass the obstacles or make my friend go first into the danger to die. Most of the gameplay is puzzles, in which I talk with another player about how to deal with tricks. Communication is a large part of what I enjoyed in this game, since some tricks are really difficult and we had to join forces. Nicely made coop gameplay, also it has such neat graphic as screenshots show. And.. if you want, this can be played alone with both hands.			",632,321,16,73,71,9,69

												A true coop game, where you have to coordinate and plan every move with your coop partner instead of just playing besides each other without really cooperating, as it is often the case with other coop games. It begins as a light-hearted, cartoony jump'n'run, but the challenges get harder and harder and require a lot of trial & error and carefully timed button presses of both players. One downside is that it is not possible to save your game during levels, which take more and more time to solve as the game goes on.			",236,99,4,27,31,4,28

												One of a kind puzzle game; built entirely around co-op mechanics. Whoever you choose to play it with will laugh at you, yell at you, maybe even quit on you... but in the end, it will be worth it. It's challenging but offers a good upward scale of difficulty as the levels go on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												got the best friend edition of this game for super cheap and had a good bit of fun with this title. if you look around you can get 2 copies of this game for less then $5. i did have a strange glitch where i seen enemies that my friend could not see but they could only effect me as well. im sure it would have sorted itself out if i restarted the game but whatever. the art is funny and nice looking at the same time. gameplay is nice but after a while some bits will take a bit of thinking to keep going. so im going to give this game a 8/10 cute and fun little mini game. hardly anything wrong with it at all.

												This game was fun in the beginning and me a friend bought it when it was on sale (THANK GOD!!!) I enjoyed the beginning of it and as well as my friend until about 80% into it.  Then the stupid switch gets turned on either the puzzles get exteremly dumb/difficult (hurray youtube!) or the timing gets crazy like you have to be nearly perfect within a fraction of a second.  That's just crazy.  We died on the final part 27 minutes straight.  Just wow...  Looking for a game to rage with a friend?  Then get this game.  If not STAY AWAY.

												Do you like other people? Do you like video games? Do you wish you could merge your love of video games with your love for other humans? Never fear, this game is LITERALLY designed for that! Command one half of the keyboard each; one keyboard + one controller; or two controllers. Although there's going to be frustrating periods where you'll yell at each other for not following each other's hastily thought-out instructions.Graphics: 10/10. Colourful, great paralax background, so many ♥♥♥♥ing colours. Can your graphics card drive a monitor? Then you can play this game! I can even switch to my integrated graphics card to run this game at 1080p 60 FPS, which saves my laptop from heating up. Sound: 10/10. Every sound feels like it was lovingly-crafted, and it shows. The sound is complementary to the game, and it really sets the mood.Gameplay: 8.5/10. Gameplay is clear, consistent, and varied. Each level is unique, but not unique enough you'll get lost. New gameplay concepts are introduced very well on-the-fly. However, some challenges require a lot of out-of-the-box complex thinking, so you will get stuck for maybe 20-30 min on a particular section. Overall (not an average): 9/10. Buy this game on sale!

This review may be updated later on, should I put in more play time and change my mind about certain things.As stated: I got this game through Humble Bundle, but the price of 9,99€ feels about right.""ibb & obb"" looks realy nice and cute and the coop puzzle-platforming is interesting. I played about 1,5 levels by my self and I see the potential. I'm definitely going to ask my girlfriend to play this with me. :)			",92,36,6,3,18,5,6

												Ibb and Obb is a cute, and beautiful co-op puzzle platformer. While you can play on your own, I don't recommend it as many puzzles rely on execution with percision movement.The visuals of the game are stunning and every level has it's own unique feel to it. Complimenting the visuals beautifuly is the soundtrack which I do recommend you get with the game.The puzzles are about a medium difficulty in the main game but can range from medium to hard in the secret levels. Once again, though, most of these puzzles rely on percision movement to complete. Overall, the game is very accomidating towards the 100% crowd and I can find myself spending many hours with my friend doing a full 100% of the game. I recommend this game if you have a friend to play it with. Otherwise, maybe skip it for now or just let an extra copy sit in your inventory for a while.			",187,49,1,15,13,2,12

												Very nice, cute game. I used to play it with my boyfriend in the same room. This is the game, which let us spend some time together not only in shooter games, but try something different. We learn how to understand each other, how to not get crazy and angry about each other. We played it as long, as it was possible to actually go through the level. At some point we finaly started avoid to play, cause we saw it's impossible to go through that level. Anyways, my memories is very nice about it, and I would start again to play after a year from the first level again. Game was a gift, so in that case I have nothing to regret. If you already have it - please enjoy, as much, as possible. If you think about buying it - thing again, if you're obssesed with finishing the whole game. Negative reviews is kind a right about how hard is to control two people moves at the precision accuracy. Wouldn't buy it for 10 euros.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Co-Op puzzle games I think I've played in a long time. Many games have come out for two (or more) players to try to solve puzzles together, but fall into one of a few traps: -One player too easily can take over, directing the other player(s) to the solution or simply doing it all themself, while waiting for the others to catch up, or making the others feel the puzzle is being spoiled for them.-The game forces each player into a specialized role which means they each have a specific job to do, and whoever is better/faster at the game is left waiting for others to figure things out. (Which makes it feel like everyone is playing their own solo game together, but separately.)-The game tries to force individual problem solving by limiting or not giving any ways for the players to communicate.Ibb & Obb does a good job of not falling into any of these traps through thoughtful puzzles and unique style and gameplay.The gameplay and style are truly unique, both in terms of design and visuals/music. A very lovely game that is challenging without being too hard, and has plenty of content without being a grind nor too short.  ",96,23,1,6,6,2,8

												I rate Ibb and Obb 5/5. Sadly, I will probably never finish it as I know no one who is able to play this game adequately. It isn't that this platform puzzle-adventure game is difficult. It isn't very difficult. It's just that all of my friends are into playing other types of games apparently. They play RTS (real time strategy) and other things. Oh well but that's the way it goes. It can be hard to find someone who is as good as you are at a game and ALSO wants to play it with you at the same time that you do. As this game depends on cooperation (most of this game's puzzles require a high-degree of cooperation) you need to play this with someone who is as competent at the game as you are and despite how cute this game looks, there are some fairly mind-bending puzzles in this game, but that's also a good part of this game's charm.The music in this game is excellent. The sound is good and cute. The graphics are cute. The game runs really, really well. The controls are, if you are a platform gamer, intuitive. But you MUST find someone else who thinks the controls are intuitive as well. Your mother who only plays complex scrabble-type word games and who has never managed to win a super mario brothers game won't be good enough at this and so the game will be sort of frustrating. This really is one of those games, like the cooperative mode of portal 2, where you should ideally be playing with someone you know really well and who is at least as good at the game as you are.

												I was never that into Coop Platforming games (I'm more of an FPS gamer) and I got the Best Friends Forever pack from a Humble Bundle. After playing this with one of my friends, I have to say that this is an extremely fun platforming game, that is both relaxing and difficult.Things I loved about the game:- Visual Quality (it is so smooth and the particles effects are awesome).- Puzzles (The start of the game was quite easy, but once you played through, the puzzles took me a while to think of what to do).- Using momentum to beat puzzles (it's so satisfying).Problems I had with the game:- A little bit laggy when playing with a friend (that might just be my internet, although other games are fine when I play them).- Voice chat in game is a 2 second delay (but you will probably use Skype, Tamspeak etc. anyway).I would give this a solid 9/10. Definitely recommend it to anyone!			",258,32,3,13,7,0,13

												Ibb and ObbFun co-op platformer/puzzle game. Plays like chill version of Super Mario Bros with ""outside the box"" thinking puzzles that remind me of Portal 2 co-op. You play as a pair of brightly colored pac-man ghost looking guys that either walk on the top or the bottom of a side scrolling level. The top-bottom thing has reversed gravity and holes that allow you to fall from one side into the other. This makes for many ""flinging"" style puzzles that you use gravity to accelerate you into the flip side world. There are enemies that can only be defeated on a certain side, and the goodies that pop out on the opposite side must be collected by your co-op buddy. The game is full of ""aha!"" moments and working together makes for plenty of high fives. It supports both local or over the internet co-op. If you have a friend and like to use your brain, you should make some time to put both to good use and play this game.			",346,116,13,28,36,2,44

The game does a superb job of introducing new mechanics and reinforcing what you've learned later on.  The core mechanic - that of using gravity and portals - is delightful in itself to play around with, that makes figuring out even a difficult puzzle feel fun.Even my non-gamer friends love to play this when they're over, and I have a blast watching them try to figure it out.

												Great game overall, it's an original idea for a co-op game, and it is really good at making you thinkPros:-Fun graphics. I really love the art style 10/10-Great transitions between levels, they're really smooth.-Very challenging gameplay. Seriously the first few levels are ""oh okay that's cool, I get it"" but as you progress, the leves turn into more like ""My patience is wearing thin. Help me figure this ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥out, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.""-Voice chat (also a con)Cons:-Wish there was a bit more instruction in the game. Yes the whole point is for you to figure it out; I'm not talking about that. I mean the level selection is a bit wishy-washy. Since there is very little text instruction it can be a bit difficult to figure you what level you are selecting-The voice that is..... okay. First I don't like the weird modulation/virtualization it does to your voice. It kinda makes it hard to understand and I know it is supposed to fit the theme of the game but it seems that if they left it unfiltered it would have been better. Also there seems to be a 3.5 second lag between when I say something and when the other person can hear it. This might be my ISP, but I'm not sure. Also, NO PUSH TO TALK! This sucks! If you enable voice chat, it's always on, and this sucks for me because I play in the living room where my whole obnoxious family is and I'm really self-conscious about my TV blaring on the other player's headphones.All in all, It's a great way to challenge your brain and have some fun with your friends8/10 would recommend.

												I only pushed my friend to his death like once. I swear. The nice part is, the game checkpoints you rather often so you arn't restarting from the beginning of a level, just at the beginning of a puzzle section. This is much appreciated when commmunication goes awry. Any time I've gotten semi-stuck its been clearly gamer error and not game error. The music is nice and soothing as well. Play the game.  It is fun. Do you really need more than that?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun co-op game, bought the duo pack to play with a friend. It is more challenging than you would think, and has tons of puzzles to figure out.There isn't an in game chat system (I don't think), but there is voice chat. A good communication tool in the game is the cursor, you can use it to show your co-op partner what to do by showing the path/direction they should go.This game could have a little bit more hints, if you get stuck, there isn't much you can do. (Look for guides?)Overall, would recommend to others to play. 9/10			",23,5,0,4,3,0,0

												Incredibly frustrating, extremely fun.You have doubtless seen many reviews of ibb and obb praising its cuteness (it is cute) and clever puzzles (they are clever) and the high requirement for solid teamwork (it does require very solid teamwork) and seen the recommendation that it is ""good to play with a girlfriend or kids"".Use caution with the last.  Seriously, this is an excellent game, but it is a rough introduction to puzzle platforming once you get to the later levels--many of the puzzles require nearly flawless timing, and that's generally fine because you don't go back too far and the reset is fast, but those new to gaming will be sorely tested.  I have to give the devs a great deal of credit for tuning some of the puzzles to a razor's edge of perfection, and we found many sections where we knew what to do and came to the conclusion that it was impossible before seeking a walkthrough and discovering we had the right solution--we just weren't good enough and needed more practice.  I myself am OK with that (I love games like VVVVV), but my partner, who loved the game as it started, reached a point of ""this just isn't fun now.""  We have one more level, and I do hope we finish it.So I love it, and do recommend it as an excellent coop puzzle platformer, but I would exert much caution using it as someone's first introduction to gaming.

												This is a beautiful, well-crafted game.The controls and game-mechanics are introduced organically through gameplay, without so much as a word of instruction, which is definitely no easy feat and probably the thing I think is most amazing about this game.The puzzles are sufficiently difficult that when you finally get that light-bulb moment, the rush cannot be topped, but equally they're not unfair or excessively punishing.The music, sound design and art style are minimalistic and stylish, but neverthless manage to convey a lot of emotion about how you should feel in a given level.Working together with your friend to solve the puzzles often involves ""signing"" - when you move your mouse it draws a line in your character's colour across the screen where the cursor is, that the other player can see. This is a simple yet powerful system for letting your partner know what you're thinking and what you'd like them to do. However, sometimes its just a tiny bit too simplistic and a built-in text or voice chat would have been nice, even if its only used occassionally to express the more complex plans.If I had to name a bad point, its that the game is essentially multiplayer-only. It is possible to play the game on your own, by controlling both ibb & obb yourself, but this quickly becomes an impossible multitasking demand. Its an unfair gripe though, because the game's whole point is about working together with a friend to solve the puzzles: don't buy if you don't have a friend to play with, otherwise, I can't recommend this game enough.

This game is a very good and unique game!Usually I feel like many platformers are mainly the same, which doesn't make it enjoyable for me.However, ibb & obb was very different.The gravity that goes both up and down and the puzzles give you a unique taste in the world of platformers.I played this game with a good friend and it was a lot of fun to play it.We have not yet been able to get a 100% in this game and I'm not sure if we will, but it is still worth playing and not something that really bothered me in this particular game.I am very positive about this game and I recommend it to everyone that's looking for a game to play with a friend.

												This is a really wonderful, relaxing-yet-challenging game. My fiance and I are both gamers, but we wanted something we could play casually together, just the two of us, without getting super competitive. This little puzzle game requires that you work together, and it's really fun when the two of you finally solve a challenging puzzle. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a bit of work to play with a friend or s/o.I'm only about 2 hours in. So far, my only complaints are that the scoring system isn't self-explained, and I'm not sure what the replay value of the game will be. Although, I'm sure we'll find out. The soundtrack and the art are both very beautiful, and the game was well designed. I'd give the game an 8.5/10, and definitely say it's worth a shot.			",110,16,0,23,2,1,10

												Cute and super fun. It feels like an arcade version of Portal in a lot of ways. But more relaxing and less ""Ah. No, GladOS! NO!"" an hour and a half of it went by in the blink of an eye.			",51,17,0,9,7,1,4

I bought the 2 game pack and gave one to my girlfriend and we play a lot and it's tons and tons of fun.  I'd recommend this to maybe couples or good friends, but possibly not for children as it will get very challenging later on, but if you have kids and want to challenge them this will definitely be a good game for that goal.

												A fun game to pick up and play with a friend or online. The soundtrack is amazingly relaxing and calm, one that won't wear out your patience if you're struggling on one of the obstacles. If anything, it probably helps with keeping you from getting frustrated. On that note, obstacles require creative ways to get around them, and playing in co-op really brings this out. The only downside I can see to this game is that there is no in-game way to communicate via text; players would have to communicate either through voice chat (in-game) or a Steam chat. Otherwise, this game is a really nice and enjoyable experience all around. All in all, it reminds me of Portal minus the frustration. Get it on sale, and you'll be a happy camper. 8/10			",92,26,1,5,8,0,2

												The concept may be pretty basic but they pull it off pretty nicely. The puzzles are designed for two people and they were fun and just challenging enough and overall me and my friend enjoyed playing it. Nothing we would play for a long period of time but it was pretty fun in short doses. And if the game works for you then you will probably have an alright time. However me and my friend experienced network issues all the time and it ruined the experience. Delay and stuff not spawning for both players are bad enough but we also experienced desynch issues which caused the game to be unplayable. Connection problems does also not mix well with checkpoints.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

												I had a lot of fun playing this with friends; it pretty much became a party game where everyone watched and cheered the two currently playing.It works in that you have a simple physics engine keeping the entire game together. What makes it difficult? The fact that teamwork is a must! Co-op games aren't usually this intensely reliant on how in sync - not just coordinated - you are with your partner! The art is charming, the music is fitting, and the whole premise is astounding. Rather difficult when playing with someone beside you, and dare I say practically impossible when playing without any way to speak or otherwise coordinate with your companion!I enjoyed this greatly and wholeheartedly recommend it.

												Ibb & Obb is a delightful indie co-op platforming experience but you need a buddy to play along with. It's strictly a co-op game, so that means either playing with a good friend or with random players. Like classic platforming, you run to the right and overcome obstacles together, the twist being that you have the ability to walk underneath the floor, parallel to the top. Many of the puzzles and enemies must be solved by using this ability, with one player being on top of the world and one underneath. There have been times where we have been stumped at how to progress thanks to this clever little mechanic. Momentum and jumping physics also play parts in the challenges for you to utilize. The game isn't the longest in the world, 3 hours and more for the secrets and collectibles scattered and hidden throughout. Visually, it's simple, using highly vectored and clean graphics with simple enemy design. You will see alot of back drops and paths being re-used with the difference being colours and ambience. The difficulty is pretty tame until the late stages which then ramps up like a bridge. Not a bad thing but you'll find yourself suddenly hitting a wall and being stuck. Although I have only played with a friend, i can see this being a difficult time with random players. You might have trouble with players who lack patience or rush ahead leaving you behind. There is no in game chat that I know of, with the only intstructions you can give is by moving the mouse around to draw lines and paths if you're trying to show how to progress.Overall, 3/5.

												This is a delightfully fun casual platformer. Think old-timey Super Mario meets Portal. The horizon mechanic where one or both players can occupy the upper or lower portions of the level is fun and adds a little bit of flavor to your standard platformer.It also implements a light level of physics as jumping through gateways retains momentum a la Portal. This becomes a pretty important mechanic later in the game.My only negative is that it is an extremely linear game. There is only one way to solve a level--period. Not exactly a huge ding, just noteworthy.			",99,4,0,4,11,0,8

												Very few games do co-op right. Some have little to no co-op interaction, and the players might as well be playing alone. Some have ""shared lives"" where the less experienced player feels like they're dragging down the team. Ibb & Obb has the best co-op mechanics of the many, many cooperative games I've played.Ibb & Obb is a puzzle platformer. Both players are needed to solve every puzzle, meaning a player is never left out or dragged behind. Sometimes the puzzles require that the players fill specific roles--Ibb. the green guy, is allowed through green portals and Obb, the red guy, is allowed through red portals. The developers cleverly alternate the use of these portals to ensure that no one player always takes the active role in each puzzle.My sole criticism is that Ibb & Obb doesn't have in-game communcation to match the intricacy of its puzzles. Players can only draw colored lines in the air, but they are fairly short and fade quickly. This problem disappears if you're playing couch co-op or are using a mic.The puzzles are excellent and make clever use of teamwork and physics.The graphics and visuals are very pleasing.The soundtrack is amazing and certainly worth owning as well.Ibb & Obb is among the best of the indie, co-op, puzzle-platform, and artsy genres. If you've got a co-op buddy, this game is definitely worth your time.			",526,192,10,64,44,4,102

												Very few games do co-op right. Some have little to no co-op interaction, and the players might as well be playing alone. Some have ""shared lives"" where the less experienced player feels like they're dragging down the team. Ibb & Obb has the best co-op mechanics of the many, many cooperative games I've played.Ibb & Obb is a puzzle platformer. Both players are needed to solve every puzzle, meaning a player is never left out or dragged behind. Sometimes the puzzles require that the players fill specific roles--Ibb. the green guy, is allowed through green portals and Obb, the red guy, is allowed through red portals. The developers cleverly alternate the use of these portals to ensure that no one player always takes the active role in each puzzle.My sole criticism is that Ibb & Obb doesn't have in-game communcation to match the intricacy of its puzzles. Players can only draw colored lines in the air, but they are fairly short and fade quickly. This problem disappears if you're playing couch co-op or are using a mic.The puzzles are excellent and make clever use of teamwork and physics.The graphics and visuals are very pleasing.The soundtrack is amazing and certainly worth owning as well.Ibb & Obb is among the best of the indie, co-op, puzzle-platform, and artsy genres. If you've got a co-op buddy, this game is definitely worth your time.			",526,192,10,64,44,4,102

												Casual coop adventure for 2 people.Players can be both local or online connected (steam friends). This game requires both of players to survive until the end. I can't leave my friend alone when I pass the obstacles or make my friend go first into the danger to die. Most of the gameplay is puzzles, in which I talk with another player about how to deal with tricks. Communication is a large part of what I enjoyed in this game, since some tricks are really difficult and we had to join forces. Nicely made coop gameplay, also it has such neat graphic as screenshots show. And.. if you want, this can be played alone with both hands.			",632,321,16,73,71,9,69

												Great coop platformer which provides for a bunch of funny, frustrating, rewarding moments with a friend.Controls are super responsive and puzzles are really nicely thought, making getting into the game a zero effort task.Although the pointers help communicating and synchronizing the moves with the other, voice chat is super recommended, not for coordination, but for sharing your laughs and victorious remarks, as well as the expletives when either of you repeat some actions for the 111th time and the other fails miserably that one time when you were about done with the current puzzle.10/10 would troll and be trolled by my buddy again.

												ibb & obb is a 2-player puzzle platformer best played on the couch with a steam controller.  Most levels are easy enough to beat but tricky enough to keep you interested.  There's almost no mechanical skill to the game; it's all about wrapping your head around simple puzzles based around the idea that gravity pulls you toward the centre (instead of the bottom) of the screen.If you want a fun co-op platformer, ibb & obb is the game.

												One of the best 2-player co-op games I've played in recent memory. I bought a 2-pack when the game was on sale and sent one copy to a friend, and we finally got around to playing it last night. We ended up losing track of time and were still at it 2 hours later.The game has an amazing soundtrack, and I love the art.Some of the puzzles are tricky, but it's a pretty good feeling when you finally figure them out.This is one of the few games that gets a solid 10 from me.

												So, ibb and obb...with a name like that I'm not that surprised that some people were like ""Meh, it looks trippy, I don't wanna play it."" But for the people who played the game they were in for quite the experience. Ibb and obb is a beautifully crafted game. It's definitely one of the best looking games I've ever seen. Most of the time I really appreciate when games go for a super edgy and dark look, but ibb and obb is a soft colorful game. It's abstract where as other games try to be realistic. But sometimes realistic works exceptionally well, like take for instance Mechaniarium! But back to ibb and obb. It tells you what to do without any words! There aren't even any cut scenes or thought bubbles or arrows pointing you into any direction! You just have to go from right to left like Mario Bros. 1... I think that was done really well, because it gives you time to figure out a problem with your friend. Ibb and obb is a two player game, there is no one player, but I don't see how a one player would work all that well with this game. You can play alone but ibb is controlled by the arrow keys, while obb is controlled by the wasd keys. But the main focus of the game is team work and puzzle solving. ""TEAM WORK?!?!"" I know some of you are thinking ""*SCOFFFS!*"" But in all honesty it's best to play with a friend. This game has online multi player which is awesome! The goal of this 2D side scrolling (adventure?) platformer is to beat the krabs, a race of spikey beady milky white pupiless eyed black sea urchin looking creatures. To defeat them you must use the power of 2 dimensions, I mean literally two separate dimensions split apart by a line in the center of the screen.  The top half being right side up, while the bottom half being upside down. Portals spread through out the world of ibb and obb allow you to pass through them so you can journey between dimensions or should I say ""PLAINS"". The game is split up into 5 worlds, or lands, or chapters, whatever...having 3 levels in each of them. Every world introduces a new game mechanic or enemy type. The game gradually gets harder with you soon over coming incredibly challenging puzzles and strategies for taking out krabs. Some crawl, some, bounce, some fly, some will follow you and I swear you will hate those followers, I like to call them kreepers, or kapers, whatever. To defeat a krab you must hit it's weak spot that is right bellow it or above it depending on where the krab is, on another dimension. Sometimes when a level gets to a big challenge the music will get slower and more melodic. That's another thing I have to mention the music is some of the best music in general I've ever heard!!! This game may seem like a colorful, cute game for all ages, but there are some parts of the game that feel...a little...unsettling to say the least. It's not until the last world in the game where things start to not feel right. Everything is all sharp and jagged and the music is creepy. Krabs are EVERYWHERE, and this may be my imagination but, it seems that you're not welcome at all in this strange part of the game. The last level has down right SCARY music. If you want to know more about these songs just look up on youtube ibb and obb krabs. For the down right scary song look up ibb and obb krabs chased. Anyways, back to the reveiw. If the game wasn't challenging enough there are also secret levels and achievements. That will push you to the brink of insanity! But at the end of every level you are greeted with a dancing trio who just want to party and celebrate ibb and obb's success. There are crystals hidden in every level and hidden inside krabs that add to your overall score and how good the victory/ party theme will be at the end of every level. Plus there are trading cards for all of the gate keepers. The guys who let you into the secret levels. Let's not forget about ubb the secret third character who's controlled by the hbnm keys. WARNING, he only appears in local co-op or single player where you and a friend share a key board, you might need a third buddy for ubb. My only complaint is that once you get ubb I wish you could permanently have him and can select him as a third player on the main menu screen. But then all the levels would have to be reconstructed into a three player game... Oh well! Another complaint I have is I wish you could have better communication with the other player in online co-op. For example, if you type something in with the keyboard and then press enter you'd have a little green or pink speech bubble appear over ibb or obbs' head. The bubble would be the color of ibb or obb, or ubb. It would hover over their head and follow them around until you press delete, which will get rid of the bubble. This game is an amazing experience from start to finish. I highly recommend this game to everyone. At least just give the first level a try. GG Sparp Weed, GG. (Sparp Weed is the company that made ibb and obb.)                                                                                                                   THIS GAME GETS 9.5 OUT OF 10			",3,2,0,1,2,0,0

												This game is an utter glitch disaster. We could not finish the final level because my friend had 3 of the final boss on her screen, while for me i could push her in the boss without her dying. At some point we got the achievement we finished the game, we were at the credits and the game crashed.This is just the example of the worst glitch of the game but not nearly the only one.So, not recommend at all.

												This is a pretty fun game by itself, however it really shines in two player gameplay. Controls are smooth and easy to use, graphics are simple but charming, and the levels get progresively more difficult with time making sure that you wont get bored with it. I would recomend this game for single play but only if you have alot of time on your hands, it simply isnt as fun as two player mode. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to any two pople who enjoy solving puzzles together.			",66,7,1,9,6,0,4

												Do you like other people? Do you like video games? Do you wish you could merge your love of video games with your love for other humans? Never fear, this game is LITERALLY designed for that! Command one half of the keyboard each; one keyboard + one controller; or two controllers. Although there's going to be frustrating periods where you'll yell at each other for not following each other's hastily thought-out instructions.Graphics: 10/10. Colourful, great paralax background, so many ♥♥♥♥ing colours. Can your graphics card drive a monitor? Then you can play this game! I can even switch to my integrated graphics card to run this game at 1080p 60 FPS, which saves my laptop from heating up. Sound: 10/10. Every sound feels like it was lovingly-crafted, and it shows. The sound is complementary to the game, and it really sets the mood.Gameplay: 8.5/10. Gameplay is clear, consistent, and varied. Each level is unique, but not unique enough you'll get lost. New gameplay concepts are introduced very well on-the-fly. However, some challenges require a lot of out-of-the-box complex thinking, so you will get stuck for maybe 20-30 min on a particular section. Overall (not an average): 9/10. Buy this game on sale!

												It is a journey between two friends to reach a party. Obstructed by black blobs that prevents you from passing the linear world, you rely on varius elements on the world to proceed.There are many mechanics similar to portal that may inspire fans to play.Solving puzzels, relying on your partner, and befriending the little yellow buds you see in your travels will be more than any thing you may felt.Also, its great practice for controling your temper :)Don't blame anything too much and try to enjoy it!

I'd recommend this to maybe couples or good friends, but possibly not for children as it will get very challenging later on, but if you have kids and want to challenge them this will definitely be a good game for that goal.

No regrets purchasing it at all. You got to learn how to deal with gravity and etc too so.....keep in mind you might spend quite a few minutes like I have trying to figure out how to get through the levels.

												While this game does many things very well, there are a couple that really bothered me.ProsThe game has a very cute and minimalist aesthetic that I enjoyed.The puzzles have a pretty good difficulty curve, with progressively more challenging puzzles.I also liked how the game exhibited new mechanics. There are virtually no words throughout the game, and the game does a nice job of showing you how to do something before you do it (at least for the beginning puzzles).NeutralThe controls felt a bit off at first. The jump felt a little too floaty. But after about 10 minutes, it wasn't hard to adjust to it.ConsWhile I said that the difficulty curve is fine overall, much of the latter part relies too heavily on being able to precisely time and coordinate movements between your partner with little room for error. If you or your partner mess up, you'll have to retry.My main gripe however, which will probably sound pretty inconsequential, is the fact that the game doesn't exactly excel. The game does things well, but not really well enough to stand out. It makes nice use of it's gravity-changing doorways, so they don't feel tacked on, but unfortunately, there's not much else to set it apart, and with so many indie puzzle platformers, you really need to do so.

												I wish there was a way to make a neutral review on steam. Since Ibb & Obb is a wonderful game. But there's points where the level design is borked so bad you have to restart, which takes a century when you're playing over the internet.There's points you have to go back to solve a puzzle but you just can't, making the game more furstrating than anything, it's really just not fun. Some checkpoints/respawn points are unclear as well, so if you get past the point you could get locked out of solving a puzzle, you could be sent right back to it for making a bad jump.I really wish I could like this game. It has brilliant game feel and everything else, but good lord does having the game actively work against you when you're trying to a simple thing like play it just not fun.			",42,14,1,6,5,0,1

												A true coop game, where you have to coordinate and plan every move with your coop partner instead of just playing besides each other without really cooperating, as it is often the case with other coop games. It begins as a light-hearted, cartoony jump'n'run, but the challenges get harder and harder and require a lot of trial & error and carefully timed button presses of both players. One downside is that it is not possible to save your game during levels, which take more and more time to solve as the game goes on.			",236,99,4,27,31,4,28

												Incredibly frustrating, extremely fun.You have doubtless seen many reviews of ibb and obb praising its cuteness (it is cute) and clever puzzles (they are clever) and the high requirement for solid teamwork (it does require very solid teamwork) and seen the recommendation that it is ""good to play with a girlfriend or kids"".Use caution with the last.  Seriously, this is an excellent game, but it is a rough introduction to puzzle platforming once you get to the later levels--many of the puzzles require nearly flawless timing, and that's generally fine because you don't go back too far and the reset is fast, but those new to gaming will be sorely tested.  I have to give the devs a great deal of credit for tuning some of the puzzles to a razor's edge of perfection, and we found many sections where we knew what to do and came to the conclusion that it was impossible before seeking a walkthrough and discovering we had the right solution--we just weren't good enough and needed more practice.  I myself am OK with that (I love games like VVVVV), but my partner, who loved the game as it started, reached a point of ""this just isn't fun now.""  We have one more level, and I do hope we finish it.So I love it, and do recommend it as an excellent coop puzzle platformer, but I would exert much caution using it as someone's first introduction to gaming.

												I really wasn't expecting too much of this game. Just a simple platformer for cooperative play and a bit of light fun.As it turns out some of the puzzles can be rather tricky to work out and require some teamwork and coordination. Not sure if it was due to networking issues, or a fault in the game, but trying to cope with a delay between the players just made it even more challenging. But also really rewarding when finally getting it right.Maybe the standard price is a bit on the steep price for such a simplistic game, but if you find someone also interested in puzzling platformers with a rather different art direction, this is a good game to check out for an hour or two's fun. Can't really speak to the length, as I have yet to complete it.			",564,127,21,71,33,6,90

												This game is great! I played through it with my GF and we had a blast! Some of the puzzles are pretty challenging but very rewarding once you solve them. Highly recommend this game :)			",44,6,1,4,1,0,2

												One of a kind puzzle game; built entirely around co-op mechanics. Whoever you choose to play it with will laugh at you, yell at you, maybe even quit on you... but in the end, it will be worth it. It's challenging but offers a good upward scale of difficulty as the levels go on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
