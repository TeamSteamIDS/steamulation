												Basically, there is an alternate reality where Nintendo made a SNES 2 instead of the N64, and this was the best game ever made on that platform.			",191,78,5,21,18,1,29

												If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.And an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.			",90,7,0,10,6,1,8

												If Owlboy had come out during the height of the Genesis/Super Nintnedo days, it would be a game you'd look back on with heartfelt nostalgia, and point to as an example of how good the classics were back then.  How good the stories could be, and how deep you could find yourself falling into them.  How fun they were.  You'd remember how lost you'd get in the world, and its people, and the fantastic music and art.  'They sure don't make them like this anymore,' you would lament.  'That was a great era.'Owlboy is a good few decades late to the Super Nintendo/Genesis days, but it honestly stands toe to toe with the best offerings of that era, and I don't say that lightly.

Product received for free
 Target Audience:    Adventuring OR Platforming Fans Summary:  A solid purchase for those looking for a different “platforming” experience. You were probably drawn to the game due to its striking visuals, and well, it definitely delivers in that area. There's some beautiful environments and some great character designs here, and they all complement some great animation work. That great presentation continues with the music as well, as it perfectly captures the mood of each of the gameplay sections perfectly. And that great presentation ends up complementing a rather solid story, with good set pieces and interesting characters. I loved the world that was built here, even if I wanted to see more of it in the end. There's no performance issues, as the 60 FPS never dropped a single frame, at least from what I saw. As for the gameplay, that's where the game starts to show some more faults, but that's not saying much. The “platforming” here (despite it being a game with flying), is rather solid, as it keeps things fresh by changing its traps and reconfiguring them on a regular basis. The combat controls do work and have a unique feel to them, although the lack of enemy variety in the end does end up hurting the game combat sections overall. When it does change up this combat sections, it definitely works, but I wish it did it more often. But the unique feel of the game still carries this game to a solid recommendation. Video Review:  


YouTube™ Video: Owlboy (Review): Boy, what a Hoot! 

			Views: 4,043		

			Should you give a Hoot about this adventure game? This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes. Owlboy went through a long development process to finally come to the various PC store...		

 Lists: Positives: Strong visual artstyle that's backed up with great animation. It reminds me of the 16 bit era, but it also feels like an upgraded version of it in the process. The devil can be in the details, but Owlboy has the details to make it look great in almost every situation.  Story telling is strong. Great Story set pieces that keep you interested in the plot as it develops. In addition, the game keeps a great storytelling pace without any filler content.  Strong “platforming” variety. Game does a good job of introducing new traps and changing up the configuration of already introduced mechanics to help keep things fresh.  Fun characters that make you want to see more of their world.  Like the “weapon” mechanic. Switching between characters, and having the center of the shot gravity be at a different angle from normal: really does help make the game stand out.  Controls are exactly where they need to be for the gameplay in question. Both the keyboard and the controller work here thanks to the game design in question.  If you were concerned about performance, well, don't be. 60 FPS is what you'll get. There was not a frame drop that I could see.  Some of the boss battles are rather cool, like riding a giant rock worm around. Like the final boss battle of the game, as it felt like a little bit of a different twist on the “weak point” formula.  The music is high quality. A good selection that captures the appropriate emotions and feel of each stage in question, and it'll be something that you'll want in your library to listen to time and time again. Can get lost in it. This is a good difficulty in terms of hitting a flexible enough game to be beatable my a majority of people, without it feeling like a horrible waste of time for others. While yes, as I elude to in the negatives, I wanted a bit more difficulty, it feels right for its projected audience. Reasonable options from an indie game, at least in my opinion.Negatives: The combat's difficulty is not where I'd want it to be at several points. This game is a lot about pattern recognition, but unlike Mega Man or Shovel Knight, the precision needed to counter those patterns is rather of a low skill ceiling. Enemy Variety could use an improvement. You can get lost in the game rather easily, and the game doesn't have an in game map for you to easily reference. A simple map would have fixed this, or at least pointing to the direction you needed to go.  Character building can feel off at times, as it seems to miss a step here and there in the natural progression. Some situations can make you feel like you've been backed into a corner, and mostly due to some game design elements. This is rare, but it feels like the game is inflexible for certain situations (changing screens in particular).  In the end, I want a little bit more content out of the game. The game delivers, but with some of the strong world building, I wanted some more side elements for the game.  ",529,87,7,50,31,6,50

												I personally had a  great time playing this game. Not going to lie at first i was skeptical about getting it because the price SEEEMED high.  After thinking about it alittle i realized that i've paid more for games that gave way less gameplay or overall lost interest very very quickly.First off if your going to make a big stink over $25 / $22.5 then simply add it to your wishlist, wait for a sale if you must and be done with it. There is no need to cry and moan about a price that was given. There really is no need for that in the forums or comments. A minimum of 10 hours of fun for $25 is pretty damn good if you ask me.After beating the game i can say though that i wish there was more to the ending. The game had it's moment's where it was pretty easy with little to no challenge of progressing. But the further into the story i got, i had quite a few moments where i was getting frustrated at certain bosses and/or areas (Beware of the monkeys!!!!!). The end game boss wasn't as tough as i thought it would be. One of the only bosses that really urked me was a particular monkey.... lots of dying i did. In any case this game genuinely made me feel happy when playing. Enjoyed just flying around mindlessly roaming, enjoying the music. Every time i got off the game to take a little break, i couldn't wait to get back on it. I have my fingers crossed that some DLC of some sort is released for this in the future. Would of been nice to have another character to play as haha. ""Owlgirl"" maybe? ^^ I loved every moment of the game.... i don't see what's not to love. If your considering it, just go for it and buy it. I don't regret getting this game at all. If your second guessing and don't think it's worth it for the price then you don't know what your missing, then again christmas is coming soon. You could add it to your x-mas wishlist and hope someone awesome gets it for you. 9/109 Because i wish it didn't end! Loved it so much! but honestly it's a 10 :]			",377,181,4,56,34,4,18

												Definitely one of my top gaming experiences and for sure the best game I've played since ""Ori and the Blind Forest"". Owlboy actually exceed the top level of 16-bit platformers and hopefully will be an inspiration for more great platformers in the future.Ah, and I have no doubts that this is the best platformer of 2016.

												Note: I have played with patience and attention (stopping to explore the world, not speeding though the game, etc.) and for longer than is recorded here for some unknown reason (circa 7-10 hours)I'm not trying to dismiss the work that went into this game or the enjoyment that others have clearly got from it - I just want to share my personal experience, which was most surprising to me.I really, really wanted to like this game - it seemed full of things that I love in games (pixel art, focus on storytelling/character, metroidvania-style gameplay, beautiful music, etc.) and it was clearly made with lashings of love and attention to detail.I just found myself not engaging with the story, the action or even the beautiful environment at all. It's hard to say why exactly, but despite really putting an effort into getting involved with the game, I found myself completely detached throughout - from the characters, the atmosphere and especially the gameplay.The game is much more about twin-stick shooter style action than exploration or platforming, and this is made rather frustrating by a character/weapon swapping/picking-up/dropping control system that pretty much leads to a constant stream of redundant button presses every time there is action onscreen. I was playing with an XBox style controller, and I cannot imagine how anyone could even attempt to play through this without a similar gamepad, such is the amount of trigger/stick fumbling involved. It really puts up a wall between the player and Otis.You'll spend most of your time wrestling with this while battling through a series of rather repetitive dungeon areas - the most challenging aspect of which is the sheer patience they demand, with room after room of beautiful-looking but functionally-similar puzzles/obstacles. I found myself battling through the dungeon areas just to finish them, as opposed to seeing what comes next. Also, the frequent interruptions to play (mainly the over-long recovery times when you take damage), the fact that 90% of the meaningful actions you can take are performed by the characters you are clumsily carrying about, and the sterility of the core flying movement made me feel very detached from gameplay. I was, like Otis himself, just drifting across the wonderful landscapes, not really feeling their presence.  I adore Castlevania: SOTN, Cave Story, Knytt, Within a Deep Forest and Treasure Adventure Game - I'm always on the look out for games that evoke this kind of atmosphere + progressive exploration combination. I was disappointed to find myself just going through the motions as I played Owlboy, eventually stopping before I could finish the final section. I'm probably just missing out on something, given the vast numbers of positive reviews, but I was genuinely shocked at the disparity between the scores here on Steam and my own experience of play. I hope this is not discouraging to the developers, who are hopefully enjoying some well-earned praise at the aesthetic beauty of their creation. I just didn't find this game very much fun.

												I will preface this review by saying that Owlboy is, overall, a good game that most people will enjoy. Looking at it objectively, it is at least a solid 6 or 7 out of 10. Those who value art and are able to get into the story are likely to rate it even higher. This review, however, is here to express the viewpoint of someone who did not particularly enjoy most of the game, and to explain why it might be one to avoid for similarly minded gamers.In a nutshell, there is one thing Owlboy does amazingly, one thing it does atrociously, and a lot of perfectly adequate game in the middle. The pixel art is second to none. The game's lengthy development cycle is evident in every single piece of scenery, every character, every cutscene, and most importantly every gorgeous animation. The artists that worked on this game deserve nothing but praise, as they have managed to achieve something truly beautiful. I have seen a number of people compare this game to Ori and the Blind Forest, and in the art department that comparison is certainly an apt one. Ori may still be the king of gaming visuals overall, but Owlboy steals the crown when it comes to pixel art.Where Owlboy does not compare favourably to something like Ori is in the gameplay, and here comes my greatest nitpick. I say nitpick, because for many people this will likely be much less of a problem than it was for me. If you're a gamer who shares this particular niggle, however, you'll understand immediately how one seemingly small problem can all but ruin an otherwise enjoyable experience:I am not at all exaggerating when I say that I never once played Owlboy for longer than five minutes without the game wresting control away from me. Most of the time the interruptions were far more frequent.Whether it is for a character to deliver a line of dialogue, a cutscene to occur, a door to open, or some other scripted event to play out, Owlboy delights in dragging you out of the moment with constant jarring interruptions that destroy the pacing and flow of the experience. The vast majority of these are completely unnecessary. Even many of the lines of dialogue do not require a pause in the gameplay for them to be delivered. There are moments in the game where characters talk, doors open, and scripted sequences occur *without* taking control away from the player, and they all work perfectly.The most egregious examples of the above are when otherwise intense boss fights are interrupted multiple times for lines of completely unnecessary dialogue to be delivered and phase transitions to occur. I cannot stress enough just how much of a toll this takes on the pacing of the gameplay. Intense moments fall flat, brain-tickling puzzles become annoying, and any section you have to repeat more than once becomes infinitely more tiresome thanks to the arbitrary interruptions. This problem permeates every aspect of Owlboy, dragging the entire experience down and souring a lot of the game's goodness. It's such a shame to see, especially after such a long development cycle, because all of it would have been completely avoidable with more awareness of how to create good pacing in gameplay.Besides the above, most of Owlboy falls into solid ""good"" territory. There are annoyances here and there, but also plenty of cool moments and clever bits of design to counterbalance them. There's no map or objective indicator, which can at times be a frustration in a metroidvania-esque game like this, but for the most part the levels are elegant and direct enough to avoid too much confusion. The bosses are very fun and satisfying when they aren't interrupted too much, and all of them are unique and memorable. The story is just fine, though nothing to write home about. There's enough emotion and drama to hit plenty of people right in the feels, but in a world where we have games like Undertale or The Walking Dead, the writing ultimately comes across as pretty middle of the road. There's passion and heart in it, however, and while the dramatic beats didn't really have enough substance for me, Owlboy at least puts far more effort into its story than the majority of games out there. The soundtrack similarly hits the correct emotional beats, but none of the tracks ever stuck in my mind for long or made me want to look them up on youtube afterwards.Core gameplay-wise, again, it's just fine. Shooting is fun and punchy. The dash feels good. General movement is okay, but doesn't have much satisfying momentum or weight to it. You don't soar like a bird so much as just drift around the screen. There are a couple of ill-considered platforming segments that do not feel good to play at all, but they're few and far between. Some abilities and their associated controls feel responsive and well-implemented, others are a little finicky. Most of the game's puzzle gimmicks are enjoyable if a little shallow. There's really not a whole lot to talk about in this regard. Owlboy plays just fine. It does what it needs to do. Not great, not bad, just good enough and largely competent.In regards to difficulty, Owlboy is quite forgiving without ever feeling too easy. There's just enough challenge to make beating bosses and clearing areas satisfying. Some bits will be tough for players who are less experienced with the genre, but it's by no means a hardcore game. It hits the middle of the spectrum incredibly well.In summary, I was someone who hoped Owlboy might be a real game of the year candidate for me, in much the same way Ori and the Blind Forest was. Unfortunately, while Owlboy looks every bit the part, it doesn't quite stand up in the gameplay department. The constant interruptions were an ever-present problem, and everything else, while consistently above-average, rarely wowed me in the same way similar titles have. I made sure to finish the game so as to piece together an informed opinion on it, but at times it was something of a slog.If you're not picky about interruptions to gameplay, Owlboy is almost certainly worth the buy. There's a lot of great stuff in there, and if you love good art then it's worth the price tag for that alone. If you're a fan of the gameplay in titles like Ori and the Blind Forest, Shovel Knight or Freedom Planet, however (and if you're keenly aware of *why* their gameplay works so well), Owlboy may be something of a disappointment.

												Owlboy started off a bit slow for me.  I think it was because I was expecting more of a platformer but a majority of the movement in this game is completed through flying.  The longer I played it, the more it grew on me.  By the time I reached the end I was really in love with this game.   It has a ton of charm and a memorable cast.  The story was well crafted and is basically about an underdog hero trying to save the world.  It may be a bit cliched but overall this game is just really good and has top notch presentation.

												I don't normally write reviews. For any game pretty much. But this ones an exception. I've lost a lot of passion for video games these days. It feels like everythings so 'safe'. No one takes any risks or puts any passion into their work. Owlboy I've had a giant grin while playing. It's almost nostalgic and I've never even played it before. Solid controls. The sprite work in some scenes has just made me sit there and think to myself "".... god..... damn.....""10/10. Go buy it. These dudes put a lot of years into it, and it shows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Owlboy - Quick Game Review 

			Views: 1,026		

			Owlboy is a fantastic 2D action adventure that combines flying with platforming in the world floating among the clouds. Written review can be found on my website here:...		

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Owlboy is a fantastic 2D action adventure that combines flying with platforming in the world floating among the clouds.You play as a mute owl named Otus. Owls are a highly intellectual species, and you are a complete and utter failure in the eyes of your mentor. You’re constantly failing to live up to expectations, and always letting others down. With the imminent threat of pirates attacking, you manage to make a few friends with other misfits that believe in you. Together, you and your friends embark on a grand adventure to try and help save the world. There is a lot of action and combat throughout the game. Combat is interesting, and I like the mechanics. You fly around, spinning and dashing to avoid taking damage. You can pick up objects to throw at enemies, or heal yourself, and you can also carry your friends. While carrying a friend, you gain access to their unique weapon and ability.You switch between your companions to progress through obstacles, and defeat boss encounters. Changing from one companion to another is easy to do, and it’s often very clear which ally you should be using. At first, I was worried that I would have to monitor the ally’s health while in combat, and keep them safe. Fortunately, they can be thrown around and shot at while they aren’t being carried, so you don’t need to micromanage them. While you’re carrying them, you have to be more careful. If you or them get hit, you take damage, suffer a brief daze, and your friend falls to the ground. It’s not too inconvenient to drop your ally though, since you can immediately teleport them back to you with no cooldown on the ability.Pros:great story that's interesting and told well the whole way throughgame mechanics are fun to use, and made for some very enjoyable battlesall of the environments and levels are well designed, and offer good pacing throughout the game for a well-rounded experience; there are some areas where you will need to be quick, other areas where you will need to be stealthy, and then plenty of other places where you can take your timethe high quality pixel animation looks absolutely lovely; adorable characters, and nice environmentsa lot of detail and character development went into each character, giving them their own personality, demeanor, and cute character animations (even though Otus is mute, his expressions are always on point, and you can tell what he’s thinking and how he’s feeling)music and sound effects are done incredibly well throughout the game; the orchestral soundtrack is excellent, and it does a fantastic job of setting the moodcustomizable keybindings & controller supportCons:no cons or things to nitpick about come to mindThe game is open-world. You can venture back and forth between the different areas as you please. There is a fair amount to explore, and you can find hidden treasure if you want to. You collect these coins to obtain items from the shop, some of which increase the size of your health pool.Owlboy took me over 8 hours to complete, and I loved every minute of it. It’s not a game I feel the need to replay, but if I wanted to go back and collect everything, I could load the save right before the final boss.Conclusion:Some people may think that the price is a bit too high. At first I was a bit concerned with the price tag as well, but after finishing my playthrough without a single complaint, I’m completely fine with it. You can tell that a lot of hard work and passion went into creating Owlboy. It’s such a wonderful game, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a well-crafted 2D adventure with unique combat mechanics, charming characters, and an engrossing story. It’s truly an excellent game.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations here.You can also view this review on my website here.[www.azralynn.com] ",288,133,0,20,16,1,36

												I first played this game close to eight years ago as the time of this writing, and when I first tried that demo I got the impression of a good, albeit short, game. That impression was wrong, this is definitely a GREAT game.Owlboy is an adventure in the truest sense of the word. You'll explore, fight baddies, gain powerups, and make friends all throughout a wonderful world and story. The art direction is gorgeous, the animations of the characters and enemies are fun to watch, the music is a treat to listen to, and the story is a great mix of silly fun, abject terror, and heartwrenching moments. When I say that Owlboy is a great game, I mean it.That being said, the game is not without it's faults, by far the biggest being it's difficulty, which is all over the place. You'll breeze through some sections of the game only to be utterly crushed by others. While checkpoints are liberal, you'll be tearing your hair out through some sections of the game trying to figure out what to do, and the lack of difficulty options certainly doesn't help. Exacerbating the issue is that while cutscenes are skippable, some mid boss fight conversations are not, and the aforementioned emotional scenes rapidly lose their luster as your forced to watch them over and over again as you die repeatedly to the more difficult bosses.Also, don't be fooled into thinking this is a metroidvania game. While it is heavily exploration focused, and you can be rewarded for revisiting previously visited areas, the game is actually quite linear, and there isn't much reason to play it multiple times if you aren't going for 100%.Don't let that dissuade you though, Owlboy is a modern day classic, and other indie developers need to look to it as a gold standard for what can be done with both the platforming genre and pixel art. TL:DR Owlboy is a beautiful experience that is both innovative, original, fun, and sets a new gold standard for indie developers that unfortunately marred by some spotty difficulty, but still remains a must own.10/10 would recommend.

												For a game that took 9 years to make, you'd think that the creators of Owlboy would have plenty of time to polish every little bit of it...And you'd be right.From the gameplay to the music, the characters and the amazing art, Owlboy is a beautiful, fun experience that I'm kind of sad is over.Owlboy is a must-play game that I enjoyed every single part of. And don't be surprised if you often find yourself putting the controller down just to listen to the music and admire the art.			",132,25,1,14,9,1,6

												Firstly, I don't think the game is going to be worth $20 for a lot of people that play it. If you are on a tight budget and want to get a lot out of a game, this probably isn't for you unless you're a huge sucker for the art style alone.Gameplay wasn't too strong, but it had some decent parts. It improves a lot as the game goes on. 6.5/10Story was good, had a bit of a Miyuzaki feel to it for me, not too sophisticated but quite surreal and emotionally charged. 7/10Graphics are incredible, but I still think they could have used effects and parralax better. 9/10Music was very good, very fitting. Favourite tracks were probably 'mesos' and 'the troublemaker'. 8/10There are some other minor-ish design choices that I was not too keen on, such as lack of maps, the screen was quite claustraphobic at times and I was less inclined to explore everything because I didn't want to waste my time backtracking.Overall, I started out not really liking the game a whole lot, but it kinda won me over by the end. Overall I'd say 75/100.			",50,4,0,2,0,0,1

												Owlboy is a masterpiece of a game that is unfortunately in danger of being severely underated. This game is up there with such indie masterpieces as Shovel Knight and Undertale. The story is fantastic, the emotional moments FEEL emotional and the thrilling moments FEEL thrilling. The fact that a mute protaganist expresses himself moreso than the majority of main protaganists in most modern games is astounding. You are totally emotionally attached to the characters: you want the antagonists to fail and meet their demise whereas you want the protaganists to succeed. If you are skeptical about buying the game, don't be. The price (which, granted is high for an indie game) is justified by the (in my opinion) pracitcally flawless gameplay and story. This game has been totally worth the 9 year wait. 10/10			",122,23,0,7,5,1,5

												Just to maintain full disclosure, I am going to tell you two things:1: I speedrun this game.2: I know the developers (specifically, the level designer).Now, let me just say- this game is not for everyone. It will take you roughly 4-10 hours to complete without doing any side stuff. However, I don't regret a single cent of my purchase. Yeah, I've spent 80+ (at the time of writing) hours playing this game, but I also have purchased this game for several friends. Even if it sounds ironic coming from a speedrunner, this game is best taken slowly, at least on your first playthrough.This game has amazing controls, a fantastic soundtrack, lots of fun areas to explore, etc. Of course, you can't even mention this game without mentioning the graphics- wow. Even as a graphic designer, this game's visuals blow my mind.Overall, get the damn game. If you don't like it within the steam refund window, just refund it.			",159,22,0,21,20,0,12

												Owlboy left me wanting more.I was extremely excited to play Owlboy, and was really looking forward to what the game offered after the demo/first area I had seen on previews before.  A game this long in the making that has so much love put into it, with bright art, compelling characters, and good music too?  Sign me up.The game pulled inspiration in its mechanics from many other games I've definitely enjoyed.  It's hard for me to say there's anything ""bad"" about these elements or their execution.What Owlboy failed to do, for me, was combine the elements to make something unique or interesting, all the while being too short to make use of its by far strongest features; its art, music, and characters.Ultimately, I ended up with a game that felt like I was simply going through the motions.  Everything is serviceable, but nothing grand.Because of this, while I can't call the game bad, I also can't reccommend it if you're looking for the same things I am in a game like this.  I'm a huge player of RPGs, I love metroidvanias, Cave Story and Ori are wonderful action platformers that I can get lost in time and time again, and of course I'm always up for whatever twist Nintendo's been putting on their platformers.  Meawhile, the Ys series of Action/Adventure RPGs really works for combat/bosses even though its stories and characters are rather basic.  I have grander story RPGs to fall back on for a compelling story with developed ensemble casts.  If we want to talk about twinstick action gunning, I'll pull out my Genesis and take out Gunstar Heroes.  Close enough.If you feel you may fall into a similar category, given those quick examples, feel free to read my following thoughts on Owlboy:-The controls work fine, for the most part, as a 360 controller user, but there are times where your hands need to press multiple things at once, and the buttons needed are all over the face of the controller.  Having to keep a thumb on a second analog stick, an index finger on face buttons, and be ready for all shoulder buttons was probably the cause of this for me.  It didn't cause any significant problems, but felt like they could have been better, and more crisp (Compare to something like Ori and the Blind Forest)- The combat is very straightforward and very easy.  Something like Cave Story has much more intense fighting sequences, especially on the boss front.  Look into something like Ys that is straight up -made- for its boss fights, and the combat here pales in comparison.  I found the earlier fights more interesting than the latter ones, but it's still not saying much.- The stealth sequences that augment the combat I personally didn't find enjoyable.  Lots of waiting, and they never really evolved behind ""Stay behind cover while enemies move around.""  Even with checkpoints after every successful segment, the waiting involved in redoing stealth areas I found tedious.  They were easy, just tedious.- The puzzles are basic at best.  I'd almost argue there's more to puzzles in Namco's Tales Of series, but that's about the quality I got out of Owlboy's.- Exploration is not anywhere near as rewarding as a more common metroidvania.  For one, there's very little of it.  This game's world is -small- and most exploration simply leads to a checklist of coins for a relatively unrewarding upgrade system, and it didn't take much effort at all to get ""all those upgrades minus the 100% one.""  What exploration did exist didn't really feel like it tested skills so much as it tested ability to poke at every wall.  Missing were sections requiring you to execute some cute little tricks to obtain the reward (Platforming, basically).  Entirely missing are *fun* upgrades scattered throughout the game that increase your ability to navigate or perform.  The upgrades obtained through collecting are more akin to stat bonuses, not really changing how everything is approached.  Given, I didn't get the 100% upgrade, so who knows - maybe it's the most amazing thing.- The dungeons, where you'll spend the vast majority of the time, overstay their welcome a little bit for me, and are quite linear when all is said and done.  I would have preferred dungeons being a bit more compact and getting 1-2 more total areas as a result.- The art in this game is -very- good, the sprites are detailed, emotional, and the backgrounds are pretty full of life and color, given the art direction of the game.  This is one of the game's strong points, for sure.- Likewise, some of the music is fantastic too.  My bigger issue with the music is most of the pieces loved are not heard very often, as the game spends most of its time in dungeons with more of an ambience approach opposed to melodic themes you'd hear in every area of a Metroid, or Castlevania, or Cave Story.- The story and characters are good, but they don't get a time to shine, as everything starts quickly and ends quickly.  These things were very hyped up from many sources, especially considering the main character's status as a literal mute, but ultimately very little was expanded on.  There were many moments of charm, but they passed very quickly, so we could go right back into another linear dungeon.  You may have heard that characters don't do the whole ""It's okay, we got this, power of friendship, ACTIVATE!"" thing, and the events that happen in the story stick with them.  That's true (to an extent - the friendship-power-buddies thing is still there somewhat), but the weight of the actions upon the characters is never really felt, as there's simply not enough time that passes or dialogue to help facilitate the gravity of everything that's going on.  A short game is not a bad thing, but the other elements must be engaging enough, and in this case, the other aspects of the game simply didn't make up for the lack of time in this story.Owlboy has a few visual moments that are pretty stunning and awesome, but unfortunately it's almost impossible for me not to compare them to Ori's, which I'd say end up superior in both artistic direction and musical composition.  There's certainly one sequence in Owlboy that completely rocks, though.If you've stuck with me, I thank you for your time.At the end of the day, I didn't find myself curious to keep playing, and I just wanted to get it over with so I could see the payoff everyone said I'd get with the characters/story (Again, it ended up serviceable).  The gameplay elements are there, and they work, but I've played so many other games that do each of Owlboy's elements better.  While Owlboy brings them all together, each element ended up mediocre, giving me a very mediocre feeling at the end of this journey, which is a good bit shorter than I had hoped for.Best of luck to you if you give the game a shot, though I'd personally suggest waiting on a bigger sale - I hope you find it more fun and rewarding than I did.  It's clear many people are enjoying it, and I'm just one person.  Again, thanks for your time.Edits: I had some typos.  There are always typos :<			",81,11,0,22,2,0,5

												I feel I need to preface my review with some personal info; I am one of those overly critical persons who never likes anything. That said, the only negative thing I can say about Owlboy is that there isn't more of it. Not that I think the game is technically too short. I simply wish to spend more time in this world. When I sensed I was getting close to the final battle, I had to stop playing for several days because I didn't want this experience to be over.I feel it in every pixel that this is a work of passion, and that speaks to me on a personal level. Owlboy might not delve as deeply into its characters, or have as complex a story, as other story rich indie games out there, but I think that only adds to its charms. There is a definite story arc and development of the main character that anyone who has experienced anxiety will relate to and understand, and it doesn't need to be further explored than what hints and sweet little moments we see in the game. Those who talk smack about Owlboy's story and characters simply haven't looked too hard. The game doesn't spoon-feed you its complex ideas; they're there if you really want to look for them.Were I not a poor student, I would gladly buy this game at full price for all my friends in order to support the creators. Owlboy, to me, is far superior to all the other 'story rich' indie games trying to squeeze out tears through emotional manipulation and exposition. Owlboy feels genuine.Now I am just sad that there isn't more. For the love of ♥♥♥♥, give these people money so they can make more games.			",126,56,0,47,36,0,14

												A wonderfully nostalgic experience for those who grew up in the 8-bit era, and a fine modern game in its own right. The gameplay is tight, the visuals are stunning, the sountrack absolutely soars, and the surprisingly deep story is beautifully told with a cast of likable, understandable characters. A few small sections of the level design feel a bit harsh, sometimes requiring more trial and error than I might have liked. One could argue that this is an authentic nod back to the games of yore, but I felt it stood at odds with the rest of the game's immaculate design. Admittedly there are a few other anachronisms, such as the lack of a map/minimap or fast-travel, both of which became a small hindrance when trying to hunt down all of the collectibles hidden throughout the game world towards the end of my playthrough... but none of this did much to hamper my overall enjoyment of an otherwise brilliant game.Highly recommended!

												Try to ignore the hype around how long the game took to make, it doesn't really show in any area besides the quality of the visuals. Owlboy is a decent game dressed up with really gorgeous pixel art. The gameplay lacks a strong central mechanic, the controls aren't great, the movement speed is just slow enough that traversal feels really tiresome, and I always had the feeling that the level and creature designs were never really playing to the mechanics' strengths.Story-wise, it's an okay effort, but nowhere near what the game or some of the reviews would have you believe. I always felt like it was trying to puff up what was in actuality a pretty small package. At the first campfire sequence before you've reached the Owl Temple, Geddy talks about how it feels like they're on a real adventure. I could think of similar scenes in other games and mediums where there was a real sense of travel and reflection, but all I could think of was ""what? we're doing this now? we've only been out of the first town for less than 5 minutes"". It was a nice looking scene but it really showed the distance between what I was feeling and what the game wanted me to feel.There were some nice character moments scattered about but, like the story, the cast is not as timeless or loveable as the game might want you to think. They're cutesy and inoffensive but they all felt a bit thin. The only moment that really grabbed me was listening to the old man from the hot spring reminiscing in the ruins. I wished the main characters impressed on me in the same way.Ultimately, the game is okay. I'm marking it as not recommended to reflect a level of overall personal dissatisfaction, but I think the general praise implies that it resonates in some way with a lot of people. I really wish the game was as good as it wants to be.			",68,12,0,7,6,0,5

Posted: November 5, 2016
The great but inevitably massively overrated by fans Indie title of 2016No i don't mean that against the game at all, there's just a game each year that fans oversell massively leading to many arguments online, I believe Owlboy is this year's game for that.  The obvious draw to this game is it's immaculately detailed pixel art style with 9 years to create and refine and I will agree along with the many others and say it delivers. The world is vibrant and interesting consistently with beautiful environments throughout. The audio and soundtrack also come in to enhance the art style in order to build a very enjoyable experience. The game is absolutely worth a purchase for it's artistic work in itself(or even grabbing the game + soundtrak bundle).The main overarching plot isn't impressive nor bad, you will probably roll your eyes when you discover it has 'that' story, I won't spoil but you've heard it before. the world however does have enough interest and intrigue to easily keep you invested throughout. Characters however is where the game does start to shine, each one is enjoyable and is interesting enough that you want to hear what they have to say or press the interact button till they run out of lines and you can find yourself caring about their fates. The over the top animations also do a great job of giving a much greater personality to the sorts of characters that would generally be uninteresting.All up Owlboy has successfully done what few games manage to do and that's create a complete package that oozes with charm and is in general an experience that's just enjoyable to experience and be in from start to finish.Gameplay is unfortunately where Owlboy starts to struggle.The main idea behind the gameplay, of Otus being fairly limited in how he fights but can carry objects carries a nice novelty and gets you to think a little differently. Each companion has a unique set of abilities to assist Otus in navigating the world and defeating a handful of creatures littering the world, some unique others are a new skin on classic platformer enemies. Unfortunately these concepts are burdened by the games levels having a clear ""use this character here"" vibe and very quickly becomes ""plant wall, shotgun"", ""bomb creature, there must be something breakable nearby"" some sections of the game do get you to think but unfortunately most of the time you're just absent mindedly running through the motions to progress, there's little room to play. With most of the gameplay then just falling into fairly standard platformer puzzles there's little to impress in the gameplay in that regard, nothing much is terribly done, but there's nothing amazing either, all up it's consistently 'okay'.  Controls can also be a little fiddly with many cases of struggling to interact with a specific item, having to pick up a character and throw them away to get to something or pick up something a few times before you get its position right, all up it's a minor annoyance most of the time and can be ignored.The game could also really do with a decent map, with the world being large with a short view distance it becomes very easy to become lost and i worry about anyone who's a real completionist as finding out the last few areas you haven't been to i can imagine will become a pain to figure out.Late game became slightly less enjoyable with slow tedious time based puzzles where accidentally tapping the jump/fly button a second time ruins everything. Yes, it also does the slowly rising screen where you jump on breakable objects with a split second to jump on the one that's just appeared at the bottom, is there anyone that enjoys that? Especially when it's happening so slowly you're not getting that rush that comes from having to jump at a million miles an hour.Finally, I found bosses, particularly late game to be genuinely unenjoyable with short cutscenes breaking the flow and unclear weaknesses that lead you to blindly shooting till you spot the weakness. the worst of which involving a pirate switched your character, showed a cutscene and then instantly jumps at you giving you some less than fair damage as you try to get out of the way and switch characters before projectiles start flying at you.  If the art style doesn't interest you i would not recommend this game, there's nothing else here for you. Everyone else however the world, visuals and sound track all easily compensate for any gameplay shortcomings and it's absolutely worth playing through if you’re after a game you can just relax and enjoy.6/10 gameplay9/10  as an overall experience  ",199,39,1,21,16,0,15

												In spite of not recommending this game, I don't think it's bad, by any stretch of the imagination.It just isn't really worth your time by comparison to all the other incredible games in the genre out there.If I could give the game a ""neutral"" rating, I would.If you're a fan of artistic 2D platforming sidescrollers, Owlboy will give you what you're looking for. However, if you're not already a fan of the genre, Owlboy will not convince you.This is a game that rewards patience. The controls are not intuitive. It is possible and sometimes likely you will get lost. But if you're willing to sit through it and learn, the game is enjoyable.If you're looking at Owlboy and thinking you might like it, you probably will. If you're thinking ""man, my friend is going on about this game, but I'm not really into these 2D sidescrollers"", then just skip it.It's one of those all-too-common-but-usually-more-than-welcome artisitic sidescroller platformer indie games.Pros:- The art is great- The music is good- The dialogue is excellent- The game is funny without trying to be a ""funny game""- There is plenty of complexity and a comfortable pacing of game mechanics- The difficulty is fair without being too easy. There are enough challenges for it to be satisfying, but never extremely frustrating (except for the Cannon minigame).Cons:- The controls are wonky and difficult to get used to- There is no map and you frequently get lost in the ""hub"" areas- There is no way to confirm/remind yourself what your current objective is- The story is all packed into the first and last 30 minutes of the roughly 9 hour game. Everything that happens in between that time is completely irrelevant to the overarching story, though it's still enjoyable.- It sort of drags through the middle part of the game- It doesn't stand out as being ""amazing"" at anything in particularThe game is fine. You could just do better with 8-9 hours of your time and $25. It's good, but not nearly as good as Ori and the Blind Forest, Cave Story, Shovel Knight, or Shantae.			",243,70,2,18,20,2,24

The absolute best sprite art saves this game from mediocrity.Look at any screenshot and it's instantly obvious the nine year development cycle went to good use. Every background asset and stage looks impeccable--even sharper as they actively transition from day to night before your eyes. An orchestral soundtrack of live instruments from TEN different people brings this world to life. I had to occasionally stop just to soak everything in.However, this game is host to a few glaring issues that I have to address. For a platformer, this game is very story heavy with plenty of lore to uncover. You'll find a lot of fascinating history, and a ton of character interaction. As you examine the characters more closely though you'll realize that their motivations are typically unexplained and often times complete nonsense. This is painfully apparent as the game and its story come to an end. If the game weren't so good at building up the characters and the lore then the ending and final leadup to it wouldn't have felt nearly as dissapointing. -----plot spoilersThe final boss only needed to talk for about thirty seconds to avoid the five minute long fight. ""I'm actually saving the world, not destroying it!"" would have avoided this repeat of the Magus fight from Chrono Trigger. ------Even on a basic level the plot fails to deliver. Why bother having the protagonist be mute if one of his partners always speaks for him? Wouldn't it be better to have him speak to establish stronger bonds among your party? The game shoots itself in the foot by refusing to answer any of the meaningful mysteries it presents, offering at best vague clues buried behind 3 hidden gold coin macguffins in the overworld (bonus: you can't access all the gold coins to read all the vague clues until after you beat the game). So much effort goes into building up both the plot AND the villain. He's a hulking, Darth Vader-esque titan. The screen trembles as he walks and every npc and ally cowers in fear as he approaches. There's a brilliantly animated cutscene that establishes just how absurdly strong he is halfway into the game and that's when♥♥♥♥♥♥really hits the fan. I was legitimately awestruck, mashing f12 as hard as I could. -----final boss spoilerThis boss ends without warning and without satisfaction. He dies in a cutscene with nearly no input from the player. You don't fight him. That is a tremendous letdown as much of my motivation lied within challenging this guy. The protag even powers up to fight him with the three Zelda artifacts. Imagine a good Sonic game without a final Robotnik supermassive Robot. Imagine Metal Gear Rising without the Senator. -----Much like the writing, the gameplay is a mixed bag. The Metroidvania exploration elements are very, very light, almost nonexistant. The levels and dungeons may as well be linear with a big hub world. Dungeons mix up the puzzles and gimmicks often and the cutscenes are a decent length (but unskippable, so forget about replaying it). Throw the big guy on the big switch to open the door. Hide behind the crate for stealth-lite sections. These are all gameplay elements you're familiar with. It's not revolutionary but it is servicable. You spend almost the entire game flying. Projectiles are nearly auto-aim so just focus on dodging rather than precision aiming. If you're close enough, you won't miss your shots. Flying and dodging a lot benefits bosses since now they can attack anywhere on screen but hampers the level design. It's not much of a platformer when you never step on the platforms. Dying is uncommon, but the punishment for death is almost nonexistant. You'll probably succeed on your first attempt against every boss since you're already free to focus entirely on not getting hit.Most people take about eight hours to finish this game, with another one or two in post-game collecting anything they missed. The reward for gettnig everything is a real let-down though so I'd recommend against doing that in retrospect. Keep the unusually hgih pricetag in mind as you mull over how long this game will satisfy you. This game is for relaxing. Load it up one weekend and submerge yourself in exquisite backdrops. Just don't expect much of a challenge. Try not to think about how many plot elements are left unresolved, or how the characters don't always make sense, or how the game's ONLY ending feels like a typical game's bad ending you get for not doing 100%.

 TLDR: Owlboy is an absolute buy for anyone who likes gorgeous, fun, 2D adventuring games.      Owlboy is an absolutely beautiful game in every sense of the word. Starting with the visuals, Owlboy isn't like most other pixel art games. While many other games use similar art in order to feel nostalgic or just to capitalize on that feeling to sell copies; Owlboy's visuals are a gorgeous, amazing, highly skilled art piece that is just fun to look at. Not once had I felt that a texture was phoned in or a lesser quality than the rest. The whole game feels like it was handcrafted to please the eyes.     The soundtrack has the same quality as the visuals, with several pieces causing the player to feel heartbreak or happiness depending on the track. The composer/musician spared no instrument to make this masterpiece of audio, and this is actually one soundtrack that I highly recommend purchasing.     The gameplay is a fun metroidvania-esque blend of platforming, twin-stick shooting and VERY light puzzle solving. The games metroidvania elements come from Otus' (the Owlboy) ability to pick up his different friends with different weapons. Each friend he picks up has a different mechanic tied to them which allow you to access different areas throughout the course of the game. This same mechanic highly effects combat as you carry your friend around, using the right stick to aim their weapon as different enemies try to attack you. It feels very responsive and is very reliable as it has a soft lock-on mechanic helping you to hit what you want to hit. While the combat controls well, it is too easy at times, especially on the boss fights which are over very soon after they begin. That being said, while the bosses might not have a lot of screen time, they are a blast to fight as you have to figure out how to get past their defenses, using the environment, or just plain outsmarting them. The puzzles, while fun and definitely rewarding at times are so simple most children could figure them out within a minute or two (at least most of them). While it does feel intentional for the puzzles to be this easy in order to keep the game flowing. Owlboy definitely isn't a game for people seeking any kind of puzzle gameplay. Overall the game has great pacing, fun gameplay that changes depending on what friend you are currently carrying, and controls that are easy to use and don't require explaining.     While trying to steer clear of spoilers, the story is centered around Otus. Otus is a sometimes clumsy, if not well-intended Owlboy that tries his best to save his town Vellie from attacking pirates. Using the help of his best friend Gebby, and other friends he meets along the way, he conquers many different obstacles and challenges that arise throughout his journey. The story grips you with its strong talons from the beginning and holds on to you throughout. Due to the gorgeous high-quality art style, each character has a full visible range of emotion that you feel in times of sadness, fear, joy, and peace. The villain is a high enough threat that you feel you need to find a way to stop him, instead of just brute force the problem. Which helps the game stay focused throughout its many different objectives. The story and subsequently the writing, are easily some of the best I have personally experienced in a 2D adventure game.     This game easily deserves all the praise it is getting due to its high quality throughout the entire adventure. The $25 price tag it holds at the time of this review might be a little steep for some people, but it is easily worth the price and those who take that leap are in for an amazing adventure with Otus the Owlboy.

												tl;dr: Good game, but keep your expectations in check.As someone who has been waiting 6+ years to play Owlboy, it’s a bit unfortunate to say that I have mixed feelings about this game. It deserves a thumbs up simply because the good outweighs the bad, and I'm sure there are people who'll love Owlboy to pieces despite its flaws. It’s great for what it is, but there’s some untapped potential here that I hope will be improved upon if there’s ever a sequel.Personally, I loved the universe, the amazing soundtrack, the beautiful graphics, and the protagonist (despite the fact that Otus never says anything). Interacting with the NPCs is always interesting and a lot of the time they say or do genuinely funny and adorable stuff. Otus’ gunners/companions aren't as likable as I feel they should be, considering that they're always around (since you need them for pretty much everything). Well, the exception being the last one you meet - at least he's got a bit of backstory and is somewhat relatable. I wouldn't mind a bit of dialogue/banter from them when you're flying around doing whatever needs to be done, since Otus (being a mute) is obviously silent all the time and the cutscenes are few and far between. Sometimes it feels like you're just doing levels for the sake of it and not to achieve anything, at least until you bother to read the reminded to see what your actual objective is.My only real problem with this game, though, is the difficulty. It's literally so easy that I don't think I needed more than five tries on the hardest boss - and that wasn't even the final one. There's no learning curve or need for tactical thinking in this game, you just shoot enemies and make the slightest effort to dodge their attacks - and that's the solution to winning every fight. You sometimes have to switch your gunners mid-fight, but you can usually win with whichever one you're currently carrying.Puzzles aren't challenging either, and I say that as someone with sub-par visual intelligence. Even finding every single coin in the world was fairly easy.The most difficult part in Owlboy is actually completely optional, and that is the mini-game that you only have to succeed 100% at if you wish to get every achievement (you'll use WASD to move Otus normally, but I couldn't complete the mini-game until I tried the arrow keys instead. Too bad I discovered that after 2 hours of messing up).I guess I hoped for more challenging gameplay to go with the story, but I enjoyed the game nonetheless. The world is extremely detailed and feels very alive, so getting immersed in it was no problem at all. Level design is clever and there's even a day/night cycle that makes the environment even more beautiful.Completionists will get more out of the game as the story is only about 7-ish hours long, but I’d say that Owlboy is definitely worth picking up regardless of what type of gamer you are; just don't buy it believing it's anything other than a casual, easy-going experience.

												I'll preface this by saying that I have nothing but respect for the developers who worked on the many iterations of this game for approximately nine years. Their dedication is certainly admirable, and their vision, while not fully brought to its potential, is readily apparent when you play the game. Truthfully, the game feels like it was developed by a team solely compromised of artists, not game designers. As players, we need to try to not hype this game up based on its development time or appearance. Look at how long Duke Nukem Forever took.With that out of the way, however, I couldn't find a way to connect myself to the story, the characters or the world itself. The art, while beautiful, doesn't make up for what, outside of the soundtrack, is a package that feels like it hasn't been properly fleshed out. Both the level and monster designs don't lend themselves well at all to the fundamental mechanics of the game, a conflict that ends up being one of the larger factors that pushes this game into overwhelmingly mediocre territory.The world is mostly empty and, despite its beauty, I hestitate to even call what you can do in this game world ""exploration"", with the exception of finding the golden discs, as there's a ridiculous amount of empty space and an almost upsetting lack of things to do, see and uncover.The story is about as mediocre as they come, despite its fairly strong start given Otus' state in the first five minutes of the game. The characters fall flat, the tale that the developers spun is nothing short of cliché and all in all, it just isn't anything special.Mechanically, the game is fairly standard twin-stick shooter affair with a few tweaks to the formula. While necessary in the open world, I had a few gripes with the Geddy teleporting system as it lessens the impact of being hit while within a dungeon. It just felt like more could have been done there.Ultimately, for a game so heavily toting its exploration, being able to 100% the experience in approximately 7-9 hours is laughable, and most definitely does not justify the price point that the game is currently sold at at the time of writing. There's very little worthwhile to find, too, which only cheapens the experience.Unfortunately, as previously stated, the breathtaking art and suitable soundtrack aren't enough to salvage a game otherwise wrought with mediocrity. If you're looking for a game that offers the exploration you might be looking at this game for, I implore you to check out Rabi-Ribi. They're very similar games, but Rabi-Ribi is infinitely better in execution as a Metroidvania style game. At a similar price point, you will get so, so much more out of it than you will with Owlboy.			",591,117,14,99,46,5,72

												Owlboy wants to please you. The game tries it’s hardest to put a smile on your face, and it nearly accomplishes that across the board. Whether it be the stunning pixel art (seriously, this is one of the most gorgeous pixel art games I think there is, period), sweeping soundtrack or the genuinely charming cast of characters, Owlboy’s aim is to please.After nearly ten years in development, Owlboy has finally released and boy is it great. As I mentioned, the first thing you’ll probably notice is the sublime art direction. You can really feel the love and attention to detail that went into crafting this world and is breathtaking landscapes. Whether it be the dusk sky or an underground cave, the game is simply a joy to look at. On top of the wonderful pixel art are the tremendous animations. Everything here is silky smooth with fluidity that really make everything pop and makes the world feel more alive.But graphics aren’t everything, right? Luckily, Owlboy is also fun to play and has exquisite controls to boot. While the minute to minute gameplay and standard enemies may not necessarily be that challenging, I still found it quite engaging to traverse and explore the world. The main mechanic of the game is that the character Otus can fly about while holding one of his friends who can fire their respective weapons. I quite liked this wrinkle and by the end of the game during boss battles, I found it quite thrilling to swap between the three friends to mix and match their weapons. Speaking of boss battles, these are some finely crafted encounters that will test your mettle. I found each boss to be tough, yet fair. I don’t think I beat any of them on my first go, but learning their patterns and weaknesses was very rewarding.While I would not call Owlboy a Metroidvania, it certainly feels like it wanted to be one. The world may seem quite open when you begin but the game is in fact pretty linear. I didn’t find this to be a bad thing, but it’s worth noting. What may alleviate the linearity for some is the excellent level design. The layouts of each area are smart and intuitive so you never feel lost. Going along with the Metroidvania-lite is the fact that there are upgrades, but they range from essential (health upgrades) to useless (hats). While I feel that if the devs fully fleshed this out and made it a true Metroidvania we could be looking at a truly special game, I still greatly enjoyed my time with Owlboy.If you’re looking for a game that will put a smile on your face and throw in a couple of laughs for good measure, you could do much worse. Owlboy is a beautifully realized world with a standout art direction and just the right amount of challenge to be enjoyed by nearly everyone. ",315,121,0,22,8,2,8

												Revered, exalted, wise. These are just a few of the words I would use to describe Owlboy.The developer D-Pad Studio took about a decade to make this game from conception to finish, and thankfully their efforts have made a masterpiece. I honestly would put Owlboy among the high echelons of indie games and other amazing games that have come before it. I am talking Shovel Knight, Binding of Isaac, Limbo, Fez; games that have shaped modern PC gaming as we know it. They have combined spectacular story telling, fantastic characters, dazzling design/artstyle, and from beginning to end enjoyable gameplay. This game was an absolute treat to play and is easily one of my choices for best game of the year, 2016.I don't say that just about any game. This game spoke to me in more ways than one, it captured my imagination and reminded me what I love about games.Now before I continue I want to put out a bit of warning, I highly recommend this title(obviously) but if you continue to read this I will be talking about game features, characters, and the overall experience of the game. So if you are considering even for a moment of buying this game. DO IT.Owlboy is game about courage, friendship, and adventure in the face of overwhelming odds. You play Otus, a young owl who is being tutored to join a long line of respected Owl guardian figures who protect and aid the people. Like quintessential heroes of yesteryear, poor Otus is mute and thus lacks in the self confidence department. His tutor Asio is tough and sometimes rough on Otus, expecting much from our young hero. The world was once densely populated with owls, but after a mysterious event, most of them have disappeared. When pirates show up at the village of Vellie, a trickster steals an important relic. This sets events into a spiral.It's hard to capture the game in one genre but it's somewhere between a Metroidvania and an Action/Platformer. The game is a side scroller that lets you fly in any direction. Obviously things like walls, doors, and other obstacles prevent from accessing areas you shouldn't but it never felt unnatural in Owlboy. Matter of fact, I have to compliment Owlboy on how natural the game combines the flow of story with little secrets hidden everywhere to be discovered. You always know where to go but you can take the entire game at your own pace. One thing to keep in mind is Owlboy emphasized on its story. It does away with the hundreds of hidden upgrades/secrets for more of a linear adventure like experience. The secrets that are there however, are very challenging to find and once found reveal more of the bright and wonderful world to you.Flying is one of the biggest treats in this game and the controls are fantastic; completely responsive. I mostly played with my keyboard/mouse but had no problems diving, dashing and swooping around my enemies and generally laying down a butt kicking. I can imagine the same could be said for a controller. Both control methods feature rebindable keys and an assortment of different control methods, even for you southpaws out there. The action is equally as riveting as you gather allies and companions giving you access to new abilities, ways to blast enemies and overcome obstacles. The action never got dull for me, as I found unique ways to deal with the many bosses of Owlboy.So now I am going to gush over the graphics and sound/music of Owlboy. Be warned. I want you to take a moment and look at a screenshot of Owlboy's clouds. LOOK AT THEM!I would gladly take these clouds ANY day of the year over any rendered 60FPS thing you could throw at me. The pixel art is gorgeous and there are several times throughout the game where it took my freaking breath away.  Attention to detail is at maximum here with each area/house lovingly given detail. The character designs and animations give the characters life in a joyous fantastical way. Every time Geddy would do his stupid dance, I would laugh my butt off. Don't get me wrong, this game isn't kittens and rainbows all the time. As a matter of fact there are plenty of times I was shocked by game itself and how dark things got. That never stops the game from being nonetheless a fun adventure and this is demonstrated in its art, level design, and animations. I honestly would be surprised if this game couldn't be adapted into an anime.Moving on to the music of Owlboy, the game features an orchestral soundtrack that would make John Williams smile. There is a moment in the game where you are riding on the back of a giant mechanical lizard. The moment that part began, the music drew me in and I couldn't stop smiling. Even as I moved about, dodging debris and everything was going to hell. It was scary, exhilarating and the music just took it to the next level. It's these types of moments that are speckled all throughout the game and which do everything to enhance the story, the art, and again the gameplay.We have arrived at that point where I usually insert something I didn't like about the game. Let me say I was HARD pressed to find anything. The game has no bugs and is extremely well made. Boss fights are challenging but not frustrating. Exploration is difficult but rewarding. The pace of the game is always moving forward at a good clip, as new abilities are given to you for you to experiment with and enjoy. Is the game perfect? Dang near but, there was one thing in combat that did grate on me sometimes. During combat, if you are struck by an enemy, an animation plays that knocks Otus out of the air and kind of stun locks you. If multiple enemies are present and attacking, you can get stun locked for quite a while and lose more health than you would like. There that's it! All I've got.Honestly, If I haven't given you the impression of how impressed I was with this title then, there really isn't much more that I could say. This game took me back to when games were wondrous. Like the first time I played Ocarina of Time or started up Final Fantasy VII. It made me feel like a kid again and I loved every moment of it. To the point where I didn't want it to end. Owlboy is about a ten hour experience more or less. You could extend that by finding every single secret. This may add two to four hours depending on how well you do the first run through the areas. You could say that isn't very long, but any more would be cheapening to the story and experience of this game. Trust me the amount of time it takes is perfect.Replay value is of course up to you, but I personally could see myself playing this game many times over and looking for every single detail of the art, secrets of the story, or just kicking back and listening to the music. Does the game innovate? Not necessarily. But it does refine an age-old style and mechanics perfectly. The game is priced at $24.99 which is above the usual Indie standard, but the quality is more than worth it. These are the types of games you want to see made and these are the games you want to support.I could honestly write more about this games bosses, story, and that awesome ending but I don't want to spoil any more for you.So thanks for reading.I'm off to play some more Owlboy!

												Not the longest game, nor the most complicated, nor the hardest, but Owlboy was visually and aurally one of the best games I've ever played.The gameplay is relatively simple, but satisfying, and some parts required multiple redos - as a person who generally enjoys coasting through games and experiencing them, this is preferable to a particularly difficult retro game ala Mega Man.  The story started off slow but a twist in the first half really caught my attention and I played through to the end, really enjoying the interactions between characters in this little world that had been created.Despite the relatively low playtime/dollar ratio (the time I have now, 9 hours, is having completed the game with some side content, though not close to all of it) I could not recommend this game more highly to anyone who sees it and at the first glance is interested.

												As a person who is studying game development as his master's degree, indie development is my dream. After following the developers for months and seeing their warm hug after the release of the game, I was hoping with everything I've got that this game is actually good and will repay the devs all the efforts they put into it.Boy am I glad to see the result.This game feels like a throwback to retro platformers and unlike most throwback games in the market, this one feels like one as well. The controls are well-polished, the story is unique, game mechanics are engaging and the interest curve provides an engaging game for everyone. It is not difficult or challenging by itself so if you're looking for a Dark Souls-esque difficulty in this game you'll be disappointed. However if you want to play a truly remarkable platformer then don't go any further - this game is your answer.I usually wait for sales to buy games but this one was an exception and I feel like it deserves the full price.

												Very enjoyable game. Did not know anything prior to an article by Jim Sterling so i wasn't aware of the history.Sucked me in hard and i clocked it at 12.5 hours tourist mode. Overall a fantastic experience and reccomended to everyone that's in to platformers or just gorgeously done games.Story is solid, music is solid, artwork is exquisite. 9/10.			",479,52,0,69,29,2,78

												Owlboy is a fairly good game; my problem is that it isn't worth the price.  Most especially due to the fact that it is being touted as a metroidvania, when in fact the game is extremely linear.  Don't be misled as I was:  this game is actually just an ARPG.  What little exploration there is to be had usually amounts to nothing more than an occasional short branch in the path, and the rewards for such exploration are generally no more impressive than a few coins.The game world is beautiful, and the characters are fun.  Sadly about ten hours is all you'll get to enjoy those aspects of this very short game.  Combat can be a bit awkward when compared to other action games, due to the fact that you spend much of it hauling around your gunners (the only way to damage the majority of enemies).It's possible that I might have been more impressed with this game had I experienced it in a vacuum, but unfortunately it comes on the heels of Ori and the Blind Forest.  By comparison Owlboy is shorter, more expensive, less immersive, less challenging, offers less chance for exploration... I could go on, but I think the point is clear.  My conclusion is that while this is not a bad game, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it had I the chance to do things over.			",37,14,0,26,9,0,17

												This game so far is amazing. From the varied enemies and puzzles, the incredibly crisp and rewarding audio, all the way to the detailed sprite work and flawless animation- this game is a work of art.The story progresses at a nice even pace that keeps you enthralled in the world, without endless waves of text boring you to tears.The game is a 2D action/puzzle game. Most of the puzzles are straight forward Zelda-esq type things, as are the bosses. The game gives you a lot of movement freedom, but is a more linear story line.Controls are responsive, and everything plays great. You can't adjust the controller mapping and it Only recognises XBOX or Playstation controllers, which might be a problem for some. Mouse and keyboard works fine too though, and can be changed.This is surely a game that had the developer's heart and soul pooled into it, and you can feel it with every minute you play. Definately glad I picked this one up.Edit: After clearing the game, I can safely say I only wish it was a bit longer, I cleared it with most stuff gathered in about 10 hours or so. Other than that, it was an amazing ride from start to finish and I would certainly recommend it to my friends either now or on sale- you definately have to play it sometime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 27, 2016
												This is my personal opinion of owlboy:Pros:Graphics are great. Story is great. Art is great. Gameplay is very fun with controller. Twin stick shooter is a good idea. The gameplay also never got stale. I never got bored.There was always a switch of game style too. Sometimes it was a sidescroller platformer, sometimes you would need to steer a dragon!!! It never got repetitive. There was always something new to do.You can play this game at your own pace. There is no rush or anything that slows you down.Bossfights were genius.Great end. Great beginning.Cons:Game is a bit short (8hrs to beat for me). Lacked a variety of enemies.At times too hard. In other platformers like mario, you can grab on to the ledge. This does not occur in owlboy and feels really awkward at times.THE CANNON PART OMG. (optional sidequest).Music is good but doesn't stick to me. Undertale had great music and I would listen to it over and over again afterwards. In Owlboy, I can hardly remember the soundtrack. It was great in game but I don't think I would listen to it again. There are some parts where there is just too much talking. I just wanted to play the game. Overall, this game was great. It had small nitpicks here and there but in the end, it was fun. Even though it was short, it was comprised of very good gameplay all around unlike a 60 hour game that has like 10 hrs of good gameplay and 50hrs of recycled gameplay like tailing missions (assasins creed im looking at you).WAS IT WORTH IT??YES			",29,6,0,2,4,0,1

Posted: November 4, 2016
												Nine  years is a large chunk of anybody’s lifetime, for those of us lucky to see a century, it’s almost a tenth of the precious, finite time we get to spend on this planet. I’ve been following the progress of this game since the first few morsels were public and admit to having forgotten about the game several times until inevitably finding more little delicious crumbs to follow until arriving at the 1st of November and a metaphorical cake, responsible for the delicious line of crumbs that preceded it waited to be eaten. I sat there like a mad man, refreshing the store page every five seconds until I was finally allowed to pick up my fork (controller) and dig in (buy and play the game!) Until at last some wonderful music and gorgeous pixel art made way for the menu buttons, the new game started and I started to take the first bite.After a brief and somewhat emotionally uncomfortable introduction to basic mechanics, the game proper began in a lush, warm room, I stayed here for five minutes mesmerised by the level of mastery the artist had shown through animation, colour palette and precision of pixel placement. Everything looked as it should, as the artist had no doubt spent hours meticulously on this single interior, this prospect left me feeling both excited and somewhat flabbergasted as to what might be waiting for the majority of the game that was waiting for me.Outside, the incredible visuals began to be accompanied by some understated but catchy music, fading and acquiring new layers to its depth as the area was explored, and explore I did. I spent a good hour just playing, interacting with objects, smashing pots for the glittering coins within and hitting flowers before watching them grow back. It might be an overstatement to say that small details like this are what make good games great but what it shows is a deeper level of understanding of the symbiotic substance that is a video game. Video games  are a composition of audio, visual and active interaction; the greatest challenge of any game designer or indeed, member of any games design team is to anticipate player action, it may seem stupid but by placing a seemingly small and insignificant flower for me to repeatedly lop the head off of is testament to the level of thought that has gone into building this lush, interactive world to explore. The devil is in the details, when you move slightly a cloud of dust forms at your feet, when you flap and roll, the air visually moves behind you and it all contributes to making the movement feel dynamic.  Audio, visual and interactivity composed to make even the simple act of movement fun and engaging, which is a relief because as this is primarily platforming and exploration you’re going to be doing that a lot! Quite a few critics have, in my opinion, unfairly described OwlBoy as having a “retro pixel art aesthetic”. There is no appeal to retro-activity to be found in the sublime pixel pushing of this artist but simply a love, understanding and desire to show the gaming community the brilliance of pixel art as a form of visual art in and of itself. There were so many occasions where I sat there in sheer awe of the level of detail being presented to me in one of the harshest, most technically difficult mediums to present such things. Any person can pick the pencil tool in paint and draw an isometric cube, provided they clicked one pixel at a time this could be described as pixel art but that would be the same as getting someone to paint a portrait of their dog in oils and calling them Rembrandt. OwlBoy is a master-class in pixel art; it is the interactive equivalent of going to see the finest works of art at La Louvre in that it showcases the medium of pixel art in a manner so far unmatched in any indie game thus far and I would put it on a level equal to some of the greatest pixel work done in video games, ever.As mentioned earlier the visual is accompanied by some of the most whimsical, brilliantly executed musical pieces that I have heard for some time, everything is meticulous here, considered and there’s no better way to understand that to simply play it yourself. The visual and audio contribute to making each and every area feel unique, hand crafted and a pleasure to explore.The ability to fly is such a huge and wondrous ability, usually limited to the final parts of many action-driven platformers, so it is such an ingenious twist to  gimp the main characters abilities in the realm of combat very rarely can you do anything but dodge or defend when playing as Otus (the titular owlboy) alone. Luckily the designers were kind enough to supply you with three very different (mechanically and characteristically) friends to grab hold of your feet and offer their projectile shooting abilities, each has their own uses, from providing a piercing rapid fire to cover most basic enemies and weaker structures; to huge bursts of musket fire to incinerate. Not once do you feel like a character is merely there for the sake of it, they have been designed and the world and all of its dirty little secrets has been designed around both your ability to fly and their ability to help you to. Speaking of dirty little secrets, there’s quite a few, hidden walls to find that usually contain some point of interest such as chests or coins. At one point I discovered a secret, only to return later and realise it held and even bigger one. Discovering these things always feels organic, as though you were meant to and that speaks volumes of the game as a whole to be honest, everything feels as though it was MEANT to be that way, it feels crafted, designed out of a labour of love. There will never be coins you can miss, they’ve been placed in areas that you can access after exploring an area; such is the level of foresight possessed by the creators. The narrative, story and plot are all wonderfully executed; you’re always kept guessing and there’s enough mystery to fuel a fan base who will inevitably be making discussion threads about why certain things are said or done. The pacing feels tight and considered, not once did I feel the story was rushed or there was too much exposition thrown at me at once. Ultimately, once more, everything felt like it had a purpose, as though it belonged for a reason greater than simply “because it can”. I’ve spent 20 hours exploring in this game and I don’t feel like single second of my time was wasted in terms of the main content of the game, there’s one mini game whose inclusion seems rather odd and out of place but this would be the singular negative in an otherwise brilliantly executed piece of art. OwlBoy rewards you for exploring, for interacting and provides some of the greatest pixel art I’ve ever seen in a game together with some top notch music. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the development team, thank you for spending the most precious thing you have in your life, your time, for making what has been a wonderfully fulfilling experience. You are all amazing and if I were rich enough I’d buy the game a million times over.			",34,1,0,8,1,0,4

												Owlboy is a masterpiece. It has beautiful graphics and sound, touching characters, an inviting atmosphere, and is fun from start to finish. Every time I continued the game I was treated to something brand-new. Seeing everything that's packed in there, it's no surprise to me now that it took this top-notch team of devlopers so long to make this game. But the wait was worth it, as it just oozes with originally and charm.This has been added to my top games of all time. Can't wait to see where D-Pad Studio goes next.			",127,64,1,13,7,2,30

												This wonderful masterpiece. where do i begin. i rarely write reviews but boy does this one deserve it. I'm not as good as other reviewers that perfectly setup their reviews pro's and con's, but let's begin.Owlboy is a hybrid platformer with flight that follows a story that slowly starts unfolding at first but quickly advances.It is full of emotions right off the start and you get spoon-fed with visual emotions such as the beauty of the music and scenery. You get the feel of wonder, adventure, and danger depending in the scenery or dungeon you're in, the music just sets the mood just right. I praise this game for it's visual, music, characters and personalities, the controls are responsive.The story is beautiful in my opinion, i know there are others who would disagree. But it's a beautiful tale of character development that you have no idea who the protagonist is besides what you see in the beginning, where are his parents, and who are his ancestors, and what your character is capable of. You are in control of his destiny as you continue the story to save the world. If by option you explore every nook and cranny you'll find secrets that give clues to your ancestry or story about people you know, with the music on top of it it just makes it so emotional and it complete's the story, as well as items to help you feel complete and powerful. You even have the option to load up the game after you beat it to explore the previous places you visited to finish loose ends which in return gives even more story, in my case i just wanted to find out why i couldn't open a certain chest which is only possible after you beat the game and well... it was full of feels.Everything about this game, from its sprites to the music, you can tell love was put into it.The main protagonist and his companion's are incredibly memorable with beautiful personalities, rich of character.Everywhere you explore is beautiful, so much detail was put into this game.I give this game a solid 10 out of 10.In my opinion the best beautiful sprited game of this recent modern era.unfortuntely i don't think there will be a sequel, and i just hope that if the developers of owlboy decide to make a game just as great as owlboy that it gets the same love and devotion but made in less time. They have the money and resources now to develope a game just as great in less time thanks to Owlboy. And if the staff splits and goes to a different company, that they continue to give all their heart and love into whatever new game they're working on just as they did with owlboy.

												Gorgeous pixel art, fantastic soundtrack, likeable characters, good plot.It doesn't do as much in the way of platforming as I would've liked, but it's still one of the best indie games from 2016 (right with Stardew Valley and Hyper Light Drifter).			",60,16,0,11,8,0,2

												This game is bonkers.Let's talk about it right away, it has its price, and I believe it is fair for such a masterpiece.I played this entire game and have earned all the achievements in under 18 hours, so it IS quite short, however, it's an adventure game, which unlike a roguelike or most free to plays is never repetitive. The truth is I plan to play it all over again to have that second playthrough where you know what's going on and notice these details and references you didn't understand before.The graphics are unbelievably beautiful and smooth, and the soundtrack is as good as Undertale's.Owlboy is hard, too. As a veteran gamer, I went through it without much problems but clearly the difficulty may increase the game durability quite a lot depending on your skill.But the thing is, the game throws new stuff at you ALL the time, never letting you get bored and introducing new mechanics and epic battles.It has fights, it has infiltration, it has exploration, it has challenges, expressive characters, numerous secrets, cutscenes, sidequests, it has a nuance between good and evil, so that you'll ask yourself if you are doing the right thing at several points in the game (can't tell more without spoilers, but get ready for some plot twists), it has a soul of its own.Really, think about it, this 20 hours game took 9 years to be released, playing it is as powerful as reading a very good book.Also get ready for the feels.

												One of the most important games of 2016. This game is now my example of masterful pixel art. The setting is interesting, it combines some Laputa-like elements into a very unpredictable story. The characters seem motivated and well-portrayed to fit their roles. It's less than ten hours, but a lot happens during the hours you play. I'm expecting some healthy speedrunning attempts with this modern classic. so yeah, terribly charismatic owls and sky pirates.

												Owlboy was the only game I have actually looked forward to playing in a long time, and one of the few games I have bought at release.  Overall,  Owlboy is worth it.  The game has been in development for 9 years, and the effort definitely shows.  Easily one of the best soundtracks of the year, and probably the best pixel artwork out of any 8-bit game.  The flying mechanic felt extremely fresh and new for a 2D game, and Owlboy executed it perfectly.  I have not felt immersed in a game in a long time and Owlboy gave me that feeling.  When I stopped playing Owlboy, I honestly could not wait to start playing again, something I have not felt towards a video game in a long time.  The only negatives for me is how short the game is (however, I did not 100% the game), and the relative easiness of the game.  The game never felt particularly hard, with only one memorable platforming challenge, and only one boss fight that took more than 3 tries.  One of my favorite games of all time is CaveStory, and if you are looking for a challenge similar, you will not find it in Owlboy.Overall, Owlboy is a lot of fun, with a very interesting game mechanic that no other game has done (or done well), and the story and characters were fun and immersing.  The major stand out points for Owlboy are definitely the art and the soundtrack.  8/10   ",109,11,1,6,6,3,13

												You know when a Kickstarter creates a fantastical mock-up screenshot, and it's pretty obvious they could never make the game actually look like that?  Owlboy actually looks like that.KOF13 is the only thing I can think of that is even in the same league as the pixel art of Owlboy.The rest of the game is sort of overshadowed by this!  The story and characters are good but not amazing, and the gameplay is merely servicable.You can tell they wanted to make a new masterpiece, but IMO they didn't quite make it.Still, I enjoyed it for what it was and you probably will too.

												To the Dev team at D-pad studio,  Thank you. This is without a doubt one of the best games I've ever played. It is beatiful in every single way. The art, the characters, the story, all amazing. I had one of the best if not the best experiences on a game ever. Again thank you for Owlboy, it is truly a masterpiece.			",53,4,0,5,14,0,12

												Overall, Owlboy was really enjoyable and worth to play. The music and art style of the 16-bit era really brings back the nostalgia back in the days. Most importantly, the story was just done fantastically from beginning to the end as well as playing as Otus, the protagonist of the game and the other characters such as Geddy, Alphonse, and Twig. Although there were some cut contents and some parts of the story, it felt like it was rushed and cut out and should've added more in there. Other than that, I highly recommend playing this game and you will enjoy it till the very end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Owlboy is the very definition of the dedication that can come from the Indie space. The game was in development for about 10 years from D-Pad Studio. While the gameplay doesn't fly as high as I would have liked, the story and animation do help to pick it up to some extent.Rising Up:Before we can talk about the gameplay, we have to talk about the story and aesthetics. Owlboy may not have the graphical wow-ness of something like Hyper Light Drifter, but the animation quality is one of the best I've seen. Character details and the backgrounds look amazing and right out of a late-gen SNES title.The story follows Owl in training Otus who has spent his life as a mute. Considered a failure by his mentor, Otus is thrust into action when pirates invade. The story continues to get darker, especially for a 2D game, but I don't want to spoil it.While this is a 2D platformer, you won't be doing as much jumping compared to other titles. Otus is free to fly around for the most part, and performs a spin attack. Otus has to rely on his friends as his spin attack won't hurt enemies.Early on, you'll gain the ability to teleport his friends directly to Otus. Carrying them, each person has an attack that you can make use of for combat and puzzle solving. Because you are free to fly, this meant that the developers had to figure out other ways to add progression.Aerial Exploration:Special coins can be found and cashed in for various items. Coins are usually located in hidden chests or rings that you have to fly through. The dungeons themselves feel right out of home from a Zelda game.Each one has the standard design of one unique quirk that you have to work around. Due to Otus not having a real attack, you need to rely on your best friend to do the bulk of the damage. While combat is not the focus of the game, there are plenty of arena fights and a few bosses to deal with.As you play through, you'll unlock a total of three friends that will allow you to find more hidden areas and coins.All around, Owlboy is a good game, but the gameplay can't match the high flying atmosphere.Crashed:Owlboy is unfortunately an example of how a unique mechanic doesn't always lead to amazing gameplay. A lot of your time spent in the game will be air rolling across wide rooms. The different dungeons never try to build on their initial quirk. Once you've solved one puzzle, expect to do it repeatedly throughout the dungeon. Outside of your three companions, no new abilities or systems are introduced.Due to the flying mechanics, there is very little platforming outside of the final area. The problem is that nothing was really added to replace platforming as a challenge.The combat system is the weakest part of the game, but is used the most. I would have liked to have seen more bosses that require other tactics than just fighting.Depending on how you play it, Owlboy can be beaten in a few hours if you skip the cutscenes. Outside of hunting coins and three mysterious items, there's no reason to go back to the game or advanced challenges to find.From a technical point of view, I had some issues with quickly performing commands using the grab button. There were cases where the camera transition between screens did screw me up in terms of dodging attacks.Gliding Along:Owlboy is an average game with a story and animation style that attempt to elevate it higher. If you're looking for a great platformer, I can't recommend Owlboy. This is one of those games that is greater than the sum of its parts, but how high it flies depends on what you're looking for in a 2D game. I didn't want to give it a thumbs down, but at the same time, there's just not enough in terms of gameplay for me to recommend it.For more reviews and talks on video games and game design, check out Game-Wisdom[game-wisdom.com] and our YouTube channel for daily video content.

												After 10 long years of development, Owlboy has been released for the world. Was this worth the time for you to pick it up?The artwork no doubt catches the eye before the story or gameplay. It can be amazing how much pixel art can accomplish and it is displayed amazingly in Owlboy. Everything is vibrant and detailed, everything being distinct from one another. Each area telling it's own story with their individual design that you can easily tell where you are without the game telling you (especially since there is no map). Every enemy beautifully designed and animated so you can easily tell what they do. Every character is distinct from one another with their design and their own background. Owls, which could of had the same cloak design, having different owl cloaks ranging from color and wingspan. While the soldiers have the same outfit it speaks for itself and the citizens all having unique designs. Little details were able to be put in: puffs of wind on the ground when flying close to the ground, day and night cycle, and giving expressions to everyone.You play Otus, a young mute Owl working with his friend Otus to protect their floating home from sky pirates. Teaming up with others to help in his journey. Getting a tiny bit sidetracked with a few things in the progress. As I don't want to spoil anything, you should experience the story yourself.Story and lore is effortlessly integrated into everything. The designs tell their own story and you can get more by interacting with the world. The characters are charming, not suffering from cheesy writing, as they tell you about themselves or various other things. There are two collectables, golden disks and Buccanary coins. The golden disks reveals information an important plot point when put in the right place, but it doesn't happen till the end. The Buccanary coins lets you unlock optional items that also include very cute chatter between the people you give them to. This can range from hats, to more health, to buffs. I would be lying if the Owl in Owlboy didn't make me interested in the game. This is not just a regular platformer but one that you can fly in and access every free space you can. Otus, on his own, can roll, injure enemies by spinning, and pick up objects to throw around. However he can not make it on his own without friends. With his friends such as Geddy and Alphonse, you can directly attack them from afar. Not only that, your friend's special ability is necessary to navigate around your environment. You can easily access them by picking them up or teleporting them to your hands.Since you do carry your friends to use their ability, dropping them to pick something else up can be a little confusing to the game. Your friends will always be first in line no matter what you want to pick up. Want that berry to heal up but Geddy is right by it? You will pick up Geddy instead so take that time in throwing him the other way (perhaps hitting him a few times for that achievement?) so you can eat that berry. To mix things up there are stealthy parts. The first time can be very frustrating, especially when the floor disappears on you like it did for me. This is also one of the parts where bum rushing it is a strategy to get past it without having to waste time fighting. Later on it does get better as you try not to provoke enemies as much in those areas (they always seem more vicious than the regular enemies).This can easily be classified as a casual game with how easy most parts can be. Once you get over learning how each enemy moves and attacks and the environmental hazards it can be a cakewalk. Checkpoints are very generous, the last one being right before the last boss, enemies being very easy to defeat, and Otus being able to take a lot of damage. The bosses are really the only thing that is challenging as they have you think on the spot with their unpredictable behavior. I actually was stuck on one of the last few bosses since it has you dodging a lot but I was able to collect more Buccanary coins to unlock more health. The only thing that might not be as easy is navigating to each area. Sometimes you either can't find the right entrance to the area or find out where you have to go to progress in the story.You can not mention Owlboy without the soundtrack. Every piece nails the mood of each scene and does a great job representing the area it is placed in. It no doubt made the game as much as the gameplay and art did. Owlboy is definitely worth picking up, discount or no discount. Easily bring in 10 hours of gameplay and more if you desire to 100% it. While it does have flaws, everything else that Owlboy brings to the table keeps the experience intact.			",110,149,0,7,22,1,7

												Normally I don't like to write reviews. However, without a doubt, every minute of this game was so awesome a positive review on steam was the least that my lazy self could do!(^_^) Between the story and beautiful unique style of the games graphics alone, I could not be more pleased with the purchase of this game. This game was enjoyable so much that I only wish the game could keep going on, and have more adventure, places, treasures to find and characters to meet and befriend. Would give this game a 10/10 no doubts. Would love to see more games like this on steam.			",174,28,0,20,4,1,4

												Forget every other game I own on my steam library. I was about to say The Witness is my GOTY but... This game, oh my, this masterpiece, had appeared out of no where as a gift (THANK YOU LEONARD), and it is has to be my Game of the Year for 2016. Owlboy does everything I love about video games. The gameplay machanics, the music (YOUTUBE THAT OST RIGHT NOW), and the artwork are great. No, not great, they are fantastic. I just love everything about it. Otus is such a reliable character and I understand how he feels when he is neglicated and unapprepicated. Solus has to be one of my favorite characters, and I love all of Otus's friends and how supportive they are. The story is pretty reliable, too.This is the type of game I love to play when I was a child with an immagination. It gives that earthbound feeling while still being a solid platformer.I strongly encourage all of you to buy this game at full price or wait for a sale. I don't know, but you just have to play it at some point your life.I am in love with this game. GOTY 2016			",176,33,6,21,14,2,17

YouTube™ Video: Owlboy Review 

			Views: 139		

			Finally finished my playthrough on Owlboy and i present my full game review on it for you guys. Wanted to do slightly longer review, but ive been feeling bit ill so i cut it bit shorter than usual,...		

 A Modern ClassicPixel art doesn't get better than this, Owlboy has a great soundtrack, great gameplay, decently long story and great character designs. While Story itself isn't greatest masterpiece it still had some good lore written about it inside the game. The price of the game isn't too bad either so it seems rather a good deal in many ways.

												Pros:- Very good soundtrack (strongly recommend buying the soundtrack as well recently found out that the soundtrack available doesn't actually have all the songs, so recommend listening to it on youtube or somewhere else).- Nice, expressive and rounded characters that all feel very human, brimming with personality and flaws.- Stealthing is enjoyable and not impossible to recover from if you screw up.- Lore is very intriguing and left me wanting to find out as much as I could about the world.- Majority of the mechanics are intuitive and fun to use.Neutral:- Only about 5-10 hours of playtime for a single runthrough and not much replay value after a single play. Depending on your views about dollars-per-hour this can either be a good thing as it means the story doesnt outstay its welcome or a bad thing as it is over too quickly for $25.Cons:- Could use some tighter controls (navigating through the vines was a small annoyance)- Some of the side quests are a bit difficult and tedious compared to the meat of the game. Wouldn't be a complaint by itself since they are not mandatory except...- Main story only gives closure for Otus and his three companions. Most of the lore you learn about along the way only gets any real fleshing out through the difficult and tedious sidequesting and some elements are left to fan speculation.			",219,23,1,18,13,3,16

												Incredible game. everything about this game is good, especially for everyone who remembers the games from the 16-bit era. If this came out in the nineties, it would probably be considered one of the best games of all time. Perhaps it is still that - but it is certainly an instant classic. The best part about the game is the incredible pixel graphics, of which I have never seen an equal before, and perhaps never will.			",70,47,0,16,5,0,9

												I didn't think very highly of the game during the first few hours for some very strange reason. It must've been because I've just seen story setup and characters done better elsewhere, and my standards have increased immensely after having played other story-heavy games like Xenoblade Chronicles and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. As incredible as those games are, I will never forgive them for blowing my standards through the roof and making me begin expecting too much from video games nowadays.But despite this, this game gradually got much, much better as the story progressed. I can't say much about the Metroidvania-style gameplay since I'm not entirely familiar with the genre (and I still have a difficulty understanding the exact definition of the term), but I was deeply moved by the characters' memorability, the amazing music and the several deeply moving moments in the story, so much so that it even reminded me of something Studio Ghibli would make. By the time I finished it, I wholeheartedly regret my former opinion and I aim to replay it someday in an attempt to think of it more fondly.Please do not take the same approach as I did. If you are like me, try to keep an open mind and you will be in for a truIy incredible experience. I sincerely believe this game is worthy of Undertale-levels of popularity.			",38,6,1,1,1,2,3

												This game is a childish but amazing reminder of the good ol' gaming days back when the SNES was the cool kid on the block. I've been playing it since I got the Steam notification and immediately bought it and can't stop playing. I would recommend this to anyone who's enjoyed their fair share of zelda, chronotrigger or secrets of mana :). I know it's not the same game genre and this one is more like a zelda + a twist of dizzy, but damn I'm enjoying it.Amidst the latest gen graphics and everyone struggling to come up with original stuff, these guys nailed it. I will keep on playing it and I hope it'll be a long enjoyable game.			",23,2,0,2,0,0,0

												Reccomended to me by so many people, I finally got around to playing Owlboy. And if I had to explain it in one word, it would be: ""polished"". This game is not only beautiful to look at with its ""hi-bit"" graphics, you will definitely notice the orchestral score. The characters are a bunch of loveable outcasts, flying around with Owlboy feels great and the game has a fair share of awesome moments. It rewards people who like to just mess around and discover - not only with collectibles, but also with minigames and even emotional scenes. None of that is compulsory, you can finish the game just rushing through it, yet it is breathtaking how much care and attention to detail went into this game.If you have 20 bucks to spare, you really can't go wrong with Owlboy. It's a lot of fun and while it felt a bit short - it was more like I didn't want it to end yet. I'll definitely come back to it someday and wholeheartedly reccomend it to anyone.

												While many people who leave negative reviews for the game saying they couldn't connect to the story, that really all depends on the individual and not the game. I fell in love with this game and its story, and feel connected to these characters. Sure the game has its moments where you're like eeeeeeh but overall its amazing. EDIT: TRANSFERING COMPUTERS DOES NOT CARRY OVER ALL PROGRESS!!! I was pretty far into the game on my laptop where i started the game but when i transfered to my PC i was at the first boss fight. Looks like ill be beating the game on my laptop.			",77,6,1,9,3,2,3

												Owlboy is a love letter to the pixel games of the SNES days. I wish all future pixel games would put the amount of detail into graphics. The game looks stunning. Now with that out of the way, let see if Owlboy is as good as it looks.Story: Otus a mute owl boy set off on an adventure with a miscast group to save his home and the world from the pirate and the power of the ancient owl relics. Honestly this game have quite a few cut scenes in it and I can't really go more into detail without spoiling the story. Although I found it funny how they specifically mention in the beginning that Otus is a mute. It always funny how must game just say the main protagonist don't talk much but they actually made Otus a mute to drive this point home. The cast you go through the game with is funny/quirky and memorable in their own way. Although I felt the game were short and the story felt rushed in some partsGameplay: Otus is an owl boy so he can fly about the screen. He can roll to dodge attacks, and has a spin attack that is use more for stunning enemies than actually defeating them. His real offense come from his friends. Each one with their own unique projectile attack or ability to use. I can't go into detail about them without spoiling the story...My only complaint was that often time it felt overwhelming trying to switch characters while flying and dodging attacks. There are time I felt I was hit because I could dodge due to losing track of my hitbox due to having to account for Otus & his companion.Overall: This is a short game, and its more story driven than anything. Some cutscene may drag on too long for players who just want to to get to the gameplay. All in all it short but fun little adventure to engage in. Just make sure you do not get this game for the full price (at the time it is $24.99). The game is too short to justify paying close to $25 for it. I got it for $19.99 and I felt I should have waited till a sale when it dropped to $15 or less. Owlboy is a soaring good time but it's price need to fall from the sky.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Owlboy is a very, very well created game (So far, I'm only a number of hours into the story), that I hope doesn't end up being severely underrated.The graphics are as described, pixel art, but of high quality, with each sprite and area design looking like it was made with lots of care and critique.It has a certain loveable charm to it in its dialogue and characters, and presents itself almost like an old 'coming-of-age' story, and it's given well.The music in Owlboy is also very wonderful. From simple tunes in tone with the art style to absolutely beautiful full range melodies, it really helps paint a wondrous, beautiful world to explore.The most important factor, the gameplay, is also very strong. It's a 'sort of' platformer, with 'sort of' coming from the fact that the protagonist can fly. In addition, it also has light puzzle elements, and in a few areas, well made stealth portions that don't suck, and serve as world-painting and mood setting. All in all, Owlboy is VERY much worth $25, and something that shouldn't be passed up, even if you're not a strong fan of platformers.			",73,10,1,11,4,1,2

												I think it is just an amazing game. Everything comes together in a perfect fit. The controls are tight and responsive, the puzzles are challenging intuitive, but the thing that I believe makes this stand out is the world. The design and are beautiful. The pixel work is top tier, its animated so smoothly even the sound effects are so satisfying and just add that special touch. It is just a wonderful world to explore and experience. Like games such as shovel knight it picks on the feelings of nostalgia for days past in gaming but then tweaks them ever so slightly to be modern and as good as the way we remember them, not worn to time.

												Great game for the nostalgic gamer. The artwork is beautiful, the soundtrack amazing, and the gameplay fun. It holds onto the ideal of sidescrollers, but yet brings something fresh to the table. The mecahnics of flying and the friends is enjoyable. The puzzles are designed fairly and intelligently, where they won't keep a player bogged down for too long, but they still do not feel too easy.  I fell in love with the game instantly and was unable to put it down. The characters are enjoyable, the setting and levels unique, whimiscal, colorful, and intriguing. The story is not groundbreaking or a cinematic masterpiece, but it is fascinating enough to keep the player's attention. Being a fan of some of the old 2d sidescrollers, this game felt like a love letter to gamers such as myself who yearned for something fresh that still offered that nostalgic feeling. If only it lasted a little longer... Just when I found myself becoming attached to the characters and the story, the game ended, and I just wish there was a little more to it. Owlboy is not perfect, but the game deserves the praise it has received and is defintely worth the play. 9/10			",32,9,0,16,9,1,18

Owlboy definitely looks and sounds beautiful and has tons of polish, but unfortunately it fails with an underwhelming story and slow progression. There are some other questionable design decisions, too, that I'll go into a bit. This is some of the most breath-takingly beautiful pixel art, though. The musical score isn't far behind, either. Controller support was good, but the flying mechanic isn't novel enough to carry a whole game on. Maybe it would have been nine years ago when developement started, but it just suffers from the case of too-little-too-late IMO.Some of the strange design decisions include the hoops you fly through (and get money). Usually in flying games, the hoops are something to test your skill. You don't even fly through them quickly in this. It just feels odd. Why does it have to play a painfully slow animation everytime a gate opens. Yes, I know that probably took a lot of time and effort to do, but I don't need to suffer through it every time. There are also a few sort of goofy one-off 'mini game' (for lack of a better word) moments, such as getting you and your friend out of the spider webbing. Just felt forced, or at the very least, unnecessary.As far as the actual game, the story is real 'meh'. Is this really the best story that could have been crafted in nine years? No, I don't know the whole story, but what I saw was pretty forgettable. Felt like something Disney would crap out. The dialogue was well written, I will say that. A bit of side-dialogue from my brain thoughts: many people embraced the nine year developement as something really amazing. Like, perhaps this game aged like a fine wine or something lol. This isn't ToME with layers of complexity and lore that has been crafted over the years. Nine years is kind of embarrasing, really. The indie gaming industry changes fairly quickly, and I think this title suffered from the long dev cycle.Pros:+Beautiful artwork and soundtrack+Controller support is good+Very polishedCons:-The flying mechanic is not nearly enough to build a whole game on-The story was 'meh' as far as I had experienced it-Slow progression and slow animations/cutscenes IMO-A bit too pricey for the hours I see people get out of it (I refunded)I had hoped to fall in love with this one. Don't get it twisted - this isn't a 'bad' game by a long shot, it's just not some indie gem worth twenty bones. I'd watch some LetsPlays if you are on the fence.Peace,			",563,162,5,75,79,8,72

I'm not saying it should be dragged out to the point of it being a terrible game. also the bosses were stupidly hard at some points in the game. and some were just mini-bosses. but, if you are interested in a heart-warming story,something to do, or are looking for a slight challenge, than this is the game for you			",21,3,0,2,4,0,0

												This game is short, but there's enough secrets and extra completionist tasks that warrant the price for this game. The story is enveloping, and one of the best story-puzzle platformer games I've played since the Legend of Zelda series. Portal, and others. I think it's one of the great games of our time and I hope it gets reception and notoriety as big as Undertale. This is a very worthwhile experience of a game that I've had the pleasure to play. If it means anything, this is the second game that has made me cry (MGS ending was the first), and I have played more emotional heart-strung games like Flower, Undertale, Fire Emblem, Golden Sun to give a few examples. Describing the story in any way ruins the magic, but I'll give a few details. IThe plot of the story and how it progresses can seem like a given halfway through the story, and if you have played many story games, it may seem a bit predictable. However, the atmosphere of the world makes up for these potential shortcomings, and I think works in its favor. The plot and story line is motivating enough to make the player want to drive on through the world as fast as they can, but I urge you to try and take your time and appreciate the work done around the enviorment. It left me awestruck how well each area was designed.TL;DR Do you wish more games were like OOT were out? This is one of them. Get it.			",74,7,0,7,7,1,10

												This is another case where I wish there was a ""neutral"" option when reviewing a game. On the plus side, Owlboy is a beautiful game. Otus controls well,  picking up new allies whilst playing through the game was motivating, and altogether the game was a relatively enjoyable experience. I understand the development that this game went through, and I think that it makes this game all-the-more inspirational.Despite all of this I couldn't bring myself to recommend this to everyone, so therefore I cannot leave a thumbs-up. Don't get me wrong, the game is a relatively good platformer. It looks good, it plays good, and the fact that it was created at all is incredible.There are a few small nitpicks here and there. Thanks to the art style some of the jumps can be frustrating, and Otus' rolls never quite seem to make it. I don't care about these things, however. Again, the game controls amazingly well anyway, and any small frustrations caused by them only last a minute or two.My reasoning is that the game is incredibly unfulfilling to the moderate gamer. Casual gamers will have a blast reading through the story and enjoying taking the game one step at a time. Hardcore gamers might get bored, but Owlboy clearly has some potential for them a long as they are patient.This game is incredibly unfulfilling, even tedious to the middle-of-the-road gamers. This is not because the game is bad, but because it is both a puzzle-action platformer AND a collect-a-thon.The smallest issue I had with the game came in the form of the monsters. Any monster not part of a puzzle was practically worthless. This is fine by itself: add some filler monsters to add some life between getting from point A to point B, but then the collect-a-thon bit comes in.While playing the game players will find coins littered around everywhere. Reaching certain coin milestones will grant rewards, although they are entirely unnecessary to beating the game. Still, getting gun upgrades and the such is usually worth it, and coins tend to be everywhere. The is a finite number of them, however, and this is where things took a dive.For as quick paced as the game can become during key moments Otus is SLOW when trying to move around the gargantuan overworld. If you want to find EVERYTHING the game has to offer get ready to triple your playtime. If you expected to play through the game casually and then collect everything you must first figure out how to turn your brain off.Because you WILL spend hours just circling around the same dungeon over and over again to find the last 10 coins you need.And then you will spend 5 minutes to get back to the next dungeon.And then you will spend another hour or so going through that one.I don't think that this sort of thing is bad by itself. Collect-a-thons are usually tedious anyway, so that's all fine. In the end, I collected all three owl thingies and put them in their corresponding pillar thingy. This is when I started questioning my decision to do so.Many similar games that require you to re-explore dungeons give you something as a reward. An alternate ending, perhaps. Maybe it'll grant you some special power, or maybe it'll be the final nail-in-the-coffin to figuring out the story.I got nothing. Just a few holograms that gave me some information I already knew. I felt like I might have missed something, perhaps I needed to go through the end of the game cutscene for my reward. Still, nothing. There isn't anything else to find. No alternate endings, no bonus cutscenes, just the credits and back to the title screen.I didn't even bother getting all of the regular coins. You can see the reward before you nab them all anyway: just a spiffy looking cloak, probably some funny dialogue along with it. I wasn't going to try watching and re-watching a youtube walkthrough a million times to find out.In the end, playing through the game itself wasn't so bad. It slowed down painfully at times, but it was okay nonetheless. The pixel art is great, and if you just collect the extras that you come across you probably will enjoy yourself.If I could go back in time, this is the information that I would have told myself. I've spent hours of extra gametime flying back-and-forth in the world to no avail. But my biggest complaint is that there was no real reward for doing so, at least not any award that was worth the extra hours gone to waste. If you wish to buy the game: play through, enjoy yourself, and if there is anything that would be tedious to do, don't do it.			",128,26,1,11,5,1,6

												This game is a hoot.Really though I have to say Owlboy is one of the best-looking games on Steam. Right from the get-go I could see all the painstaking detail that went into this game to make it as gorgeous as it is, from the charming character expressions to the environments that really draw you into the world of the game. Aside from beholding the magnificent visuals, the game itself is a lot of fun! Keep in mind I went into this without any expectations and found myself surprised at the quality of the puzzles and level design. Oh, and the MUSIC is so vibrant and does an amazing job at reflecting the tone of the game through it's various stages. If you're looking for a game that'll make you smile or just really like owls then I'd definitely say the price is well worth it, even if you just want to give it a shot I'm confident a masterpiece game like this will rarely, if ever, disappoint.

												As per usual with my reviews, I'm going to say 'yeah, this is pretty great' and then try to say something few others have. Owlboy is one of those rare few games that has an intro that REALLY pulls a player in, rather than just being easy street and nothing but easy street. Also, for a game with gimmicks you haven't seen elsewhere (flying being a main focus, carrying friends) Owlboy has really tight and intuitive controls.			",23,4,0,5,1,0,2

												A fun game with some tight mechanics. The collectables aren't TOO hard to find, with only a few things here and there being hidden a bit too well. The hardest was definitely hitting all the rings on the cannon challenge... and FINISHING the cannon challenge! It's too fast with too many screen switches and blind turns!The story is relatively simple, and while I think the ending was lack-luster (no spoiers), the bad-guys are fun, the allies are fun, and there are some seriously emotional moments, and 'Holy Crap' visuals. And the MUSIC! Good soundtrack, for sure. Overall, the experience was a fun one.Pros:Controls are tight and responsiveMusic is FANTASTICVisuals capture the feeling of what's happening very well, and are a love-letter to classic bit-style graphics of the late genesis/SNES, early PS1 days.Metroidvania style gameplay that works well.Right from the start YOU CAN FLY!!!!Cons:Story is a bit simpleThe 'twist' kind of detracts from the storyFights can sometimes be a bit chaotic when needing to swap between partnersSCREW THE CANNON CHALLENGE!A bit short. Completed the game 100% in just over 10 hours, and that was with taking in the scenery.Very linear. Little to no replayability, outside of just wanting to experience the visuals and story again.My score would be a 8/10. Good game that is a little short for how long it was in development, but the visuals and the music, as well as the tight controls make it a great game. $25 price is a bit high, but $20 is good. Buy it on sale, or wait for a price reduction.			",194,46,2,41,24,2,34

												A work of art! I didn't think I'd see another retro platformer as good as Shovel Knight for YEARS but Owlboy has proven me wrong. Amazing music score, rich story and complex yet fun gameplay makes this game a definite must have in any person's game library.			",230,71,2,54,29,2,36

												You know...I hope we get a sequel, stunning arts,beatiful soundtrack,great platform,mostly everything...Except the cliche you know story and dialogue and 8-10 hour story and gameplay. I know most people are complaining about the price also but i didn't care about it as i was hyped for this game and enjoyed it. I do recommend this game for every platformer or puzzle players. (You should probably wait for the price to go down if you wish to save money)			",71,1,0,5,4,1,2

												+ Highly polished graphics+ Fun and engaging gameplay+ Immersive world; lots of tiny details (e.g. birds, rustling grass, etc.)+ Excellent and memorable cast of characters+ Good puzzles+ Good soundtrack+ Great story+/- Difficulty varies from area to area+/- Gameplay feels both smooth and clunky (in some areas)- Lackluster ending- Some bugs here and there- Feels incomplete on the whole; lots of loose ends- A bit short; the game can be completed 100% in less than 15 hoursAdditional notes:On the whole, I think the game was worth it and I would recommend grabbing this game. Gameplay progression is excellent - new mechanics are continually introduced as you progress so it doesn't feel tedious at all. The story hearkens back to the good old days where the story revolves around saving the world from an impending threat. The world building is complex and deep enough to leave you interested. I personally love the protagonists in this game, each has a fleshed out backstory so that you can relate to them to some extent. Most of the villains are terrible, only one of them was well written, the rest feels rushed and uninteresting.Game has a lot of puzzles in it which are not so easy that you would breeze through it and not so difficult that would leave you stuck in the same puzzle for hours. It's got the right amount of difficulty, enough to get your brain to function and think. The gameplay was innovative, I guess, but the gimmick is really nothing special. It plays well, however, and the gimmick is implemented well enough such that it feels natural after the first hour of gameplay.The biggest letdown to me was the ending. It felt rushed, incomplete, and unsatisfying. I wore a blank face throughout the ending sequence - the development was too sudden and random that I was suddenly felt detached from the story. The world building also feels incomplete; too many questions are left open and never explained throughout the game. There are some areas in the game where you would think may hide some secret lore, but instead what you get is a blank map with nothing in it.That's all there is to it - the (very memorable) story on the whole is excellent (I absolutely loved everything from the start of the journey until just before the final stage) which more than makes up for the terrible ending. The graphics as well! It's practically pixelated wallpaper: the game as the graphics are consistently top-notch all throughout. Despite some setbacks I think the good points outweigh the bad so I will recommend buying this game.			",90,13,0,10,5,1,7

												It is no secret that I have a huge love for both indie games and emotional games.Owlboy from the Norwegian developer D-Pad Studio manages to capture everything I love in games. From beautifully crafted pixel-art visuals and wonderful music, through its amazing gameplay that combines elements from Zelda, Metroid and flying games to its humor, emotional moments and great and often relatable characters. The first few minutes themselves managed to make me love the game. PresentationI dare to say that Owlboy is one of the best looking games of 2016. The pixelart is this game is often breathtaking. The attention to detail, beautiful scenery and really nice looking and expressive sprites with a sort of Zelda-esque style make the game really pleasing for the eye.10/10As for the soundtrack, it's equally beautiful with many wonderful orchestral pieces mixed with some ocasional electronic bits. The music often manages to build up atmosphere and sometimes even play on your emotions.10/10GameplayThe best way to describe the gameplay is that it's a mix of Zelda and Super Metroid where you can fly. One of the main features is carrying things while flying which has many uses in solving puzzles etc. You also get to carry your buddies who will, for the most part, be attacking the enemies for you. On your adventure you'll get to explore the world including several big open areas and a few big dungeons, full of puzzles, challenges and a lot of secrets, some of which are hard to find. It all works nearly perfectly with some very minor issues. The game isn't the longest, but it's an acceptable length for this type of game, especially if you want to enjoy the game to its fullest by 100% completing it.9.5/10StoryNot gonna reveal anything about the story as I think it's best to experience it without any spoilers, but all I can say is that in many ways, it is similar to games like Mother 3 or Undertale, with very memorable and often very relatable that you really care about, many humorous moment as well as emotional moments that might drive you to tears. It might not be everybody's cup of tea, but I hold games like this really, really dear.9/10Overall: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From its artwork, to its music, to its atmosphere, to its story, to its characters and their interactions, Owlboy is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.  I didn't want it to end.  As clever, fun, and full of surprises as the main adventure is, perhaps the moments I treasure the most are moments that were entirely optional to the completion of the game.My dislikes are few and minor.  There are some startling, frustrating difficulty spikes at times.  I had to backtrack through every area in the game hugging every wall and defeating every enemy to obtain all the coins for Buccanary's shop, and even then, there were things that I missed and secrets that were perhaps a bit *too* well-hidden.  But I can forgive this, partly because the coins and secrets are optional, and partly because scouring every inch of the game to find them allowed me to spend more time in its tranquil, rich, whimsical world.Few games have as much heart visibly poured into every detail as Owlboy, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

												This game gives me THAT feeling... The one that can be commonly associated with indie titles. You know the one. No? Let me elaborate.After breezing through Owlboy in 7 hours, I can safely say that I was not satisfied with the game, and only artsy indie-only ♥♥♥♥♥♥s will come out of the game thinking ""yeah, this was worth my money. Poor Indie devs took like 10 years man!"". I got this game at the lowered price of $20, and even at this price I will warn you that Owlboy is not worth anything higher than say, $10. Now that I have prefaced this, let me get into some of the issues. - THE BAD - First off, this game controls like garbage. This astounds me, because there are not that many controls in the first place. The worst thing I had to deal with during my boring journey was that YOU HAVE TO ♥♥♥♥ING ROLL FIRST IN ORDER TO SPRINT. This ruins so many things by extention. Because your movement speed is worthless, you will unfortunately be encouraged by the game to spam rolls constantly, inhibiting precise movement and making a really, really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying sound. Once you begin to move about the world this way or as slowboi, you'll notice something else. This game feels... Empty. This is due to many things, such as:1. Few Enemies2. Low Enemy Diversity3. Pointless NPCs4. Weak Worldbuilding5. Few Collectibles (Coins and ♥♥♥♥ discs)6. Lore = Three ~5 page books* (like 10 words per page), and some dumb♥♥♥♥ lorenerd.7.. Gorgeous open areas... With nothing to do in them.About that ""feeling"". This is what causes it, and is the second largest reason for my not recommending this game. It is the feeling you might get from, say, a unity built game that looks pretty, but lacks purpose and substance. You feel alone. It feels wrong, Owlboy! Don't do this to me! - THE MEDIOCRE - Those two problems are by far the worst, but this game has plenty of other issues.Combat - Can be quite boring, and tends to be floaty. The bosses in this game are meh. Of the companions you will pick up, only one is really quite effective for combat. Others are either backup, waiting for this other companion to reload, or primarily used to get through lazy metroidvania style blockages in the world. Characters - You won't get attatched to anyone in this game, and you certainly won't care about their mortality. All of them are either painfully boring, total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or don't get enough screentime to be used effectively. When I started this game, I really wanted to care about these characters. But, by the end, I didn't care about any of them.Story - SPOILERS  Basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥ poor man's Bastion with owls and less memorable characters and events. So little from the story is important enough to remember after finishing this game. There was one moment that I thought I enjoyed - where you go up and hug your teacher, after escaping from the pirate HQ. I thought 'hey, that's kind of cute'. But besides that, nothing really sticks out storywise. Owlboy's story suffers from a few major plotholes here and there, but I can excuse them due to the sometimes wacky nature of the game. What I cannot excuse, is the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor pacing. It is extremely noticeable, especially at these points: Everything after advent, Recruiting Spiderboi, and the non-fight with Molstrom. The only good buildup this game ever dedicates to properly is the fight with Dirk.  - THE GOOD - Now that everything else is out of the way, let me say something good about the game. This game is similar to a lot of indie games coming out these days, in that it banks on pixel art to draw people in. And truth be told, this game is actually quite gorgeous. Not as good as something like Hyper Light Drifter (a game that actually plays well AND has good art), but still pretty nice to look at. I guess most of those 10 years in development were spent drawin trees, aye?And, though somewhat generic, this game does actually have a decent soundtrack. It's orchestral, and can sometimes aid the world in feeling large, even sometimes managing to make your journey feel ""epic"". It is not, do not be fooled by the good music. TL:DR Owlboy is not worth $20. Pick it up if it goes on sale for $10 or less. It suffers from bad controls, an empty world, weak combat, bad characters, and a dull story. However, it does have good art and music.			",106,24,0,7,7,0,6

												I played many platformer/metrovania games before and I honestly didn't enjoy the game ""Owlboy"" for many reasons.I was really disappointed by the game after reading so many good reviews.This will mainly be a list of pros and cons based on my personal opinions about the game but I will try to explain some of them.Pros- amazingly beautiful pixel art- nice soundtrack - story was quite niceCons- controls are mediocre- gameplay feels lackluster¹- collectibles feel like non-existent²- nice gameplay elements or sections are usually only used once in the whole game- more annoying enemies than actually well designed ones (gameplaywise)³- some animations are really annoying and disturbing1: You can have multiple friends that you can carry around, drop them somewhere, pick them up again and use their weapons. Those friends can be called and send away with some kind of ancient teleport device. You can imagine the many possibilities this could be used for. In reality you just use them like one time each when they join your team, the rest of the game they are just used as your weapon or to clear paths that you cannot take otherwise. The most part of the game they feel useless.2: I like achievements and collectibles etc very much and I was sad to see that there were no collectible at all except normal coins (which there are a limited number of) and 3 big coins. With coins you can buy up to 8 items. Five of them are stat upgrades the rest are cosmetics. These cosmetics are temporary and lost the next time you take damage. After collecting everything you get one item that increases your utility...3: I don't care about hard games having frustrating enemies but I feel in this game they are completely unnecessary since you have no real disadvantage of dying. (You just get set back to the beginning of the room) My point here is that having actually well designed enemies would be much more profitable to the game than ones that chase you through multiple screens even though there is nothing to get from them anymore.All in all the game felt really nice in the beginning but went downhill in the middle. At some point the awesome art style couldn't really compensate the unsatisfying gameplay. I don't think good art style is necessary if the gameplay is good but this game just felt like it tries to justify underwhelming gameplay with a really amazing art style.Remember this is just my honest opinion about the game so you may like it but I didn't and I still don't think this game is worth ~20 bucks.

												The older I get, the more I look for emotions in the games I play. Most of the time the story is the essence of emotions. But somitimes its the characters. In this case, its the later.I went into this game based on the amazing reviews on internet, and I thought ""Ok, I am going to play up to 2 h and then refund the game"" Was I ever naive. The game dragged me in with its art, music, jokes and most of all, charachters. Dont get me wrong, the story is not bad, it is pretty good. Just all of the above mentioned are better.Do Yourself a favor, and at least give it a tray, and the farther You get in the game, the better it gets!			",116,17,2,3,5,0,10

												Excellent.That's the only word necessary to describe this game, there's nothing else that needs to be said. But I'll say more anyway.Every once and again a group of people come together to realize a vision, creating an experience that speaks to the soul. This game does that.Excellent music of the cinematic orchestral variety, beautiful scenery, fun gameplay, and an interesting story make this one of the must-play games of this quarter century.There are some hard boss fights, however it is worth persevering.If you liked this game, you would probably like Ori and the Blind Forest, and Undertale.

												This game was not what I expected and disappointing in many ways, but I also like it a lot. I’ll try to explain my reaction with some examples.First of all, I was expecting an old school platformer. It’s not a platformer, but rather a dual stick exploration shooter. I expected Owlboy to be the main character, but you mostly interact by carrying around other characters that are sort of your weapons and gadget.I loved the action, music, and art in their other game Savant, but this game isn’t quite like any of those. There are a few boss battles, but only one set pieces that’s crazy enough to be like Savant. The music is beautiful, but orchestrated rather than hard hitting dub step. The pixel art is similar and character designs are great, but I don’t love it like I expected to. Later on I realized I needed to enable letterboxing which fixed the aspect ratio and vastly improved the look of the art, but it’s still not quite what I expected. The rotating arms for twin stick aiming really throws me off and kills the look for me.It turns out that it feels much more of an homage to Zelda games or even Okami and really finds its grove in the middle. The puzzles and pacing is perfectly design. Everything feels like it was meticulously design to live in this world and it all fits together perfectly. The story is very grandiose and really pulls you through some massive events and character growth. The written dialog is top notch, funny when it needs to be and to the point.And then at the end it suddenly turns into the old school platformer that I expected at the beginning, and by that point I don’t really want it. A really odd choice and somewhat unsatisfying end. But the journey is great. There’s so many unique environments and no filler. It’s weird enough that it’s tough to recommend, but there’s also nothing else out there like it. Owlboy is the best Owlboy game I’ve ever played.			",458,259,6,39,101,18,55

												PLEASE NOTE: the following is my review of the game and MY opinion about the game. If you don't feel the same way that I do, please consider that this is only my opinion, and that it's completely fine if you don't agree. It won't change my mind. ...Where do I even begin with this game?...Owlboy. You don't think much of a title like that right away...But then this game pulled me in. I heard about this game from VideoGameDunkey, in his PAX video I believe. I saw the art and thought it was intriguing, as I am a big fan of art, whether it be music or visual art, or otherwise. Seeing that the game had come out recently, I bought it and started playing it. What I found was a great journey of many emotions and many wonders. I honestly felt like a child again playing this game. Owlboy pulled me in right from the start. I was interested in the characters, their plights, and I wanted to like everybody. And honestly, I did. I can safely say I like EVERY character in this game, good or bad, for different reasons.The art and the music is just simply breathtaking. I found myself getting lost exploring this world the whole way through. Quirky characters, funny items (play the game you'll understand), and the journey that was taken with friends. Owlboy makes you love every single friend you make in this game. Now, this all might be fine and good, but what about THE GAMEPLAY? I can assure you, the gameplay is great. It blends so many elements of metroidvanias, zelda-esque puzzle-solving, and platforming together seamlessly into one nice ball of fun. The bosses are all exciting, encourage solving another puzzle, and keep you gripped on the story. Play this game for about thirty minutes, and you'll see what I mean.D Pad Studios, if you guys are reading this, you spent a great 9 years making this game. I can't thank you enough. PLEASE, I IMPLORE YOU, consider porting this game to consoles, as other people should experience this wonderful masterpiece of an indie game. Any other developers that are out there playing this or considering this competition in any way, THIS IS HOW YOU DESIGN A VIDEO GAME. So many game developers today lose sight of how to design in an effort to rush a product out to grab cash quick. This game has been in development 9 years, and it's probably the best game I've ever played. No hyperbole, and no sarcasm.In conclusion, Owlboy is a fantastic journey through a beautiful world with rich scenery, a great soundtrack, WONDERFUL characters and an absolutely wonderful story that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. My only gripe with this game, is that I wish I had more. This game gets a 10/10 from me, and that's a hard score to come by from me these days. Thank you so much for making Owlboy, developers. All I want to do is jump back in and play the story again.			",90,11,0,16,2,0,6

												This game is absolutley the greatest in terms of being a 2D adventure game. The pixel graphics is a joy to look at because of the scenery is beautiful, the level designs were put into so much thought, the soundtrack is perfect with each scenario that is playing out, and the character's look can be clearly told in order to display what emotions they are feeling. The controls were simple and easy to control and the combat can be challenging. There were a lot of enemy variety that lets you use different weapons to counter them and puzzles that can be either a breeze to go through or a challenge that makes you think at one point. The story can be a hit or miss for some people but I enjoy the story thoroughly except the ending was a little disappointing in my opinion (I will get back to this). The characters were well thought out and the main character Otus is a joy to watch even though he doesn't talk at all. The ending really did not put the grand finale that I wanted it to be. Sure there is collectables that might unlock another ending (I'm not sure if this information is right or not), but if that is the case they need to have a resolution for the story and the characters you just encountered after the credits roll. I felt the ending did not provide a resolution but instead more questions for the main characters. The pricing might make people suspicious of the game but after playing 12 hours  with fun gameplay and interesting storytelling, I think it is worth it. The gameplay is solid, the soundtrack is beautiful, the graphics is breathtaking, and the story is interesting up until the last act which takes off a point in my review. I would rate the game a 9/10. Anyone who loves 2D pixel graphics game should experience this game.			",11,7,0,2,0,0,4

												I haven't felt so happy playing a platformer since Shovel Knight, and that game did not even come close to the amount of emotions I felt during this game.The story is well written, the attention to detail with the art and interactions is amazing, the gameplay is solid, fun and challenging at times and it truly rewards you for taking your time with it. Take the time to collect coins and examine everything because there are some interactions and touching scenes that you might miss out on if you rush through. Owlboy is a fantastic game and easily one of the best ones I've ever played. Its a masterpiece.			",160,13,0,22,9,1,11

												Absolutely gorgeous and a total blast. Infinite flight in a metroidvania-ish game is an interesting take and the developers have pulled it off excellently. If this seems like the kind of game you'd be into, then play it immediately.If I had to say one thing bad about it, the exploration aspects are kind of a pain in the neck. Most of the secrets are of the dull ""rub your face into every single wall in the game"" type. That's only really an issue if you try to 100% it though, and even then it's not a huge one.

												Okay, so... I pretty much knew very little about this game when I picked it up. I was aware that the plot was a big deal and that it was considered to be a good game. I wasn't disappointed.Let me get something out of the way: the story was, indeed, quite amazing. The narrative goes from the main character being a screw up to showing everyone that he was much more than just a kid by the end, and it has an overall feel-good tone all along. The musical score is also brilliant and uplifting (no pun intended, since you fly around as the titular owl boy Otus). The store page didn't lie about the boss fights: each and every one, considering how simple the game mechanics are, feel well balanced and engaging from the very first one.That said, Owlboy feels a bit short for an averagely skilled gamer used to exploration games with puzzles. The main source of longevity for the title is just in going through the story again because otherwise it's all about the collectathon for the 100%. Picture this: every area has some coins, which basically once you reach certain amounts you get health upgrades and QoL upgrades for the guys you use as gunners. The final upgrade in this chain grants you invulnerability (no joke!), which by the time you do get it you'll use it for the otherwise considerably-hard final encounter. If you ignore looking for every collectable and just do the actual game you might clock in at around 5 or so hours; that's not bad, but you can understand where I'm coming from, likely.It should be noted that dying in this game is litterally a minor setback with practically no consequences, given how you are restored to full health and the game likes to auto-save a lot on area transitions and clearing things (such as unlocking a door or collecting some thingamajig).Should you buy it? I guess. It is a good game, after all. The music really is great and the story is memorable. There's a funny moment here and there so it's not too bad. The post-ending extra area that clues you in on some very important key points of the plot also feels well done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Owlboy review:Owlboy is an action/adventure gsme where you play as a little owl called otus. Otus is seen as a good for nothing by his fellow owl students and his teacher asio since he makes many mistakes while learning to become a proper owl. Though otus does have one friend geddy. Geddy is a human unlike otus but they get along very well. our story begins whit asio waking up otus. He informs otus that they have overwatch duty and have to watch for pirates. Suddenly a random trouble maker shows up and otus and geddy start to chase said trouble maker. They run into a cave where they find a weird looking relic. Geddy decides to chip a piece of the relic and to there suprise geddy starts to teleport. this is a big mechanic in the game but more on that later. when Geddy and otus find there way out of the cave there are pirates every where. This leads into a stealth section where you cannot get spotted. Otus and Geddy manage to flee there town safely and our adventure begins. Alot more happens in the story over all and i found the story to be compelling. Story:7.5/10 charming characters and good lore.Gameplay wise Owlboy is a blast to sit down and play. Otus cant really do anything to protect himself but that is were geddy comes in. Geddy has a blaster that he can use against enimies that is why the teleporting mechanic is so important. being able to teleport Geddy and eventualy other partymembers by your side by pressing the E button is seemless and works really well. other than that there are many different puzzles to solve through out the story. The puzzles were never chalenging but fun non the less. There are also a few memerable boss fights. They are both challenging and uniqe. Gameplay 8/10 challenging fun The best part about owlboy by far is the presentation. The sprites are fantastic and the music is amazing in every way. It took the develepors 10 years to make this game and the sprites are probaly a big reason for that.Presiontation 10/10 Fantastic Verdict: Owlboy is a game whit a breif but compelling story with charming characters and fun dialouge. The gameplay is different, Challenging and Fun. The presiontation is amazing with beatiful sprites and music that made me stopplaying and just listen. And with all that in mind i give owlboy an overall score of:9/10 PLAY IT NOW			",57,3,0,6,6,0,1

												Fantastic game, whose art style and charming - if simple - narrative direction lends size and gravitas to a world that is actually much smaller than it first appears. I completed the game wishing I could spend a little more time in this world.The characters all have a rough, silly charm. It's an adventure of misfits coming into their own. In the way the story unfolds, it becomes clear that all characters have a certain real dimension often lacking from the cardboard cutouts featured in some AAA releases.The pixel art is breathtaking, and I look forward to more ""hi-bit"" games in the future. The mix of chiptunes and orchestral music help transition scenes from video-gamey exploration and combat to heavier, emotional scenes that convey tragedy, majesty, joy, or melancholy.Gameplay is fun. It was probably a challenge to make such a free-movement system feel challenging, but with the use of clever barriers and the unique companion system, the game can really become challenging.Perhaps most importantly, the game is rich in secrets and lore. Finding coins, while sometimes frustrating, is a rewarding endeavor. In a game like this, no pixels are out of place, so pay attention to subtle details like the movement of insects or the prominent foreground look to some walls. The last lore reveal is tragic, terrible and beautiful. I never felt like the game was wasting my time.All-in-all a great game, doesn't overstay its welcome, and hopefully an inspiration for future indy projects. 9/10, great for most gamers.(Side note - I played with a controller and found it a little more fluid than mouse and keyboard, fwiw)			",253,96,0,44,8,3,11

												This game blew me away. After watching Jesse Cox do a fan friday of the game, where he played through only a small amount of it, I had to purchase it and try it myself. The story is beauitful, as is the artwork and music. Some of the boss fights are very difficult, but the feeling of victory when you beat one is worth the frustration. I higly recommend this game to anyone who liked titles such as stardew valley, undertale, zelda and maybe even sonic.The game also has full compatibilty when it comes to controllers, which is always a plus and I recommend playing it using one, although you'll have a great experience with a keyboard and mouse as well. Personally I played the game with keyboard and mouse.Theres a few secrets I didn't find or finish, but the game lets you go back before the final bossfight to finish those, even if you already finished the bossfight. Your last save is before the fight.The end leaves you with a few questions, but the last section of the game may answer a few.Honestly, the game made me tear up a bit at certain points, and it has a very realistic feel to it, even with awkward silences and arguments that feel incredibly real, making you really connect to the characters. This will definitely go high on my games of the year list. Buy it and play it, it's cheap, it's worth it and it's long, I finished the game in around 11 hours. The story is really something you should see with your own eyes. Also, support the small indie company that spent 9 years developing this, they did a terrific job.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I could talk about the amazing and unique gameplay that is constantly evolving throughout the game. I could talk about the amazing soundtrack. I could talk about the amazing story and lore. I could talk about the amazing characters and character development.But all I really want to say is, how dare you make an ending that emotional? And not just the ending-ending when you've stopped playing and the credits roll. Nah. The WHOLE ending. I've never made so many uncomprehendable noises towards my computer screen in my life.... so yeah. Good job.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Never would I have thought that a 2d platformer could jerk a tear from my eye. Without going into spoilers, this is a story of redemption and friendship. Characters evolve in a way that makes sense and feels right. In terms of mechanics the game feels very good. Platforming is a little bit janky sometimes with Otus not exactly doing what you want him to but nothing game breaking. Level design is superb and the puzzles, though quite simple, add a bit of fun to the general exploring. Overall a must buy in my opinion and since you could probably run this with a bag of chips as a gpu and a hamster wheel as a processor, you honestly have no excuse not to.			",59,3,0,10,10,0,5

												I absolutely loved this game. I'm playing through it again to unlock some achievements! The music is Amazing. The characters are well designed and thought out. And the art is stunning. There are some moments where I kept dying and really wanted to throw my laptop out the window, but this game is forgiving when you fail lol. (I'm not a full-time gamer ok? haha very rusty!)I wish there might be a way to unlock a map for all the platforms (maybe when you finish?) so you can actually try getting all the coins without getting lost again. Especially in some post-destroyed boss fight areas like in the floating continents. But since it's a pretty small game, it's not a huge problem. Sometimes the music did stop playing midway which was a bit worrisome, but once I re-entered the area, it was okay again.Even with some glitches once in a while, I do reccomend this game to my friends who enjoyed Journey or Ori and the blind forest (though I felt that game was way harder than this) :) Or folks who want to just play a short and beautiful 2D platform RPG :)			",6,1,0,1,0,0,1

												Spectacular, Amazing, and extremely fun to play.The absolutely beautiful 32-bit graphics made me feel nostalgic all the way through the game, and put detail and life throughout every area that you explore. The emotional, and occasionally touching cutscenes really do make you care about the wonderful, and diverse characters that you meet. The gameplay mechanics were perfect in almost every aspect. Everything comes together in this incredible adventure that you have with Otus.It's not hard to tell that this game has had a lot of tender love and care put into it throughout its long development cycle of nine years, because this is one of the best games I've played this year.100/10 An experience that you simply cannot miss.

												Owlboy was a charming and beautiful little game that I very much enjoyed. For me, the game was a good difficulty level - it presented a decent challenge while not causing me to rage-quit. The characters are cute and had many moments throughout the game that were lighthearted and amusing, as well as dark, which made me feel a full range of emotions. I cannot compliment the artwork and music enough. This game is gorgeous, especially when one single person created all of the pixel work!That being said, this game is not perfect. The story is interesting, but not overly so. And while the game is beautiful, a lot of the areas felt a bit empty. I was able to 100% this game in 10-12 hours. That is something to keep in mind if you are thinking about return on investment. Still, I would definitely recommend this game.			",92,30,2,19,9,1,24

												Very polished, well done indie adventure game. From the character design, level design, visual themes, music, gameplay, the story - everything about this game is well done. I'm not sure how to better articulate it...The gameplay teaches you the correct way - no tutorial. Instead, its a story you play through that requires you to do certain things. You naturally learn on your own terms how to play the game through actually playing the game.The puzzles are intuitive and engaging.The combat allows you to approach from many different angles.The story is SO well tied together with so many layers of depth (this will especially be true if you go through the trouble of discovering all of its secrets hidden throughout the world).

 I'm going to warn readers now that there will be spoilers for the game's ending. I will mark spoiler territory with a spoiler sign. BackgroundOwlboy is an indie platformer developed by D-Pad Studio. It has been in development since 2007 and was relesed November 2016. PlotThe plot of Owlboy is set in the land of the sky and the islands of the world below has been separated by a catastrophic event. You play as Otus, an owl-human hybrid race called Owls. The game has a unique mechanic in the fact that Otus cannot really defeat any enemies, just stun them. Luckily, you get the help of your best friend Geddy, whom you'll be able to carry around and shoot enemies with his gun. Your duty as an owl is to guard your village from Pirates whom have recently united under a ferocious leader named Molstrom.ReviewLet's start by pointing out the obvious; the game is bloody gorgeous. The pixel-art for this game looks amazing and it is, in my opinion, one of the prettiest looking games I've ever seen. The world of Owlboy is extraordinarily pretty and the attention to detail is amazing. The characters all have their unique design which, in turn, makes all of them very memorable. The game's writing is also something you have to thank for that however, since all the characters have their own unique written personality. The people you meet all feel like genuine and real people.The soundtrack is great. It's not perfect, it's a rare thing that games pull that off, but the people behind the orchestral tracks of Owlboy has done a great job on tracks that are supposed to be more happy and adventurous, my favorite being the Tropos Day music. Unfortunately I can't really mention any boss themes that I found memoreable, but on an overall scale, I'd say that it's one of the best I've heard in recent years.The gameplay is simple. You fly, walk, shoot, jump, roll. Basic stuff. You have to fight your way through many bosses and puzzle your way through ancient dungeons. If I have to criticize something, it's the fact that a lot of the puzzles are too easy. The fact that you can fly makes a lot of the platforming almost non-existant. However, the boss fights are interesting, they are fast-paced and they are exciting. The pacing during fights can be a bit off sometimes, as there are bosses with attacks that are way too fast for a first-timer. Bosses should start easy, then scale up in difficulty, but Owlboy unfortunately often throws too much at the start of the fight and then doesn't up the difficulty enough to make the fight truly feel like a threat.Enemy variety gets a bit stale, but seeing how the game focuses around puzzles and platforming, it's not much of an issue.The story of Owlboy is simple. As I've mentioned above, the characters you meet during your journey really is what makes this game interesting. However, if you come to this game and expect a story as deep and touching as Undertale, you're wrong. The story works well, it has its plottwists and touching moments, but unfortunately it feels rushed. The pacing feels off sometimes and there are moments where you're supposed to get deep emotions, but because the pacing is too fast, you don't get enough time to attach to things. There are of course moments where you do genuinly feel sad or touched, but not as often as the game would like you to.Spoilers for the game's story up ahead.  The perfect example for this feeling of rushed is when the capital, Advent, gets destroyed during the pirate attack. The whole world around you is supposed to have been changed for the worst, but the player can't really feel much sympathy or sadness cause you do not know enough about the world to really feel sad for it. The whole story about the pirate threat feels rushed too, since one does not get proper establishment that they exist and they are a threat. The game just throws it in your face that ""Boom, they're here, they're bad, deal with it.""The ending is also something I have to criticize. Because of the pacing, the ending feels unsatisfying. Your part of the whole saving the world scenario is explained to not really matter. Solus, the 'Final boss' of the game, is explained to have just tried to save the world from floating up into space all along and one also realizes that your role is pretty useless. Solus' plan would've worked even without you interfering and the only thing Olus' does is actually almost ruining the whole thing. Your sacrifice in the end is pretty lame, due to the fact that the only thing you really did was to amend your own mistake. It doesn't make any sense either that Solus doesn't explain his intentions from the start. If he truly meant good, say so, don't just run away without explaining it.Spoiler territory over. Speaking as a person who cannot buy everything I want, 22.99€ is quite a price for an 6 hour game. After beating the game, I don't really have any feelings of wanting to go back to collect every item or coins either. The Bougin challenge is not fun either. Final Thoughts and Verdict It seems like I've been bashing the game more than I have been praising it, but I am really fond of this game. It's not going to be the next big hit like some might've expected, but it is an extremely polished game with some of the best visuals and characters that has come out over the recent years. The music is good, the visuals are fantastic and the characters are memoreable. I do highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of platformers or just wants to have a good time, cause you'll certainly find it in this game. The 9 years of development time has certainly paid off in this happy and touching story about one little Owl.			",140,10,0,13,13,2,22

If you dont have the game, GET IT NOW! $25 may seem like a steep price for a pixel rpg for some people, but trust me, its worth it! 10/10 would play again but probably wouldnt because i dont have the patience to replay 11hrs but i might idk. :P (Also it has at LEAST 10 hrs of gameplay which tbh is a bargian for $25)BUY IT NOWWWWWWWWW			",22,6,1,3,4,0,0

												Definitely a very fun to play game with somewhat unique mechanics and a good story that keeps you playing on. The visual style is adorable and feels very pleasant, the animations and expressions of the characters feel very well made. The music is good and adds to the general atmosphere and feel of the game.I haven't finished the game yet, but I do feel that there could be more done when it comes to the items that upgrade Otus and his friends, more choice to what you can do and how that helps or does not help you in your quests. I play the game with a logitech controller and it's quite fine but I don't like the aiming with right stick, it feels quite difficult to pull off for some reason, especially when you have to aim quite precise (Twig).I did ran into some bugs, such as getting knocked into a wall and not getting out of it, and sometimes the audio disappears for a few moments, and sometimes the cutscenes are loading really long. But overall, these are minor issues and should definitely not hold you back from giving Owlboy a shot.			",52,18,1,6,2,0,3

												Pretty good. Final boss was very fun and utilized lots of the skills that you learned in the game. Although the characters were not particularly interesting, they make for a pretty fun ambiance. I did want to fight the pirate king though. Dissapointed that I couldn't. ",92,7,4,13,8,0,3

												Owlboy is a game that traditional platforming fans might find lacking,  as there is not much in the way of challenging platforming sections in the game's ~6 hour runtime. Most of the challenging platforming is concentrated in the last hour. The mechanics of the game (infinite flight for the protagonist) naturally make it difficult for the developer to create platforming sections that test the player's mastery of the game's physics. The platforming is not what I would call the game's strong suit, but it doesn't have to be- everything else is top notch.The pixel art is jaw dropping and backgrounds are frequently gorgeously animated. The music is a standard orchestral affair, and there are plenty of strong tracks within the soundtrack. The characters of the world are great- Otus, the main player character, is established early on as a sympathetic failure of an owl whom most characters brush off as useless or disappointing, especially so Otus' teacher, Asio. Otus starts out almost friendless, but the band of buddies Otus meets along his journey keep him in high spirits. My favorite surprise of the game was how expressive Otus was- despite being mute, he has a litany of facial expressions that keep him from just being a stonefaced protagonist. Every character in the game has great dialogue, especially so for Geddy, Otus' best bro. Geddy is the star character of the game scriptwise. He says the right stuff at the right times.The game does not last any longer than it needs to. It establishes the main conflict well within the first 20 minutes of the game and solves the conflict within a reasonable time period- should the game have lasted an hour longer, I imagine I would've started to feel the tedium of traversal in the game through the same areas weigh on me. The level design is about what you would expect it to be for a game featuring a flying protagonist- many floating islands in the hub-like areas and frequent linear sections limiting flight possibilities in the areas related to plot progression (though these flight limiting sections are often not as interesting as I would like them to be personally, but again it's not a dealbreaker). To that end, if you're expecting a hardcore or extremely difficult platforming experience with Owlboy, this game is simply not for you. Look elsewhere.However, if you want a nice 6 hour experience with amazing presentation that tells an engaging story with a great cast of characters....this is the right game for you. Is the game worth the 25 dollar price point? I'd say the value I would put it at is closer to 20 dollars.... Though of course, if your game is in development for 9 years, I suppose you really want to get your investment back sooner rather than later, so I can understand why the devs put the price point where they did.

												Alright. Owlboy is beautiful, well made, and brimming with charm. The majority of it is inspiring, sweet, lightheated, and fun. The endgame is a spiralling existential crisis, which that's not my cup of tea for my method of escapism. There is certainly merit in it -- it was something executed artfully and beautifully. I just didn't want a game that made me feel good suddenly make me feel very bad forever. Why is that such a prominent trend recently?			",26,9,0,16,4,0,1

												Owlboy is a good game, not perfect, not a 10/10 just plain good. Lovable characters, fantastic pixel art and animations, great music.But it also is a bit too easy, controls could be tighter and because it is a mixture of genres it lacks a bit personality in the gameplay.I may play it again to find all the collectibles and secrets but not for the story or gameplay itself, unfortunately.

												2 hours in and I found myself struggling to take a break. Almost a decade ago we were introduced to this promising classic take on a pixel 2d platformer(ish?) game and despite them working behind closed curtains I can honestly say it was worth the wait. I honestly only caught wind of the game's progress because a friend of mine mentioned it was well along development a few months back and could release in a matter of months. What do I have to say about the game itself? - Well, the protagonist is pretty nice. I genuinely felt a little bad for the fella in the beginning but he's currently off to make things right in the world of Owlboy. - The first few (mini?) boss fights I've encountered were kinda mindless. I literally stumbled into them, steamrolled the bosses and kept it moving without much thinking power.- The puzzles so far are somewhat interesting but a little straightforward. I'll save judgment for that for now though since I don't think I've even made it halfway through the game yet.- The soundtrack is oddly interesting with its differences. Some parts of the game are like chiptune-ish while others are like modern-day soundtracks. The inconsistency kinda throws me off sometimes in terms of immersion.I don't really like writing stupid long reviews so I just want to keep it short and simple as possible. 9 years of work right right here and it's visually appealing and plays well.

I saw the price tag and thought it was a little pricey, but got it anyway. Within 15 minutes, I was sure that this was going to be an amazing game. The sound track is legendary, every new area comes with new exciting music, with day and night themes. The gameplay is clever but not overwelming. The characters are relatable and feel very real. Buy this game now because it has fun gameplay, an interesting story, and the best soundtrack of almost any game i have ever played.			",108,14,1,16,9,0,8

Apparently this game has been in development for almost ten years but I've heard nothing of it until now and I'm glad I hadn't because that made this a pleasant surprise. I've only just completed two dungeons and can already tell I'm in for a treat. It just oozes charm as well as god-tier pixel art and a fantastic soundtrack!This game a labor of love, it has a soul!

												Owlboy is beautiful. Don't be put off by price tags, these $25 is worth more than most other games you've bougth at even higher tags. To me Owlboy is a story of friendship, the ability to look past mistakes and what you can achieve together. And throwing monkeys in lava. The different characters have so much personality to them, shown in both dialouge and expressions. While the story itself can be completed fairly quickly there's still a lot to explore and find. Spending time finding coins for the Buccanary Shop is totally worth the time spent simply for the amazing dialouges you'll get from it. There are secrets to be found as well, and are well rewarded with various lore events so I do recommend spending time outside the main story itself. A lot of love has gone into making this game, to make sure we can love it in return. And I absolutely loved the time I spent on this game.			",243,110,2,50,19,2,22

												I really wanted to like this game. But as for many others the main sellingpoint was the gorgeous pixel art. The things that made me to not recommend this game was:* The gamedesign: Boring puzzles and leveldesign.* To much dialogue: Don´t get me wrong, I love when the charaters is giving some personality, but not when I have to pause time after time to wait for the characters to say something none important stuffs when I am right in a good flow.* To much effects on the screen. Lovely pixel effects and animations but to much, makes the combat to messy. Weapons that makes the whole screen red.* The hit system. When the player is hit he usully hits the ground and looses so much flow in the gameplay that its just gets annoying.			",145,97,2,13,9,1,25

It doesn't treat you like an idiot with its puzzles, it instead subtly nudges you in the correct direction.

												Owlboy is the perfect trap. It has great visuals, amazing music, and an overall unique feel.On the other hand... Once you start playing, you notice that the character relationships feel forced. Then, the environment is bland and keeps you in small corridors for the most part, completely removing the explorative possibilities with the flying mechanic. Finally, there are quite a few issues technical-wise (I glitched outside the map unintentionally, spotted a few typos, and found a dead pixel in the textures now and then).Everything seems like it should work, but it feels like something is missing at all times.

The gameplay  is alright, the controls are wonky. You press RT to shoot. This is a damn platformer not a  FPS.   I got thing eles to say, this game is good. Recommend if your a big fan of 2d platformers like i'am.Sorry if this review is terrible, i'm not a good   critic. My rating: 9/10I took 1 point because of the controls .			",159,10,6,13,14,1,4

												This game is beautiful.The controls are tight and responsive, even in flight where you'd expect them to be floaty. The story is great, even though some specific parts can be a little predictable (One specific part follows an overused action movie cliché that can be seen coming from miles away.) The soundtrack and pixel art is absolutely gorgeous and doesn't try for a nostalgia grab at all. The music isn't chiptune, and the color palette isn't restricted to a short, specific range of colors to emulate the NES, SNES, or SEGA Genesis art/sound styles. The music sounds like a full orchestra, and the art is about as detailed as pixel art can get. The game also runs at a constant frame rate of 60fps with little to no frame drops.The gameplay is really unique, and there's really only one thing that I can compare it to.Remember when you were really young and wanted to play ""Sonic 3"" with your older brother, but got stuck playing as Tails because that's who player 2 controls? Remember how Tails was actually really useful to control because he can fly and carry Sonic around to hard to reach areas? That's right, you're pretty much playing as Tails carrying your friends around, but this time you're player one, you make the decisions now. When you're carrying any one of three companions, the game goes from a scrolling platformer to a twin-stick shooter with puzzle-platformer aspects. It really is a lot more fun than just being able to ferry the real protagonist around.The characters are all very diverse, and though the trope of ""silent protagonist"" is there, its part of the character. Most games that follow that trope do so to help the player put their own personality onto the character they are controlling. In this game, Otus (playable character) is mute, and other characters comment on this. Instead of Otus' personality being expressed through dialogue, it is shown through his expressions and animations. Throughout the game, Otus will show his reactions to getting bullied with a saddened expression. He'll react to his teacher and father figure downright hating him for being such a disappointment at everything by crouching a little and covering his ear-slits (because he's an owl) with his hands to try to block out what's being said. When he drinks something that raises his max HP, he'll stand stock-still, stiff as a board with a wide eyed, surprised expression. At the end of the game is the only time we ever see him take on an angry/determined expression, but its easily identifiable.The only gripe I have with this game is the price. I mean, I would have spent $25-$30 anyways so I could get the soundtrack, but $25 for the base game is a little steep. I don't regret spending the money at all, though. I'm not trying to justify the price by saying ""I enjoyed it, so the price is worth it to everyone, anyone who disagrees can go to Hell."" The price is a bit too high, and that will be a turn-off for some people.			",143,51,3,27,17,0,4

For a game with such a strong and whimsical start, it all falls into a mash of uninteresting mecahanics, frustrating gameplay rife with enemies and situations that seem unfair, and a fairly standard story.I had high hopes for Owlboy and right from the opening title screen I found myself enjoying the inspiring music and getting transfixed with the world it was building with just those two elements. I even lost myself to apparent metroidvania style of level design and the little bits of flying I got to do. The dialogue was fairly witty and making Otus mute was an interesting take on the silent protagonist trope that I adored right off the bat.Then I had to go to the first dungeon and found myself enjoying the game less. The flying had quickly become far too slow and I ""fixed"" this by air dodging everywhere instead. That was forgivable because, ""hey, it's like Ocarina of Time! You just roll everywhere anyway, right?"" But man does flying feel like the worst thing after having to traverse open areas with it. I found myself wanting to not explore anything because it meant I have to fly everywhere, and I'm the kind of person who 100% goes left when the game points me toward the right. The combat in this game, in no respect, ever wowwed me. When I learned that it was a twin-stick shooter, I was on-board but skeptical. I figured there would be some fairly immediate upgrades to make Geddy's blaster feel less slow and crappy, so I was immediately excited when I got Alphonse! Until, that is, it turned out that his blunderbuss took what felt like a year and a half to fill up. The idea, of course, is to blast away with Geddy then switch to Alphonse and do a chunk of damage, so I get it, but it's bad. Nothing you do feels quick and powerful, but boy howdy do the enemies have the reverse issue!I was having a good time with the game during the second dungeon area, which is a bit of a stealth mission done simply and elegantly, and I was ready to go on to the next big level! And then that level threw you into so much frustration that after I was done SMASHING into it with my beaten and bloody head, I immediately quit the game feeling cheated. I respect games that take a tough-but-fair approach. Part of that approach is to make sure your players feel like they're getting stronger with the characters. I was ready for a game, priding itself on its SNES/Genesis style, to be difficult-yet-rewarding, but part of that is giving your player ample rewards in the game to keep them going. I don't need much. A simple blaster upgrade for Geddy, a timer reduction for Alphonse's shotgun; anything that would make you feel just a little more powerful would be great. Instead, you take your thousand coins, go to a shop with a shopkeeper who's punchline is that she beats her employees, and then buy a health upgrade and a freakin' hat or two.At the very least, this game is pretty. With artwork this fantastic, I can tell Owlboy's look took nine years of tweaking and changing and reworking and deconstructing and rebuilding to get it just right. I can give nothing but a massive kudos to the artists and musicians of this game. The presentation is lively. This game truly gave me that nostalgic feeling of a late SNES title like Super Castlevania or Demon's Crest, or even Chrono Trigger but with a lot more polish and the power of a PC to back it up. Even the story I found myself enjoying despite it being a fairly on par experience.But beauty is only skin deep. When you get down to the skeleton of a game, the gameplay, it's all rather feeble and dusty.			",179,30,2,17,12,1,9

												Alright, I just beat Owlboy after 7 hours of play (too much of which was cutscenes for my taste). I did not 100% it, though I did do some of the extra content. It was alright, but highly disappointing. Not a bad game, but only excellent in its use of pixel art. Wait for a sale. George Weidman (Super Bunnyhop on Youtube) described this game best: ""I love you, but sometimes you're a piece of ****""TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE: I believe the game at one point exited to desktop suddenly without warning. However, I can't replicate this. What I'm certain it did was minimize itself at points without warning, despite me only using a 360 controller. This happened a couple of times, and may have something to do with using a second monitor. There were a couple of framerate hiccups that frankly shouldn't have been there considering the style of game, but it wasn't anything harmful to the experience. You have some options for graphical settings, though not many. Understandable for the style of game. PRESENTATION: Lots of wonderful, stunning pixel art that I appreciate thoroughly. Animations are also nice, though there are unfortunately not many of them to see. Characters can emote, and Otus is a precious cinnamon bun, but after the 50th time he gets spooked or looks dead-eyed you kinda wish there were more things they could do. However, what's there is very nice. Menus worked alright, UI was fairly minimal and unintrusive. You have options to change parts of the UI, which is appreciated. There was a surprising amount of the screen going a single colour (white or red) due to shooting an enemy or something, and I found that pretty jarring. GAMEPLAY: This is where Owlboy just tanked for me. The first couple of hours were enjoyable, even if largely scripted. The ability to fly is nice, though it ultimately may have done the game more harm than good. In Owlboy you can fly indefinitely without consequence, which must have posed many problems for level designers trying to make a challenging 2D ""platformer"". It is more of an exploration-based game like Zelda or Metroid, but the only real exploration is done in the game's dungeons. There's some rudimentary puzzle solving, stealth sections, and shooting enemies, standard stuff. However, I never got into a flow like you might in a Zelda dungeon, where you start being unable to do very little to progress and by the end, can do everything in it. It didn't feel like Metroid either; I never felt lost, I never felt I had to explore much more than one or two screens over to find my next path to progress. The level design isn't particularly complex or elegant. Case-in-point, there was a section where you pass some deadly moving blocks into a room with a giant screw blocking your path. I'd never seen anything like it prior, and couldn't figure out the solution. There was a terminal window in the room, but all it said was a bunch of vague stuff about the story. I tried to leave the area, but found the deadly moving blocks would kill you no matter what timing you used, so all I could do was try the screw again. I did end up progressing, but from what I could tell, nothing prior taught you how to do it, and the solution was not even slightly in-line with anything shown before. That's poor level design, even if I'm just bad at puzzles. The real boss fights, while good when present, were far too scarce. Several ""boss fights"" were nothing more than waves of common enemies thrown at you, which was disappointing. This also exacerbated what I feel was the absolute biggest problem: the shooting. It's laid out like a twin-stick shooter, but the weapons at your disposal either don't feel remotely satisfying to use, taking far too many shots to kill, or are just impractical for combat. A shotgun you get halfway through has a preposterous cooldown, which is awful when it's used for several repetitive puzzles. Most of the game you'll be mashing a single button to shoot, just because they found it necessary to give your gun a 3-shot burst if you don't do that. Combat isn't just repetitive and time-consuming, it's also frustrating. When you get hit, the whole screen stops moving for a fraction of a second and you get flung in a seemingly random direction. If you hit a wall or an enemy, you also slide along that wall for a period of time. This looks good to a viewer, but when you're playing, it just feels like the controls are being yanked from your hand. CLOSING: I'm sure you can get something like double the time I spent out of this game, but I'd never want to do so. The game works fundamentally, but it's just not very fun after a while. The art is beautiful, but the game lags behind, trying to compensate by shoving story beats in your face. If you want pretty art and a bland game that might have you dying more than you expected, but not because it's difficult, go for it. I'd wait for a sale.Gave this a 5/10			",180,30,9,18,10,2,20

												Owlboy is simply one of the most impressive indie games I've seen the last years, and I'd say the overall experience makes it equally worth playing as the likes of Shovel Knight, Braid, Cave Story, Undertale and Hyper Light Drifter (not to say that these other games don't have strengths this game doesn't have). The pixel art is stunningly good, perhaps the best I've seen in any hi-bit game. Especially the multiple layered backgrounds look amazing. It contains a very charming cast of characters, who are well-written and highly likable. The OST fits the game perfectly, and some of the tracks will hit you right in the feels. The gameplay is fairly simple, but with an intersting blend of mechanics for the combat. You fly around freely, though you can only stun enemies with Owlboy; for dealing damage you need to use other characters you encounter in the game, and their respective attacks are effective against different set of mobs. The combat works as a twin stick shooter where you can freely aim and fire in all directions irrespective of movement or the direction Owlboy is facing. The gist of it is dashing to dodge mobs while aiming and firing with correct timing, as well as swapping efficiently between your different characters depending on the specific weakness of the mob(s). Your are pointed to the main dungeons in a mostly linear fashion, interspersed with cutscenes and dialogue that drives the story. But there's also metroidvania-like exploration for collectibles (coins and golden disks) and simple puzzles, and the game handles the dungeons well by keeping them fresh and unique, often revolving around gimmicks specific to the abilities of the most recently acquired character. Owlboy doesn't have the same replayability as Shovel Knight with its speedrun achievement or Undertale with its multiple endings, and it's not a hard game to beat. But as an aesthetic experience it's superior to both. This is a masterly handicrafted game, a labor of love, and the most comfy 10 hours you're likely to spend this year.			",54,17,0,13,0,0,2

												Owlboy is a very charming and beautiful game that definitely proves how games can be art. The game was made by D-Pad Studio, a team of only 5 people, during the period of 9 years and it was well worth the wait. Every pixel in this game shows how much of a labor of love this game is. The first thing you’ll notice when you launch Owlboy is the amazingly fitting and atmospheric soundtrack right from the menu screen. Second thing you’ll notice is the most beautiful and detailed pixel art I’ve seen  in a video game since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. From characters and animations to the game world itself everything looks gorgeous, stylish and unique. The gameplay is simple, but very well made. It’s a mix of flying, dashing, jumping and shooting. You’re Otus, an owl from the village Vellie, and you fly around the world while carrying your friends to help you on your adventures with their unique abilities. The story is charming, filled with humor, but sad at times and characters are very believable and relatable. The only thing that left me kind of underwhelmed and disappointed is the ending. I really hope that D-Pad Studio will release some kind of DLC to explain the ending and the lore more because me, and I’m sure many other people, would like to know more about the characters and the world at the end. Other than that Owlboy is a phenomenal game that I can’t recommend enough. It’s easily a new indie classic and one of my favorite games of all time. Go buy it, it’s worth every cent.

												Pros:-Story-Art-Soundtrack-Original MechanicsCons:-A few wonky controls    Owlboy is one of my favorite games of the year. This game features some of the most beautiful artwork of any game I have played in recent memory. The soundtrack is awe-inspiring and it hasn't been been since I was a young boy playing Chrono Trigger on the SNES that a band of pixelated heroes had felt so... real. There are times in the game that you will be reminded of the classics from yesteryear; there are hints of Zelda, Rayman, Metroid, Castlevania but Owlboy always feels distinctively it's own thing. There are a few questionable mechanics in the game. One of your companions has a recharge rate on their weapons that can be absolutely maddening. Though I'm not quite sure whether this is a bug or a feature as it lends to every single one of your companions being indespensible, never being able to rely completely on one single companion. The story remains the single best thing about this game. It covers themes of loss, failure, inadequacy, and learning to have hope in hopeless times in ways that no other medium could. If you enjoy SNES era games or story-rich indie titles Owlboy is a must play. 9.5/10 ",28,10,0,9,0,0,1

You can tell the amount of love and effort put into Owlboy from it's well written story, loveable characters, fantastic art, and (not to mention) pretty darn good music. The combat is unique, not mention this boss fights are pretty freakin' rad too. However, if you are playing on mouse and keyboard prepair to have a bad time. The controls are decent, though it requires a lot of dexterity. Owlboy is by far one of the best games I've played this year.			",63,44,0,17,8,0,0

												Oh boy, I was blinded sided by Owlboy.  Over the 8 or so years this game had been in development I somehow managed to avoid hearing a single thing about it until I saw it on the front page of steam. I bought it on a lark and have had a hooting good time. The first thing you notice is that the game is pretty, every aspect of the game looks great and is a joy to look at, from backgrounds to enemies, and most of all the main characters, especially our mute avian hero Otus. His small sprite is highly expressive and very cute that instantly endears you to him. The writing is also top-notch. The story is interesting and all the characters involved make you want to learn more about what is going on. The game is a touch ruthless on hammering home the fact that our hero is a low bird on the totem pole, many characters in power are dismissive of you and actively blame the little owl for things way beyond his control. From this arises one of my problems with the game, and fair warning this paragraph will contain some slight spoliery things. The problem with the writing I have is that come the last leg of the game you get the feeling that you in fact have just made things worse than if you stayed home. The first few missions of the game you get beaten down for failures that Otus had no control over and this instills in the player a feeling of proving that you are right and can save the world so we cheer on Otus and the gang through their hardships.  This falls apart in the last segment of the game, it’s revealed that you have in fact been getting in the way of the character really trying to save the world and almost blow it completely and doom all of creation. That is to say you get a feeling that had you just stayed home then things would have played out similarly in the grand scheme of things. This could be a damning ending for a game but the rest of the experience was so wonderful and the characters you get to interacts with make it more of an annoyance than ruining the whole thing. The game is also very good as, well, a game. The controls are tight and flying with Otus feels great as you traverse the world around you. Once you can pick up your friend Geddy (and a few others later) the game becomes a two stick shooter, you move with one hand and, aim and shot with the other which feels great. The game feels fun and rewarding to play though it is admittedly not that difficult. I don’t mind the casual feeling of the game though for some it is a valid strike against it. The game ramps up the difficulty at a fair pace though it never gets too hard that one should be stuck because of combat for too long. The puzzles also aren’t that hard but I feel that it helps the casual pace of the game where focus is more on having fun with the good controls and keeping the narrative flowing at a decent clip. .  The one point of contention I have seen many bring up is the price and I understand it, I feel that 25$ for the 9-10 hours you get from beating the game is worth it to me, I feel that each of those hours is so jam-packed with lovely visuals and fun gameplay that the quality makes up for the quantity. Some people evaluate the price of their own time differently than I do so may not feel that it is worth it for the amount of game play so I would keep how highly you value hours per dollar in mind before buying the game. Overall I feel Owlboy is worth a play, it’s a delight to control as well as look at and the characters are fun and interesting as is the writing, for the most part. The game left me happy with the time I spent with it though a bit hungry for more content. I also want to pay kudos to the Devs who are active on the discussion board and even helped me when I did encounter a (now patched) game breaking bug within the game. I say take wing with Owlboy and friends and explore this colourful world! ",25,7,0,8,3,0,2

												I'm still progressing through my first playthrough but I can definitely recommend this game to anyone who might had an interest. It's got some strange gameplay which takes a little getting used to, but it's fun, beautiful, and the story is surprisingly dark but still has an amazing charm to it that'll make you smile.My only real 'issue' so far is how easy it can be to lose your character in even mildly tense moments. Especially because often times when being hit, you're sent flying in a seemingly random direction and you lose track of where you're at. Toss in the fact that being toss into a wall will play the same sound as being hit and you quickly start panicing because you think you're being hit multiple times but you're not. This is especially problematic in boss battles with a lot of moving pieces and projectiles.Overall though, that's a very minor issue. I'd still whole heartedly recommend it.[Update]Having beaten the game, I've got to say... the story genuinely impressed me. I felt engaged from start to finish. My only real 'issue' so to speak is that with the game starting off with such a beautiful hook, the final resolve to that conflict seems underwhelming.Spoiler Alert:A mentor which was disappointed in you throughout the entire game seems to have a sudden change of heart with no real explaination before ending off his time in the game with the cliche ""I always knew you could do it."" I would have liked to see a more complex development of his character since it really seemed to be a major motivation on your part to earn.The overall story exposes some fantastic potential for lore that seems untouched. But taken at face value, what you've got is an adventure spinkled with developing friendship, dark consequences, realistic optimism, touching moments of sadness, and genuine charm.

Owlboy perfectly melds adventure and exploration with free-roaming duel stick shooting mechanics.The story is incredibly polished and full of relatable and charming characters with themes of friendship, living with disabilities, and heorism. Paired with the exceptional pixelated graphics and wonderous music, Owlboy is a experience of awe and wonderment.Recommended for: Story lovers, empathic people, and adventure-seekers.

												This is game is a complete masterpiece. I had never heard about it until a few days ago, and I instantly fell in love with the artwork. I had no idea what the game was supposed to be like, I bought it purely because it LOOKED nice. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it also has a great story, unique and loveable characters, amazing music and sound design, superb animation, and of course fun and interesting gameplay.I've played for about 3 hours so far, and am just now feeling like the adventure is really getting started, though I've enjoyed every minute of it. I was a little worried that it might be short with not a whole lot to it, as these visually impressive 2D games sometimes tend to be, but every once in a while you get a true masterpiece like this, where everything from design to gameplay is spot on, and isn't too short and gives you a lot to do.This is not a multiplayer or open world sandbox with endless replayability game which seems to be the strange requirement for a lot of people in games these days. It is fairly linear with some exploration in areas, finding coins to unlock upgrades, with secret rooms and hidden chests. I honestly miss games like this, that aren't overly complex with upgrade trees and skill sets. It's quite simple, but does a really good job at being simple, fun, and intriguing. I can definitely see myself being satisfied with a sense of completion when I manage to finish it.With all that being said, I think the price is completely justified. This isn't a short random indie game with nothing much to it, it's a full blown story and adventure with puzzles, boss fights, numerous and unique creatures and characters, secrets to uncover, and has amazing artwork. You can definitely tell that a lot of skill, hardwork, and time went into making this. I want more games like this, so I'm willing to help fund the cause of bringing back games with the magic and creativity that we just don't see so much anymore.			",43,10,0,1,10,0,8

												This is the best game I've played in at least 2 years. The animation is beautiful right off the bat and continues to amaze me throughout the game. The Musical score... Oh my god the musical score for this game is incredible, the music really drives the tone of the game and helps the player feel invested. The story is also good, the characters are loveable and I became emotionally invested in the them 15 minutes in. Game play wise, the movement is satisfying and crisp. It feels so good to just woosh around the overworld. I love puzzles and this game does them well for the most part with new innovative ideas that make you think. Although some of the puzzles get a little repetitive, this game still does a great job at keeping the game fresh and fun the whole way through. This game is fantastic, and I hope it get's the love it deserves.			",51,3,0,6,2,0,0

												Simon Andersen, aka. Snake, is one of the few kings of pixel art. Visually, Owlboy is a masterpiece. It's a monument that tells pixel art is not only for retro.On top of this, the atmosphere is so original that it's on par with say, Fez. It tells a great story, not one with too many surprises but it will drag you in.Sounds... well, I didn't know a platformer could have music of this quality.The game play is also original, you don't get to control an inherently flying character everyday in a platformer. The game is much like a metroidvania but with a few twists and RP elements. It isn't hard, isn't a walk in the park either but it's not for who looks for finger breakers such as Ori. Actually I like this better, as I'm not a player with too much time.Controls are quite good. Which is very important because I hate clumsy platformers, and it's unfortuately too common in metroidvanias these days.			",318,231,4,58,42,4,85

												Brilliant so far.I wouldn't consider myself a fan of 'old school pixel art' but I still think this game looks gorgeous.Especially the character sprites with their detailed animations and cute facial reactions are a joy to behold.Story sofar has been very entertaining with characters I immediately cared about and the number of well implemented little twists on the gameplay have made it very hard to put the game down.There were a few intances of background looking like foreground and vice versa, but since you can just fly into it to check (or do a 'faceplant-check' by throwing one of your companions against it : P) and don't loose any 'progress' like you might do in a J&R it didn't feel frustrating at all, just a little bit confusing at times.I think this game is worth a try even if you do not consider yourself a fan of the genre (like myself).-totally not an owl *hoot hoot*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most beautiful and touching side scroller I've played in years. Had me emotionally invested in the first 5 minutes.Incredibly solid controls.Beautiful graphics.Amazing Soundtrack.Absolutely perfect writing.*Final view on the game after completion*Owlboy is an instant classic in this generation of pixel games and platformers. The art is by far the best work I have ever seen in a game of this stature. It is lush, beautiful, and masterfully crafted. I looked forward to every new environment as each one told a part of the story. Embedding the story into the art itself made it all the more enjoyable.Apart from the art, the soundtrack is absolute perfection. A series of wind and string instruments form a masterful composition that captures the immense imagery of flight and wonder that the story takes hold of. From fights to story, the music captures the moment perfectly. Even the lack of music in certain parts of the game build tension or allow the excellent sound design take the reigns for a few minutes.The controls are incredibly tight, and the gameplay follows suite. Everything ran together very naturally, from combat to exploration. It reminded me vividly of rolling around in Zelda games to get places faster. But also provided a unique flying combat that I found thoroughly enjoyable all throughout the game. The platforming, especially in late game, is extremely well executed. This being said, a lot of the game is spent flying, but the parts in between are incredibly well done.The story had me from the first 5 minutes. And by the end had me crying more than I care to admit. It's incredibly well written to the point where I missed twists that were completely unexpected, but made perfect sense. Even the art hinted at these twists and story elements, it was amazing to make the connection between these things. I adore the characters, all of them are fleshed out as much as they need to be and not too much. They have aspirations and goals as well as fantastic and lovable personalities. Even the way they handled Otus as a character was perfection. His body language and personality shined through, making him just as lovable as all the characters around him.If you are looking for a solid 5-8 hours of gameplay, 10 if you plan on collecting everything and finding all the secrets. Which I recommend. Owlboy delivers, with incredible grace. It's worth the price in it's entirety. You get an amazing piece of art and the amazing journey it provides.Easily this game gets a 10/10 from me. I highly recommend it.			",309,31,9,24,18,4,26

												Visuals: Lots of effort and love was put into the animation and level of detail in objects, environments, etc. The ""cut scenes"" are put together really well, there's no guessing as to what's-what. EASILY some of the best sprite-work I've ever seen.Music: Solid. It helps create the atmosphere the developers were going for.Story: Characters are mostly forgettable, save for Otus (he is the protagonist after all). Story has some weight to it, but often times there's a difference in what I feel (eh) and what the game wants me to feel (despair).Controls: Twin-stick, though it supports WASD+Mouse. Standard 2D Platforming fare otherwise, with flying being really easy to use. Overall, pretty solid, but it took me some getting used to using the LT/RT buttons for the picking-up/throwing mechanics.Gameplay: A bit lacking for my tastes. Not a whole lot to explore except for finding hidden chests and what-not. I didn't find the puzzles challenging. The Boss Fights: some may find challenging but not in a way that tests your reflexes as one would expect from this kind of game. It's more of a ""what the hell do I do"" kind of thing. Most players should have no issue figuring out what to do, which doesn't leave much in terms of an actual challenge.Overall: Good game, but the drawbacks mentioned above keep it from greatness.A soft 7/10			",262,28,1,54,17,2,26

I'd only give it real gripe for some of the actual gameplay where the controls are either hypersensitive or when input isnt recognized right so you take extra damage from dumb stuff.I also wish there was some sort of newgame+ where the game is harder, there are more minigames and the bosses maybe have new mechanics.

												I absolutely can't recommend this game enough.  Beautiful pixel art, gorgeous soundtrack, platformer-style collectables and secrets, loveable characters, and some heartwarming moments for those willing to learn about the inhabitants of the world.The gameplay is its weakest point by far, but by no means is it bad.  Part DKC2, part Zelda, part Metroidvania.  The difficulty is never very taxing, which may be a negative for some, but I felt like it was appropriately done for maintaining a relaxed atmosphere while still pushing against you enough so that you can feel accomplishment with your character.  Some of the dungeon design was a bit annoying.  I frequently would try to go the ""wrong"" way to grab secrets before progressing only to take the correct route and be locked out of part of the dungeon for an extended period, making it difficult to remember what routes I had and hadn't looted.  Ultimately, getting 100% of the collectibles was pretty painless, though.  The cannon minigame and the (spoiler) snake riding felt pretty awkward, but I guess it might just be another trait (accidentally) adopted from DKC since they feel similarly out-of-place like DKC3's rocket levels.Ultimately, it was an excellent game, and I'd say it's worth anyone's time that likes any of the above-mentioned games or just wants a ""pretty"" experience.  My playtime logged is a bit over what it actually was.  I idled for a handful of hours while taking breaks and also extended the time a bit while revisiting a bunch of areas to get 100% completion.  Most of my Steam friends logged about 8-9 hours to complete the game.It was worth the 9-year wait.			",272,51,4,56,20,3,45

												It's a really nice game that brings a quality experience.

Not sure if this is a good thing or not, but it kinda made me wanting more of the story in some areas; still, I understand that concision is often necessary to provide a clear message and a smooth experience. I'm a bit conflicted as to whether to give this an 8/10 or 9, so I'll just rate it 8.5/10 for now.

The art direction is fantastic, the music is STELLAR (Hell, the MENU music makes me tear up!), the controls're tight, and the characters're compelling, heartfelt and sympathetic.As a warning, I WILL say that it's a little slow to start, but I recommend at least completing the first three ""stages"" before you pass full judgement.

												This is a game everyone should play. The controls are tight, the soundtrack is my favourite this year, and the pixel art is possibly the best of any game ever released. The difficulty curve is great and there was only one fight that I felt was too difficult. Every single character in this game is lovable and well thought out, from their dialogue to their animation, everything about them is charming. Also I would like to commend the team on how they are taking on speedrunning and bugs. Based on emails with them they have seem to understand that a speedrun community exists that uses OOB glitches while also making sure that these glitches are currently to easy to trigger and are causing problems for casual players. 10/10			",182,31,0,44,17,0,41

												I was browsing my steam store and rolled over OwlBoy a couple of times now because I'm usually not into 2D side scrollers of any kind really. But I decided to give it a go and holy cow this game gave me a wild ride. Right from the get go you are introduced to a cast of loveable characters and absolutely beautiful polish.The bosses and puzzles are challenging and rewarding once you figure out how to do them.It only gets better and better as the story goes along.

												Even if you haven't been aware of the existence of Owlboy until this moment, this is the game you've been waiting for, whether you know it or not.Owlboy is a charming and exciting adventure platformer with the most creative gameplay I've seen in the genre in some time.

												One of the best games I've played in years. You can easily tell that a lot of thought and polish was put into every little detail over many years. The artwork alone makes this game worth it. It tries to be a ""jack of all trade"" kind of game with a little bit of platforming, shooting, stealth, and puzzles - all nicely intertwined with a perfect balance but it's not meant to be any of those things specifically. Although it's not an easy game, it's fairly straightforward and typically after death you'll be able to nail it on the next attempt or two. The story is simple, but feels very real and immersed me somehow more than most games I've played. There was never a time something in the game didn't work right or felt awkward with controls/menus/gamepads/etc... everything just worked perfectly as you'd expect every single time without fail which seems to be sadly uncommon these days. This game is worth every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game! Probably the biggest thing I like is authentic atmosphere. But really, all aspects of the game are good or great.Overall score: 9/10.Difficulty: Medium.Graphics: 10/10. It's the best pixel graphics I ever seen. Music: 10/10. The soundtracks are nice and original. Story: 8/10. Interesting beginning and middle part, nice plot twist in the middle, but somewhat boring ending.Gameplay: 10/10. Game has interesting mechanics, when most of your abilities are provided by your companions, which you can carry and switch between. Each companion has unique set of abilities, and the game often requires you to choose the right companion for the situation.Level design: 9/10. Each level introduces new gimmicks and enemies, which made levels interesting to play and not getting boring. There are few segments that are slightly repetitive though. Darkness gimmick was quite tedious. Also, I expected final fight to be harder.			",67,15,0,2,13,0,6

												I had an absolute blast with this game, the mechanics were a lot of fun and they gave you new skills to learn as you went so I never felt myself getting bored. The story was pretty solid, I'll admit it didn't have as stong of an ending as I was hoping for but I had so much fun along the way that it really didn't bother me. The characters were the strong point of the game in my opinion. A lot of quirky personalities with good character development throughout the games story. I really reccommend Owlboy to anyone who enjoys light and fun games, a cute story, and arcade-like mechanics.			",10,0,0,1,0,0,0

												It's a really nice game that brings a quality experience. The story wasn't as emotionally gripping for me, but I could definitely see some moments where it would bring many a tear to one's eye. Not sure if this is a good thing or not, but it kinda made me wanting more of the story in some areas; still, I understand that concision is often necessary to provide a clear message and a smooth experience. I'm a bit conflicted as to whether to give this an 8/10 or 9, so I'll just rate it 8.5/10 for now. This is in comparison to all of the games I've played, which is a lot to say the least.Oh and I forgot to mention--- the soundtrack really made the game feel more alive.			",13,0,0,7,4,0,5

												Fantastic game. This is going to be a brief review because I simply dont have the words to describe how good this game is. StoryControlsLevel designArtworkUnderlying lessons and themesRewarding explorationEverything is top notch.And at every bit it leaves you wanting for more.And that is my only complaint. I believe there was some missed chances to explore the beautiful lore and backstory to this game. There is so much more I wanted to know about the characters in this game and the little bits of back story they feed you. I was hoping there would be a greater resolution by the end or that as you explored the game more that you could learn more at your own pace. But the information wasnt offered. And while I loved every minute of what I did get. By the time the game was over I came away feeling a little unfulfilled.Now that being said, maybe it was the intention of the creators to have the game this way. It makes the game have its own niche. In that its one of those stories that gives you just enough to drive you crazy with longing to know more. In a bitter sweet sort of way. And I also kind of got the feeling that as a part of the underlying theme of the game, we arent supposed to know everything. Either way. This is a beautiful game, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Game has interesting mechanics, when most of your abilities are provided by your companions, which you can carry and switch between. Each companion has unique set of abilities, and the game often requires you to choose the right companion for the situation.Level design: 9/10. Each level introduces new gimmicks and enemies, which made levels interesting to play and not getting boring. There are few segments that are slightly repetitive though. Darkness gimmick was quite tedious. Also, I expected final fight to be harder.			",67,15,0,2,13,0,6

												This game is absolutely gorgeous and definitely fun, but it also has some issues too.Its fairly easy and short, making it a fairly relaxing game. It's also easy to collect everything and get all the achievements which is satisfying. The only real problems are that it can be fairly repetitive and doesn't fully use its more unique mechanics.Its good, buy it when its on sale.			",141,21,0,14,8,0,9

Posted: December 11, 2016
												So, let's talk about Owlboy for a bit. I'm sure everyone has seen the stories about how this game took nine years to make by a very small team. It's quite amazing it even made it out, much less that it is receiving all the praise it's getting. Kudos to the team for sticking to their guns.You play an owl boy named Otus. He can't speak at all. He also has a mentor named Asio, who is generally a jerk to Otus. The game ends up centering on many oddball characters, and their unlikely friendships. Two of your companions are actually partially responsible for the bad things that happen to the main owl city, and Otus' hometown. I don't want to spoil the story, but despite a simple tale everything is written very well, and ends up being enjoyable, if quite a bit melancholy.But really, the story isn't even likely the first thing you're going to notice. No, it's those lush visuals. I've seen some ""good-looking"" games back in the day, but something still felt off artistically with them. That's not an issue here. This is peak 32-bit Capcom era stuff. They've dubbed it ""hi-bit"", and that's probably a good enough description, because it fits within the rubric of the best 2D Saturn/PSX/N64 visuals. On top of that, the game looks splendid in motion. Everyone has neat unique animations, it's all smooth while being very responsive, the whole game is just a joy to behold. Really, the level of polish across the board is consistent with a Nintendo release, which is high praise indeed.That also extends to the soundtrack. It doesn't use the usual retro-styled chiptune music, it uses orchestral tracks that are excellent, although I have to admit that I don't really have any of them stuck in my head. But it is quality stuff in a filmic way.With all I've said above, you'd think this was one of the greatest games of all time! Not to be the bearer of bad news, but it's not. It's competent, decent, sometimes good, but never really feels like it fulfills its promise mechanically.Otus has full-flight capabilities, except for in a few story-based areas (and water). It doesn't even matter who he's carrying. The sense of freedom is awfully nice, but the world tends to lack for lots of interesting things to do. You can find scattered treasure chests along the way, either through exploration or killing groups of enemies to make it appear. These chests, however, do not contain interesting upgrades, though, but ""Buccanary Coins"", which can be traded in at Buccanary's shop. You will get a few upgrades out of these, but none of them are strictly necessary. Gated progression is limited to acquiring your three companions. The other collectibles are three Owl Medals that can be used to unlock a hidden area after you've finished the game, which fleshes out more of the story.Geddy is the first, and your default attacker. He fires a fairly weak pistol while carrying him about. You aim his, and your other companions', attacks via dual-stick controls, although there is also some auto-aiming involved here. He can destroy a few barriers, but nothing too impressive. It should be noted that you don't have to constantly pick up and drop characters. The plot gives you a relic that lets you teleport someone straight into your mitts, making what could have been very tedious rather simple.Alphonse, your second character, has a massively-powerful shotgun, but it takes serious time to reload. It will blast/burn down plants and such from your path. The last companion is spider-like, and shoots webs to bind enemies as well as lets you grapple to far away places, which will get you through some waterfalls you can't pass otherwise. That's pretty much the extent of your abilities. Combat never gets very frenetic, with a very limited number of enemy types, and the game tends to be forgiving enough that you'll slide through a battle on your second or third try pretty easily. It just feels like there was so much more interesting they could have done to make combat more engaging from moment to moment.There are also stealth segments. Oh no. Well, actually, I thought these were pretty solid. They're not mind-blowing, but they end up working pretty well, and also reinforce the sorts of odds that this ragtag crew are up against. Plus, there are a few cinematic segments as well, and the last area sees fit to rob you of your infinite flight. This is where the game finally starts to take advantage of some rudimentary platforming puzzles, but it's sadly far too little of it.I can't help but compare the game and its free-flight to two other games, Demon's Crest and Child of Light. Demon's Crest doesn't give you the sort of freedom that this game does in terms of flight, but has much more interesting exploration and combat. Child of Light gives you freedom, and it also rewards the player much more significantly for exploring, always doling out new items and weapons to utilize. In this game, things are a little too straightforward and sparse. There are a few switch puzzles here and there, but they're the usual sort of video game logic we've seen many times before.If I'm going to trot out a comparison to a game, there's actually another one that works, maybe not from a mechanical level, but from a ambition level, and that's Solatorobo: Red the Hunter on Nintendo DS. This was a sort of spiritual successor to Tail Concerto on PlayStation, one in which you got to ride around in a mech amidst a startlingly well-realized world, with lots of polish and charm all the way around. Yet the gameplay proper boiled down to a simple pick-up-and-throw-things. The core just wasn't enough to sustain the experience, no matter how compelling the world-building was. It's a game I wanted to like, but I ended up just thinking it was a'ight. I have the same feelings about Owlboy. It's a spectacular game for content voyeurism. If you want to see amazing and consistent art design in pixel form, this is your game. If you want a polished story, a compelling world, it's here. But the gameplay rarely rises above ""okay"". And that's a shame. 7.5/10.			",513,222,10,91,35,5,107

												Undoubtedly one of the best games of 2016 and another example as to why the indie scene is so much more imaginative, inspiring, and brilliant than the majority of AAA mainstream releaseas. Owlboy evokes memories of Studio Ghibli films such as Howl's Moving Castle and SNES era classics, but it's very much its own game. The story is fantastic, the challenge perfectly pitched; it's inventive, fun, charming, and a complete masterpiece. My favourite game of the year.			",44,15,0,5,1,0,1

												I have not finished the game yet. As of now, I have only played for one hour and I had to write a review. I will update it after I finish the game! To start, I just need to say: Everything about this game is fantastic. The charecters are so adorable and easy to fall in love with. They all have fantastic charecter design (in both art and charecter) and are, again, adorable. The score in this game is another area where it shines. So far, it does an excellent job of conveying emotion and just makes you feel, well, happy! The last thing I want to talk about for now is the art style. This should sum it up:Oh my god, this game is beutiful.If it's not on sale, BUY IT. If it is on sale, DON'T THINK, JUST BUY IT. You won't be dissapointed.			",60,9,6,4,4,0,1

There are a few switch puzzles here and there, but they're the usual sort of video game logic we've seen many times before.If I'm going to trot out a comparison to a game, there's actually another one that works, maybe not from a mechanical level, but from a ambition level, and that's Solatorobo: Red the Hunter on Nintendo DS. This was a sort of spiritual successor to Tail Concerto on PlayStation, one in which you got to ride around in a mech amidst a startlingly well-realized world, with lots of polish and charm all the way around. Yet the gameplay proper boiled down to a simple pick-up-and-throw-things. The core just wasn't enough to sustain the experience, no matter how compelling the world-building was. It's a game I wanted to like, but I ended up just thinking it was a'ight. I have the same feelings about Owlboy. It's a spectacular game for content voyeurism. If you want to see amazing and consistent art design in pixel form, this is your game. If you want a polished story, a compelling world, it's here. But the gameplay rarely rises above ""okay"". And that's a shame. 7.5/10.			",513,222,10,91,35,5,107

												Undoubtedly one of the best games of 2016 and another example as to why the indie scene is so much more imaginative, inspiring, and brilliant than the majority of AAA mainstream releaseas. Owlboy evokes memories of Studio Ghibli films such as Howl's Moving Castle and SNES era classics, but it's very much its own game. The story is fantastic, the challenge perfectly pitched; it's inventive, fun, charming, and a complete masterpiece. My favourite game of the year.			",44,15,0,5,1,0,1

All the fun of a classic game with modern controls.There is one painful flaw, a cannon minigame that is unbelievably frustrating to complete all the way. Doing so is not necessary to the story, but it does unlock a really great cutscene and gets you a bunch of money. Developers, please fix this garbage bit in an amazing game!			",141,21,1,9,6,0,15

												This is one of my best games i've ever played! It is a beautiful and gorgeous pixel art with brilliant sky and the music is a masterpiece for this game, it's all about experiencing the sky layers of heaven and space! Let me talk for a bit! So, when you start the game it's actually very basic and crappy beginning as all games do. You start in a village/town like you just woke up ready to start another crappy day of work then it becomes a relaxing experience of adventuring, like you are finally in freedom, but you also encounter danger! This game felt almost like a movie for me! A masterful experience and a journey into the Unknown. Lore/Story:You're an owl named Otus exploring the vast and immense world of places, puzzles and dangers, with your best friend Geddy also the mechanic of Veille, meeting new friends, encountering bosses and passing various obstacles. It's all about adventuring here, the Adventure era has evolved so you're exploring the future of this world, also, it teaches you to get outside and explore places with your friends, i mean you have plenty places to explore in real life rather than just staying home. Like in this game rather than just staying in Veille and Snapchat or Facetime your friends lol! So, be ready for adventure, pack your bags, get your favourite things and let's go!I wanna say thank you for D-Pad Studio for making such a grateful game and for how long did he take to make this game! Very good lad! This is a Hard-worker! ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- Story plot twist is interesting.- Other than the interesting story, the soundtrack and game art really made the game alive. It felt very nostalgic yet new. It's as if I'm living the big part of my childhood as an adult.- I think this game needs a world map. Also, more clues I guess?- It felt too short. There could have been more character development; a number of elements feel incomplete.- Gameplay is pretty OK, average at best.			",42,3,0,3,1,0,1

												Worth the decade wait!Pros:Awesome soundtrack - Each piece of orchestral music complements the mood of the scene really well and just sounds real good!General Art Direction- The neo-pixelated art may be somewhat overused at this point but really serves the game well, everything is detailed and quite prettyInteresting and unique characters (Take this with a grain of salt as I tend to be bad at assessing characters and their development)Meh:The story - Not too shabby, by my own standards anyway (Whatever they may be)100% Completion - All achievements and 100% can technically be unlocked within 1 game, but to fully witness everything, you'll need to continue your finished game as you are stuck in the final area which you get the final collectibleEnding - A bit rushed, difficult to understand until you find the sanctuary and even then it's rather vagueCons:Difficulty - I didn't find it too hard at all, quite easy in fact. My only deaths involved running into enemies while trying to complete 100%Length -  Even after mucking around collecting everything, I finished the game clocking in at 12 hours (If I had just went straight for the ending, This would be a 6 hour game)Mother♥♥♥♥ing Boguin Challenge - Controls are reversed such that clockwise is left on the analog stick (or A on the Keyboard) and anticlockwise is Right. Took me more then 30 minutes to collect all the rings even after turning the controller upside-down. It wasn't satisfying at all.All in all, this is a game very much worth the 9 years of development even if there were a few hiccups in between. So, buy it and get a free (not really) Boguin Plush!

												Owlboy is an amazing game. I can't recommend it more highly. I would describe it as a mixture of Contra, Super Mario, and that it has story telling elements that remind me of the Legend of Zelda (ancient lore behind the story, relics, and such). The overworld feels very alive, and you get a good idea of the personalities of many of the NPCs. The gameplay is stellar, and may be on the challenging end for some people. This game will likely, in my view, go down as an indie classic much like Undertale.I would be critical of anyone stating that this game is currently 10/10. This game is nothing short of incredible. The artwork, the characters, and the gameplay is so much fun. That said, some aspects feel unrewarding and some levels are going to feel more like memory based platforming as opposed to reflex based. Some people may prefer that, but I get tired of repeating the same scenes over and over again. Some things happen with so little warning that you have to replay from the checkpoint and remember that it is going to happen. This isn't to discredit the game, but just one of my few critiques. When I die in a platformer/shooter/whatever box you want to put this game into; I want to feel like it happened because I made a mistake and not because I just wasn't given any sort of heads up to respond in time.The only other aspect I would knock is the price range. If this were a $10 game; it would be on the longer end and a huge bargain. $20+ seems a tad steep for how long the game is. I think $15 or so would be far more reasonable. If money is an issue, then I would just keep that in mind. I finished the game in about 8 hours.I would give this game a solid 8/10.			",7,2,0,1,0,0,0

												This is game is a complete masterpiece. I had never heard about it until a few days ago, and I instantly fell in love with the artwork. I had no idea what the game was supposed to be like, I bought it purely because it LOOKED nice. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it also has a great story, unique and loveable characters, amazing music and sound design, superb animation, and of course fun and interesting gameplay.I've played for about 3 hours so far, and am just now feeling like the adventure is really getting started, though I've enjoyed every minute of it. I was a little worried that it might be short with not a whole lot to it, as these visually impressive 2D games sometimes tend to be, but every once in a while you get a true masterpiece like this, where everything from design to gameplay is spot on, and isn't too short and gives you a lot to do.This is not a multiplayer or open world sandbox with endless replayability game which seems to be the strange requirement for a lot of people in games these days. It is fairly linear with some exploration in areas, finding coins to unlock upgrades, with secret rooms and hidden chests. I honestly miss games like this, that aren't overly complex with upgrade trees and skill sets. It's quite simple, but does a really good job at being simple, fun, and intriguing. I can definitely see myself being satisfied with a sense of completion when I manage to finish it.With all that being said, I think the price is completely justified. This isn't a short random indie game with nothing much to it, it's a full blown story and adventure with puzzles, boss fights, numerous and unique creatures and characters, secrets to uncover, and has amazing artwork. You can definitely tell that a lot of skill, hardwork, and time went into making this. I want more games like this, so I'm willing to help fund the cause of bringing back games with the magic and creativity that we just don't see so much anymore.			",43,10,0,1,10,0,8

												I absolutely can't recommend this game enough.  Beautiful pixel art, gorgeous soundtrack, platformer-style collectables and secrets, loveable characters, and some heartwarming moments for those willing to learn about the inhabitants of the world.The gameplay is its weakest point by far, but by no means is it bad.  Part DKC2, part Zelda, part Metroidvania.  The difficulty is never very taxing, which may be a negative for some, but I felt like it was appropriately done for maintaining a relaxed atmosphere while still pushing against you enough so that you can feel accomplishment with your character.  Some of the dungeon design was a bit annoying.  I frequently would try to go the ""wrong"" way to grab secrets before progressing only to take the correct route and be locked out of part of the dungeon for an extended period, making it difficult to remember what routes I had and hadn't looted.  Ultimately, getting 100% of the collectibles was pretty painless, though.  The cannon minigame and the (spoiler) snake riding felt pretty awkward, but I guess it might just be another trait (accidentally) adopted from DKC since they feel similarly out-of-place like DKC3's rocket levels.Ultimately, it was an excellent game, and I'd say it's worth anyone's time that likes any of the above-mentioned games or just wants a ""pretty"" experience.  My playtime logged is a bit over what it actually was.  I idled for a handful of hours while taking breaks and also extended the time a bit while revisiting a bunch of areas to get 100% completion.  Most of my Steam friends logged about 8-9 hours to complete the game.It was worth the 9-year wait.			",272,51,4,56,20,3,45

												One of my favorites from 2016. I can see why some may not like it as it isn't much of an action packed or challenging of a game, but being an artist myself I pretty much just enjoyed the creative visuals and environments rather than the gameplay mechanics. To me a game is fun if the story is good and the visuals are good, not if it was challenging or made me work to complete it. The characters were charming and creative and the attention to detail made my jaw drop throughout each location I explored. I did end up getting 100% completion in the game in around 12 hours or so, which may seem like a short game for some to be 25$, but I got more enjoyment out of it than some games I have paid upwards of 60$ for. I definately reccomend to anyone looking for a visual masterpiece to experience, and for those who are on the fence, it's worth picking up during a sale.			",77,15,0,9,7,2,8

												Brilliant so far.I wouldn't consider myself a fan of 'old school pixel art' but I still think this game looks gorgeous.Especially the character sprites with their detailed animations and cute facial reactions are a joy to behold.Story sofar has been very entertaining with characters I immediately cared about and the number of well implemented little twists on the gameplay have made it very hard to put the game down.There were a few intances of background looking like foreground and vice versa, but since you can just fly into it to check (or do a 'faceplant-check' by throwing one of your companions against it : P) and don't loose any 'progress' like you might do in a J&R it didn't feel frustrating at all, just a little bit confusing at times.I think this game is worth a try even if you do not consider yourself a fan of the genre (like myself).-totally not an owl *hoot hoot*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best game I've played in at least 2 years. The animation is beautiful right off the bat and continues to amaze me throughout the game. The Musical score... Oh my god the musical score for this game is incredible, the music really drives the tone of the game and helps the player feel invested. The story is also good, the characters are loveable and I became emotionally invested in the them 15 minutes in. Game play wise, the movement is satisfying and crisp. It feels so good to just woosh around the overworld. I love puzzles and this game does them well for the most part with new innovative ideas that make you think. Although some of the puzzles get a little repetitive, this game still does a great job at keeping the game fresh and fun the whole way through. This game is fantastic, and I hope it get's the love it deserves.			",51,3,0,6,2,0,0

												The most beautiful and touching side scroller I've played in years. Had me emotionally invested in the first 5 minutes.Incredibly solid controls.Beautiful graphics.Amazing Soundtrack.Absolutely perfect writing.*Final view on the game after completion*Owlboy is an instant classic in this generation of pixel games and platformers. The art is by far the best work I have ever seen in a game of this stature. It is lush, beautiful, and masterfully crafted. I looked forward to every new environment as each one told a part of the story. Embedding the story into the art itself made it all the more enjoyable.Apart from the art, the soundtrack is absolute perfection. A series of wind and string instruments form a masterful composition that captures the immense imagery of flight and wonder that the story takes hold of. From fights to story, the music captures the moment perfectly. Even the lack of music in certain parts of the game build tension or allow the excellent sound design take the reigns for a few minutes.The controls are incredibly tight, and the gameplay follows suite. Everything ran together very naturally, from combat to exploration. It reminded me vividly of rolling around in Zelda games to get places faster. But also provided a unique flying combat that I found thoroughly enjoyable all throughout the game. The platforming, especially in late game, is extremely well executed. This being said, a lot of the game is spent flying, but the parts in between are incredibly well done.The story had me from the first 5 minutes. And by the end had me crying more than I care to admit. It's incredibly well written to the point where I missed twists that were completely unexpected, but made perfect sense. Even the art hinted at these twists and story elements, it was amazing to make the connection between these things. I adore the characters, all of them are fleshed out as much as they need to be and not too much. They have aspirations and goals as well as fantastic and lovable personalities. Even the way they handled Otus as a character was perfection. His body language and personality shined through, making him just as lovable as all the characters around him.If you are looking for a solid 5-8 hours of gameplay, 10 if you plan on collecting everything and finding all the secrets. Which I recommend. Owlboy delivers, with incredible grace. It's worth the price in it's entirety. You get an amazing piece of art and the amazing journey it provides.Easily this game gets a 10/10 from me. I highly recommend it.			",309,31,9,24,18,4,26

												While short, this was one of the best game I've played in a while.  It was shockingly brilliant in both gameplay and writing, and was an unexpected goldmine. Its gameplay is intuitive, lending to little repition, its enemy and character designs are drop dead gorgeous, and its story is a touching tale of pushing past the low points of life. This game deserves the recognition and love that Undertale got, and then some. I reccomend you, yes you reading this, if you have even the slightest ounce of inquisitive interest to play this game, do it. And then share it with your friends. Pros: -- Great musical score-- Great story writing-- Engaging Gameplay-- Lovely graphical style-- Unique through and throughCons:-- Just a bit on the short side, but you'll be playing this game again in time, I assure you.

												I don't take the time to write reviews often, but this game hit some heartstrings for me. If you grew up in my era and the SNES is what you remember being the best part of being a kid, you need to get this game. I know the price tag is a bit much, but this isn't some cheap SNES clone that you'll mindlessly play through and forget about. Everything from the gameplay, story, graphics, music, and feel of the game will be sending chills down your spine. It's Zelda. It's Final Fantasy. It's Metroid. It's all of those placed into a neat little package that tells a completely new and amazing story that will grab your by your heart and yank it out of your chest. The best part about it all is how it is presented to you. It's not a lot, and it's not a little. It's the perfect amount of detail to keep you wanting more. I also should mention that they get the feels down SO HARD. It's all about little moments that make you teary eyed, or yell, or smile, or cheer. Everything about this game is what I thought it wasn't going to be and it is hands down one of the best games I have played this year. Do yourself a favor and buy it.			",375,126,2,75,22,2,34

												Well, Owlboy has made its way into my top 10 favorite games of all time. After completing the game, I was left feeling a slew of emotions from the result of an amazing story.PROS:Atmosphere: This game's soundtrack along with amazing polished visuals help create some of the most beautiful atmospheres I could ever experience. No detail was left out.Mechanics: The gameplay and its mechanics I found were very easy to grasp and are fun to use. The controls are smooth and very responsive. The game mechanics vary in interesting ways that always gave me something new or challenging to play with.Story: Owlboy is a highly story-driven game, and it is done well. There are a few little side missions and collectibles here and there, but the story takes grasp of most things the player will do. It is beautifully told, and I highly recommend paying attention to it, as it will push you to play more and more.CONS:Game Length: When I play games, I like to explore every nook and cranny. Even with the way I play games, Owlboy only took me 9.1 hours to complete. I wish there was a bit more content to keep me busy as I feel like I blasted through this game, even though I explored it thoroughly.Final Boss Fight:  I did enjoy having to use all 3 of my followers to help me defeat the final boss, however, I felt it was a bit too easy compared to previous boss fights. The fact that I didn't have to fight Mostrom was a bit disappointing as well. ",79,9,0,14,12,0,10

												Good length for a platformy game of this kind. Puzzles are easy enough that they don't kill the pace of the game; challenging enough that they don't feel like a slog.Game tends to reward risk taking play, with its puzzle solutions, which suits me well.Artwork is obviously just eye-wateringly lovely from start to finish. The story is charming, if you're willing to let it charm you.Only doing this review for the Autumn Sale badge but I recommend this game to anyone who likes good games.			",526,184,19,75,66,6,97

												The short of it: Technical issues, pacing issues and a very short run time for price mar a hybrid platformer that controls uniquely and absolutely oozes charm, still probably worth it.The long of it: Despite the long development process, the game is short.  According to steam, it took about 2.5 hours to complete, and a good amount of that was faffing around.  The pacing is very odd even for an indie game- the way scenes cut into one another is more like an animated movie than a traditional game, and you barely have time to get used to your last party member before the game abruptly prevents you from using them and ends.  The characters all have great chemistry and unlike many games really feel like they're all along for the ride, but for the most part there isn't time for much development, especially for the secondary and tertiary characters.  Some of the main character's major conflict never gets resolved, and I feel maybe the ending was rushed due to that.The game itself is a halfway between a twinstick shooter and a platformer, with an emphasis on flying and lifting objects.  In terms of difficulty, there are a few bosses and enemy setups that might make you retry, but for the most part it's a walk in the park and the final boss can easily be beaten on your first attempt.  The flight feels good, the basic abilities feel alright and the teammates are fun to work with, but unfortunately the platforming without them is much weaker.  In particular when you aren't supposed to open your wings, it's quite difficult to avoid doing so due to having to hold the jump and the floaty mechanics.  I also experienced a fair number of bugs- characters teleporting from offscreen to odd places, one strange screen change, and a few times where I collided with nothing after being thrown by spikes.  My friend was also unable to play the game in general, only having a black screen on startup and still hasn't found a fix.  Given the time spent making the game this is somewhat surprising.The art and music are very good, the former being mostly oodles of pixel porn of clouds and pirate ships, the latter incorporating a lot of woodwinds and being very atmospheric.  Outside of the startup theme, I didn't find the music very memorable, but the characters pick up the slack on that front, including the supporting cast and main character.  They don't really have the time for the characters they do have, and a lot of them get more or less forgotten in the last third of the game.So, is it worth it?  Yeah, probably.  The high price tag and short run time is a bit much, but at a lower price this game will offer a unique and satisfying, if brief, experience.			",370,57,3,64,25,2,37

												Owlboy is a joy to play and a pleasure to experience. There is nothing quite like soaring through beautiful locales and getting to know a game world through its vivid characters. While the game itself is a little bit on the short end, what is there is a smart and creative 2D adventure game that is every bit as charming as you imagine it to be. And with so many things to collect and places to explore, there is much to do in Owlboy, even if the adventure ends just a tad bit too soon.			",141,51,5,18,17,1,17

												It is a nice game. Definitely not a masterpiece like ori and the blind forest, but a nice litte game. Neat art style with attention to detail, a wonderful soundtrack (but unfortunately there are parts of the game without any backgroundmusic) and overal a good platform-adventure. For my taste a bit too much backtracking and most of the time i did not immediately know where to go, not even a rough direction. Admittedly it was my fault, because i fast skipped over great parts of the text dialogs, where i suppose the charactes where roughly telling, what to do next. But i could not really bond with Oti`s (player character) allies in the game / couldn`t care less what they have to say. Also the repeating of dialoge/text scenes, when restarting at some checkpoints (Boss fights) was a bit annoying. Don`t get me wrong, it is a good game, but -in my opinion-  not a phantastic one. At least it motivated me to play it through (roughly 14hours), which nowadays is not common at all (i guess we all know the first world problem of having houndrets of games here in steam and maybe finishing less than 10%)I do not regret buying the game, as it did overall entertaine me for a couple of days.

												Ever since I played Undertale, I have been longing for a game that did a similair pull on the old heartstrings. Owlboy does something like it, but in a different way. Point is: I was immersed and loving it!The story is good and gameplay is nicely varied, as I never got tired of a particulair segment before i got to a new one.Check out the demo if you are considdering, but I definitely recommend Owlboy.

Puzzles are easy enough that they don't kill the pace of the game; challenging enough that they don't feel like a slog.Game tends to reward risk taking play, with its puzzle solutions, which suits me well.Artwork is obviously just eye-wateringly lovely from start to finish. The story is charming, if you're willing to let it charm you.Only doing this review for the Autumn Sale badge but I recommend this game to anyone who likes good games.			",526,184,19,75,66,6,97

												I have to say, if you're on the fence about purchasing this game, don't be. It's a beautifully story-driven game that flows smoothly from once scene to the next. The characters are very well rounded and make you feel immersed in the world they live in. Just. Absolutely fantastic.The gameplay is intuitive, the graphix are fantastic and it honestly just feels good to play through. On top of all that, the actual story took me about 11 hours to complete, and I wasn't exactly slacking off or running around in circles! Definetly one of the best games I've played to date. In my opinion, the only not-so-good part of the game, is that it ends. I just want to keep playing! Then again, I probably will! There's still a bunch of ingame content left like collecting special coins for that glimmer cloak or finding the informational relics. It's a big game for how small the world is!

												Can't go wrong with this game, the price is justified, this isn't just some generic 2D platformer, it's a fully fleshed out 2D adventure that you truly won't regret buying! Only other thing to say is:

												So, I've played through this twice now, I've just finished my second play-through and it is 1:40 AM so I'll keep it short. Owlboy makes me happy. It allows me to experience something which is hard to explain. The smooth and fun gameplay, the beautiful art and music, the loveable characters and brilliant story. All of these things mesh together to form a masterpiece. This is the first game to make me cry tears of happiness in all my years; I could not recommend you try this enough.			",42,4,0,10,2,0,1

												With one of the most impresively written stories among titles that have come out recently today, OwlBoy does some abitious things, both gameplay wise and beyond. Even just the way things are placed in the environment is done so well given whatever scenario you are in at the time. Flying feels great, especially when you are full. Not having a lethal attack without your buddies at first didnt appeal to me, but i soon learned that it was no problem at all. Dialougue between your party members is very entertaining as well, and above else, my personal favorite are the little cute ponguin doods.all in all 11/10			",289,49,5,46,28,4,26

												Fun game, but 100% not what I was expecting going into it. I was expecting an open-world platformer with flying/Aero the Acrobat-style gameplay. Instead, what I got was a hybrid Twin-Stick shooter and Puzzle Platformer, with Metroidvania/Openworld level design elements, that all work together, with a nice story to along.Not sure if it joins games like Undertale, La-Mulana, Cavestory, Dwarf Fortress, etc. in the Indie Game HOF, but i'd say it's up there.

												""A love letter to pixel art...""A love letter it truly is, and I can't find the vocabulary to better articulate how good this game is.It had me laughing.It had my crying.It had me frustrated with those silly Boguins and their stinkin' cannon. I swear I'll beat their challenge one day...Every inch in the game has been lovingly handcrafted and the characters are well-rounded and full-bodied. Some more than others... *cough cough* Alphonse... If one takes a moment to look at the world around them, the area they will find themselves will captivate them; the music that accompanies every beautiful backdrop will seduce them; the story they are a part of will keep them attentive to the end.I've always felt like the games of the past: PS1/2 Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and Sly Cooper--just to name a few--have always been in a higher tier of quality than many of those in the present and deserve to be preserved and passed down...And I feel like Owlboy is one such game. It doesn't last for very long if you breeze through it, as with any game, ...but if you just take the time to look around and take it all in, even if it's on a second playthrough, you'll notice that the game is perfect in every way.0/11 Would play again.No but for real this game deserves no scale...

Review of : Owlboy SumarryAfter over 5 long years D-pad Studios finally gifted us with their jewel, and I must admit , it was worth all the waiting^^.Owlboy brought back some nostalgic feelings I never thought I could ever feel again. The game is beautiful, challenging, colorful , fun and a lot of other good things you can think of^^.You play as a mute owlboy called Otus, which due to his deficiency and some lack of confidence isn't as talented as the others, but it starts changing as you visit ancient tamples and get ancient relics that grants him special powers that joined with Otus's friends become amazing!Graphics:The Graphics of Owlboy , despite following the patterns of pixel graphics, feels totally different: bright , colorful, alive. It reminded me of a great game I played in my childhood : Metal Slug. So you can Imagine how good it feels playing Owlboy^^.

Soundtrack: Here the game pleases me one more time. Playing owlboy is a favor to my ears, it doesn't matter how many times you play the game you don't get enough of the calm, relaxing, beautiful and encouraging songs they composed. Below you can check one of the songs.

												Owlboy... Here's some first impressions. It's like if metal slug was an adventure game... But with owls. The art and animation style is very reminiscent of the metal slug series which I've always been fond of. Even the boss battles are flashy, action packed, and quick paced.So far the story line seems enjoyable minus an instance or two where the story line advanced abruptly and dose so in a way that doesn't offer much explanation. Or at least that's what I've noticed. The engagement with characters in the game is very pleasant, and immersive, you'll laugh when they laugh and you'll cry when they cry, so to speak.. The characters are just so likable.Okay the controls are well done, you can tell they've had plenty of time to polish everything out, including the interaction with the world, you can tell that the game was meant to be played with a controller so if you have one, I'd use it. All I can say is that the game controls great and super satisfying to use. The combat is enjoyable however takes a bit of time to get used to.The soundtrack is great, it's diverse yet it fits the theme of the game very well, every moment, every plot twist, the ambient sounds, movement, and combat sounds are also very pleasing to the ears. Most modern pixel games put a lot of effort into creating a decent soundtrack and Owlboy is no exception.I'll probably update this later but those are my thoughts on the game so far.. So far I really enjoy it and I think a lot of other people will, as well.EDIT: Okay I finished it, the game was an emotional rollercoaster but it was fantastic, I'm stunned. The story really smoothed out in the end and I need more of this game in my life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Owlboy is a really good game, and for its price, definitely worth a buy if you're into metroidvania-esque games, great characters and generally high-quality games.There are some problems here and there, and even though they are very small, I will list the ones that were most prominent to me:- The percentage of the game during which you're blocked from going back to the main map to explore is quite high, for my tastes too high regarding it's a metroidvania-style game.- Camera zones are annoying and twitchy relatively often.- The controls aren't as intuitive, I suggest trying to reassign button assignments around when you enter the first dungeonI highly recommend Owlboy.

												I love this game so much. It's beautiful, it has an amazing story, the music is phenomenal and so much more. The adventure was just an amazing experience to go through, and I loved every second. The ending leaves many questions, and possibly a teaser to a sequel? There most likely probably won't be a second game following Otus, but if there was it would probably be even better than the one we have now. All the characters are so charming in their own unique ways. Buccanary with her Boguins, all the friends you team up with, even small ones like Mandolyn and such are just simply adorable and a fun time to be around. I'm so glad that I discovered this game, not even knowing it existed until I saw the Game Grumps play it, and then I went ahead and bought it while it was on sale. And man, was it way better to play through this on my own instead of watching some YouTubers play it. You are amazing people D-Pad, I hope you achieve even more greater heights than this one, and I hope your next game goes as well as this one. Hoot hoot.			",58,9,0,2,6,2,1

												Such a beautful game. I've been excited to play it for a while and it's really been worth the wait. The sprite artwork is drop dead gorgeous and the music is just as good. The gameplay is (importantly) quite solid. I'm absolutely blown away by the atmosphere of this game.Without saying too much, I find the story to be pretty good, but probably one of the weaker points to an otherwise stellar game. There's also little replayability aside from a few side quests, though what this game has to offer certainly makes it worth the price. Ultimately I would give it an 9 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Otus, the main character, being mute puts you almost as a replacement for him. You feel everything that he does. 10/10 game. Would recommend to anyone.			",266,24,1,31,19,0,21

												A truly jaw dropping experience. 8 hours of true beauty from a puzzle action game not to difficult but enough to keep you on your toes. this game will draw you in the first 5 minutes you play and you wont want to stop till your done. This game is the epitome of what everyone game should look for being. i have to say it was worth the 9 years it took to make this game into a true masterpiece. Thank you D-pad studio for reviving my hopes for future games, and for the best experience in a video game i have had all of 2016.			",47,3,0,6,2,0,1

												When I think of art, I think of labor. I think of the toil, the nights spent with a brush held between knotted fingers in front of a lamp-lit canvas. The great masters knew the importance of taking the time to get things right. After ten years of development, D-Pad studio have created the finest art in any metroidvania game, ever.

												When I was younger, I used to adore the old Mario games for their simple comlpexity. The way a younger person like myself could play the game and enjoy it on a simple level, but once I was older I could return to the game and find new secrets and techniques to play the game. Even as an adult I was able to enjoy those games, and it has been nearly a decade since a game has proved to me that a kid could enjoy and appreciate it just as much as an adult could. Then comes OwlboyI had little to no knowledge of this game going in, only that I loved what I saw in the trailer and the promise of ""9 years of work"" being put into this. I picked it up on day one and I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did so. Merely opening the game and seeing the intro screen made me feel the first sense of childlike wonder I'd felt in years. The art style was stunning even for a pixel game of our day and age. AND THE MUSIC. If the gameplay, story and art didn't steal my heart right off the bat I guarantee you the soundtrack did. When I first flapped my way into the Tropos area of the game and the triumphant violins began their chant I was brought to tears by the sheer beauty of what I was playing. In fact, I don't believe I was crying for reason that the game was gorgeous, but that it reminded me why I started playing games in the first place: Because it made me feel something. Something special. I hadn't felt a sense of wonder like it since I'd played Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii. TL;DR Game made me cry 100/10			",104,10,1,5,3,0,3

All in all, one of the best platformers you will ever play. 9 Years of development was clearly well worth it.			",191,21,1,22,24,2,19

												+++ GraphicsIncredible work on graphics. Varied environments make for exciting exploration.++ MusicWould be 3+, but I feel some of the transitions in music can be a little awkward at times.++ StoryVery good story with likeable characters. I won't spoil anything though.+ GameplayIt's fun, but feels slow at times. Somewhat easy. I find myself mashing the roll button to get around quicker. I enjoy the collection aspect for money, as it gives the player motivation to explore more, as well as giving a clear goal to completionists.- Level DesignNot a big fan of some of the levels. They feel a little maze-like in some situations. I think a simple map may help, but I feel that might take away from some of the exploration aspect. There is a dark section in the game which really made this score drop.Overall ++ Incredible graphics and great music, very immersive, with a good story. Gameplay is pretty fun, really enjoyable if you enjoy casual exploration. The levels sometimes feel bland (just the way you progress through them, the art on them is amazing), and sometimes a little repetetive.I'd say for $25 it's worth it for a player who loves exploration and story.

												Absolutely incredible visuals, and a nice soundtrack. However, the gameplay is weak at best.The bosses are cheap and random, and it feels almost impossible to dodge attacks - the monkey boss in particular just felt horrible. Perhaps I should have been using a controller, but I just found the gameplay really frustrating - not fun at all. They flying felt boring, the attacks were boring, and the recharge time on the shotgun - the only useful attack, is so long that it's impossible to use effectively.The story is sort of interesting, I kind of liked the lore presented, but the characters were weak.It's probably my bad, feeling the way I do. I know the game has got tremendous praise, but the gameplay just leaves me feeling angry and hard done by. This is particularly aggrivating as I would have really enjoyed to explore the world more.

												Yeah, 31.1 hours and the game came out only a few days ago. I couldn't put the thing down. I only stopped playing the game to sleep and eat.The game is a very solid game mechanically. If you're a fan of old platforming and shooter games, this is a must buy. It's the best game I've played this year. It's incredibly solid.I streamed the entire game if you want to see some gameplay, but I suggest you don't watch my videos and play the game for your self. :)The video I linked is near the end of the game. You can see most of the mechanics your characters will have. I only suggest you watch it if you don't care about spoilers.

												I just finished playing through the story a few minutes ago and I figured I should share what I thought about this game while its still fresh in my head.POSITIVES:The art and animation is top notch, top tier, top shelf, top gun, top everything.  I can't stop looking at it, there's just so much detail in every little pixelated inch and I can't get enough of it.  All the characters are animated amazingly well and I love Otus' range of emotions despite being mute. The characters themselves are also fun, distinctive and you can latch onto them immediately.Basically the visuals are 11/10, 12/2 even.NEGATIVES:You can really see when this game got to the point where the developers were like ""Ok, we really need to finish this.""  For those of you who have played the game already, I'm talking about the 5-6 hour mark where there's just a lull in the gameplay and story.  Its servicable, but lacking heavily in comparison to the rest of the game.The collectables are a mix of vanity items and two things that can't imagine going without.  Once you get roughly 2000+ coins, there's no reason to collect the rest unless you want that shiny cloak thing that I bet gets knocked off after you get hit once*.  Seriously, why give you the options of wearing things if they're just going to fly off the moment you make a dumb move and get hit?  I wanted to fly around the entire game with a pirate hat on, dammit!I suppose if you really want that 100% completion, I say go for it as there isn't a lot you need to do, but I don't feel the rewards are satisfying enough.  Unless there's a secret mystery ending I'm unaware of.There's one or two bosses that I felt were a little ridiculous and I found that the only way to do it was to tank what I could and pray that I live.  The other bosses were well designed and you could figure out after a mistake or two what you needed to do.OVERALL OPINION:I really wish there was a ""Maybe"" button for the recommended, but to reflect what I've said in this review, I would not recommend this game.I would not buy this game for full price.  I honeslty bought it on impulse after trying it on my brother's steam account since I found it enjoyable, but looking back now I really should have waited instead of buying into his hype.  Its fun, if not entirely polished in terms of story and gameplay, and I can guarantee you will be amazed at the visuals presented to you.*EDIT: After being informed and finding out what the cloak actually does, yeah, its kind of worth it, I had just assumed it was a vanity item.  However, I don't believe its necessary, as the item just makes the game easier when its already not that difficult to begin with.			",155,24,1,33,9,1,38

												PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER ONLY!I've played the game, found it a pretty game with some intersting level but frustrating and unpolished mechnics.Only afterwards when comparing experiances with another player who played with a controller we realised there are massive diffrences created by the diffrent control schemes.With mouse and keyboard you can't shoot and spin at the same time as they are both bound to mouse left-click , having to drop your 'weapon' to spin, additionally once you drop a 'weapon' you have to choose a new one to activate it where on a controller you just fire and it instantly pick one. Spining and firing in quick sucession is vital to many enemies and having to 'reload' every time after you are hit also makes many fights much more frustrating.This creates a vastly inferior experiance on mouse and no binding options are avialble to the mouse to fix this. The experiance is so diffrent I would not hesitate to call the mouse version of the game out right broken. ",67,48,1,10,4,1,12

												I felt obligated to the developers of this wonderful game to write this. This was one of the few great experiences I have had in my many years of gaming. That being said I don't write reviews for games because I don't think my thoughts on a game should be a selling point for it. But this, to me, isn't just a game. This is a god damn work of art. And I, with all my being encourage you to buy it and give it a shot, refund it if you can't bring yourself to like it. But something like this should be experienced. Games like this don't come around often. From the gameplay, storytelling, and characters all the way down to the graphics (I don't believe graphics make a game) are phenomenal. Owlboy will most likely be my Game of the Year, if for nothing else, all the love and effort the developers put into it.

First and foremost, the hi-pixel graphics is insanely well made and all credits in the world to D-Pad Studios, what a great norwegian/english game company. I recomend everyone to add this to your steam library and play it without knowing something beforehand, that will dubble, if not triple your gaming adventure (just a tip). The music is also fantastic and the characters is both funny and elegant. Great design overall!10/10			",62,24,2,10,6,2,5

												I'm going to have to be the vote of dissent. This is a 6/10 game with 10/10 graphics sound and charm. The gameplay is both basic and at times frustratingly imprecise. Entering and exiting flying mode never feels 100%, which doesn't matter much until it does at the end of the game. I even encountered a progress-halting bug on the pirate ship that had me wasting an hour of time. Overall cannot hold a candle to the new wave of metroidvanias such as Axiom Verge, Ori and the Blind Forest, Guacamelee...It's a lovely, lovely game, and I'm glad it exists, but I wouldn't pick it up for full price.

												I don’t often write reviews for anything but I must write something for this game as it is amazing in every sense of the word. The gameplay is superb, the visuals are stunning, the music out of this world, but what really makes the game shine is its storytelling, this game will make you truly care about the characters and when it is all over you will be sad to leave it. I am leaving this vague so as to not give away anything, but you will not regret your purchase of this game, only tip I would give you is explore, you may find something you did not expect. The only people I would see that would hate this game is people who love to rush through games, this is a game about pace and sometimes you just got to slow down and take in the sights of the place. 10/10			",17,5,0,1,1,0,3

												Owlboy an almost perfect game in my opinion. Visually it looks stunning. The soundtracks can evoke a variety of emotions depending the the scene. I did face few glitches and there was a frustration mission. I loved the game to bits. Otus though mute is immediately likable and his companions too have their distinct personalities. There is a diverse range of locations to visit and explore. Though there aren't many different types of enemies there are quite a healthy number of boss fights spread throughout the game. It keeps the game challenging and I never got bored exploring the beautiful locations. If you are reading this review I assume that you were curious enough about the game and scroll down to the reviews. It is completely worth the purchase and you won't be disappointed.

												This is the first game I ever purchased on Steam and boy, was it worth it.Owlboy is a beautifully animated, atmospheric game with rich, detail-filled story, deep and lovable characters, and music that will absolutely knock your socks off. The mechanics are smooth as well, and boss battles are never so difficult that you'll get stuck forever. If you're a fan of platforming, owls, friendship, exploration, or just gaming in general, you should buy this game!In Owlboy, you play as a mute owl, Otus, who is shunned and belittled by most members of his floating-in-the-sky village. However, when sky pirates invade, it's up to Otus and the friends he meets along the way to stop the invaders and find out the truth behind the relics that the ancient owls have left behind.Pros:-Cute characters-Stunning animation-Gorgeous soundtrack-Captivating story-Large areas and exploration-focused objectives give it an open-world feel-Good length-Plot twists-This is a lighthearted, fun game, but it also delves deeply into some emotional situations. Each character has a rich backstory and a lot of feelings. You'll laugh, but you might also cry! (I did and I'm not ashamed)-Really diverse gameplay. I'm serious. You will never get stuck in a rut with this game. New mechanics, tools, and abilities are constantly being introduced, and every boss encounter is unique. Also, there is at least one fun side quest/minigame!Cons-If you want a super hard game where you have to grind for hours to achieve anything, this is probably not the game for you. But honestly, I can't really think of any cons!Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I just finished it at 10.1 hours of gameplay and I already want to go back! Owlboy is a delightful tale with a unique narrative and...just go buy it already!			",2,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Owlboy is cute. The protagonist, Otus, (Otis?) endears himself to you easily. The stylized ""Super Duper Ninendo"" graphics look great. The game looks amazing in motion, and when you watch it, you're impressed by the world's potential. But it's just not fun to play. You're given too much mobility and firepower for combat to be a challenge. The puzzles are a joke, and you can just rush out of danger even if you get spotted in a stealth section. The boss battles are either rotations of simple concepts only made difficult by the fact that you get thrown around like a rag doll if you get hit, or they're scripted, unfair sequences you just have to memorize through repetition.The soundtrack has nice production values, but it isn't particularly catchy. The level design either has simple, linear progression, or needlessly large areas that aren't impressive in this day and age regardless of the nice art style. This is a sale purchase at best. Just watch someone stream it and you'll probably have a better time.			",641,187,27,123,56,1,91

												It pains me to say that I can't really recommend this game.  It is the best-looking retro-pixel game I have ever played. Every pixel has been painstaking placed, every animation brilliantly detailed and expressive.  But somewhere in those 10 years of development they forgot to check if their game was fun.Maybe its because we've had 10 years of innovation in this market, or maybe I'm just spoiled; owlboy can't really compare to Shovel Knight or Axiom Verge.  Switching out friends to change weapons is gimmicky, moving across the map is trivial.  Controls aren't particularly tight.  Once you start there is not much depth or ramp-up in difficultly as you proceed.  It seems like there is a good story hiding in here but you can only really guess at it even after gathering all the lore collectables and such.Worth picking up if on sale, but as a whole, I'm pretty disappointed in this.  If you're looking for a light-hearted easy game to breeze through, this is a good choice.  Was a good length for this kind of game, but by the end I was bored enough with the main game loop that I was ready for it to be over.			",63,31,0,7,9,0,7

												Well, after completing that game i can say one thing for sure:it had me caught and wouldn't let go, especially with that gameplay that follows the same rules as every metroidvania before it. The soundtrack is amazing, the art in the game is a pleasure for the eyes, and the story have you rooting for the characters in this game. There's also the good ol' tradition of collecting items but instead of directly getting the good stuff in chests you find throughout the game, you get them by visiting a shop in Tropos.There was also rumors saying that the Boguin's Cannon Challenge was amongst the hardest part of the game although i didn't get much trouble getting the rings and finishing the parkour.The only thing i'd have to say about the game overall is that it left me hoping for more as i think the ending is a bit abrupt.Also another rent that i won't be counting as a major flow of the game is its price, sure the gamewas enjoyable and most of the things in it were well-made and you can tell a lot of work was put into it (everything overall is amazing.), but i think it's worth less than it's actual price on steam right now. Might have considered picking it later for maybe 15 bucks or less when the sales are comming but im kind of trigger happy with my money.Nevermind the price, if you're ever thinking about picking up and playing Owlboy, go for it, it's absolutely worth your time!

												I don’t often write reviews for anything but I must write something for this game as it is amazing in every sense of the word. The gameplay is superb, the visuals are stunning, the music out of this world, but what really makes the game shine is its storytelling, this game will make you truly care about the characters and when it is all over you will be sad to leave it. I am leaving this vague so as to not give away anything, but you will not regret your purchase of this game, only tip I would give you is explore, you may find something you did not expect. The only people I would see that would hate this game is people who love to rush through games, this is a game about pace and sometimes you just got to slow down and take in the sights of the place. 10/10			",17,5,0,1,1,0,3

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Owlboy is a game developed and published by D-Pad Studios. Owlboy is an adventure in the truest sense of the word. You'll explore, fight baddies, gain power-ups, and make friends all throughout a wonderful world and story. The art direction is gorgeous, the animations of the characters and enemies are fun to watch, the music is a treat to listen to, and the story is a great mix of silly fun, abject terror, and heartwrenching moments. When I say that Owlboy is a great game, I really mean itThat being said, the game is not without it's faults, by far the biggest being it's difficulty, which is all over the place. You'll breeze through some sections of the game only to be utterly crushed by others. While checkpoints are liberal, you'll be tearing your hair out through some sections of the game trying to figure out what to do, and the lack of difficulty options certainly doesn't help. Exacerbating the issue is that while cutscenes are skippable, some mid boss fight conversations are not, and the aforementioned emotional scenes rapidly lose their luster as your forced to watch them over and over again as you die repeatedly to the more difficult bossesAlso, don't be fooled into thinking this is a metroidvania game. While it is heavily exploration focused, and you can be rewarded for revisiting previously visited areas, the game is actually quite linear, and there isn't much reason to play it multiple times if you aren't going for 100% fully finished gameOwlboy is a modern day classic, and other indie developers need to loot to it as a gold standard for what can be done with both the platforming genre and pixel art. Owlboy is an indie classic! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I Just finished Owlboy today, the game was amazing, it only took me 8.2 hours to complete - not exploring completly everything but also taking my time. The characters in Owlboy make owlboy an amazing game. Especially the 4 main characters. (Otus, Geddy, Alphonse and Twig) Their roles and script matched their personality perfectly. The game offers even more, as they have a great story and soundtrack added aswell. The bosses and other characters you meet on the way make this game even more amazing. Throughout the whole game you discover more on the Owlboy and try to stop the antagonist called Molstrom from collecting the 3 runes that would make him unstoppable.Owlboy was a great time and is definitely worth the price. I give Owlboy a 9/10 - Thanks for the experience D-pad Studios, thanks for sharing your masterpiece of a game.			",254,34,6,31,13,5,16

												The game is overrated by my opinion. I don't understand the 10/10s it keeps getting, there are too many negatives for that.Pros:+Good pixel art, animations and music+Some good boss fights+Quality feels good because the game is highly polished.Cons:-Bad controls, especially the transition from ground to flying is annoying. Also the area before last boss is impossible with an analog stick, I had to use D-pad(intentional?) to get through the area.-the 45 degree angle intervals for shooting is bad for a flying game.-Some really annoying enemies, especially the mosquitos.-No achievement for completing the game.-The invulnerable state and knockback feels unfair, I end up getting chain♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes.-Too easy puzzles.-Game crashed at launch a few times.

OverviewYou play as Otus a mute owl as he embarks on an owl-hood defining adventure that will involve navigating through treacherous dungeons. Otus himself has no true combat abilities as he can only stun enemies. This is where his companions come into play. As you progress, you will gain new allies that Otus can carry along with him. Each ally has a unique type of ammunition which has it's own attributes. You can only have one active companion at any given time but you can switch between them on the fly.Take note that, your companions cannot be hurt and any damage you take from enemies / hazards will be reflected on Otus' health bar. You also drop your companion if you get hit. The only way to regain health is by getting 'health pickups' which usually appear as fruit / vegetables? OR by resting. To my knowledge you can only rest at 2 places in the game - your home and a camp fire nearby the town. The game also has no concept of lives. When your health is reduced to zero, you just respawn at the last checkpoint. Yes, this is an auto-saving game. No manual saves here. You can however manually load from the last checkpoint - sometimes useful if you accidentally entered a new area (e.g. boss area).Right from the get go, you are introduced to the game's collectible Buccanary coins. This is not in-game currency as there is nothing you can buy in the game. However, at preset coin thresholds you can visit a shop to unlock trinkets which are upgrades for yourself - increase your max health or for your companions - longer range, improved shot. These coins are littered around the Owlboy universe usually cleverly hidden in the dungeons but also sometimes hidden in plain sight.Issues There is no in-game map. When they said the game features large dungeons they weren’t kidding. When you’re playing through a dungeon for the first time the progress is usually linear because they lock sections off but when you revisit a dungeon to look for any Buccanary coins you missed, it’s very easy to get lost so much so that you might find it difficult just to exit the dungeon.The game doesn’t exactly tell you where you are. Yes, the game displays the area name at the bottom of the screen when you transition between major areas but it does not do this for all areas which quite frankly puzzles me.The boss battles aren’t challenging. The attack patterns are simple and it’s usually obvious what you need to do. The fact that you respawn with full health when you die adds to this problem. The exception to this was the final boss fight (reminds me a lot of Savant – Ascent).Quite a lot of things are left to the player to deduce / observe. On many occasions there were things which didn’t quite make sense or just aren’t explained. For example, in the pirate ship there are switches which are actually for turning off the poison gas. The catch here is the poison gas only activates if you are spotted so you will be left wondering what those switches are for if you were never spotted.The story packs a little too much towards the end. The story became really interesting as the game drew to an end but it would have been really nice if there was more happening in the beginning. Apart from your companions, the side characters like Strix, Fib, Bonacci,etc don’t have much of a role in the game. Missed opportunity: Hiding coins in people’s houses?Art & Music / SFXI think the 'hi-bit' art and music needs no introduction. Feel free to take a look at the videos / screenshots that are available. You can also find some bits and pieces of the soundtrack publicly available on the developer's YouTube / the artist's (Jonathan Geer) Bandcamp[jonathangeer.bandcamp.com] pages. I will only add that the sound effects are really good and many sections / mini-cutscenes have their own music, all of which are really good and help to set the tone with the story.MiscellaneousI’d say 10 hours is a good estimate of the length of the game. It took me 14 hours to complete everything – mostly backtracking through all dungeons to get all the coins. You can skip cutscenes.There are some options controlling the UI (show HUD, show control prompts) so you can tweak some things to your liking.Basic audio volume controls are there for the in-game music and sound.The video options available are - Fullscreen, VSync and Letterboxing.You can remap the key bindings for the keyboard / controller. Note on the keyboard support: Qwerty, Azerty and Left-handed key bindings are available. For controller support you should probably read the Common Questions thread by the dev.Special note: Windows Media Player is required for the game which may or may not be an issue for you. More details here and here. ConclusionIt pains me to say this but Owlboy is not the great game that I hoped for. The weight of expectation after having waited more than 5 years probably has something to do with it. Having said that I agree with what most of the other reviewers have said about the game.The art is absolutely amazing and so too are the music and sound effects. This is where the 9 years of development truly shows.The gameplay and level design could use some tweaks. There something about it in general which leaves me more dissatisfied than satisfied in most if not all situations. It’s especially telling that I enjoyed playing the Boguins’ Cannon Challenge more than the game itself.Long story short : Owlboy is another good game that could have been great.

												As a speedrunner and glitch hunter of this game I think I can give a pretty acurate review of this game. Overall this game is really enjoyable an the less you know going in the better but I do have a few problems with it. Some of the areas are way harder than the others and I can see how some poeple could get to frustrated and stop haing a good time but this is a problem I see few having. The developers of this game are some of the best and are an active part of the community and if you are having a problem will try and help you with it. Most of the complaints as far as design go is nit-picky and is pretty solid throughout. The game play is very fun and rewarding and the pacing is wonderful. All in all I think you will enjoy this game and hope you can even half as much as I do.			",130,16,2,12,27,0,11

												I've been trying to think of something to write here since my first hour of playing it, but I haven't been able to come up with something to say. but I'll try anyways.  It's around 10 hours or so (it took me 12 hours to beat), but each minute of it is fantastic.  The gameplay is smooth and fun, the music is so well done, the characters are great, and the art is on a level not really ever seen before in a game.  The levels are really varied, and the game gets so much done in the time it takes to beat.  It feels far more like an adventure than most games that can boast about their length.  I'll admit, I tend to enjoy most games I play, but Owlboy really is something else.  It's worth the money and more.  This really is something special.			",89,36,2,13,11,0,2

												Yes, there are indeed tons of people who have given this game positive reviews. And yes, the few negative reviews probably won't do much impact, and fans will not like this review one bit. But I am alright with being one of the black sheep. Below are my very own personal observations and I stand by them:Just like every platformer lover who also has a soft spot for pixel art, I pounced onto this game. But I am not really happy about what I received.I really wanted to like this work, which took a whopping 9 years in the making, but I found that not so easy. Without further ado, here is a brief pros and cons list:Pros:+Beautiful art indeed+Smooth controls+Enjoyable story+... Nothing else really.Cons:-Very little exploration in a vacant world which could have been detailed a lot more than its current state-Although you get a bunch of allies and abilities, character development is redundant-No sense of progress-Too linear-Upgrades are apparently useless and not even worth pursuing-No obvious replay value. I don't see any reason to complete this game and ever want to play it again.-Too many times the game stops you for a long cutscene or unnecessary effects (was it really necessary to halt the game everytime a robot pirate spots you?)Finally, if I had played this on my 8bit console back in the day, I would have surely fallen in love with it. For a PC game though, I find its sheer lack of depth disappointing. It might be just my nostalgia addiction that led me to the purchase decision. I had been following Owlboy ever since I first stumbled upon the news of its development on some indie website years ago. It stuck in my mind. When it finally came out, I didn't even think twice. Probably I shouldn't have snatched this game so soon. In that regard, the blame is partly mine.In the end, this game taught me one very valuable lesson that I seemed not to get for such a long while: Don't be hasty about a new game. Wait for reviews to come up. And even if the game has received overwhelmingly positive reviews, go ahead and check whatever negative reviews are out there. Word to the wise. Hopefully you are doing just that yourself right now.P.S.: I respect long and hard work, and it pains me to write a negative review for this game, but that is just my unpopular personal opinion right here. Take it or leave it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My God...Just...Just yes. So...SO much yes. Do yourself a favor and PLAY THIS GAME. It's...it's something else. The Story is all about mistakes. Making them, making up for them, and learning to deal with the concquences of said mistakes. Every memeber of your team has made/makes a mistake in this game and only wish to better themselves by helping you, Otus, the Self-thought, Mute, Town screw up, save everyone and prove to the world, and to themselves they aren't failures. The Characters are very well written, funny when it can be, serious and emotional when it needs to be. There wasn't a single character that I hated, and even ones I did redeemed themselves by the end, relating back to everyone making mistakes. It's nothing Ocsar worthy, but it's something I think everyone would enjoy. I surely did. The Gameplay is somewhat innovative, yet simple. It's a Metroidvania...but you can fly...anywhere. There's platforming sections here and there, but nothing mind-blowing. From the start of the game, with the help of an Owl Cloak, Otus is able to fly around in ALL THEM BOOtYFUL DIRECTIONS. It is a skill you will MASTER by game's end. Problem is, by himself Otus is fairly vulerable. But with the help of his allies, he's capable of shooting, blasting, burning, and zipping through the few dungeons (Yes, DUNGEONS for ya Zelda Kids drooling over BotW) of the game, each with their own neat little gimmiks. The world is fairly small, and well connected, you'll soon get where everywhere is placed. The graphics makes me cream. The detail in the backgrounds, the character sprites, the JUST AMAZING SOUNDTRACK MAKES ME...Feel things. A single screenshot of this game does NOOT give it's beauty justice...It has a Night and Day cycle. Doesn't do anything, there's no special scenes, or different dialouge...It's just there. AND IT'S SO PRETTY. Is it pricey?...Well, Yes...Get it on a deal or something, I dunno, but please, PLEASE, give this game a shot, it's something that needs to be known, in the indie hall of fame.

You've probably already seen pictures of the game and the pixel art is pretty amazing. But when it comes to everything else the amount of time this game spent in development really starts to show.Nothing about it is innovative, it adds nothing tro the table.

												I Just finished Owlboy today, the game was amazing, it only took me 8.2 hours to complete - not exploring completly everything but also taking my time. The characters in Owlboy make owlboy an amazing game. Especially the 4 main characters. (Otus, Geddy, Alphonse and Twig) Their roles and script matched their personality perfectly. The game offers even more, as they have a great story and soundtrack added aswell. The bosses and other characters you meet on the way make this game even more amazing. Throughout the whole game you discover more on the Owlboy and try to stop the antagonist called Molstrom from collecting the 3 runes that would make him unstoppable.Owlboy was a great time and is definitely worth the price. I give Owlboy a 9/10 - Thanks for the experience D-pad Studios, thanks for sharing your masterpiece of a game.			",254,34,6,31,13,5,16

												The game is overrated by my opinion. I don't understand the 10/10s it keeps getting, there are too many negatives for that.Pros:+Good pixel art, animations and music+Some good boss fights+Quality feels good because the game is highly polished.Cons:-Bad controls, especially the transition from ground to flying is annoying. Also the area before last boss is impossible with an analog stick, I had to use D-pad(intentional?) to get through the area.-the 45 degree angle intervals for shooting is bad for a flying game.-Some really annoying enemies, especially the mosquitos.-No achievement for completing the game.-The invulnerable state and knockback feels unfair, I end up getting chain♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes.-Too easy puzzles.-Game crashed at launch a few times.

OverviewYou play as Otus a mute owl as he embarks on an owl-hood defining adventure that will involve navigating through treacherous dungeons. Otus himself has no true combat abilities as he can only stun enemies. This is where his companions come into play. As you progress, you will gain new allies that Otus can carry along with him. Each ally has a unique type of ammunition which has it's own attributes. You can only have one active companion at any given time but you can switch between them on the fly.Take note that, your companions cannot be hurt and any damage you take from enemies / hazards will be reflected on Otus' health bar. You also drop your companion if you get hit. The only way to regain health is by getting 'health pickups' which usually appear as fruit / vegetables? OR by resting. To my knowledge you can only rest at 2 places in the game - your home and a camp fire nearby the town. The game also has no concept of lives. When your health is reduced to zero, you just respawn at the last checkpoint. Yes, this is an auto-saving game. No manual saves here. You can however manually load from the last checkpoint - sometimes useful if you accidentally entered a new area (e.g. boss area).Right from the get go, you are introduced to the game's collectible Buccanary coins. This is not in-game currency as there is nothing you can buy in the game. However, at preset coin thresholds you can visit a shop to unlock trinkets which are upgrades for yourself - increase your max health or for your companions - longer range, improved shot. These coins are littered around the Owlboy universe usually cleverly hidden in the dungeons but also sometimes hidden in plain sight.Issues There is no in-game map. When they said the game features large dungeons they weren’t kidding. When you’re playing through a dungeon for the first time the progress is usually linear because they lock sections off but when you revisit a dungeon to look for any Buccanary coins you missed, it’s very easy to get lost so much so that you might find it difficult just to exit the dungeon.The game doesn’t exactly tell you where you are. Yes, the game displays the area name at the bottom of the screen when you transition between major areas but it does not do this for all areas which quite frankly puzzles me.The boss battles aren’t challenging. The attack patterns are simple and it’s usually obvious what you need to do. The fact that you respawn with full health when you die adds to this problem. The exception to this was the final boss fight (reminds me a lot of Savant – Ascent).Quite a lot of things are left to the player to deduce / observe. On many occasions there were things which didn’t quite make sense or just aren’t explained. For example, in the pirate ship there are switches which are actually for turning off the poison gas. The catch here is the poison gas only activates if you are spotted so you will be left wondering what those switches are for if you were never spotted.The story packs a little too much towards the end. The story became really interesting as the game drew to an end but it would have been really nice if there was more happening in the beginning. Apart from your companions, the side characters like Strix, Fib, Bonacci,etc don’t have much of a role in the game. Missed opportunity: Hiding coins in people’s houses?Art & Music / SFXI think the 'hi-bit' art and music needs no introduction. Feel free to take a look at the videos / screenshots that are available. You can also find some bits and pieces of the soundtrack publicly available on the developer's YouTube / the artist's (Jonathan Geer) Bandcamp[jonathangeer.bandcamp.com] pages. I will only add that the sound effects are really good and many sections / mini-cutscenes have their own music, all of which are really good and help to set the tone with the story.MiscellaneousI’d say 10 hours is a good estimate of the length of the game. It took me 14 hours to complete everything – mostly backtracking through all dungeons to get all the coins. You can skip cutscenes.There are some options controlling the UI (show HUD, show control prompts) so you can tweak some things to your liking.Basic audio volume controls are there for the in-game music and sound.The video options available are - Fullscreen, VSync and Letterboxing.You can remap the key bindings for the keyboard / controller. Note on the keyboard support: Qwerty, Azerty and Left-handed key bindings are available. For controller support you should probably read the Common Questions thread by the dev.Special note: Windows Media Player is required for the game which may or may not be an issue for you. More details here and here. ConclusionIt pains me to say this but Owlboy is not the great game that I hoped for. The weight of expectation after having waited more than 5 years probably has something to do with it. Having said that I agree with what most of the other reviewers have said about the game.The art is absolutely amazing and so too are the music and sound effects. This is where the 9 years of development truly shows.The gameplay and level design could use some tweaks. There something about it in general which leaves me more dissatisfied than satisfied in most if not all situations. It’s especially telling that I enjoyed playing the Boguins’ Cannon Challenge more than the game itself.Long story short : Owlboy is another good game that could have been great.

Posted: November 7, 2016
												I've been following Owlboy's development for at least this past year, and was incredibly eager to give it a try for the art and animation alone.As it turns out, Owlboy is an excellent game in its own right. It seems best described as a side-view Zelda-esque game without a lot of extra padding and unnecessary fluff, but it certainly has an identity of its own. Aesthetics:As anyone can see even from the trailer and screenshots, it has a gorgous, incredibly detailed style of pixel art with some impressive animation. It also has some amazing moments of visual spectacle, especially in certain boss fights. The soundtrack also works very well with the game, and has enough standout tracks to warrant listening to on its own.Story:Owlboy's story is engaging, well-written, fairly unique, and even surprisingly somber at times.There are even several hidden pieces of interesting story and lore to find across the world.Also, robot sky pirates are a critical piece of it. Just saying.Puzzles:The game's puzzles, while not exactly mind-bending, are still interesting and make good use of your party's abilities and the theme of the area in which they are found.The Gunners:The Gunners, which function as Owlboy's equivalent of upgrades or ""dungeon items,"" all feel unique and are useful in both combat and puzzles, not to mention being interesting and enjoyable characters themselves.Difficulty:Owlboy's difficulty isn't especially punishing. I died a fair number of times, but the final boss only defeated me twice. Honestly, the hardest challenge was the Cannon minigame, which is completely optional (if you don't want to be completionist).Immersion:Owlboy also does a remarkable job of keeping the player's immersion, both through avoiding breaking the fourth wall entirely and giving contextual reasons for abilities and decisions that in other games often seem arbitrary. For instance, rather than simply being a typical arbitrarily silent protagonist, Otus intead does not speak because he is actually a mute, a trait which the other characters are well aware of.My one complaint was that the game doesn't convey much of the world outside the little slice of sky you are given to explore. The story is very much contained in this relatively small area, with practically no references to the world outside. And while the characters populating the game's few settlements are interesting, the places seem oddly barren. Even your home village, the biggest explorable populated area, has a grand total of only about 10 houses, 6 of which are only seen way off in the distance, and even fewer NPCs. Don't get me wrong, the area you are given has plenty of interesting details, but the sense of scale of the world is portrayed inconsistently at best.Overall, Owlboy is well-worth the price. Between its incredible art, interesting dungeons and challenges, solid mechanics, and good characters and story, it's an adventure well worth taking.NOTE: In my play time I cleared the game 100%, so at least a few hours of it were spent searching through areas for hidden secrets. I also spent at least an hour or two trying to clear the optional Cannon minigame. ",38,13,0,1,1,0,4

												Owlboy does many things right. The most obvious are the GORGEOUS visuals. I do not think the was a background or character I saw that did not scream how much time, effort, and love must have been put into its spritework. The next noteworthy thing is the gameplay. Simple enough to quickly grasp, but engaging enough to keep you involved with only a few breaks in the fun. The last thing I will note are the characters; developed enough to be more than one dimensional, but not developed enough to feel like there is a deep deep deep lore you can find out just by playing the game. The in game lore is there, but it is vague enough so that it doesn't feel like it is pushing itself on you; which leads into what I feel are some of the games weak points.The first gripe I have with the game; it leaves you wanting more. The game felt short for all it tried to introduce you to, but not quite finish. I found myself wanting more when I would be introduced to a new area or new character. Sadly, very few things are tied up when the story ends. The second and biggest gripe I have with the game; the ending. Without giving away spoilers; the ending feels half full. You never quite resolve a few of the major story points you deal with; some still happening right as the finale is about to begin. I can understand artistic endings, but some people would rather have a full story as oppossed to an artistic ending. I am one of those people. The last gripe is very minor, but still one I feel should be addressed. While I mentioned the gameplay is simple and easily engaging; there are some points, especially late game, where it feels a change or two in mechanics would be appreciatted. Such as including a map to help with exploration, a faster mode of travel (Note, you do get a small form of it, but the distance said mode has isn't particularly long), and the ability to fast travel in the ""hub"" areas.Overall; despite the gripes mentioned above, Owlboy does an outstanding job of just being a fun game that is nice to look at, though it is not perfect, it is definitely a good game.

												Fun metroidvania-style game.Art and sound design is very good, assuming you like the 16-bit style graphics.Story is decent, altough at times I found it a bit confusing.Gameplay is entertaining, but not as tight as for example Ori or Rayman.Overall recommended.			",99,20,0,10,4,0,10

												It was decent but definitely not worth the current price of $25 that I paid for it. Wait till a sale and even then there are much better games out there like Ori and the Blind Forest. People have compared it to Ori and in my opinion Ori blows Owlboy out of the water in every aspect.I'm befuddled by the rave reviews this game is getting. It was way too easy, the story wasn't great, the aiming controls can get wonky, etc. It's just not nearly as good as people are making it out to be and was left feeling disappointed.For those who haven't played it yet, beware of the bandwagon effect here. Wait for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really, REALLY wanted to enjoy this game, but I just can't. It's probably one of the most beautifully crafted pixel art games I've ever seen, the music is good to great and I like characters as well as the humour.But the problem I have with Owlboy is its battle system. It's simple and annoyingly exhausting at the same time, because the controls are so clunky. And even though you can fly, it never feels like you can actually move fast. After Ori and the Blind Forest showed me how smooth a platformer can be, this game seems like the complete opposite. It's a shame, but I can't recommend it at all.			",308,126,7,70,9,1,33

												One of the most charming games I have ever played.  The pixel art is top notch, the characters are likeable, the story is compelling, and the controls are responsive.  I wish it were longer, but I got nearly 18 hours out of it which is well worth the price; I just didn't want it to be over.  If I had one gripe it's that you never fight Molstrom, but maybe in a decade we'll get a sequel ;).			",193,50,0,27,19,1,19

												Wow!! After seeing a lets play of Owlboy by TeamFourStar I fell inlove with Otus right away. There are so many little attention to detail things. For one, all the animated foreground and backround objects, EVERYTHING IS MOVING, EVEN THE GRASS!! The music is very well done too, gives me chills....In a good way :)    Awesome job D-Pad Studio!

												Owlboy's not a bad game and honestly it's difficult to give it a thumbs down, but I just found myself really underwhelmed by the game, especially after reading so many great reviews from both critics and players. It's not that I'm saying you shouldn't try it, but I feel like expectations should be tapered a bit.To start with the good, there's a lot of heart in Owlboy. The art direction is great, some of the best pixel art I've ever seen in a game, and the soundtrack really gives the feeling of a grand adventure. The characters have a lot of charm and the game balances humorous moments and emotional moments really well. The gameplay is a pretty standard twin-stick shooter, albeit framed in a fun way where Owlboy carries his friends who are in charge of the gunning. The controls are pretty simple and tight as well, so any failures felt like they were my fault. The gameplay is fun at first, but gets old as the game doesn't really have any ""upgrades"" to add another element of gameplay past what's initially there. After a while, I just couldn't get myself to keep playing.Unfortunately, I just feel like Owlboy doesn't do anything that some of the top indie games in the past couple of years haven't done better. It sucks, and I'm sure the 8-year journey to develop the game was definitely not due to choice, but I can't help but feel like Owlboy would've seemed so much better were it released years ago like it was planned. It just seems like it was a bit late to the party and the trophies it was going for have already been snatched up by bigger and better games.Again, not a bad game but just not what I was looking for.7.0/10			",90,16,0,9,6,0,5

												THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE Satisfying gameplay. Beautiful art. Really captures adventure and has a kind of ""Miyazaki"" sense of wonder. One downside - My computer turned off mid-game right after I reached a save point. I loaded it back up and my save file was gone. I had exited the game and picked up from where I left off prior to this. Dont know what happened.but overall (this technical issue aside) i highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had to stop. The bosses were getting too diffcult for me. Maybe it's because I don't generally play (or even like) side scrollers but this game came highly recommened from people. I like the story, setting, music and characters but the controls are not very good for me. This is an example of a game which it would be nice if I could skip boss battles.			",106,28,0,14,19,0,11

												Owlboy is the best game I've played this year. Every element of it: story, art, music, mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics, is filled with the heart and soul of 9 years of development by some hugely talented people.It is not a game without its flaws, and players who struggle with 2D action-adventure/platformer elements in games will have a frustrating moment or two here and there, but every flaw and frustration is paid off in beautiful scenery, a mystifying soundtrack, gameplay that felt as smooth and natural as it did challenging and fulfilling, and a masterfully paced story that always left me wanting to play on, even after hours of play.Finishing Owlboy was an experience that left me with tears in my eyes and shivers down my spine.Edit: The achievements are fixed! Hurrah!			",168,33,4,29,38,2,30

												Otus says: ...(He's mute but his expression says a lot)-----------------------The first time I launched the game, I went ""Wow! That intro animation."" It don't stop there. The attention to details are everywhere. The idle animations, when you run pass a bush or hit it, those animation are very detail. There are so many hidden passages and treasures. The cut scenes are full of flavours. And there is an artwork on a wall that looked like a pe_nis but it's not. I laughed so hard when I first saw it. The pixel arts are just gorgeous. Even a plane wall has so much details. Control is awesome. I tested both keyboard + mouse and gamepad control, for me keyboard and mouse are the easiest to control. Boguins' Cannon challenge is very hard to control though.Music is awesome, blends in and out with the time; music also changed when you are flying or grounded. Gameplay: 9/10 (might be too easy for hardcore platformer)Controls: 7/10 (Boguins' Cannon challenge too hard to control)Story: 7/10 (Story very loose, but sweet moments are nice)Music: 9/10 (dynamic music in boss battles)Artwork: 10/10 (Awesome parallax tricks)-----------------------Overall: 8/10If you are reading this review, don't watch more review videos, don't read more reviews, don't spoilt it for yourself, buy it and experience the surprises.

												In Owlboy you play as Otus, a mute young owl who ventures off in a heart-tugging emotional adventure about friendship and trust.Here is the video review (or see below for the full written review):

			Here is our review of Owlboy, one of the most anticipated adventure platformers of 2016. ➥Join our community: www.youtube.com/downwardthrust Owlboy is a side scrolling adventure platformer developed...		

Full Written Review:The story of owlboy is a simple yet warming coming of age tale.  Otus’s Owl homeland gets besieged by airborne pirates and Otus, along with his soldier buddy Geddy and a few other trusty friends, must set out to put a stop to their dastardly deeds.

Otus’s Owl homeland gets besieged by airborne pirates and Otus, along with his soldier buddy Geddy and a few other trusty friends, must set out to put a stop to their dastardly deeds.  Along the way you’ll team up with rebellious pirate   tand misbehaving spider Twig, using their abilities in conjunction with Geddy’s to foil the plans of those invading pirates.Animation & ArtThe first thing that will take you aback in this game will most likely be its refined pixel art.  This isn’t pixel art like we saw it back in the Super Nintendo era, nor is it a contemporary mashup of what most developers consider ‘throwback or retro style pixel art.’  This is sophisticated and tastefully crafted pixel art with all the dressings of high resolution graphics.  GameplayOwlboy’s gameplay is a melange of adventure platforming, aerial navigation and twin stick companion shoot-emup.  With the tap of a button, you can fly freely without any recharge mechanic, as an owl should, and on your own, you may dodge, perform a spin-attack that stuns enemies, and drag select objects around after picking them from the ground. But the meat of the game rests when you pick up your companions.  The game then ventures into the twin stick realm, you’ll be flying with one stick and free arming with the other depending on the abilities of your counterpart.   As such, this is how ability progression plays out in Owlboy - not by purchasing new abilities or unlocking them, but by finding companions and utilizing their skill sets to add to your own.FlawsFaults are hard to find in Owlboy, save for some tweaking that needs to be done to make the controls more responsive. It’s just a tad unresponsive, it’s a downfall yet not a catastrophic one.  Like getting an ice cream sundae and finding you didn’t get enough extra chocolate sauce.  No big deal in the end really. The only other notable thing would be that the navigation can be tricky from time to time as you fly around the hub worlds, discover new areas and unlock barricades on past screens with special abilities.  It’s all a little bit hard to keep track off.  But nothing to mare the overall experience.   VerdictThe presentation, story and character arcs are Owlboys strongest weapons.  You’ll find Twigs story arc particurlly poignant and you may find yourself open to the idea of exploring the deep character archetypes that each character is instilled with.  You’ll make friends, you’ll feel the nostalgia from the obvious Zelda influences and may gush a little when the story all comes together.  And it doesn’t hurt that the gameplay is also refreshing, diverse and satisfying.			",30,1,1,5,0,0,2

												Owlboy:~~~~~~ Despite the long, hard training given by his mentor, the famous Owl Asio, Owl-hood has not been very easy for a small, mute owl named Otus. His first flight was not one to be remembered, if you ask Asio. The disappointment on Otus’ face could have be seen from miles away. Well, today is another day, thought Otus before taking his watch over the floating Island of Vellie. It’s a big day for an Owlboy like him, especially after reports of pirate ships flying around the area! You know you can do it Owlboy, you know you can!Owlboy is a platformer / adventure game where you play a small owl, who, with the help of his friends, will have to save the capital Advent from a pirate invasion.You will be greeted by a fabulous piece of orchestral music as soon as you land on the main menu page; it truly gave me goose bumps! As you start a new game you will be introduced to the story, which will also include a short tutorial. Then your character will wake up on the floating city of Vellie, where you will receive your first orders. This chapter is pretty much an exploratory one and will give you a good feel of how to manoeuvre your owl, as well as what to look for in each level: coins and heath items.  Most of the coins are half-lodged into the ground - pull them up and coins will appear. You will also earn coins by flying through rings which are scattered all around the levels. There are a certain number of coins to be discovered per stage. If you find them all, you’ll earn a golden star and it will also contribute to accessing special devices from the buccanary’s shop. To restore health, just pick fruits from trees or pull vegetables from the ground.  As you progress through the story and meeting new characters, some of them will join. One point I forgot to mention - Otus doesn’t have weapons! Sure, he can fly, roll and twist his wings but he can’t shoot anything. He carries someone around who can shoot at enemies. Enemies are pretty fun, lion thingies that spit fire from their mouths, cavemen who throw rocks at you, pirates and their parachute explosives and one-eyed flying green balls, to cite a few. Boss fights are quite tricky here and has taken me several attempts to beat some of them so far.Nice puzzles, however quite obvious in my opinion. The pixel artwork is fabulous and I really like the fluidity of the animations. The soundtrack is splendid - it grabs you from the start. Control-wise, you can use the mouse and keyboard but I prefer to use a gamepad – it’s better, in my opinion. It is quite easy to go through the levels, apart from the boss fights, which are more challenging. Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Great graphics and animations-	Splendid soundtrack-	Responsive controls-	Good story and characters-	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Needed to be more challengingOwlboy is a very well-designed game with splendid pixel artwork, great animations and marvellous music!9/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Owlboy is not a METROIDVANIAN game, even though it's tagged as one.---Don't get fooled by Owlboys stellar Pixelart or amazing music.Sadly, the gameplay feels uninspired and sometimes even boring.It looks great, but it's just not fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before anyone is going to rage at me here for this... I LOVE this game... and i wanted so so so so hard to give it a ""YES""... But i just have many reasons why i didnt. I try to do this relatively Spoiler free!This is gooing to be a bit lengthy... so bare with me... i will put a tl:dr at the very bottom of this. 1. The BackgroundThe Background Idea for Owlboy was as it seems aspired by Kid Icarus, Super Mario 3 and has to me at least certain Zeldaesque Elements. The Game was in Development since 2007. Certain points clearly show this... others sadly dont. The Game was created by D-Pad Studio. I sadly never played anything they made before. 2. The StoryThe Story is a very basic ""Save the World scenario"", not to spoiler too much, There are Very Powerful Relics wich came from a very old Owl Civilisation, they stand in the Focus of Resoring the World, or Destroying it again. 3. The Main characterWe play as a small semi-anthromorphic Little boy named Otus. He seems to be born as a Mute, wich explains why he does not talk. He is shown as a weakling with no real Skills or anything. A Pure dissapointment  for his Mentor. He can walk, Fly, and Dash. Also his main Purpose is to carry around other characters, wich will aid him with firepower, or other gadgets, to make his way through the game possible. Sadly Otus is one of the most... interchangeable characters i have EVER seen in my life. He is a Mute, wich makes him unable to speak, this is perfectly fine and used very well as a story element. Yet Otus never seems to grow during the whole Story... nothing that happens really lets him shine in what he does. He is always scared and always weak. He never stands up for his friends and feels in a lot of cases just like the Taxi for his Party. ""Hey Otus, pick me up so i can shoot this enemy there... please thank you! In Zeldaesque games, we at least have the Feel of the Main character growing with the Story. Getting Stronger, getting smarter about what is happening. Otus is just kept very small for the entirety of the Game, Everyone else knows ore, can do more, and is more important for the overall story. 4. The GameplayThe Gameplay is to put is simple... decent. I really liked it, the Controls were a bit wonky at times, switching out your Teammates to solve puzzles on the fly is quite fun. I think the game for what it is... Is a bit too Simple at times... and at other times insanely frustrating because certain enemys just annoy you to fight against (the Beebirds in the Darkness level) because of numbers. Mini Bossfights always follow the same Pattern: 1 Enemy, 2 Enemys, 3 Enemys... and so on up to 8 enemys. That was no fun and got frustrating very soon.  Another big letdown for me were the ""final"" bosses of each ""dungeon"" Memorize the very very simple patterns and you are Good to go. It is from WTF to ""oh when i stay here, the enemy wont be able to hit me anymore... yay"". 5. The GraphicsHere we come to the point where this game truly truly shines... the graphics are some of the most beautifully, lovely crafted Pixelarts you have and will ever see. Every detail is nice and crisp. Truly.. Lovely!6. The ControlsI played this on my Keyboard and the Controls felt very smooth. They do what they must, and they never really feel... ""sloppy"" or bad. 7. The LengthThe Game Clocks in at about 10 Hours. Very Few Dungeons, no real collectibles, nothing to really power up your character. The Dungeons are on a very easy to normal level of difficulty, and mostly you find the right solution to a Puzzle in a matter of seconds, because the Game shows you anything, and barely encourages you to think for yourself. Making it more of a rush. 8. The ConclusionOwlboy is such a great and lovely game, with so many loveable characters. I would just squeak and hug Solus (another cutie owl) all day and take care of him. Sadly his ""plot"" twist does absolutely not work with his overall character... but hey... plot twist... guess they can do anything they want in the end. The very short length of the game (for me at least), does not match up with the asking price of CHF 24 (Swiss Francs for me).The Overall character  Progression is for my playstyle very dissapointing and many of the Plot Twists just dont make any sense. To prevent any Spoilers, i sadly cant fully write out what i think of most passages and twists, but this is a review and giving out spoilers, would ruin the fun for many people. 9. TL:DRI would get the game when it is on a discount. As it Currently Stands.... it is too short for the Price Tag and does not offer too many outside possibilities for side Quests. The Game feels like a barebone skeleton to test mechanics, and certain ideas. It does not feel like a fleshed out game. Thanks for reading!			",220,48,2,41,42,2,21

												Writing this review sort of breaks my heart.As I was getting close to completing this game, it was possibly one of the best games I had played so far this year, if not the best.Excellent art, controls, level design, story and atmosphere.Then I reached the last stage. And for whatever reason, developers thought it would be a brilliant idea to change the control scheme that worked so well so far (won't spoil how) and use this opportunity to throw a frustrating precision platforming section into player's face. After reading ""Stay afloat, Otus!"" for the 20th time while failing to reach the corresponding platform, my controller was well on the way to start learning how to fly.Eventually I got past it - no sense of achievement, only anger.Then I proceed to try and complete the one optional minigame. Again, a completely different control scheme from the rest of the game. One hour of fruitless attempts before eventually giving up. No less than half the achievements of this game are gated by completing this (not that I care much but it's really a bizarre decision to give so much weight to this ONE optional part of the game).I am sure I am going to get a lot of flak for this, and yes, I know, ""git gut"".But if you are amongst people who can't get good enough, you may want to give Owlboy a pass. You will love it for 95% of the adventure, but the remaining 5% will leave a sour aftertaste...It makes me really sad - a couple of design decisions that seem inconsistent with the rest of the game in general were enough to switch my opinion from ""Highly recommended"" to ""Not recommended"".

												Owlboy upsets me because it should be a good game, but it isn't. It has nice graphics and decent controls, both important to a metroidvania, but it is a miss in every other aspect.The protagonist has unlimited flight, so platforming as a mechanic is effectively non-existent. The level design is boring, straightforward, go from point A to point B with a few puzzles scattered about to prevent you from blazing through the game at full sprint. There are very few secrets and no reason to explore. Enemies exist solely to present an obstacle and drop nothing, no money, no items, not even health or powerups. That could be forgiven if the enemies were interesting or tough, but the only difficulty any of them present is due to your limited options, not their cool powers. The gadgets you unlock with the coins you do find are mostly worthless: other than lifeups, it's just useless hats and an almost unnoticeable upgrade to each of your companions.If you're a metroidvania fan, Owlboy simply doesn't measure up. If you are new to the genre, start somewhere else.			",271,36,7,48,7,0,23

												I'm sure this game is great for people who like the exploration style of platformers.  I felt I might enjoy it based upon so many positive reviews.  Unfortunately, I found the game kind of cute, but ultimately dull.  I only played 5 hours and got bored and am not interested in going back.  Guess this review is for those who may have seen all the positive reviews and thought it may transcend the platformer puzzle style of game.  In my opinion, it did not.			",17,10,0,21,10,0,10

												This is by far one of the best games I've played recently. BEAUTIFUL art, a lovely orchestral soundtrack, fun and well-designed gameplay, and clever level design. For folks who are into completionism and 100%ing, there's a strong collectathon element as well. There are also a few hidden secrets, reminiscent of classic 90s games; however, don't get me wrong, this is overall a modern game despite some classical elements. I'm a major sucker for nice pixel art, and Owlboy most certainly delivers on this score. Every bit of this game clearly had a lot of love put into it. Color choice, character design, just... unf. Love it, love it, love it. This game is what modern pixel art games should aspire to be. The soundtrack is just as lovely as the art; it gets a little extra appreciation from me given the amount of oboe featured! The characters and storyline are enjoyable and fun. Our main cast is made up of a mute owl, a friendly (but sometimes a little judgemental) engineer, a poetic pirate, and a wannabe spider; each has their own backstory and character growth. There are quite a few optional opportunities to learn more about each character, in addition to the main plotline. Each one is loveable and quirky in their own way. I also feel as though the somewhat ostentatious and gaudy shopkeeper, Buccanary, deserves an honorable mention in this category. Especially at the end, the game can hit you with a few nice, emotional punches as well. One moment at the very end comes to mind in particular, but unfortunately, it's extremely spoilery. The gameplay is a nice blend of puzzle-solving, platforming, and Tanooki-suit Mario. While the first dungeon has a fairly simple feel to it, it's clearly meant to be an introduction, as the future dungeons change things up in fun and sometimes novel ways. Everything from grappling puzzles to traditional platforming are featured. Even if it's not revolutionary, none of the gameplay feels ""stale"" or cliche. Everything is polished and fits well in the context of the game. I highly recommend this game, overall. Well worth the full price, to me! ",161,75,0,16,21,3,30

												It's no Shovel Knight, and it's PAINFULLY short for the asking price (7 Hours on my end, and I wasn't trying to speed run), but Owlboy tries, and more-or-less succeeds to overcome it's short-commings and gutted story with sheer love and dedication. But buyer beware; if the game's art style doesn't charm you immediately, you're in for an expensive diversion. Long Form: Keeping with the trend of 2016 video games, Owlboy's conclusion will leave a lot to be desired. The game plays well, though it's occasional obsession with having you navigate blind through pitch-black spike trap room is just bafflingly poor design. The game was in development hell, and it clearly shows, both in the bizzare pacing (The Primary Antagonist is never fought, despite having all of the spritwork done for an actual battle, there's an upgrade for a weapon that, by the time you can afford it, will only be useable once) and in an almost pointedly avoided Three-Magic-Items quest that seems to be happening for the villians more than for you. But Owlboy is a light game, with a surprisingly heavy asking price. It's conclusion does not leave a good taste in the mouth, and there's precious little to recommend beyond the eye candy and the lovingly realised characters who, if not exactly genre defining, are at least fun and inoffensive. Owlboy is inoffensive, which is the best I can say for it. It digests easily, passes quickly, and will be forgotten about within minutes of completing it. Let's hope 2017 shows us some games with actual, realised endings.			",214,52,0,42,29,3,43

												The game simply beautiful, i almost only have positive things to say about it. The game is a pixelated platformer that plays really well. From the background the nature and how it feels flying around in the game is a really good feeling overall. It is easy to pick up and finish. I'd say it is a bit too easy but i would still die here and there. Good bosses, with great move sets. The game does not have too great replay value, if you explored it through really vell. Of course it is worth playing through again if you missed out on the story (which is by the way amazing 10/10), or if you are an achievement hunter.			",65,12,0,11,2,1,5

												First thing : I haven't finished the game yet.At the time I write this review, I'm about 6 hours into it when removing the distraction time from my steam counter.And damn. I wanted to play that game. The graphics are really good, the gameplay looked promising ...Don't get me wrong. The game isn't plain bad, and that's why I'm still recommending it, but ...* The story is rather boring* The characters are annoyingly immature* The Dialogues are a pain and you'll find yourself trying to skip them most of the time* The gameplay just feels wrong, from the way you decide to fly in the middle of a jump to the way you bring your partners to shoot at your ennemies. Everything feels rather rough and clunky.I am still going to push to finish the game, because I still think it's worth it, but beware before picking up that title : it's far from a perfect ride.Edit : Now that I have finished it, I come back to it. The gameplay towards the end of the game is getting even worse by its inconsistence. Characters contradict what we've seen from them in-game even right at the end of the game. The game is quite a disappointment overall. I wanted to like it, but that is far too painful overall, I'm switching my recomendation from ""yes"" to ""no"".			",689,167,14,93,45,1,92

												Beautiful art, silky-smooth controls, and the charm of a Studio Ghibli film. Although cinematic sequences can feel over-long, they play out like little vignettes and rarely feel cheesy.Going into Owlboy, I was worried it might come off as cloying or twee, but the tone feels about on par with a Zelda game, and it's got a surprising emotional depth to it. D-Pad studio pushes each pixel to its storytelling maximum, and Otus' animations are stunning in their cartoonish authenticity.With Owlboy, D-Pad studio has created something that's practically beyond categorization, with elements of twin-stick shooters, shoot-em-ups, platformers, and Metroidvanias all rolled into one cohesive package. The level design never feels cookie-cutter, and each area provides a whole array of new challenges that defy comparison in the hi-bit indie genre.This game, to me, is a must-play, and one of the finest that 2016 has to offer.

												A competent platformer with amazing art.Considering the hype around the game, I may have gotten my hopes up a bit too high, because while I find Owlboy worth playing, it's just not up there with the best platformers to me.The art is fantastic and is by far the best thing it has to offer. If good pixel art is all you need to play a game, just stop reading now and buy it.The rest of the game is just ""solid"". The music sounds like a greatest hits collection from other games, but has no real identity of its own. The combat mechanics are fairly weak, but they take advantage of things when they can. The control scheme is just way too complicated, and the difficulty of combat comes from fighting against the controller, not the enemies on screen.Tehnically it runs fine for me, although for some reaon it totally chugs in windowed mode to about 20 fps. It has some very minor issues with my 21:9 monitor in full screen, where overlays don't extend far enough to the edges and slight sprite pop-in is present at the edges. There is no option to change the screen resolution, which would have let me fix it myself, which is annoying but ultimately the minor graphical problems aren't game breaking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful Art, Music, Gameplay, and, Characters. This game does it all right. The devs of this game sure took there good time, but it was time well spent! It really pays off in the way the characters ooze emotion, breathing life into pixles. The gamplay isnt particularly challenging, but it is most certainly fun. Overall amazing game, highly reccomended.			",165,29,2,25,20,0,9

												I am a huge platformer fan, and I love playing indie games that put a twist on them, this once certainly was different. I overall had a lot of fun with this game. The difficulty levels are kind of all over the place, with most of the game being easy, but certain parts being very hard. I sometimes got frustrated with swapping my characters and managing them. The story is good, but felt incomplete in the end. Also had some plot issues. 9/10			",45,8,0,8,3,0,4

												Owlboy. What more can I see besides, ""excellent""! Checks off every aspect I love in a video game: soundtrack - one of the best I've heard this year, level design - very challenging levels with many twists, turns, and puzzles, and challenging boss fights that take me back to the days of playing Mario on my DS as a little kid! Combine all of this with an array of quirky and memorable characters, you've got yourself in my opinion a GotY dark horse!			",52,9,0,17,9,2,6

												First thing : I haven't finished the game yet.At the time I write this review, I'm about 6 hours into it when removing the distraction time from my steam counter.And damn. I wanted to play that game. The graphics are really good, the gameplay looked promising ...Don't get me wrong. The game isn't plain bad, and that's why I'm still recommending it, but ...* The story is rather boring* The characters are annoyingly immature* The Dialogues are a pain and you'll find yourself trying to skip them most of the time* The gameplay just feels wrong, from the way you decide to fly in the middle of a jump to the way you bring your partners to shoot at your ennemies. Everything feels rather rough and clunky.I am still going to push to finish the game, because I still think it's worth it, but beware before picking up that title : it's far from a perfect ride.Edit : Now that I have finished it, I come back to it. The gameplay towards the end of the game is getting even worse by its inconsistence. Characters contradict what we've seen from them in-game even right at the end of the game. The game is quite a disappointment overall. I wanted to like it, but that is far too painful overall, I'm switching my recomendation from ""yes"" to ""no"".			",689,167,14,93,45,1,92

I loved the game all the way to the end (Minus one of the boss fights), but I would still recommend that you get this game on sale. It's very short, and could probably be finished in less than 3 hours if you understood everything right away. But other than that, I'd give it 9/10			",92,15,2,6,10,2,8

												What defines a good game?Storytelling?Level Design?Visuals?Well. you'll find a lot of that here in Owlboy.Let's start off simple, the Visuals. Owlboy is very Visually appealing. Every sprite looks crisp and clean. and fits into the world around it. The visals for the Floating Islands are just beautiful. Most importantly however, is that every character's design fits in with their personality. Overall, the Visuals are enough to pull in anyone who's a fan of the 16-bit Era of gaming. And maybe even some who aren't. Level Design, What makes a good level? Well. I tend to look at the 'Mega Man' Formula when it comes to level design. where you Introduce one gimmick at a time. and then expand upon it. And this game does it brilliantly. You never feel like you're thrust into situations unknowingly, without having prior experience with a GImmick to an area. (Although there are two exceptions - Which I won't get into here as they are late-game spoilers, All spoiler things will be at the bottom of the Review past 'Final Score') Enemy placement never feels unfair. If you take a hit, it's your own fault. and that's something I can get behind. Oh, and do you like Secrets? This game has plenty of little Secret rooms in which to find Collectibles. Another thing is that every room in the game's dungeons has some form of Puzzle to it. Be it simply dropping a block on a Pressure switch, or sneaking past enemies who would otherwise easily overpower you.Storytelling. That's the big thing, What's the story about? How does it reach it's end? Well, as the Spoilers are at an end I won't go too in depth. but the Story progresses like a novel. you have an Opening part where characters are established, then Conflict. then a solution. and then a bigger conflict pops up, then a solution, and a conflict. and then the climax in which the solution ties solely into the solutions for past conflicts. The storytelling is great - Although the game does suffer slightly from being an Open World. the story can say ""You must rush to point A."" And you can go off and find collectibles for two hours. and then stroll over to point A to continue the main plot. Also, be prepared for Feels, as this game will bring you on a small Rollercoaster of emotions. Not that that's ever a bad thing in a Story-driven game.Overall Scores.Visuals: 8/10 - I Personally adore the Sixteen Bit style of games, always have, always will. it's not for everyone.Storytelling: 9.5/10 - This game's storyline had me so interested, that I completed the game from start to finish in a single sitting.Level Design: 7/10 - The Level Design is overall good, however in some cases the 'Stealth Sections' you're introduced to can slightly irritate. Another slightly frustrating moment happens later on in the game - See 'Spoiler' Section below.I cannot recommend this game enough, It had me hooked enough to complete it in a single sitting. I recommend that anyone who loves this sort of thing do check this game out. It's one of the best games I've played since Dust: an Elysian Tail.~~Spoiler Section - Be Advised~~Level Design Complaint - Surfing the Robotic Dragon/Snake/Wyvern thing. Acting fast can be a problem for some, Especially when you can only move up and down in about five set places. this can cause you to scrape your head on the ceiling repeatedly. Which is painful, even at the Maximum Health Bar.Storytelling Spoilers: The protagonist is a mute who - despite all he does to try and help, messes up more often than not (Sometimes even just percieved as messing up by his teacher), So his teacher scolds him, Saying various things like ""I am Very Dissapointed in you."" ""You're the worst student i've ever had"" ""Don't let me catch you coming back here."" Also, the Ending. My god. the Ending, I'll keep spoilers low - Even if this is the Spoiler Section - But my god. that was such a Bittersweet sort of Ending. a very much ""But at what cost"" Type of ending.Also, Watching that Tin Soldier get vaporised when he's been built up as an unstoppable wall of Metal and Strength. so satisfying. Thanks devs. c:			",48,2,1,4,5,0,5

												I am not very far into this game so I can't say much about the over all story but what I can say is this;      Owlboy is a ""platformer"" that will go down in history, I think. The animation is superb. The emotion that these 2d sprites can evoke is phenomenal. The general atmosphere is truly something to get lost in. While at first, I was getting some Fez vibes which, say what you will, can be a good or a bad thing, but very quickly I started to notice that that would not end up being the case. Characters have motive and purpose, and the setting is purposely set quite differently to the tone of the games characters. It's written much more like a good film from Pixar than it is like a typical platformer. I can't say yet whether it's worth the price tag but with the time and effort put into it, I can't really say there's any going wrong with buying this game. There is a lot of love behind it and it's easy to see. It's absolutely not for everyone but everyone should try it, nonetheless. Maybe it'll make a convert out of you.    I'll update the review as I get further (probably)			",160,38,2,15,22,1,12

												It's a beautiful pixel-art based game, with a strong emphasis on platforming and twin stick shooting. Gameplay's alright but the controls can sometimes gets confusing in the heat of the moment. Story and lore starts strong but slowly becomes uninteresting towards the end. Main characters are fine but the main antagonist was disappointing, you don't even get to fight him as the final boss fight.Finished this in about 7 hours, without doing most extra exploration for total completion. Highly recomended to buy during a sale.			",40,21,0,26,4,0,2

Product received for free
												Owlboy is definitely a love story to old school platformer games, but it's also not entirely trying to be a retro throwback here. It very much has it's own unique style of gameplay, and it's fun!  The art style is beautiful. It's not just another pixel art game, it's up there with the cream of the crop in terms of visuals. The music as well is very nice, combined with the graphics it gives the whole game a rather epic feel that I've not seen in any platformer game since the golden age of the SNES.Add in an intriguing story (at least what I've seen of it so far) and interesting characters, and it's a pretty solid recipe! I have so far only played through the very first part of the game, but I'm hooked, and definitely looking forward to more!You can see my playthrough of the beginning here:

												Gorgeous game with fun characters and amazing music. A few issues with the gameplay here and there, namely a couple of repeated sections and wonky controls in a screen or two, but I still enjoyed it immensely. Difficulty-vise it's neither too hard or too easy, and almost all of the stealth sections can be completed without being stealthy at all. You get rewarded for collecting as much money as you can in form of powerups, which is much better than just getting an achievement. It also sports a lot of puzzles that wouldn't feel out of place in a Zelda game.The writing is probably what blew me away the most, and it has one of the strongest endings I've seen in a long while. It has its flaws, but I couldn't recommend this game enough. It has 9 years of work and care put into it and it really shows.			",273,56,7,22,15,2,34

												An excellent game that held my interest to the end while not being too difficult and yet taking a decent amount of time to complete.  It may seem a tad pricey but I found it money worth spent.  Doesn't overstay its welcome.  I would absolutely reccomend Owlboy to any classic Mario/Metroid/Castelvania fan.  It's nowhere nearly as difficult as Axiom Verge, but it certainly has more charm.			",165,28,0,23,5,1,19

												Okay, so I clicked that I recommend the game because there's not 'recommend with caveats' button.Let's get the obvious things out of the way: Owlboy is gorgeous. The art is top-notch, the music is fantastic, the attention to detail in the smallest custom sprite animations, etc, is stunning. Moving around the rather unique game world feels fluid and natural. And over all, Owlboy is an okay game.Yeah, just okay. And just kind of... a game. It's vaguely a twin stick shooter. It's a bit of a metroidvania, a bit of a puzzler, sometimes a set-piece stealth game. It doesn't really have an identity. It doesn't have unified gameplay, and it suffers for it. It feels more like a sequence of things to do than it does a game. A few of the boss fights are solid, but over all, the gameplay is bland and the sequences wear out their welcome all too fast. It's an 8 hour game that could have been 4 hours long without losing anything.The characters are not especially evocative. A few side characters here and there are charming, and most of the characters have a shining moment or two, but they never come off as particular distinct or likeable, nor do they have fleshed out character arcs. The story has its ups - a very stunning moment or two - but like everything with Owlboy, it's too thin. It's mixed in with hours of little-to-no story but also little-to-no gameplay.The game has wacky difficulty balancing. Sometimes, it feels like a kid's game, almost insultingly easy, then a sequence will slam you with incredibly precise timing and instant death punishments. Sometimes, in the game's lack of identity, it becomes very, very unclear what exactly the game wants from you. And while the movement and jumping and flying are very smooth, you spend a lot of the game cycling between companions that you have to carry about to use their abilities, and switching between them/lifting and dropping them is a bit of a headache. It functions fine for the Lost Viking style puzzles, but when suddenly you have to switch between them and activate their abilities back and forth during a hectic boss fight, it gets unacceptably muddy, especially for a game of this production quality.So, do I recommend Owlboy? Well, I don't NOT recommend Owlboy, but it's not an art piece game that will leave you thinking, and it's not a story game that will leave you interested, and it's not an action game that will leave you adrenalized. It's just sort of a pretty thing to look at and experience and then go about your day, mostly unaffected.It isn't a bad game, but it's just sort of a game.Blind playthrough viewable here:

Owlboy -- from my point of view -- teaches the player the basics and then proceeds to teach the player like the old games I played when I was a young boy.This game makes me flipping giddy. I love it.I've been doing a series on it, and I express how awesome I think Owlboy is at least once an episode.

												Owlboy is a beautiful, retro-inspired platformer that delivers fun and emotional story telling, a neat twist on platforming, and wonderful roster of characters. The gameplay is reminiscent of a more linear Metroid. This game does SO much right with just a few minor, albeit annoying, flaws slipping through the cracks. First off, this game is gorgeous. It totally captures the snes age, retro feel but with modern day pixels. Sprites are well designed and the landscapes are intuitive and fun to explore. The gameplay is very fun and pretty unique and discovering hidden areas feels very fulfilling. The buddy characters add a lot of dimension to exploration and combat and the teleportation mechanic is very well done. Iinitially, I was a little disappointed with the runtime. I beat this game from start to finish, while in no particular rush, in 7 hours. However, those 7 hours were so packed with content and fun I really can't complain. The pacing is top notch. There were multiple times where I intended to play for 30-45 minutes and ended up playing for 2 or more hours. The story really chugs along and gets you invested right off the bat. I highly recommend this game!!			",179,30,2,29,5,1,18

												Owl boy is like that blonde cheerleader from high school: you wait ten years for your chance to be with her, but, when the time comes, she's nothing but a pretty face. Owl boy is absolutely gorgeous. I'd read reviews, watched youtube videos, etc., and was well aware going in how pretty it was supposed to be. Nothing prepared me for the first zoomed out shot of the overworld. Jaw literally dropped. Then I started playing. Then I started waiting for it to be good. Then I started praying it would evenutally become good. It never did. Just like the blonde cheerleader, owl boy is gorgeous and overflowing with charm, but it doesn't have a single inch of depth. 90% of the game is spamming 'roll' to get around the map and holding the left mouse button. That's it. It never advances beyond that. Even the intermittent stealth scenes are just spamming 'roll' to move from obstacle to obstacle. That's it. No strategy, no skill, no challenge. The occasional puzzle and loads of spam. The emotional payoff of having a mute, mostly unrelatable protagonist doesn't payoff until the last scene. It's not worth 7 hours of playtime for a one minute cutscene of emotion. I hate every word of this review because I wanted so badly to enjoy this game and be able to support the indie devs putting in the hard work to make games we crave. But, sadly, this is even more lifeless than AAA action FPS games. I would not call this adventuring, platforming, or even 'tactical twin stick' as I have seen it described. D-Pad studio obviously has talent and knows how to make a game look good. I think they just forgot gameplay along the way. I want to say they forgot to have their game beta-tested for the 'fun-factor' before committing to it, but I doubt that's the case.			",57,13,0,9,1,0,8

												Beautiful graphics and style. Stunning looking.But the gameplay is uninspired and boring. Slow moving and linear. Click around and do the same things over and over.I wanted to like it so badly, but I couldn't manage to keep myself engaged.			",142,54,1,10,9,0,23

												Owlboy was a game I honestly expected to be the big indie darling of the year. It looked fun, simple and beautiful. I was very ready to watch a brand new indie mascot emerge and hang with the likes of Meatboy, but sadly I feel Owlboy will be a soon forgotten character. It's visual art style is one of the few interesting parts of the game. Gameplay and overall game feel are terribly bland by comparison.Owlboy starts off in a lovely little town full of characters to talk to, houses to enter and small places to explore. This set a great tone for the game almost like that of a Zelda adventure, but it doesn't continue on this path. Although it continues to expand the lore and allow you to talk to a bigger cast of NPC's as you progress through the game, it starts to become a nuisance. I have a huge problem with the amount of exposition presented in the game. Most indie games with interesting lore (or even AAA games for that matter), give you the option to dive into the deep expository elements of the game. The key word is option. Owlboy chooses to make the story of the game unavoidable, with a false sense of importance. Especially for a game so short, I just don't care about the finer details of the 'owl lore'.The gameplay doesn't make up for this expostion overload. It lacks variety, despite seeming like it will have some with multiple companions. The game suffers mostly from a slow pace. The games flying mechanic is great at giving a sense of freedom, but the pace severly stunts this feeling. You'll be spending most of the game auto-targeting enemies and mashing the shoot button, with the occasional stealth section oddly enough. The game lacks any serious upgrade feature, and the shop acts mostly as a way to track your collectables. The few upgrades you do end up receiving happen later in the game, and judging by the difficulty of enemies and bosses, you wont really feel the difference. Most enemies are quite easy, and there's no real penalty for death.To end on a high note, I must stress how great the art style of this game is. The environments are always new and interesting, the characters are cool and well designed, and the game mixes a good variety of light and dark tones. I haven't seen an indie game in quite sometime that  has such a solid art design as this. It has no gimmicks and it serves no ultimate purpose to the gameplay. It's just beautiful.With all of this said, I hope to play future D-pad Studio games and enjoy them, taking the faults of Owlboy into consideration.			",136,15,3,9,4,0,7

												This game is a game that starts so well and I want to like it so badly but i just cannot. The graphics are really great they add so much to the game.The story starts really interestingly for first 30 minutes but it soon becomes really bad same with the characters at first you feel like this might be a platformer that has characters and story like monkey island but they soon lose their charm.I am on the last level of the game currently and I just want it to end and i have felt this way for most of my time in the gameThere are occasionally really great moment but they become more few and far between the more you play.Most of the game is ridiculously easy but there are some certain difficulty spikes at times that feel like they are there just to prolong the game. Some of the bosses get really annoying and certain platforming and puzzle sequences get frustrating. I dont play a lot of platform games so this might vary from person to person.I find the controls work well sometimes but when they dont work they really make you mad. They are quite clunky but there are parts where you need to jump, or do a prolonged jump or to jump and fly which all use the same button and it just doesnt work well often its hard to beat a platform difficulty spike area just because the controls are working against you.I think people review this game on how good it could have been rather than how good it actually is.Also in certain sections, usually around the difficulty spikes it makes you have to go through a cut scene type thing every time before u do the awkward bit. Yes you can mostly skip the cut scene but it takes time and it just prolongs the time it takes to get you back trying that part again.As well as that the cut scenes and dialoges often totally break the flow of the game.Overall I somewhat enjoyed some parts of the game but most of my play time I found either bored or frustrated.For me the price of this game is nonsensical. Steam price is 22.99 as of writhing this but it is in no way worth more than 4.99.I have played around 12 hours of this and probably enjoyed one or two of them. I do regret buying the game and i even more regret the time i put into it.Yes it could be great and yes at times it is great but for the most part in my opinion and experience it is not very good and way way way over priced. Dont believe the hype.			",691,145,11,150,122,4,268

												[UPDATED REVIEW: See below]after the long time i've been waiting for thisone I finally bought my copy of Owlboy and the game crashes constantly. I cannot pass the part after I wake up in my flat. I tried couple of times and it happens on the same part. I got this DRM song error and im really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about it. How can i get DRM error at all, Why sell game in countries which have DRM protection for it song playback. I would not recommend this game if you have DRM protected soundtrack for some countries and not the whole gameSong playback failed. Please verify that the song is not DRM protected. DRM protected songs are not supported for creator games.   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.MediaQueue.Play(Song song)at GameEvents.GameEventCreator.CreatePlayMusicWithTiming(EventCreationCache create, EventStringReader re)at GameEvents.GameEventCreator.LoadEvent(GameEventHandler eventHandler, EventStringReader re, String currentEvent, EventQueue existingQueue)at GameEvents.GameEventLoader.loadEvent(String eventName, String mapName)at GameEvents.GameEventCreator.AddEvent(String eventName)at GameEvents.GameEventCreator.CreateStartEvent(EventCreationCache create, EventStringReader re)at GameEvents.GameEventCreator.LoadEvent(GameEventHandler eventHandler, EventStringReader re, String currentEvent, EventQueue existingQueue)at GameEvents.GameEventLoader.loadEvent(String eventName, String mapName)at GameMovements.LevelCreator.LoadEvent(Level level, String eventName)at GameMovements.LevelCreator.LoadLevelIni(Level level, MainGameFrame gameFrame, ContentManager content, TextureSprite& hero, Option`1 levelData)at GameMovements.LevelCreator.LoadLevel(Level level, MainGameFrame gameFrame, ContentManager content, TextureSprite& hero, Option`1 levelData)at Screens.MainGameFrame.LoadContentMethod()[UPDATE 1] - I saw some other people having the same problem if you have turned off windows media player in Windows Features. They say turing windows meadia player feature on will solve the problem. gonna do that and play game a bit more and surely return with edit. not gonna refund the game becouse I need to play it :) [UPDATE 2] - I resolved crashing game problem, as i read about it and try it myself the result was no crashes at all during the game. Game runs perfectly some of the gamecontroller mappings are a bit strange. for me im using xbox360 controller and thos trigger bindings are annoying, buttons would work for that perfectly, I cant find any cons so im gonna just continue to explore this fantastic game <3 no sleep for me today <3			",29,8,0,1,1,1,0

												Owlboy has been a game that has been in development for 8 years. Now That I was given the chance to play it, I can say it was worth the wait but at the same time it was not. The game is about 7-8 hours, maybe less, but the story is enriched with characters and even a mute for a protaganist. The gameplay is minimal at best, and does not overwhelm you. As I am writing after beating the game, I recommend to those who like the stories from Studio Ghibli, legend of zelda exploration, and its simplistic gameplay.			",117,11,3,14,5,1,4

												What a beautiful game in every sense of the word.Before I sing its praises, I have to admit that I completely understand the criticims:- short game- some fairly annoying platforming due to the flying mechanism- the cut scenes taking the game out of your hands oftenWith that being said the positive aspects of the game are SO DAMN GOOD, that in my view they outweigh any potential negatives.  Reading other reviews, they've hit on the pros (art, sound, gameplay) so I won't beat that dead horse.  While I agree with superlative from the other reviews, for me, the thing that made this game an absolute classic was the feeling it gave me while playing.  The story was genuinely affecting, making me run the gamut of emotions, and feeling them right along side Otus.  Going through this adventure with my little Owl protagonistc just genuinely made me happy.  What a wonderful experience.			",173,51,0,21,17,1,10

												I'm nearly 5 hours in and the graphics continue to wow me, the controls take a bit to get used to at first, especially at the start/intro.Regarding combat: You're practically thrown headfirst into dealing with some basic enemies, but you are treated to a gradual learning curve by your own admission... without any tutorials about it. I can't explain it, you just seem to slide right on in and your own intuition takes over.This is NOT a bad thing as it's not too easy or too difficult to work out on your own, you may be defeated a few times and you'll actually eventually learn from your follies, but you won't give up through difficulty-rage; neither will you feel disappointed because it feels like a cakewalk... it feels JUSSST right so far.The enemy confrontations play out like a 360° bullethell/shooter game like Megaman at times but with amusing and rewarding twists... don't get me wrong though; the game isn't all about shooty-fighty-boom-boom. It has moments on par with other great story based 2D platformers as I mentioned and referenced in my previous status... and dare I say -- it sometimes shares the same kinds of humour and intriguement as Monkey Island and Final Fantasy respectively when you least expect it.The storyline is gripping so far, the music is somewhat forgettable but the characters are definitely not.It's crazy that this game took 9 years to develop, starting from 2007 and only released since the start of November this year - because of that, there is some frame lagging/refreshing when it comes to traversing wider parts of the world but only when houses are involved on screen... it's hardly a problem and doesn't ruin the experience, I'm very sure they will fix that in patches with time to come.

												While the core gameplay can be fun, it suffers from the developers and testers being too good at their own game and ramping up the difficulty (although it only took me two attempts at most to get through any area I had trouble with).This, however, is something I can forgive, but what I can't get passed is the fact that 90% of the NPC dialogue spoken to or about the main character is nasty or belittling, often being outright lies. This nasty dialogue is often unskippable, and is often long winded. If you had some way of reprimanding these NPCs, that would be fine, but they are characters that you're fighting to protect, and you have no way of interacting with them other than to talk to them to receive their scathing disapproval.All in all, it's a really demoralising experience, and I have no motivation to pick up the game and continue, knowing there's just going to be another tirade of nasty remarks coming my way despite completing objectives and defeating boss monsters successfully. It's such a nasty contradiction; play the game well and you're rewarded with mean and nasty people telling you you're worthless and useless. Consequently, I've sought a refund for this nasty waste of time.			",113,23,3,11,12,0,10

												Most of the time spent in this game involves sliding the character across every available surface to try and find invisible walls that have no tell. It is tedious and not fun. I played for 9 hours, then while sliding through a wall my character fell outside of the level. Now when I load it puts me back into a location I am not supposed to be that is blocked on both ends due to previous scripted events and I am completely blocked.Also towards the end of the game there is a minigame that involves memorization and intense precision, which are not skills that the rest of the game requires. It is completely out of place and frustrating, and performing this minigame perfectly is required to find all coins.			",50,14,0,9,1,0,4

												This game was enjoyable overall, but failed in very key areas that just undermined the whole experience for me.Do you know the saying, ""Show don't tell?"" I don't think the devs have, the storytelling is often very heavy handed, and the dialouge isn't very natural.The game is overall pretty easy, but the bosses present difficulty spikes that I didn't find enjoyable. I'm no stranger to difficulty, I play Dark Souls, but the bosses often felt repetitive and unrewarding.The biggest breaking point imo is the price. I beat the game in 6 hours, and that's with finding ~1600/2500(?) of the collectibles, and 2/3 of the big collectibles. If this game was priced at 15$ I fell like that would be more appropriate.

												I saw this game pop up on steam and youtube recently. It looked pretty good, but I never bothered to give it a go. Bored one day, I picked it up and gave it a whirl.And boy, what a whirl it was!Owlboy is a platforming/puzzle game with so much charm it hurts. I loved it from start to finish and I honestly can't think of any negitives about Owlboy.It has a nice story, a atmospheric and beautiful soundtrack, characters with boatloads of personality and a enviroment that looks so good, each screen is an absolute treat to the eyes. Controls are fluid and combat feels great.In terms of both it's structure and visuals, this reminds me a lot of Cave Story, a much loved game. If you like Cave Story, you'll like Owlboy too.While in Owlboy's story nothing particuarly blew me away, not even any reveals (that I won't spoil). There were some heartening scenes near the end which were lovely and I wish I could experience again, but I never really said ""OH SNAP!"". It was a pleasent ride regardless.Enough rambling. BUY IT ALREADY!			",152,37,3,23,15,3,15

												In the passing years since I’ve started writing about games, I have been loathe to refer to any of them as “charming”. It just feels like a cop-out adjective: something that could very easily be applied to any number of indie games that put a heavy focus on character, story, and a friendly or sometimes melancholy atmosphere. There have been a ton of clever, inviting indie games that have been released in the past decade, and an endless stream of them could use that forbidden adjective. Shovel Knight, Firewatch, Minecraft, Spelunky: the list goes on and on. “Charming” just sounds simultaneously lazy and condescending, and I’ve tried to avoid it.But here today, I am forced to use that word when it comes to Owlboy. Because no other word encapsulates the feeling I get from D-Pad Studios’ indie platformer better than that troublesome little moniker, so let’s just get right into it, shall we?Owlboy is charming.

												Instead of waiting for the game to go on a 50%+ sale like I do with most new titles, I went ahead and bought it when their team was doing the Reddit AMA (Xmas sale 20% off right now!), to support this indy title. So far... Man, it's worth it.Haven't spent much time on it yet, but the polish is amazing. This is what the other kids must feel when they played Zelda the first time. The music, visuals and attention to little details make you feel like Owlboy is off on an epic adventure in a beautiful world. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most beautiful games I've seen in a while (relatively haha). But really, as a fanboy of the Gameboy era handhelds, this is something that hits me right where it should. Really simple game which is just enjoyable throughout. I've played more than what my steam profile may says, and I've enjoyed every aspect from the music to the graphics,, to the gameplay. Its more of an experience than a skill based game, I'd say play it with a controller for a better experience.			",157,54,1,9,12,1,17

												It's too easy. Just way too easy. That's a big problem for me and I just wanted to get that dissenting opinion out there since I haven't seen much posted about it in other reviews.Additional problems I have with this game are that there are just too many things that slow the pacing down to a crawl. From the sleepy story, to the unchallenging gameplay, to the poor level design with required backtracking to solve ""puzzles"" I feel like this was more of a time sink than a game.Artwork, Music, Controls all get an A plus. Maybe even an A plus plus if your into this particular style.Gameplay, Exploration, World-building, Fun Factor and everything else are lackluster and I would say D is about the best grade they could possibly worth.For me this is going straight to the overhyped indie garbage pile along with Undertale, Cave Quest, and  Five Nights at Freddy's.

												This game looks very, very pretty.Pretty much every other aspect of it fails. The story is VERY weak, and pretty much drops the ball in trying to make the world around you feel fleshed out and interesting. The game plays a lot like a simplistic Zelda, and ends roughly at the story point in which Zelda games go to their second half. The gameplay is very superficial, and mostly involves spamming your dash a whole lot to make the game move faster, along with shooting unsatisfying weapons. The game also loves to wrestle control away from the player in order to force him to go through ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogues and cutscenes.I finished this game and was shocked at just how little there was to it. That 6 hour completion time is misleading, as I had to restart around halfway through, having lost my save the first time around.I do not recommend this game, as it's extremely overrated.

												TLDR; pretty, frustrating, bland and inoffensive.This is a game where every platformer trope has been taken wholesale and cobbled together in an inoffensive and cliched manner with the single exception that the main character can fly. There was never a question of ""should we put boss fights in the game?"", the question for Owlboy was ""how many can we cram in there?"". A boss fight has never been fun in a video game it wasn't fun doing the same fight 20 times in the 90s it's still not fun now.Also: collect all the coins to unlock all of the upgrades? Hunting for coins behind secret walls is not a suitable replacement for content. I did not get all of the upgrades because the game was already frustrating, and the game was made all the more frustrating for not having the unlocks they provided.The controls are frustrating at times, the dodge button cannot be pressed at the same time as aiming, leading to a lot of frustrating clusterf**ks with many trivial (and they are almost always trivial) enemies on screen and you having to devote your thumbs to either killing them, getting hit a lot in the process, or dodging their attacks. The inability to do both left the game feeling clumsy and poorly thought out.Another bugbear with controls is that there is a dash button that makes travelling through the spacious game MUCH faster. So I played this game constantly mashing B just so I could get through it quicker. There's no excuse for this, it's just dumb game design.There's also the matter of the few scenes where the game requires a lot of precision for platforming sections where your flying ability has been hampered. These sections would benefit greatly from having fine control and precise input, alas if you have a controller plugged into your computer at all you cannot use the keyboard because for some reason it disables the jump key. Bizarre.There's also no fine control. So you are better off using the DPad rather than a joystick most of the time. If the joystick is a little left, it's the same as pushing it all the way to the left. Stupid.The story is middling. Standard ""bad guy wants to end the world because reasons"" tropes abound. The characters are distinctly individual but I found very little reason to actually care about them.The protagonist is mute because all protagonists are mute. Nothing new to see here apart from the bullying the main character gets for it.At many points in the story I got very lost, owing mostly to previously completed level sections being explorable again without any warning that you've been there before. By the time I realised I had already explored that section days before (and forgotten because it all looks the same) it was another 10 minutes of mashing the dash button just to get back to where I started.The art style is absolutely lovely and it's obvious a lot of man-hours went into it; if the devs had spent as much time on having a vision for their game and sticking to it rather than making concessions for every man and his dog then they might have created something really special.As it is, I can't recommend Owlboy as anything other than a very pretty, thoroughly samey platformer that will appeal to no-one and offend no-one.

												Pros - Most beautiful visual pixel art I have ever seen in a video game. Ever. Period. This is almost something thats undebatable for me.Hand crafted. Every inch. Beautiful characters, comedy, love, easy to fall for. Cons - Easy. Casual Audience. Lackluster puzzles that are more repetition + add more of something instead of creatively challenging the player. Like it wants to be zelda but struggles to warm up the fire. Overall, appeals to a very wide audience, I don't honestly think it's worth the price tag. At all.... sorry... 9 years or not, the quality is high but the content offered doensn't reflect the high price tag. Other platformers/metroidvania style games offer much more at a lower price tag.

												This game was 10 years in the making and it looks gorgeous. The pixel artwork is fantastic and they took great pains in animating all the stuff. Absolutely phenomenal artwork. But sadly artwork does not simply sell a game. This game has done nothing innovative in terms of gameplay. The gimmick here is that it is a platformer but you can fly. The main character can fly and has a spin attack and a dash attack which I think was only useful to break some walls. You can carry your pals one who has a shotgun and can burn things,the other who has a gun which shoots pellets and the third who has kind of a websling. You get these pals are various stages of this 8-10 hour game. So they basically shoot for you and the controls use the mouse to shoot,WSAD for movement and double pressing W makes you fly. The level design is average at the most with you mostly shooting enemies and solving very trivial puzzles which involve button pushing for the most and nothing else. This is the most uninspiring gameplay I have ever seen. It is not fluid at all and the main character moves so slowly. It becomes a pain navigating the levels with such a slow character. The levels are also dungeon like so there are celings to stop you and there is not much use of the vertical flexibility that could have been achieved. The boss fights are very simple with very easy to figure out patterns. The last    boss gave me some trouble but I finished that in 3 tries after figuring the pattern. I generally do not care about a game story and completely ignored that one but you can talk to folks and figure out whats happening. I found the cutscenes very annoying and they sometimes popped up randomly which was very annoying. Also there is a level the last one which is very annoying as they do not ley you fly and it is absolutely the worst level designed and is completely against the flow of the game. I would not recommend this game. it was an absolutely chore to play with nothing innovative in the gameplay and a very slow moving character. Also the character switching is clunky where you can get the pal you want to use teleported to you. Absolutely boring gameplay.			",116,36,4,1,1,0,7

It's far too easy, and I don't need what I need to do next explained to me in greater detail than War and Peace. You get to play for about ten minutes, and then you have to sit through about ten minutes of dialogue without fail. They keep stopping the gameplay for a very bland and uninteresting story. Tell your story through gameplay. Sorry, I was excited for this, but I would not recommend it.			",59,13,0,4,0,0,1

												This game has pixel art that is just below the top tier. It's really fantastic to behold.Sadly, the game has almost nothing else going for it. The story is mediocre. The levels are poorly designed. The controls are significantly flawed. Even really basic things like screen scrolling are really bad in many places. It makes so many basic game design mistakes.It's really disappointing. If they had spent a bit more time polishing the rought spots and maybe adding a few more levels, it could have been a fantastic game. Instead it's just a sad platforming action game that often makes you want to throw your controller against the wall like the old days.			",168,59,1,23,17,2,36

												Horrible endgame. Player spent the whole game playing a flying platformer, but the ability of flight is taken away during endgame, during which the game is a gimped jump platformer. Since the UP key is used to transition from jump to flight during regular game, if somehow game detects player press UP during endgame jump, the jump is cut short. This makes analog control impossible. Only 2 major mechanics progression during the game (when acquiring new allies). Player is required to use the same ally to do damange for most of the game, as the other ally's attack is cooldown based. Boss does get harder, however due to lack of abilities, the harder bosses plays like a crappy fighting game, where invulnable frames matter. No map travel, making doing achievements/collections a pain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this one - the visuals, music, and quirky characters are all done fantastically well, and D-pad absolutely deserves a ton of credit for creating them with their limited resources. Unfortunately, while I'd say this game's 9 years of development were well-spent on those aspects, the gameplay desperately needed more attention. It's great for about the first quarter of the game, but starts relying on weaker mechanics after that for the sake of variety. I'd still have recommended it if not for the last stage of the game, which robs you of both flight and your friend's abilities in order to force some god-awful platforming sections on you. Owlboy's controls weren't meant for platforming, and this section makes that painfully clear. It killed the game for me.			",326,88,11,64,30,1,57

												i had immediate crashes immediately after leaving owlboy's house but re-enabling windows media player via programs and features > turn windows options on and off > media features > windows media player solved it.to the commenters complaining about me not sending a bug report: if the bug reporting in the game actually worked i would've sent one---the bug report thing in the game seems to have lots of pertinent information for debugging but unfortunately i couldn't interact with it due to another bug occurring from having a controller plugged in.  issues that prevent you from being able to progress more than 5 minutes into the game are worth being brought up to people thinking of buying a game when it just came out.  you'd be irritated preordering a game and having it not work at all on a brand new computer you just bought.  i'm glad the devs are working on it and i am absolutely not the only person who disables unwanted services and programs on their computer.it's a fantastic game.  the artwork/animation is incredible.  i've heard people complain about the writing being childish for whatever reason and i don't understand it----it has a ton of charm and hits quite close to home for me.  the music is phenomenal.  the gameplay is a little bit weird to get into but i warmed up to it by the time i made it up to the owl temple.  i'm sure the design and difficulty of the ""dungeons"" and whatnot will improve as the game progresses.  it's different for sure and is worth checking out and i will definitely update this review once i have time to progress further.i definitely hope the patches will improve the stability of the game because from what i've played so far it's pretty great.

												Owlboy is the worst kind of bad game- a game I had high hopes for; a game which had so much potential that it shines through even the crud that is its final form.Let's go back a step though- what does Owlboy do right? From the very first trailer I and almost everyone else who saw it was enchanted by the visuals, art style, and music. That part still holds. Retro art is ironically old now, but it's done well here unlike in some indie games, and the music is strong enough that I bought a few tracks from the OST on the composer's website. The thing is, Owlboy never really goes beyond that.The Combat is incredibly barebones. Owlboy lifts up to 3 partners, which basically means 3 different guns you can freely switch between unless the partner is missing for story reasons. These get 1 minor upgrade each over the course of the game, and are otherwise unchanged. Enemy selection is very limited, with 1-2 types in each area. Thankfully, the boss fights at the end of each area are a bit imaginative and mix things up, but that's just not enough variety and challenge. You do not gain any extra movement abilities or powers beyond the guns (which unlock slowly over the course of the story).Let's talk about the Rings. I hope I wasn't the only one getting serious Superman 64 vibes from that part of the trailer. Owlboy can fly around opening chests to get coins, or fly through rings to get coins. This isn't currency, though. Think of them more like Feathers in Assassin's Creed. They're collectibles and they unlock things in a ""shop"". The quotation marks are because you can't choose what to unlock, they simply unlock automatically at certain coin thresholds, in a linear order. These are mostly cosmetic changes for Owlboy (content padding) with the 3 minor upgrades for your weapons mixed in. The whole thing reeks of unfinished features and playtime padding, which is kind of sad for a game that took 10 years to develop, regardless of the dev team size.The worst part of the game is the Level Design. The devs simply went full retro with these. Owlboy levels rival the worst of nonsensical NES level designs with nonsensical layouts that aren't very interesting to play through. I cannot describe the disappointment I felt when I entered the second major dungeon area- apparently a bunch of samey looking steel girder grafted to literal clouds, which formed a maze on the way to a major bad guy airship. The idea that some reviewers have described Owlboy as a Metroivania is a joke. There's no exploration here; routes are 90% linear and the only thing that can be missed are small hidden alcoves with extra chests and floating rings.In summary, just stay away. Watch the trailer again to experience a quick sense of wonder, without having it spoiled by actually playing the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Owlboy has beautiful pixel graphics.  The first level of the game (the demo) is polished to a mirror shine.  Each progressive level thereafter is worse and less enjoyable to play.  Each game mechanic introduced after the first level is clunkier and looser.This is an excellent demo with a lazy, boring, clunky game tacked on to the back of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want your control input to be taken away every two minutes, then this is the game for you! If not, look the other way. The game is continuosly stoping you, so you are forced to read and read tons of lines of text as your thumb numbs for the constant botton pressing that you are going to find yourself into due to the desperate attempt to skip the story. So far, for me this game has been a long story in which I do nothing, interrumpted once in a while with these amazing platform and puzzle gameplay mechanics that I haven't been able to fully enjoy due to the endless ""ah! c'mon! another story snippet???! just let me play this game already!"". So... as subjective as it sounds, I feel the percentage of actual gameplay is way too minimal and I´m having a very hard time to enjoy this game. That being said, graphics are amazing and yes, nostalgia breaks your hearth in two. PEACE!			",74,7,2,6,1,0,6

Posted: November 8, 2016
												Owlboy is a game with wonderful visuals and music that took a long time to make that is utterly mediocre and not really worth your time. (Note: this review does contain slight spoilers)Let’s talk about the positives. The visuals are fantastic. Some real top notch pixel art. Save for some questionable art direction (ie the red flash from the shotgun attack, lack of some button UI), the art is some of the best modern pixel art you’ll ever see. Characters are detailed and full of expression. Background are beautiful and have a real sense of depth.The music is wonderful. It’s pretty typical video game-y adventure music, but it’s well orchestrated and there wasn’t a single track that felt was overly repetitive or annoying. The writing; aka the plot, dialogue, flavor text, is all serviceable and generally inoffensive. There are some genuinely touching moments and a decent little plot twist. However the ending feels like a non-ending that essentially amounts to generic time-travel related trope that we’ve seen done better in games. The character’s motivation towards the end of the game are forced and it, excuse the pun, it doesn’t land on its feet. Unfortunately the gameplay is the weakest part of this game. This game is riddled with a lack of polish that prevents it from having a good feel to it. You cannot remap the buttons for either gamepad or keyboard/mouse (I highly recommend you never attempt to play this game using keyboard/mouse as those controls are inexcusably awful.) The level design often demands a level of precision that the controls do not allow for. Example: You roll with the B (Circle), but aim with the Right Stick. Sometimes you’ll need to roll to avoid an attack while aiming, but can’t remove your thumb from the right stick fast enough. There are stealth sections that are either tedious or outright terrible. These are often poor with sensible checkpoints and any small screw up results in near instant failure. There are at least 3 of these throughout the game with the last one being essentially a whole dungeon. At least you can fly in that last one. The main gimmick of this game is that the player can fly. It’s not an original idea by any means. Games like Aquaria, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, and others have done similar things, but it’s still uncommon enough to be novel. However there are multiple points in this game where they take away the one unique thing about it and the results vary. The waterfall sections feel fine. In them you can only jump. The jump is super floaty unlike most other games and takes while to get used to, but those sections are usually very short. A single room or a bit more. You can’t attack other than the little spin attack that does no damage, but combat is usually avoidable or nonexistent in those sections. They’re actually nicely done. It’s the other times that are extremely questionable. There’s an early stealth section that’s pretty bad but the worst offender is the last area. There you can only fly for a little bit during it. Doing so will cancel all vertical momentum and slow you considerable. This would be fine if flying wasn’t so easy to trigger accidentally. By simply tapping up or jump again while in the air you’ll start flying. For most of the game this is great. You can just hold up and fly around. It feels expected, especially when using the analog stick. However, in that last section, if you start flying when you don’t expect to you’ll likely fall into an instant death trap. This causes you to countlessly restart what should be an fairly straightforward platforming section not because of your own inability, but due to unexpected control issues. It felt like an awful Mario Maker level.This sort of one-off mechanic that doesn’t quite feel right or is straight up bad is very common throughout the game. There’s a dungeon where everything is dark and you only have a very small radius of light. You have to navigate tight tunnels edged with spikes, but the controls are floaty and the spikes too easy to clip into. Often it doesn’t look like you should have hit them. Later on you’re riding a giant lava snake and moving it up and down to avoid obstacles, but the screen is constantly rotating and it just feels wonky and awful instead of super cool like it should have. There’s not a single area of this game where I could say “Man! That was a really well done and fun!”Combat in this game is, like so much else, lackluster. It’s boring, slow, and often times unavoidable since enemies will chase you until you’re dead. Boss battles are much the same (expect for the final boss which is actually pretty well done! Though they do make you do it three times). Typical bosses have either a safe area (generally towards the top of the screen) or a simple strategy that makes them a complete non-issue.Ultimately, I feel like the developers would have better spent their time making a bunch of small games instead of trying to prefect this game. They did not succeed. So much of its issues scream inexperience and stubbornness. Had this game come out a year or two after they had started working on it, it would have been a flawed but alright game that they could have built from. As it stands now, it’s a flawed game that does not live up to expectations. If you want to play game with beautiful pixel art that took 8+ years to make then go play AM2R instead. Owlboy is just not worth your time.			",266,92,3,43,23,2,21

												Boring, uninspired, unpolished.It's absolutely riddled with design issues that affect diffulty unfairly.  The health and checkpoint mechanics are so poorly thought out I frequently thought, ""I might as well die here once so I can get all my health back.""I gave up 7 hours in beacuse of a timed challenge where, if you die, there are an extra 3 minutes of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to do to get back to the timed challenge.They're charging $25 for a game with great visuals, but zero skill in game design.

												So... I almost finish the game and getting bored.Actually, I was getting bored from the beginning.My playtime is about 30 hours just because I pause the game and leave it be while I'm doing  more interesting activities like shopping, eating, sleeping which I usually don't care to do when I am playing good game.That means this is very boring game.I think it shouldn't be called as game.I would call it a nice pixel art book.I would recommend this... software if it was sold as the art book.But since it claims itself a game, it doesn't earn my recommendation.Controls are bad, actions and puzzle are boring, story is also boring. The only thing this thing is good at is showing a nice hand-drawing pixel art which reminds me of good old snes.			",75,6,0,9,9,0,0

												Pros: Very nice graphics, animations fluid and a lot of care was taken to give personality to NPCs and player characters. Music is fantastic. Little penguin guys are funny. The story is a bit sentimental at times, especially the ending. You want Otus to win!Cons: Not a lot of content, especially considering the price. They could have done a lot with character progression, or even secret doors placed throughout the world - why are there so few? Not at all challenging - you can easily finish in 8 hours. Controls can be wonky sometimes if you are trying to drop a teammate and pickup something off the ground. Upgrades almost meaningless, so not a lot of incentive to collect coins.In sum, I wanted to like this game but ended up disappointed. Games like Momodora, Axiom Verge, or Salt and Sanctuary are of the similar Metroidvania style but offer twice the gameplay with creative mechanics and deeper plots (at half the price). I don't think Owlboy was a very memorable expereince (besides the graphics and sound) and I wouldn't play it again.			",80,21,1,13,19,0,5

												This game is good if you are expecting a ridiculously low amount of gametime for a decent chunk of cash. 9 Years fooled me into thinking the game would have a decent amount of content but alas, even going slow it took me just 8 hours to complete the story - and I was afk for about 1 hour. The gameplay is nothing fantastic, the puzzles are laughably simple and calling it an open-world game is ridiculous, the linearity is unescapable. The one part where the game kind of shined is the story, the main reason I carried on playing was that the story was intruiging, until the end where it ends insanely abruptly after the easiest final boss to exist. I did want this game to be good and I would probably would have liked it a whole lot more if... well if the was a whole lot more. TL;DR ; Dont buy this game for outstanding gameplay or a lot of content - just buy it if you want an OK story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the game starts on a really high note, pretty neat flight mechanics and the partners you find add brilliantly to the gameplay...then it ends, in a terrible, underwhelming, super quick and underdeveloped ending.the story at some point felt like it would go places, but in the end it fell right back into a lukewarm cliché.a great start for a game that could be great, but ends up feeling like a demo.particularly the last part is a complete disaster as it even removes from you the best mechanics of the game for way too long... then it gives you back the ability to fly without even explaining why.definitely check it out if you want to spend 4 or 5 hours in an afternoon once the price drops below 5 or so, I strongly disencourage you to pay anything more than that for this game.

												TL; DR: Good game, but the pricetag is a way too high. Steam won't let me post without giving it a thumbs up/down, so thumbs down because I didn't really enjoy the game, the price is too high, and the average score is too high.Virtually everything about Owlboy is good. The art, music, gameplay, presentation, and writing are all well done. It's clear that a ton of love and effort has gone into the game. Like anything, there are a few rough spots here and there (the platforming in one of the final areas was particularly frustrating) but overall, each part of the game is great. That said, I can't really say that I loved the game. For whatever reason, the whole never really came together as something greater than the sum of its parts (despite those parts all being individually decent). The gameplay is decent enough, but it wasn't quite mechanically engaging enough to pull me along. The checkpoint system is incredibly forgiving, so there isn't really any challenge. The whole idea of having companions never really plays out to be more than just having different weapons equipped, which feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. On top of that, the puzzles aren't very mind-bending nor the gameplay particularly exciting. Likewise with the story and characters. They were interesting enough, but I usually didn't really feel super interested in what was around the next corner. The music was uniformly well composed and performed, but often felt out of place. The world is very pretty and well-connected, but there isn't really enough going on to encourage a ton of exploration. Ultimately, it feels like you end up with the worst parts of a Metroidvania game (excessive backtracking through areas) without the good ones (the feeling of excitement to use a new skill/ability to open new areas and find secrets). I realize the game isn't necessarily meant to be a Metroidvania, but the style of the world is reminiscent of one.All that said, the quality of the individual components of the game gives it a bit of charm that settled in by the end of the 8-10 hours I spent with it. I can't give it an outright recommendation because of the price and the lack of cohesive greatness, but it is by no means bad.Edit: The more I've been thinking about it, I just didn't really find the game to be fun. Plain and simple. And because none of the other elements really stuck out to me as being really exceptional, I wasn't left with a great impression overall. If you find the game fun, I think it will feel really, really great but I didn't because the gameplay didn't really grab me.Edit 2: Fixed TLDR for people who can't read good.

												Do not buy this game. It doesn't know what it wants to be it looks like a Metroid game, but has no interesting power ups, it has aspects of a shooter but all the guns are not fun to use, it has aspects of a platformer but the controls dont work reliably enough to be fun, traveling isn't fun combat isn't fun, the story also not fun. You are constantly as to go to A, how do you get there... ♥♥♥♥ IF I KNOW! No map, and ambigous signs, greeeeat, hey you got a shotgun, that should be cool, oh it reloads so slowly that it has no value in actual combat, perfect. They give you knew mechanics, do they explain any of it, noooope. There are relics you can find all over the map, do they give you a map or a fast-travel to 1. Know where they are at, or 2. Not get lost in butt ♥♥♥♥ city while you are there nope. So yeeeeeaaaah, I was literally 2 bosses away from the end said: ""♥♥♥♥ IT!"" and I put it into a steam category that I have titled: ""Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself"" I hope this review helps, anyone save moeny and ....PS: It does look pretty and have great music.

												I'm probably going to get blasted for this, but this is perhaps the most boring game I have played in 2016 and many years before. Gone Home is equivalent to how bored I was in Owlboy. In fact I went to bed the night after I played it, woke up, then went the ENTIRE NEXT DAY before I remembered ""oh yeah I played Owlboy didn't I, I should refund it."" It was that forgettable. I have never played a game I literally forgot the next morning; they're either too good or too bad. This one was just too mediocre.""But you only played for 47 minutes!"" True! To which I defend myself by saying I went to a friend's house for the weekend and observed as he played it there, since he told me to buy it. At no point did I think ""I should buy the game again."" The gameplay is generic, the levels are generic, the story tries and fails to be meaningful, and the only redeeming quality are the graphics. It pains me that such cool graphics are in a game so utterly boring as this one.I'm also annoyed at some reviews claiming this is the best platformer of 2016. You spend a majority of your time FLYING, which means you CAN'T PLATFORM. Child of Light had this issue. This game is not a platformer, and it barely qualifies as a puzzle game since the puzzles are laughable.I don't want to say I didn't stay for the ending... Instead I'll say I couldn't stay around for the ending.			",176,27,5,20,16,0,18

												Absolutely loved the first half of this game, but in its second half it becomes a painful reminder that there just isn't a lot of love for the casual gamer by the gaming industry.  The difficulty/tedium level increases exponentially, to the point where I finally gave up for good after probably 40+ attempts at completing one of the last segments of the game.  I know I'm in a minority wanting games to be easier, but some of us don't have the time or patience for games that feel more like work than play, and it would not be difficult for developers to include a ""story mode"" that lets us wimpy gamers bypass the tough scenes if we want to.  I enjoy the story, characters and artwork of this game, but don't enjoy the type of gaming that has you repeating segments ad nauseum to learn the choreography of precision timing scenes.

												I really wanted to like this game. I remember loving The Legend of Zelda and Metroid and I hoped it would be a similar experience, but it’s not. In my opinion, Owlboy barely qualifies as a game. It feels more like an interactive story that leads you around by the nose through various set pieces. I’m about half-way through and there's been no more than one or two fun scenes. It’s too easy –as an example, it’s almost impossible to take a wrong turn. When you’re finished with an area the game often literally closes a door behind you as if to say there's nothing you missed, just keep moving – way to kill the mystery. The puzzles are simple and the clues to solving them are telegraphed. The retro Art and Music are great but the gameplay is boring.			",13,13,0,0,2,0,4

												Good PLATFORMER. Really good: all 2-D progression, interesting but kind of obvious puzzles, smash-your-fingers bosses. But the fact that is  a platformer has been subtly disguised or is at all absent in the game description. If you are  looking for a game that requires you to perfect-time pressing 5 keys in a second, this game is for you. If you are looking to ""live a sweet and tender adventure"" that the game description proclaims without getting your nails to hurt, then you should probably look somewhere else.			",7,2,0,3,1,0,0

												The story was lackluster and poorly written. Molstrom just dies without you ever fighting him, despite being the ultimate war machine built by the Owls, and Solus never confides into Otus his reasoning for using the relics, despite saying that he considered Otus to be his only friend. There were too many unnecessary, irrelevant things to the story that were communicated while tons of other more pertinent questions to the story were left unanswered. For example, what does the engraved stone with the Roman numerals on it mean? Why are there plants overgrowing in some areas, and how did no one realize that they broke the wind machine in the Owl Temple? Who wrote the Book of Nocteus, and why was it prophetic?There may be more to the end of the universe, but this story did not do a good job of convincing me that there is.I could go on about the oversight in game mechanics, but I feel as though they pale in comparison to the lack of effort put into the story.However, I will say that this game is beautiful. There were many times that I was just awestruck by the detail put into it. I can't reasonably put my enamorment into words, but the art alone made this game worth it to me.I would not recommend this game, though, because I believe great games have great stories. This, sadly, was not one of them.(EDIT FOR CLARITY—11/5/2016):I have taken the spoiler tag off not to spite anyone here, but to more easily make it understood how incomplete the story is.The authors attempted to create many twists within the story, only to neuter it by creating major flaws in the character arcs of Solus, Molstrom, and the unknown Book of Nocteus author. Taste is subjective, but the story is not written well on an objective level, and I had to create an argument with apropos evidence by stating such a thing.A game with a good story should allow you to get immersed and lost within it. This game does everything within its power to prevent this, from the complete and utter destruction of Advent after Anne says to come by her house in Advent to learn more about her, to the lack of historical explanation of the Owl race. This game goes out of its way to make the story undigestible.This will be my last update, as the story of this game is not worth discussing further.https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810My review is not against steam rules, and you are not required to read reviews before purchasing this game.Should you find anger after reading my review, then I suggest you reevaluate why you sought out reviews in the first place.

												Really enjoyed this game. The art is incredibly detailed and the music is very enjoyable to listen to. The gameplay has a unique feel to it and varries throught the game. The control scheme feels a bit strange, but I think it adds to the experience as learning to control Otus feels like learning a new skill. As Otus became more confident in his skills in the story I became more confident in controlling his character.			",96,24,1,15,7,2,9

												Owlboy was a fun, highly enjoyable game.  The graphics and music were well made and a perfect throw back to the 16 bit era.  The characters were fun and interesting, and provided depth to the world.  Gameplay was fun and enjoyable.  The game was overall average difficulty and can be completed in about 4-6 hours depending on how fast you want to rush through.  It's a pretty linear game, with extra trinkets to find, but not necessary to complete the game.  For those complaining about the price, I'd say either wait for a sale or it's not the game for you.  If this was an older time, this game would have been a full retail priced game on the snes or genesis, and people still would have enjoyed it.			",486,201,5,97,60,5,59

												It could be said that this game is short. Another could find that that the collecting is somewhat tough to go through. A lot of people also were having a hard time grasping exactly what story the creator was going for at the very end.At the moment I began to explore the world, every second I spent going through every inch of this game begging for another reason to stay just a little longer to discover more, and even many hours after 100% the entirety of the game, I wish that I could spread my love for this game with every breath I take. I gladly spent those beloved hours captivated by how this game felt and how it made me feel. That feeling is something rare and precious. It is not perfect as just a game, but I pray there is more content to look forward to.If anyone reads this looking for a reason to play it, I want you to just take my word and buy it. You'll wish you could pay more for it. It also, like many thing, is a personal experience you want to go into with as little exposure as you can.			",335,40,1,32,20,2,23

												Was very conflicted about this one, because I played the worst part of the game right before ending it.Good:* Awesome soundtrack.* Fun dungeons.* Godly artstyle.* Interesting story.* Huge overworld + endless flying (seriously, I get more enjoyement just out of flying around it than I get from entirety of some other games).Bad:* BOGUIN CHALLENGE (It's so bad I wrote a script that completes it for me. Why put a reflex challenge THAT HARD in a game that has oherwise fairly balanced difficulty?)* No fast travel (The world is huge, so It would be great to be able to travel from some places to the others. It's not that big of a deal, as it allows to feel the hugeness of the world, but still...)* Boguin challenge. * Tone shifts (sometimes the game goes from cute to grimdark in 10 seconds and it's disturbing).* Boguin challenge.Technically Boguin Challenge takes 30 sec. to complete (although I spent about 4h on it), so 99.9% of the game if awesome and 0.1% is my personal hell.

												It's a lovely game with wonderful pixel art and a touching story with some good humour as well. I enjoyed it a lot but would have been grateful for some in-game map and the ability to ""teleport"" to areas directly - at least after finishing the story (for collecting all coins). It's a pretty large world and searching stuff after the main story got a bit tedious. The controls (I played with a X-Box controller) are good but not perfect. The levels are quite diverse with some rather difficult parts but they are well thought out and never so long as to get frustrating (even when needing several attempts). Overall I think difficulty is very well balanced. I spent 12 hours with Owlboy and can heartily recommend it. It's a game made with a lot of care and love and it shows.			",528,153,13,38,36,4,56

												This review was written by a friend who finished the game on another account:It's been quite some time since I've come across a game with the sheer charm and personality Owlboy has achieved. The Backstory of Otus the main character has depth and gives them relatability and meaning. Otus isn't infallible and relys on the support of his friends. Being mute did not stop me from connecting to Otus, since we get a sense of his feelings and traits through the eyes of the other well fleshed out characters, his well animated gestures and animations (particularly his facial expresions). I could connect to the story though the atmospheric music, ambience and well animated reactions of the characters to the events going on around them. That connection made me care when lives were lost and characters I got to know were hurt or betrayed throughout the progression of the story. The 10 hours (approximately) story keep me engrossed and through the varied artwork, characters/character animation, made it well like I was playing through an interactive movie. Well worth considering the time and money to invest in this well concieved adventure. ",181,40,3,14,19,1,25

												The music and art are 10/10, I love the atmosphere.The gameplay itself is decent, the boss fights are really good. I like that the boss fights aren't just a ""shoot until dead"" kind of thing, they incorporate the terrain and different items for each boss. The rest of the dungeons are good too, but don't really stand out to me. I think they hit the mark with the difficulty level.			",46,6,0,8,5,0,0

												This is an indie platformer. Do you want one of those? If the answer is yes, then you should buy this game. It took me 15 hours to do everything. + Amazing Art+ Solid Story+ Gameplay is solid (Don't expect anything revolutionary) - Cost a good bit for a short game with little replay (This doesn't bother me, but I know this is important to a lot of people)It's just a cute little game.

												What seemed to be just a little indie game with over 9 years of development, Owlboy is an adventure to behold. I finished this game two days after the game had released. Why? I absolutely fell in love with the game. There's a lot of things that really hold this game and make you just want more. While there are many MANY good things about this game. There are, however some spots I really was disappointed in. Now I won't be spoiling the whole ordeal on what I am talking about, but I will make reference to it so this review does HAVE SPOILERS AT THE END OF THE REVIEW ON ITS OWN SECTION BUT IT WILL BE SPOILER FREE!!!Owlboy is an Indie adventure game where you control Otus, a mute Owl who apparently has a lot on his shoulders when things don't really go his way. He and his friend Geddy are tasked with watch over their village when a huge group of bandits known as the Pirates invade, taking an Owl relic that is stored in the village. And off we go on our adventure to get that back and stop the Pirates and their plans. One of the first things I've noticed in game is the presentation along with the soundtrack. Holy crap this game has detail in its animations. Props to the devs and animators for a very polished game. The scenery looks beautiful and it sets the mood in the beginning as a light-hearted adventure. Otus himself is a mute, but the amount of detail in his responses, whether he is twiddling his thumbs when he's nervous, he covers himself with his cloak when he's sad, its all there and I wasn't expecting how I would feel for the poor guy. One effect though I had with the looks of the game were at some points, textures didn't spawn (which were resolved by resetting the game) and there are some weird bugs like if you eat a healing item and get hurt at the same time, it produces some weird result. Nothing gamebreaking, but I think that needs to be addressed.Speaking of feeling, this game can really tug on your heartstrings. You can get attached to these characters and then suddenly the feel train will hit you. I remembered that I at least teared up or even flat out cried at some sections because what was happening and how I didn't want bonds or spirits to break from the main cast. This story is very well done and the pace is very fluent. There weren't times I wanted to put down the game because I was just done. No, like I said before, I wanted more. When it finally ended, I was pleased with what I got. The game's difficulty isn't that bad either. It's very easy to get into and the game will test your knowledge of when to use certain partners, There are some hard spots, but it isn't too bad.Now lets talk about that gameplay huh? So Otus, as a mute owl, he really can't attack. He can stun people with is little spin, but thats all he can really do other than his little dash (which I'll get to in a minute). So the game pairs you up at first with your best friend Geddy, Geddy has a gun, which Otus can carry him and he can fire at enemies. This is an interesting mechanic as you need to manage having your partner on you while also dodging enemies, solving puzzles. The whole game would be a boring cake walk if Otus can attack. Because of this, there are special sections were Otus is alone and he has to sneak past enemies. There are a number of stealth sections in this game and they are handled pretty well. I never got bored of them as they went by pretty fast. Not to mention you have a great source of movement. Oh my god the movement. I mentioned Otus can dash either in the air or on the ground. As a speedrunner, I absolutely love games with amazing movement, and Owlboy is no exception. Sure there are a lot of times I spammed the dash to get point A to point B in a timely manner, but I never felt rushed. The regular flight speed that Otus has is very optimal. At no times when I was exploring a dungeon that I needed to move around by dashing, only when I needed to backtrack or dodge incoming fire. There is even an upgrade you get that makes your movement even better so that in the later parts in the game when you have more freedom to backtrack and collect any of the game's currency to buy the extra goodies. Overall, the game is a gem. It was worth the wait of 9 years of development and polish. I didn't hear about this game until youtuber VideoGameDunkey where he had said he had a really good feeling about this game. I looked into it, and gave a lot of hope. Owlboy is a must play if you like adventureous games with a story that really likes to hit your soft spots. I absolutely loved it and am looking forward to speedrun this game!Owlboy gets a 9.5 out of 10 for me. ~LuckPercentSRL---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPOILER SECTION! SPOILER SECTION! SPOILER SECTION! READ IF YOU WANTSo with all the praise I just gave this game. Why did I give it a 9.5? There are two small disappointments I had with the game's story.So at the end, it appears that Otus had fallen because he activated the anti-hex to save the world. In the end, we get this little section of him talking to all his village friends and they appear to be happy, saying bye sort of feeling, like a memory sequence. We find his teacher at the end who explains some things and where he is. Then it ends and we see him falling from space to.....his death? Is he alive? I'm not sure. It looked like he was dead initally, but his master say the realm he is in gives him a section chance? And then we see him falling from space so is he still alive? Arrrg! I just wanted to know and it just ends off right there! So yes, the ending is a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, there are still a couple of things that make it great.Also, Captain Molstrum seemed like an interesting antagonist. He was hyped up to be this unstoppable baddie who, with a relic, absolutely obliterates Advent with one blow. We all wanted to get back at him and I was so ready to fight him in like the 3 sections you have contact with him, and you don't get to at all. He gets killed by the plot and I was sad about that. Now this isn't to say the final boss was boring or a wasted potential because I did enjoy fighting him. I'm just sad that we get this hyped baddie and we don't even get to fight him.

												I am not a nice person. I judge things by their faults, not by their strengths. It is a system of subtraction. For everything that displeases me the game needs to have something equal or greater in order for me to enjoy it. Games that are ""flawed but good"" do not get my recommendation. I am hard, I am critical and I find little pleasure in things anymore. I have prejudged them all and found them wanting. I tell you this so that you might understand the weight of what I say next. Owlboy is a masterpiece unlike any I have seen for a long time. It is not only a joy to behold, but to experience. I am not one for graphics making the game, but the screenshots and whatever video you have seen of this game does it no justice. It is stunning from start to finish. The characterizations, the movement, the attention to detail, the colors and the vivid landscapes. Everything is uniquely designed and is so amazing you won't be able to take it all in through a single playthrough. As you play, keep your eyes open and attentive and you will be endlessly rewarded.The music is a marvel. I am going to go and buy the soundtrack. Its really just that great. There's flow and character and mood and melody. Everything is weird and different but it all fits together. Character themes and areas and even the sound effects just flow seemlessly to set the tone of the adventure. If you love old soundtracks for the classic game of bygone then you will not be disappointed.Story and writing are not what I would expect out of this game nor did I anticipate it to be such a high point. It has epic adventure without feeling forced. The characterization is excellent. There's comedy, which is genuinely funny and light hearted, but its only a pause from the rising gravity of a situation gone extremely wrong. There's intrigue and development and those who are careful to watch it unfold can notice some very interesting things early on that will pique your curiosity.Its a fun game to play. The controls on keyboard and mouse are simple enough that you don't struggle against a steep learning curve but certain segments will have you hammering away at keys in order to switch up moves and having you scramble during some of the faster paced segments... but the game is very forgiving. It will throw you into a situation, but its not guaranteed instant failure if you mess up. You get multiple chances and if you've worked on what the game has taught you then you will easily fall into the reflex of knowing what to do. The areas feel good, feel smart. They're crisp and never requiring pixel perfect jumps or for you to count frames in order to succeed. Its fun. There's a few minor bugs to the game. I've had to deal with one, but honestly I can't blame the developers; its a problem with XNA and I daresay anyone developing a title like this one would have been bit by the same thing. They're working on it, and I've had no issue with performance outside having to reinstall WMP. Its worth the money new. And that's high praise.			",174,29,1,30,29,1,53

												Fell in love at the title screen. This game is not super difficult, nor does it have increadibly complex mechanics but its not really trying to be. What it does have is a very great lore, an absolutely beautiful artstyle and a hell of a lot of charm. I love the sheer amount of polish in this game. From the Night-Day cycle, to the very detailed sprite animations you can tell instantly that this was a labor of love from the devs. I find myself exploring every nook of each screen just to take in the gorgeous background art and environments. This is really something that the devs should be proud of. 10/10 would hoot again.			",61,11,0,18,10,0,29

I remembered that I at least teared up or even flat out cried at some sections because what was happening and how I didn't want bonds or spirits to break from the main cast. This story is very well done and the pace is very fluent. There weren't times I wanted to put down the game because I was just done. No, like I said before, I wanted more. When it finally ended, I was pleased with what I got. The game's difficulty isn't that bad either. It's very easy to get into and the game will test your knowledge of when to use certain partners, There are some hard spots, but it isn't too bad.Now lets talk about that gameplay huh? So Otus, as a mute owl, he really can't attack. He can stun people with is little spin, but thats all he can really do other than his little dash (which I'll get to in a minute). So the game pairs you up at first with your best friend Geddy, Geddy has a gun, which Otus can carry him and he can fire at enemies. This is an interesting mechanic as you need to manage having your partner on you while also dodging enemies, solving puzzles. The whole game would be a boring cake walk if Otus can attack. Because of this, there are special sections were Otus is alone and he has to sneak past enemies. There are a number of stealth sections in this game and they are handled pretty well. I never got bored of them as they went by pretty fast. Not to mention you have a great source of movement. Oh my god the movement. I mentioned Otus can dash either in the air or on the ground. As a speedrunner, I absolutely love games with amazing movement, and Owlboy is no exception. Sure there are a lot of times I spammed the dash to get point A to point B in a timely manner, but I never felt rushed. The regular flight speed that Otus has is very optimal. At no times when I was exploring a dungeon that I needed to move around by dashing, only when I needed to backtrack or dodge incoming fire. There is even an upgrade you get that makes your movement even better so that in the later parts in the game when you have more freedom to backtrack and collect any of the game's currency to buy the extra goodies. Overall, the game is a gem. It was worth the wait of 9 years of development and polish. I didn't hear about this game until youtuber VideoGameDunkey where he had said he had a really good feeling about this game. I looked into it, and gave a lot of hope. Owlboy is a must play if you like adventureous games with a story that really likes to hit your soft spots. I absolutely loved it and am looking forward to speedrun this game!Owlboy gets a 9.5 out of 10 for me. ~LuckPercentSRL---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPOILER SECTION! SPOILER SECTION! SPOILER SECTION! READ IF YOU WANTSo with all the praise I just gave this game. Why did I give it a 9.5? There are two small disappointments I had with the game's story.So at the end, it appears that Otus had fallen because he activated the anti-hex to save the world. In the end, we get this little section of him talking to all his village friends and they appear to be happy, saying bye sort of feeling, like a memory sequence. We find his teacher at the end who explains some things and where he is. Then it ends and we see him falling from space to.....his death? Is he alive? I'm not sure. It looked like he was dead initally, but his master say the realm he is in gives him a section chance? And then we see him falling from space so is he still alive? Arrrg! I just wanted to know and it just ends off right there! So yes, the ending is a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, there are still a couple of things that make it great.Also, Captain Molstrum seemed like an interesting antagonist. He was hyped up to be this unstoppable baddie who, with a relic, absolutely obliterates Advent with one blow. We all wanted to get back at him and I was so ready to fight him in like the 3 sections you have contact with him, and you don't get to at all. He gets killed by the plot and I was sad about that. Now this isn't to say the final boss was boring or a wasted potential because I did enjoy fighting him. I'm just sad that we get this hyped baddie and we don't even get to fight him.

												I had fun playing this game. Its strange to feel that it isn't the norm when I play a lot of games, but normally there is some kind of goal or achievement involved to test my skill or my patience. This game was... it was just fun! It made me genuinely laugh at some parts, and at others I felt sad for the characters in the story. Yes I know people say the story is cliché and could have more and has loose ends (not everything has to be explained) but who cares. Owlboy game me that same experience playing Dust: An Elysian Tail where I was just completely absorbed into the world and wanted to see this adventure through Emotions and overall feel aside, mechanically the game was solid. I only encountered ONE bug the entire time and that was a boss not progressing as he should have at a certain time. This was easily fixed by just reloading from checkpoint and fighting him again. Nearing the end the game became increasingly difficult and it felt rewarding once I succeeded. 10/10 in my book and a 100% recommendation to anyone that just... loves video games.

												A labor of love from the best pixel artist alive right now.Owlboy is not a game for everyone. It's rough around the edges as far as gameplay goes. The controls are pretty tight, but not super tight. The puzzles are very clever, but not incredibly clever. The game is mostly bug free, but not completely bug free.Overall I felt I got my money's worth, and I'd surmise that most people alive to experience the SNES era of action platformers will also appreciate the game. Younger gamers most likely won't, as the lack of polish in a number of areas won't make up for the stunning imagery and supurb sound design.The game also has a number of fun and interesting set pieces, but they tend to be over before you can really appreciate them. In addition, there are a number of clever platforming puzzles that don't get the full treatment. Once you get the hang of a new puzzle concept the game pushes you into the next. There are also several sections where you can sort of bumble your way through. The game can feel challenging in some places, but more often than not it's a matter of figuring out the preferred way of solving the problem in front of you, rather than mechanically getting good.That said, the very last level of the game does away with this and demands platform jumping precision in an environment you are not familiar with. It's not too hard as, mentioned previously, once you get the hang of one concept the game shunts you on to the next, but it was an odd choice.There are numerous small details that ultimately brings down the experience. The reloading time for the musket is one. The lava level has a number of puzzles in the dark that can be muddled through without understanding them. The game is in desparate need of a map system as, while the maps in dungeons are linear, they can be confusing to navigate. In addition, the game borrows elements from Zelda, but without a map or easy way to mark which locations require more searching to get that vaunted 100%, it kills a lot of the desire to fully explore and re-treat previous areas for the last few coins.On the subject of collectibles, there seem to be three side-quests in the whole game. One involves rescuing a number of adorable penguin-like animals, who unlock an interesting if daunting mini-game. The second involves a secret in the first dungeon which doesn't seem to ever get fully explained. The third is collecting each and every coin in the game, which is kind of a hassle since, unlike many metroidvania titles, there are no clues as to what constitutes a hidden wall or passage. Or if killing every enemy in a location will unlock a chest. The lack of clues and helpful tools to get around the map or explore kill off the metroidvania vibe.In addition, the maps for dungeons are virtually 100% linear, so in essence it's less like playing Metroid, Zelda or Castlevania classics, and more like playing the more modern Zelda titles where you hardly ever backtrack and simply solve each puzzle and dungeon in sequence.With the complaints out of the way, the story is pretty on point. The characters are endearing enough, not charming enough to be remembered for a long time, but not hateful or annoying either. There are also a number of strong, darker moments in the game that would really amp up the emotion if the characters were a little bit more fleshed out.I think, the greatest crime of Owlboy, is that aside from the stellar visuals, the game is the most solid B+ title I've ever experienced. No doubt the long development time was devoted to the visuals and animation, I feel as though the small team could've used that time to iterate on the design and polish the game up even more. I wonder if 6 extra months of development time would've vaulted Owlboy from an interesting game for pixel art enthusiasts and nostalgic fans, into a true indie game darling and platforming classic.No doubt, enough love and care was put into the title, and there is definately a feeling that Owlboy be placed among other titles such as Cave Story, Noitu Love, Undertale, et al. But it's that lack of finish that ultimately squashes it's aspirations.I recommend it, and I think it's worth the price. But if you're expecting the next Undertale, perhaps wait for a sale?

												Visuals for this game are 10/10. Seriously, as someone who used to dabble in pixel art, it just blows me away at how GORGEOUS this game looks. Otus is animated so fluidly that flying around with him is just.. fun!  I feel bad for not finishing this game, because it deserves so much more of my attention. The bit I did play, I really enjoyed. Until I got stuck, and then had to call my dude to come beat a sneaky part for me. Regardless, the art and OST for this game are so so so goooood.			",113,37,4,11,8,0,19

												Given the game's 9-year development cycle, Owlboy is clearly a labour of love on the part of the developers, and this absolutely shines through in the final product. Between the game's heartfelt story, its absolutely stunning visuals and music, its fun Metroidvania gameplay, and its irresistable Super Nintendo-esque charm, it all combines to form one of the most memorable and satisfying adventures I've had the pleasure to play in quite some time. While it's not without its flaws, they are trivial compared to the sheer amount of polish that has gone into the final product, and ultimately, this is a game that despite having completed it, I can easily see myself returning to it time and again. Absolutely stellar game, D-Pad Studio should pat themselves on the back for this.			",493,148,5,72,28,4,63

												Last year we got a little indie title that blew us away and now we get one that also manages to look awesome as heck.At very first let me tell you one thing. THIS IS NOT A METROIDVANIA!Sure, today its cool to slap this tag on EVERY FLIPPING INDIEGAME, but this is not a metroidvania, its more like a Zelda plattformer... an Action adventure. If you want to see what a Metroidvania is, then go on and play Axiom Verge, Metroid, Shantae and the Pirates Curse or Castlevania. If you aren't braindead you'll see the difference.Owlboy awaits you with it's stunning visuals, interesting characters, solid gameplay and soothing soundtrack.Yeah, soothing, I mean the background music for the action packed sections of the game was cool too, but its nothing that I would remember for a long time... nevertheless, it gets ya pumped for what is happening and thats all I want.The Visuals are, as I said, incredible. You really feel the passion that went into the animations and every little rock.The games story and characters are something that i would rather leave without any big spoilers... especially since the game has just been released. All you have to know is that its pretty good and gives the adorable characters a solid worldbuild to exist in.The game will take roundabout 5 hours to beat and 7-8 to absolutely complete it the first time.its not too hard but surely will wipe the floor with your sorry behinds if you're not getting the hang of the situations you are in.Overall, I absolutely have to recommend this game.Its a really nice axperience, even tho I highly doubt it will leave the same impact as Undertale did a year ago, since Owlboy really explains every little thing whilst Undertale gave the player tons of content to specualte about... there will surely be no clickbaity Game theory about this game... which is bad, since Owlboy deserves all the attention it could possibly get.

												It's not enough that this game is gorgeous, but the characters are lovable, the music is fantastic, and the flight mechanic is fun and intuitive! I'll admit that the $20+ price point made me nervous, but my fears proved to be unfounded as I instantly loved everyone and everything in and about this game. Additionally, if you're using a controller setup you'll notice the LT trigger button does a whole lot in terms of managing important interactions but, this too, it does very well!Devs: Please make merch for this game as soon as you get the chance. I need to buy all of it...Also, please be nice to Otus, he is so dear and I love him. I'll fight you. I'll fight all of you! (A decade well spent crew. Thank you.)			",7,3,0,4,1,0,0

												TL;DR : This game is astounding, 9.5/10._________________________Owlboy is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry, something different from the casual FPS or other cash-grabs with no real game. And allow me to explaing why. In this game you play as Otus, a young owl living in the town of Villie along with his bestfriend and partner: Geddy. While you go on your adventure you will find out that as Otus you are unable to kill an enemy yourself, for you can only stun them or knock armor off of them. This is where the innovation begins, as you must pick up Geddy to kill an enemy, for Geddy (and other teammates you will get later on) will be the only ones able to kill an enemy.  As you fly along through the story, you may also notice that you can trail off from the given path to adventure else where, to find secrets of the land and stories untold...and maybe a few more coins laying around. I find that this type of level design in super exciting, because I love to explore, and while on the topic of levels, the many levels of this game all feel different making each and everyone a different journey to be had. Now, to the juicy stuff...pros and cons.Pros: - The music is phenomenal. - The art is gorgeous. - The enemies are different. - Levels are designed well to keep the game interesting. - Characters are lovable. - The story is in-depth, while being a rollercoaster of emotions. - Sprites and animations are wonderful. - Exploration is fun.*- Boss-fights are also fun and different.With all these pros you'd think there'd be no cons, right? Nah there's like 2.Cons:  - The game isn't too difficult, I only died a couple times, but that was from me being stupid.*- Along with the first con, the boss-fights are not too difficult.The game is fun and innovative and competely worth your time and money, I just wish they had a difficult slider or something, because I found myself going through levels with ease.Oh well, a game doens't need to be difficult to be a masterpiece. I give this game a 9.5/10 just because it was pretty easy and it felt like I was ""flying"" (heheheh) through the game.			",113,9,0,13,2,0,7

												The game looks and sounds great, and plays pretty well until they require you to juggle abilities. Perhaps it's much easier with a keyboard. The most difficult parts in the game, so far (I believe I'm very near the end), are fighting the controls, which is a shame because I'm otherwise really enjoying the game. Every time I find myself getting frustrated with the controls, I have to turn the game off for another day. But it keeps luring me back in with its old-school charm and top notch production. Also, the exploration seems extremely limited. I kept expecting to reach new areas when I got a new companion, and that's partially true, but for the most part, backtracking has been mostly a waste of time. Bottom line: I'm enjoying this game, but I'm not as impressed with it as a lot of the reviews seem to be, mainly because of the frustrating controls. The price is a bit steep for the amount of content. $15 would've been more appropriate. These Indie developers need to consider the amount of manpower that goes into their games. There are $25 games out there that are better than this that hundreds of people worked on. No Man's Sky is probably the biggest perpetrator of this mistake.Warning: just because certain abilities interact with certain things doesn't mean you should use that ability. I spent a lot of time trying to do certain things because I would almost accomplish it a certain way to eventually break down and watch a youtube video bash it's head against it and find the solution for me.

												Ever wanted to play a game that gave you a classic SNES or Sega game?  This will most likely give you that feel!  Oh it doesn't stop there!  Need more feels? Watch the opening scene where Otis, the main character, gets crapped on by his mentor and even the villagers.  But theres always the glimpse of hope from his best friend, as well as from the companions Otis makes throughout his journey.  It starts off depressing, and as the game goes on, it keeps that mood going. I cannot stress how well written and developed the characters are.  Play it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Owlboy is straight up beautiful.It is by far the best experience i have had with a platformer/adventure game is recent years. The animations look amazing and the 2D sprite art is just great. The music is perfection.The characters are lovable and likeable and actually make me want to learn more about them. Going to the fire pit in Tropo every once in a while is a goal for me, just so I get more dialogue between the characters. This game is just plainly a masterpieceDo I think it is worth the $25 USD? Yes. Do others? Maybe.Wait on a sale if you must, but I believe the game is well worth the price.			",312,42,8,57,27,1,35

												Given the game's 9-year development cycle, Owlboy is clearly a labour of love on the part of the developers, and this absolutely shines through in the final product. Between the game's heartfelt story, its absolutely stunning visuals and music, its fun Metroidvania gameplay, and its irresistable Super Nintendo-esque charm, it all combines to form one of the most memorable and satisfying adventures I've had the pleasure to play in quite some time. While it's not without its flaws, they are trivial compared to the sheer amount of polish that has gone into the final product, and ultimately, this is a game that despite having completed it, I can easily see myself returning to it time and again. Absolutely stellar game, D-Pad Studio should pat themselves on the back for this.			",493,148,5,72,28,4,63

												I often call Owlboy the ""Undertale of action platformers"", and that's exactly what it is! Owlboy is a beautiful 2D adventure set in a world floating in the sky. You'll explore ancient ruins, fight monsters, aquire friends with unique abilities, and battle challenging bosses. Everything here is so carefully crafted, from the balanced difficulty to the design of the levels. You'll never be truly lost in any dungeon, and you'll always end up going in the right direction anyway. The art itself is so beautiful, even if I got lost somehow, that I was in disbelief. The sheer effort that went into the animation and pixel art is ASTOUNDING! The story alone is incredible and compelling. There is nothing better than a group of friends going up against overwhelming odds! What a classic tale full of tension and hope! For this review, I am not going to do my usual summary of the positives or negatives. Because there really isn't a single negative to say about Owlboy. Maybe the odd stealth sections are a minor flaw, because they do a good job breaking up the usual gameplay, but everything else is so well made. In fact, if you don't care about collecting everything or finding all the secrets, the collectable coins are designed exactly to give you the upgrades you need just by playing normally. That is polish and care on a higher level! Owlboy is another ""indie darling"" that deserves to sit next to Shovel Knight and Undertale!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those game where it's a pleasure to just look an listen. Whether it's the beautiful art, or the fantastic soundtrack, you really can't help but appreciate the world they've built. The controls can be ever so slightly odd at times, but aside from the rare annoyance they feel quite nice as you fight and explore the land. Enemies are designed in a way that forces the player to switch it up instead of just spamming fire, which is always nice. Overall a very good game that's more than worth what you pay.

												I honestly could not recommend this game enough if I tried, I played it from beginning to end in one sitting without getting even slightly bored of it because of the fact the game just gets progressively more enjoyable as you go along. The way this game is open world enough to explore extra areas while still being closed enough so you don't get lost or confused is a great feature many games could learn from. The story may seem distant or dragged out at the start but very early into the game everything starts tying together and crafts this amazing adventure you get sucked into and never want to leave. I would go into more details about this game instead of just saying ""this feature is great"" or ""this game is amazing"" but it's something you HAVE to experience for yourself, even if you don't enjoy playing pixelated games- (which for a pixelated game it has pays a lot of attention to small details such as effects, sounds, animations, particles, ect. to make everything look, feel, and sound extremely smooth) -I HIGHLY doubt you'd regret buying Owlboy.

												PROS:-Simple yet challenging mixture of 'platforming'/bullet-hell/twin-stick shooter-Gorgeously realized world-Characters with depth and growth - a character I'd seen as an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥made a surprising turn towards the end.-Very well-told story-Epic soundtrack-I like that upgrades aren't so much 'bought' as 'earned', where you get them by collecting coins, but the coins aren't actually spent on them.CONS:-Some frustrating set pieces. An actual platforming bit towards the end is rather frustrating and made me aware of a certain over-sensitivity in between jumping and actually flying-I'm sort of in two minds about the ending-You don't have much health, and opportunities for healing can be few in dungeons-Some checkpoint placement can range from irksome to downright sadistic-Some graphical effects (such as firing a character's musket) can be somewhat disorienting - but I've found myself to be somewhat sensitive to that kind of thing.All in all, this game's a real hoot. (I regret nothing.)			",208,46,0,19,14,2,13

												This is a remarkably well made retro platformer. The music is outstanding. Reminding me of Final Fantasy. The gameplay is really solid with a light metroidvania feel that had me feeling mildly confused about where I was going most of the time. You just fly around, but use the power of your friends to combat and traverse portions of the environment. They're easy to use and control and have clearly defined roles. Problem is that you have little time where you are using all three at once. There are a couple sections that felt out of place like the cannon flight, but they're few and far between. My only other gripe is that the game really gives you zero context for how an enemy is defeated or a section traversed. It's all trial and error. Visuals are peak retro. They use the term hi-bit and I like it for this genre of graphics. I really liked the character animations. Otus's surprised face gave me a giggle every time. Well worth the asking price.

												Okay I love this game. Highly recommended. I've got about 4 hours logged in the game and this is the first game in a long time that I want to continually revist. So here's what I like about the game sprinkled with some opportunities I think the developers might consider:Music - the musical score in this game is absolutely wonderful. It can be delightful, brooding, somber, exciting, uplifting, everything. It's so wonderful, I don't know how else to describe it. I can't really go into depth about it since I'm no audiophile, but lemme say it really greatly adds to the mood and setting of the game at any given point.Graphics - this is a 2D game of course, but as far as 2D games go, this game looks absolutely gorgeous. I will say here that sometimes the environments feel somewhat empty, and the lack of a map or map hotkey makes navigating somewhat difficult but it's not unbearable and never really feels like it's a huge hinderance. I think it may make collecting all the extra stuff a little hard but I think not spoonfeeding stuff to players isn't a HUGE problem. Gameplay - the game is really responsive, I never find myself doing something I didn't want to do, same with the aiming and all. The whole concept of carrying different gunners to do and accomplish different things is really cool and it's a clever gameplay mechanic. The puzzles are pretty fun, not too difficult though, but again, no hand holding here and it's great. Story - I leave this one up to you guys. I really enjoy the story line, I know some of you out there will say it's a tried and true story, done plenty of times before. But that doesn't stop me from really enjoying the story. My only wish is that the game doesn't end quickly. I'm only 4hours into it, I hope theres a lot more of the story left. I'm not going to assign a number value but I'm going to say this game is great. I really love it. I hope the game lasts quite a bit longer, but I'll append this Review when I'm done to give a good idea of how long it takes. Highly recommended, if you need a new story driven game that doesn't hand hold you through every single piece of it, look no further, speak no more.Edit: I finished the game, I have 9 hours logged and I could've finished it a lot faster honestly. I really love this game, the ending is memorable and I look forward to what the creators have next in store. I wish the game was longer though, that's probably my only gripe.			",171,4,7,5,7,1,3

												On the surface, this is a fun little platformer game with aspects of twin-stick shooter. Like others have remarked, it has impressive art design. Unlike others, I didn't find myself very compelled by the story and overall game design. Does it have a message? Yes, you can definitely see the parallels it draws between its characters and the hardships that we, as inhabitants of earth, face economically, environmentally and socially.But, was it fun? Kind of. Will it leave a lasting impression on me? Probably not. Is it worth the $20+US? No...I would say about $15 relative to other games I've played that are similar indie platformers. I understand this was an indie title that took 9 years in the making - don't really understand why so long - possibly finances? In all honesty, I've played other indie games that were far more enjoyable to play and left a lasting impression - I'm talking about you Environmental Station Alpha, Cave Story and Valdis Story. Opposed to these others, I can't honestly say that I'd come back to play this one. It's very linear. Controls are just ok. There's a section near the end that requires some experimentation with platform jumping. I'll give a hint...if you've been using the analog stick in the flying portions preceding this, you definitely want to switch to the D-Pad during said jumping section near end of game. Something weird convolutes the analog left movement stick with the jumping mechanism, intermittently wonking out and prompting premature flight, loss of hang-time, etc. You'll see. Maybe the devs will fix this.Anyway, bottom line, it is a fairly enjoyable game that I would recommend...with one caveat. If you don't mind spending the $20+, go ahead and purchase; otherwise, wait for a sale at around $15 or so.			",37,3,1,2,1,0,3

												After dealing with Owlboy for a full video series where I played it, it left a good impression on me as a game itself. Uncertain if I can link that, so here's just the review!In all honesty, it's hard to rate Owlboy as anything less than 'Amazing' in almost every aspect it tries to touch upon. Gameplay is solid, the map is solid, the characters are great, the art is pretty and stylish, and the story overall is told well... But there are still flaws. In the story itself, there are a lot of things that are hamfisted or simply not explained well enough and most characters come off as negative because of that. Now, a majority of them are still fine and that's why I said they were great, but there are definitely a few I feel have fatal flaws that simply aren't explored in the gameplay. That is my major complaint.Another major complaint is a build up that never receives a payoff. Something that may hint for things to come now that the foundation has been set, but... It could have been handled better. This game was amazing, there's no doubting that, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action platformers like this that are very story driven. There's also a lot of hidden things that just aren't really focused on unless you really want to 100% the game, which is a plus. It's nice when a game likes to show you its story through actual work instead of just an hour long cutscene, though there are plenty of small cutscenes through this game as well.Regardless, this game has flaws and a few major ones too, but it's not a bad game. Gameplay was simple, clean, and overall fun, but ultimately ended up becoming repetitive or just annoying, particuarlly in certain situations. The music was always on point, though, and there were only a few points where the art was an issue, particuarlly when dealing with enemies that have arkward hit boxxes or move a lot. That being said..... The information I have states the game took over 10 years to come out. In these 10 years, it got a lot of support and a lot of people were looking forward to it. In no way do I think anyone who did wish for it is disappointed and I am definitely not disappointed either in buying it... But it could have been better and I feel like 10 years was more than enough time to make it better. There's a lot of small things that really make this game just barely reach 'Amazing', but it's still amazing nontheless. I'm looking forward to more from this group and hopefully this game will allow them to see flaws they otherwise missed because of either lack of experience, or simply not trying to focus on fixing them. Hopefully it'll take less than 10 years next time, possibly for a sequel. Story: 7/10Art: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Music: 10/10Characters: 7.5/10 (One specific character has a good moment, but overall is pretty meh.)Overall: 8/10. Could use work, but it's still an amazing game that people should pick up if they enjoy this genre.			",134,16,0,25,11,2,13

												This game is the product of nine years of development, and it really shows that the developers crafted every detail of the game with love. Owlboy isn't perfect, but it's definitely a standout title.PresentationOwlboy's strongest attribute by far. The ""Hi-Bit"" pixel graphics are gorgeous and set a high bar for any future games using a pixelated art style. The soundtrack by Jonathan Geer is beautiful and emotive, making the soundtrack a worthy upgrade if you're the type to listen to video game soundtracks when you're not playing. Animations for the characters are absolutely on point. The characters' expressions and reactions during dialogue are very charming and expressive.GameplayWhile I had a lot of fun with this game, it's not as polished in the gameplay department as in presentation. The game is often far too easy, with some spikes in difficulty in certain sections. I found myself breezing through the levels, with puzzles, boss fights, and other obstacles doing little to slow my progress. Occasionally, I would get lost in some of the levels if I decided to go hunting for collectibles as there's no minimap, though not much backtracking is required to progress in the game.StoryI loved the story and spent time talking to every NPC. However, I know the story is hit or miss for some. Owlboy's story pacing is pretty standard, breaking up the action in-between dungeons for narrative development and character dialogue. The characters are likable and distinct, and the story has some unexpectedly emotional turns. If you're not interested in the story, however, you're probably going to get annoyed at the interruptions.Final ThoughtsOverall I'd recommend Owlboy to anyone looking for an aesthetically-pleasing game that's light on difficulty but high on charm. If you're an action platformer veteran looking for a challenge, this game will disappoint you. Owlboy is at its best when you just relax and let it pull you in with its story and presentation. I wish the game was longer or more challenging, but I came away from the game without regrets in my purchase, even going back to 100% it and see everything there is to see			",933,263,15,130,63,11,122

												Overall the game was great.  Good nostalgia, beautiful pixel art, good music, enjoyable story, and for the most part the gameplay was good.  However, there were a few gameplay/design choices that I thought were gimmicky and unnecessary only to try and add some difficulty to the game and just came off as stupid/annoying. You're an owl, there shouldn't be levels that try to use darkness as a way to add difficulty to a level.  You should be able to see. I thought that was a little silly.  Also, there is one boss battle where the map is constantly rotating as is your gamepad direction.  There are a few more design choices like the two I mentioned that just seem pointless and could have been better designed.  Other than that, the game was very enjoyable.			",73,24,0,11,1,0,3

												Owlboy is a 2D puzzle-platformer about an anthropomorphic owl named Otus who finds himself unknowingly in the midst of a cataclysmic disaster millenia in the making. With the assistance of friends he makes along the way, Otus solves puzzles, shoots enemies, defeats monstrous bosses, and unearths dark secrets about the world he lives in.  In terms of gameplay, the only thing that sets it apart from other platformers is Otus' ability to carry one of his companions while in flight. Over the course of the game, you encounter 3 friends who accompany you on your adventure, each of which has a unique ability that can be used to gain access to previously inaccessible areas, solve puzzles, eliminate enemies, and avoid or circumvent obstacles. Although a novel mechanic, it is utilized in generally uninteresting ways, resulting in a gameplay experience that falls a bit flat. The puzzles presented in the game aren't difficult in the slightest, and your companions' abilities are only used in the most surface-level puzzle-solving. Oftentimes, the puzzles come down to: use a companion's ability at this point to progress. Had more of the game's puzzle-solving revolved around switching between companions or combining their abilities in unique ways, the gameplay would have been much more enjoyable. However, this would have required fundamental changes to the story beats and progression as the first two companions are introduced in the first couple hours of the game. The third (and final companion) isn't unlocked until you are in the throes of the game's climax. To make matters worse, over the course of the game you periodically lose a companion, meaning that you only have a full party for what seems like the last hour or so. Despite the narrative justifications for this, it's frustrating that  one of the defining mechanics of Owlboy can only be fully utilized for the last hour or two of the game. The story itself is filled with the charm and whimsy that you would expect from a game like Owlboy. The game's narrative follows Otus as he attempts to save his people from a cataclysmic event which gets increasingly dire as the game progresses. There are some unexpected turns in the story that kept it from being completely predictable, but at the end of the game it was a pretty standard ""save the world from X because ancient people did Y"" narrative you might expect from an animated children's movie. Although it falls victim to some fairly common narrative tropes, the story was compelling enough to keep me engaged and interested for its entirety. Artistically, Owlboy is a masterpiece, and I struggle to think of a more perfect example of pixel-art done right. Whether soaring through the sky towards a floating continent, or dashing through lava-filled caves, every frame is a beautiful pixel-art painting. The environments teem with life as birds fly off into the distance, stars twinkle in the night sky, and the background and foreground slide along in some of the best examples of parallax scrolling I've ever seen. The character sprites and monsters are beautifully animated and brimming with personality that would make even Nintendo green with envy. The entire game is filled with screen-shot worthy moments that were composed with almost absurd attention to detail. Although the artwork in Owlboy is second to none, the soundtrack itself is a wonderful composition of scores that perfectly complement every scene. Lilting clarinets, violins, and cellos accompany Otus on his journey to save the world, instilling a sense of mysticism and serenity that is not often found in games. Unless you're one for scouring every inch of a game in order to collect every single coin imaginable, once you're done with Owlboy there's no reason to come back. There is no ""New Game+"", unlockable content, or multiplayer. That isn't to say that it would need any of that. The journey is a short one at roughly 6-8 hours, but considering the overall shallowness of the gameplay, any longer and it would have been a slog. There's no question as to when the game will come to a close as the story ends in a textbook climactic fashion. With most of the narrative threads being wrapped up in the game's bittersweet conclusion, the ending of Owlboy feels nothing short of satisfying. It's not disappointing, nor is it powerfully moving. Instead it feels absolutely appropriate, a perfectly competent bookend to what was overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Despite the lackluster gameplay and the occasionally frustrating traversal segment, Owlboy has stuck with me. From time to time I'll find myself whistling the main menu music or imagining the blue skies and gently swaying foliage of the introductory area, and I'm immediately reminded of the games from my childhood. 16-bit vibrant landscapes, colorful characters, and comical villain archetypes. Owlboy serves as a rose-tinted lens through which I retrospectively view the games of my childhood. It's nostalgic, charming, and beautiful.

Saw an article on this game and it compelled me to try it, and not disappointed. Although, one thing I do notice, and not sure as of yet, I can't save whenever I want. It saves at checkpoints. Prologue made me a bit sad, but Otus is a though owl. I feel bad whenever I drop someone and they faceplant into the ground, especially when I don't mean to. Shh, I might on purpose do that in games.I'll update after playing farther in the game, but so far, satisfied.			",27,20,0,12,6,0,0

												This was one of the most visually stunning games I have seen in awhile. The story was heartwrenching and made me tear up every 10 or so minutes. There should be a DLC that allows me to marry Otus and Solus and live together happily forever after. I really want to see them bang. Also I want to see their beaks clash together in a hot fiery pasion of lust and intimacy. And maybe even adopt some of those fat penguin things as their children (Since they couldn't have children duh) And what ever happened to that slave penguin locked in the basement?! Is that a strange fetish thing with the shop keeper and chubby penguin??? Good game overall 9.84/10 rating.			",86,18,0,7,11,1,1

												This game suffers from mediocre combat and in some parts frustrating level design.  The movement system isn't as much fun as I thought it would be for a game where you can fly from the get-go.  There's very little backtracking and a lack of puzzles for a game of its metroidvania flavor.  Owlboy, however turns out to be more than the sum of its parts.  None of these individual gripes end up being a deal-breaker, and the ups in my opinion far outweigh the downs.  Containing fun characters, a decent story, and easily the best pixel art I've ever seen in a game,  Owlboy is well worth your time.It's perhaps a bit short for $25, but it's a must buy if you can't get enough of the atmosphere of games like Fez and Hyper Light Drifter.

Sufficiently hard to make you question yourself, and and easy enough to let you actually finish the game.The fact that the game portrays a protagonist nobody believes in is quite satisfactionary, as most people have been at the receiving end of crushing disappointment. A wonderful experience.			",223,48,0,48,22,0,30

												I really enjoyed this game. The story felt well paced. Introducing new mechanics as your team grows. The dungeons felt interesting and the world pulls you in. I played it a few times spread out and then powered through the last half of the game in one sitting. For a game that took about 10 years to make you can really feel just how much love the developers put into to this game. The pixel art style is outstanding.			",146,12,2,11,8,0,9

												Owlboy.The game is an action platformer.You play as ""Owlboy"", a mute fledgling owl that is forced to spread his wings and thrust into an adventure like no other. The art style: Is wonderful, with its vibrant and colourful display, its locations are wonderful; you can really see that this was a labour of love, rather than a rushed game.The Music: The music is truly fantastic, it really helps to create emotion, whether that being melancholy or wonder, it has a track for that; I couldn’t help but find the soundtrack and listen to it again. The fact that it is fully orchestrated helps wonders too. The Story:I felt that the story captivated me and kept me well engrossed, making me want to come back to play the rest almost every night. The story took me about 6-7 hours to complete, but I did not get all of the collectibles that are on offer. I was not disappointed. The Combat: The combat is something that I enjoyed; you pick up and carry one of three different characters to act as your weapon each with a unique still set that will be useful in your travels. There are a large variety of enemies that you will face and a good amount of boss fights that will engage you. I only wish the boss fights were a little more difficult.I honestly loved this game and I recommend it to you whole-heartedly.			",279,47,4,48,9,1,21

												Simply one of the best games I played. Stunning graphics, awesome soundtrack (listening to it every day) and a great story with unexpected twists and turns and lovely characters.Some passages are pretty tough, but never unfair. If you fail, you know it's your fault.It took me 7 hours for the first play-through. I'm currently in the second round finding lots of hidden stuff I missed the first time (like the camp fire scene with Geddy).Totally worth the price. Buy and enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I sincerely recommend this game to anyone who likes a 2D adventure game.The hi-bit pixelart is stunning and gorgeous, and the environments feel alive and varied.The story is generally fantastic, as stakes rise without them feeling forced to make things more urgent. It's not the longest game in terms of the main story though; the linear path is rather short.The gameplay is quick and seamless; If you make a mistake, you feel like it's your own fault rather than the game's fault.The puzzles cleverly utilize the flight mechanic with the 2D space, but most of them are rather simple.In all; fantastic game, go buy it if you can!

I laughed many times at the great characters. The difficulty scales really well as the game progresses. At first the bosses are easy, by the middle they offer a challenge, and by the end you'll have to attempt each one numerous times. Luckily checkpoints are numerous, so there is no frustration in that regard.♥♥♥♥ the cannon though.			",168,38,0,20,10,0,22

												Ever wanted to play a game that gave you a classic SNES or Sega game?  This will most likely give you that feel!  Oh it doesn't stop there!  Need more feels? Watch the opening scene where Otis, the main character, gets crapped on by his mentor and even the villagers.  But theres always the glimpse of hope from his best friend, as well as from the companions Otis makes throughout his journey.  It starts off depressing, and as the game goes on, it keeps that mood going. I cannot stress how well written and developed the characters are.  Play it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Owlboy is straight up beautiful.It is by far the best experience i have had with a platformer/adventure game is recent years. The animations look amazing and the 2D sprite art is just great. The music is perfection.The characters are lovable and likeable and actually make me want to learn more about them. Going to the fire pit in Tropo every once in a while is a goal for me, just so I get more dialogue between the characters. This game is just plainly a masterpieceDo I think it is worth the $25 USD? Yes. Do others? Maybe.Wait on a sale if you must, but I believe the game is well worth the price.			",312,42,8,57,27,1,35

												It's weird for a ""Metroidvania platformer"" to have the entire game make you essentially ignore platforms, but this game has two good arguments for playing it: the environments and the music.Now let me be clear: a lot of games get praised for their score and I've played a number of games that are famous for their scores, but this is probably the first in a long time that I felt encouraged to put the controller down for a little while and just listen.The backgrounds and artwork are very detailed in a very subtle way: I didn't actually notice it at first (I was exploring and a bit lost) but for a game with that old-school X-bit look, there's a lot more attention to detail than I expected.The controls are simple (I always mess them up in boss fights though) but I'm not sure how I feel about so explicit a plot in a Metroidvania game.  It's new to me and I'm unsure if it helps or hurts the game. ",152,56,1,65,16,3,20

												This is one of those game where it's a pleasure to just look an listen. Whether it's the beautiful art, or the fantastic soundtrack, you really can't help but appreciate the world they've built. The controls can be ever so slightly odd at times, but aside from the rare annoyance they feel quite nice as you fight and explore the land. Enemies are designed in a way that forces the player to switch it up instead of just spamming fire, which is always nice. Overall a very good game that's more than worth what you pay.

												The game looks and sounds great, and plays pretty well until they require you to juggle abilities. Perhaps it's much easier with a keyboard. The most difficult parts in the game, so far (I believe I'm very near the end), are fighting the controls, which is a shame because I'm otherwise really enjoying the game. Every time I find myself getting frustrated with the controls, I have to turn the game off for another day. But it keeps luring me back in with its old-school charm and top notch production. Also, the exploration seems extremely limited. I kept expecting to reach new areas when I got a new companion, and that's partially true, but for the most part, backtracking has been mostly a waste of time. Bottom line: I'm enjoying this game, but I'm not as impressed with it as a lot of the reviews seem to be, mainly because of the frustrating controls. The price is a bit steep for the amount of content. $15 would've been more appropriate. These Indie developers need to consider the amount of manpower that goes into their games. There are $25 games out there that are better than this that hundreds of people worked on. No Man's Sky is probably the biggest perpetrator of this mistake.Warning: just because certain abilities interact with certain things doesn't mean you should use that ability. I spent a lot of time trying to do certain things because I would almost accomplish it a certain way to eventually break down and watch a youtube video bash it's head against it and find the solution for me.

												TL;DR : This game is astounding, 9.5/10._________________________Owlboy is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry, something different from the casual FPS or other cash-grabs with no real game. And allow me to explaing why. In this game you play as Otus, a young owl living in the town of Villie along with his bestfriend and partner: Geddy. While you go on your adventure you will find out that as Otus you are unable to kill an enemy yourself, for you can only stun them or knock armor off of them. This is where the innovation begins, as you must pick up Geddy to kill an enemy, for Geddy (and other teammates you will get later on) will be the only ones able to kill an enemy.  As you fly along through the story, you may also notice that you can trail off from the given path to adventure else where, to find secrets of the land and stories untold...and maybe a few more coins laying around. I find that this type of level design in super exciting, because I love to explore, and while on the topic of levels, the many levels of this game all feel different making each and everyone a different journey to be had. Now, to the juicy stuff...pros and cons.Pros: - The music is phenomenal. - The art is gorgeous. - The enemies are different. - Levels are designed well to keep the game interesting. - Characters are lovable. - The story is in-depth, while being a rollercoaster of emotions. - Sprites and animations are wonderful. - Exploration is fun.*- Boss-fights are also fun and different.With all these pros you'd think there'd be no cons, right? Nah there's like 2.Cons:  - The game isn't too difficult, I only died a couple times, but that was from me being stupid.*- Along with the first con, the boss-fights are not too difficult.The game is fun and innovative and competely worth your time and money, I just wish they had a difficult slider or something, because I found myself going through levels with ease.Oh well, a game doens't need to be difficult to be a masterpiece. I give this game a 9.5/10 just because it was pretty easy and it felt like I was ""flying"" (heheheh) through the game.			",113,9,0,13,2,0,7

												This game is the product of nine years of development, and it really shows that the developers crafted every detail of the game with love. Owlboy isn't perfect, but it's definitely a standout title.PresentationOwlboy's strongest attribute by far. The ""Hi-Bit"" pixel graphics are gorgeous and set a high bar for any future games using a pixelated art style. The soundtrack by Jonathan Geer is beautiful and emotive, making the soundtrack a worthy upgrade if you're the type to listen to video game soundtracks when you're not playing. Animations for the characters are absolutely on point. The characters' expressions and reactions during dialogue are very charming and expressive.GameplayWhile I had a lot of fun with this game, it's not as polished in the gameplay department as in presentation. The game is often far too easy, with some spikes in difficulty in certain sections. I found myself breezing through the levels, with puzzles, boss fights, and other obstacles doing little to slow my progress. Occasionally, I would get lost in some of the levels if I decided to go hunting for collectibles as there's no minimap, though not much backtracking is required to progress in the game.StoryI loved the story and spent time talking to every NPC. However, I know the story is hit or miss for some. Owlboy's story pacing is pretty standard, breaking up the action in-between dungeons for narrative development and character dialogue. The characters are likable and distinct, and the story has some unexpectedly emotional turns. If you're not interested in the story, however, you're probably going to get annoyed at the interruptions.Final ThoughtsOverall I'd recommend Owlboy to anyone looking for an aesthetically-pleasing game that's light on difficulty but high on charm. If you're an action platformer veteran looking for a challenge, this game will disappoint you. Owlboy is at its best when you just relax and let it pull you in with its story and presentation. I wish the game was longer or more challenging, but I came away from the game without regrets in my purchase, even going back to 100% it and see everything there is to see			",933,263,15,130,63,11,122

												After dealing with Owlboy for a full video series where I played it, it left a good impression on me as a game itself. Uncertain if I can link that, so here's just the review!In all honesty, it's hard to rate Owlboy as anything less than 'Amazing' in almost every aspect it tries to touch upon. Gameplay is solid, the map is solid, the characters are great, the art is pretty and stylish, and the story overall is told well... But there are still flaws. In the story itself, there are a lot of things that are hamfisted or simply not explained well enough and most characters come off as negative because of that. Now, a majority of them are still fine and that's why I said they were great, but there are definitely a few I feel have fatal flaws that simply aren't explored in the gameplay. That is my major complaint.Another major complaint is a build up that never receives a payoff. Something that may hint for things to come now that the foundation has been set, but... It could have been handled better. This game was amazing, there's no doubting that, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action platformers like this that are very story driven. There's also a lot of hidden things that just aren't really focused on unless you really want to 100% the game, which is a plus. It's nice when a game likes to show you its story through actual work instead of just an hour long cutscene, though there are plenty of small cutscenes through this game as well.Regardless, this game has flaws and a few major ones too, but it's not a bad game. Gameplay was simple, clean, and overall fun, but ultimately ended up becoming repetitive or just annoying, particuarlly in certain situations. The music was always on point, though, and there were only a few points where the art was an issue, particuarlly when dealing with enemies that have arkward hit boxxes or move a lot. That being said..... The information I have states the game took over 10 years to come out. In these 10 years, it got a lot of support and a lot of people were looking forward to it. In no way do I think anyone who did wish for it is disappointed and I am definitely not disappointed either in buying it... But it could have been better and I feel like 10 years was more than enough time to make it better. There's a lot of small things that really make this game just barely reach 'Amazing', but it's still amazing nontheless. I'm looking forward to more from this group and hopefully this game will allow them to see flaws they otherwise missed because of either lack of experience, or simply not trying to focus on fixing them. Hopefully it'll take less than 10 years next time, possibly for a sequel. Story: 7/10Art: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Music: 10/10Characters: 7.5/10 (One specific character has a good moment, but overall is pretty meh.)Overall: 8/10. Could use work, but it's still an amazing game that people should pick up if they enjoy this genre.			",134,16,0,25,11,2,13

												The amount of times I've found myself grinning like an idiot while playing this game is too high to count. This is a love letter to what I thought gaming would be in the future back when I was playing games on my Genesis. Responsive, GORGEOUS, and charming as hell, this is one of my favorite games of 2016. I don't want to go into any more detail in fear that I'll ruin aspects of it, but I can guarentee that if you like 2D platformers, you will love this game. On top of that, I nominate it in my own category, ""BEST PIXEL ART"" because it literally has the best pixel art I've ever seen in a game.			",197,74,4,21,17,2,21

												A piece of beauty, that's all I have to say about this game. The art is amazing, the soundtrack is awesome and fitting (but don't look at the song titles because spoilers), the story is great and the characters are lovable and memorable.They spent nine years working on this game and it shows!That being said, the game does have its share of glitches, although those I encountered were fairly minor. But there is one complaint I have about this game, namely the bosses, the game sometimes takes a huge difficulty spike at some of its bossfights, which could be pretty frustrating and sometimes made the controls feel a little unresponsive...(that being said, I'm not exactly great at reflex based activities in general, so this probably doesn't apply to everyone)I have nothing but love for Owlboy, give it a shot, it'll be worth it!

												Fun, cute game, but suffers from slow pacing and wonky controls, especially with switching around teammates. Additionally, there's this NPC in the game who basically physically and emotionally abuses her coworkers (well, let's be honest: slaves), but it's portrayed as being funny because she's, well, she's a girl - and girls, I guess, aren't ""supposed"" to be physically/emotionally abusing. But, for someone like me - who, uh, has a history with this sort of thing - this hit a little too close to home, and made me feel extremely uncomfortable to see it portrayed in such a lighthearted manner. Despite all this, I'm assuming that most people don't really care or aren't as affected by it as I am, so I really recommend the game, so long as you're one of these people. Of course, just be aware that the game does start off rather slowly and that the controls are a little loose. Both are relatively mild concerns, I think, so they're easily outweighed by the game's charm, music, and general enjoyability. Pros:- Charming pixelated graphics and animations- Fitting music- Personable and memorable charactersCons: - Slow pace- Loose controls- That one questionable NPC (to me, at least)			",96,42,0,29,5,0,5

												Owlboy has brought a classic formula into modern gaming with enough tweaks that it doesn't feel like what we've seen millions of times already. The characters and story are engaging, the music divine and the environment immersive, its exploration feels real. It has that ""one more turn"" feel to it, you don't want to stop playing. Owlboy might just be GOTY for me and for its price I can't not recommend it.			",127,33,2,7,22,4,28

												I had fun playing this game. Its strange to feel that it isn't the norm when I play a lot of games, but normally there is some kind of goal or achievement involved to test my skill or my patience. This game was... it was just fun! It made me genuinely laugh at some parts, and at others I felt sad for the characters in the story. Yes I know people say the story is cliché and could have more and has loose ends (not everything has to be explained) but who cares. Owlboy game me that same experience playing Dust: An Elysian Tail where I was just completely absorbed into the world and wanted to see this adventure through Emotions and overall feel aside, mechanically the game was solid. I only encountered ONE bug the entire time and that was a boss not progressing as he should have at a certain time. This was easily fixed by just reloading from checkpoint and fighting him again. Nearing the end the game became increasingly difficult and it felt rewarding once I succeeded. 10/10 in my book and a 100% recommendation to anyone that just... loves video games.

												TL;DR : This game is astounding, 9.5/10._________________________Owlboy is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry, something different from the casual FPS or other cash-grabs with no real game. And allow me to explaing why. In this game you play as Otus, a young owl living in the town of Villie along with his bestfriend and partner: Geddy. While you go on your adventure you will find out that as Otus you are unable to kill an enemy yourself, for you can only stun them or knock armor off of them. This is where the innovation begins, as you must pick up Geddy to kill an enemy, for Geddy (and other teammates you will get later on) will be the only ones able to kill an enemy.  As you fly along through the story, you may also notice that you can trail off from the given path to adventure else where, to find secrets of the land and stories untold...and maybe a few more coins laying around. I find that this type of level design in super exciting, because I love to explore, and while on the topic of levels, the many levels of this game all feel different making each and everyone a different journey to be had. Now, to the juicy stuff...pros and cons.Pros: - The music is phenomenal. - The art is gorgeous. - The enemies are different. - Levels are designed well to keep the game interesting. - Characters are lovable. - The story is in-depth, while being a rollercoaster of emotions. - Sprites and animations are wonderful. - Exploration is fun.*- Boss-fights are also fun and different.With all these pros you'd think there'd be no cons, right? Nah there's like 2.Cons:  - The game isn't too difficult, I only died a couple times, but that was from me being stupid.*- Along with the first con, the boss-fights are not too difficult.The game is fun and innovative and competely worth your time and money, I just wish they had a difficult slider or something, because I found myself going through levels with ease.Oh well, a game doens't need to be difficult to be a masterpiece. I give this game a 9.5/10 just because it was pretty easy and it felt like I was ""flying"" (heheheh) through the game.			",113,9,0,13,2,0,7

												I would like to start this review by saying that this game took 9 years to make.  9 years that were totally worth waiting for.  This is what game developers should aspire to.Owlboy is a short, metroidvania-style game made by D-Pad Studio.  I stumbled upon this game shortly before its release, because Savant: Ascent (A previous title by the same studio) was such a fun game, I wanted to try it out again.  When I reinstalled Savant, I noticed a small news article on the game page talking about Owlboy's upcoming release.D-Pad Studio has, in my opinion, the best pixel art style out there.  And Owlboy is no exception.  Througout the entirety of the game, I was amazed simply by how beautiful every area was.  This game has no map, but it's not needed, because the great art style lends itself to some gorgeous landmarks, to help you find your way.  Sadly, there is no form of fast-travel, but it isn't necessary, due to the speed at which you can traverse to a new area.Savant: Ascent really had done gameplay well.  Owlboy kept to these tight controls and fun gameplay, while adding a short, but powerful story.  While sometimes difficult, no part of the game ever felt frustrating, and I always kept coming back.  This was mostly due to the varied cast, all of whom had well written dialouge.  As such, many of the game's characters were some of the most relatable characters I've come across in recent years.Owlboy may be a short game, but there are a decent amount of collectables, and I could definitely play through the game again, to experience some of the emotions this game will bring out.This is one of the best games I've played in years.  Do NOT let this one pass you by.			",591,118,8,91,66,6,64

												This is basically a super gorgeous Shantae game.  Which is great, because those are fantastic platformers, they just don't spend 10 years on each one meticulously doing amazing little one-shot animations.  Now you get the best of both!If you haven't owned a Nintendo console it's hard to imagine the magic of this type of game.  Shovel Knight is another good comparison. If you've got minimal twitch reflexes (It's easier than Aquaria and Shovel Knight, nowhere near as sadistically evil as Ori and the Blind Forest, and again about the same as Shantae games) you should give it a shot. It's gorgeous, bittersweet, very funny at times, and a very satisfying ending. Worth full price for me.			",1378,608,33,193,106,7,153

												Art: 9/10 Basically the best pixel art I've ever seen. However, some animations felt slightly under par, particularly on some party members.Music: 9/10 Actually really really good.Gameplay: 6/10 My two biggest issues with the game as a whole are the enemies and movement mechanics. The bosses are way too easy, I only died to the final boss once and most other bosses I did not die at all on. There are no enemies outside of bosses that were a real threat, outside of ""trap"" enemies, and the static obstacle Pirates. The greatest depth in movement is tapping B every half second, or much later on (for basically a single level), using a grappling hook thing.  This game I feel would be greatly improved by adding extra abilities to the player throughout the game, and having more varied and difficult enemies, as well as making the bosses more difficult.However, this is coming from a person with 3000 hours in the Dark Souls series, so take some of that with a grain of salt. In addition to those issues, the levels often seem very simple. All of them are entirely linear, with weak puzzles that feel more like chores than anything.Story: 7/10 The story at times is rather generic, however at other points it is extemely engaging. Kind of a mixed bag here.Overall: 7/10 Needs more depth, and difficulty.			",243,35,3,17,21,3,8

												Owlboy is among the most fascinating games I've ever played. I can't put my finger on the exact reason, but something about it captivates me in a surreal way. I can't determine whether it's the well-realized art style, amazing music & sound design, responsive gameplay, or engrossing story. I think it's truly a combination of all of these things; but, whatever the reason, I couldn't put Owlboy down. Yes, there were a few moments of frustration (controls being a little inconsistent in some later-level platforming, a few boss encounters) but, overall, my complaints about Owlboy are easily drowned out by my gushing praise for the remainder. If you enjoy platformers, or games with wonderful stories, I urge you to play Owlboy. It is worth every cent, and every minute. Congratulations to the team for finally putting it out, you created something truly special here.			",195,47,4,12,14,0,22

												I never write or read a review, But this game deserves it.its simply beautiful, it has a looot of story, the maneuvering with the controls and simple weaponry is very handly.The characters are amazingly well created.and msot of all, the exploration.  You donty get a minimapwhich at first was a lilttle bit confusing, but it gives a more vast sensation  of exploring and disvoering new caves and rings and coins.theres a time where the game literally says, go explore, we are not telling you where to go. and im like, omfg, thats what i wanted to hear, hit me harder with this desesperation of not being able to find the things i want.just buy it, worth evry penny, worth every Buccanary			",18,2,0,2,0,0,1

												•	Storyo	The game revolves around Otus, a young mute Owlboy who is lackluster at all things his mentor deems as important to being a proper being an owl. In this game an owl is the protector of the denizens of the floating islands that make up the world. Throughout the game Otus meets new companions who serve as his weapons on his journey to save the floating islands from sky pirateso	The story told is a familiar take on the Hero’s journey, however it’s done well. Dialogue is well written and character development is well paced. The game is sparse with its NPCs and makes the ones who are in the game pretty significant, if not to the main story then to the side quests that are placed throughout the game.o	However, even with the side quests mentioned prior, this game is short. I made sure to talk and return to most npcs after each pivotal moment of the game (for anyone interested most of their dialogue changes frequently) and completed all but 2 of the side quests, aand reached the end screen in 7 hours.•	Technicalo	As Otus is an owl, a majority of the game is navigated via flying. This gives the game a unique feel to its platforming. The levels are designed well around this form of movement and makes exploring the game rewarding.o	Otus can’t attack on his own, but instead carries his allies around as weapons. His allies hang under him as he flies them around. While this is a cool concept, I found my allies getting snagged on terrain at tense moments as the ally pretty much doubles the size of your controlled sprite. This results in some situations where the controls feel clunky.o	Every level has its own theme that are visually stunning and every room in the levels are distinct, which assists in preventing the player from getting lost.o	However, the game lacks a mini map makes it difficult to back track through completed levels. While going through a level the first time is easy and intuitive, the shortcuts opened as you progress make it easy to overlook rooms when returning to collect missed coins. A mini map would fix this.•	Final Thoughtso	While there are certain parts of the game that become frustrating due to control issues and the game runs a bit short for the price tag, I would still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of 2d adventure games and games with touching stories.

												Even 16-bit-era fans that are experiencing ""pixel art fatigue"" owe it to themselves to feast their eyes and ears on Owlboy. The art direction and animation are on a whole other level of polish that will remind you of countless games without ever feeling like style for nostalgia's sake, and the feel of the controls hold up masterfully on a gamepad OR mouse and keyboard.There's so many disparate elements coming together that Owlboy SHOULD feel like the gaming equivalent of a high concept album; twin stick shooting, ballistics, grappling, platforming, storytelling, and exploration... The fact that it DOESN'T is a testament to how polished and focused this feels compared to many ambitious indie games.Part of me wishes the mechanics dove deeper and demanded more challening combinations of your abilities, but the length is just about right for a narrative adventure of this scope.I loved Owlboy, and it left me wanting more without wearing thin.

												Owl boy is very charming. Ever sInce I completed Shovel Knight, I've been looking for a new unique game with similar aspects. It was a bit more expensive than I was expecting it to be, but I have to be honest, the visuals and storytelling have so far been worth it. It's the little things and the attention to detail. Play this game if you like 2D, retro style games. Those are the types of games that I have fallen in love with and Owl Boy is a great addition!			",73,12,0,8,3,0,2

												On the surface, this is a fun little platformer game with aspects of twin-stick shooter. Like others have remarked, it has impressive art design. Unlike others, I didn't find myself very compelled by the story and overall game design. Does it have a message? Yes, you can definitely see the parallels it draws between its characters and the hardships that we, as inhabitants of earth, face economically, environmentally and socially.But, was it fun? Kind of. Will it leave a lasting impression on me? Probably not. Is it worth the $20+US? No...I would say about $15 relative to other games I've played that are similar indie platformers. I understand this was an indie title that took 9 years in the making - don't really understand why so long - possibly finances? In all honesty, I've played other indie games that were far more enjoyable to play and left a lasting impression - I'm talking about you Environmental Station Alpha, Cave Story and Valdis Story. Opposed to these others, I can't honestly say that I'd come back to play this one. It's very linear. Controls are just ok. There's a section near the end that requires some experimentation with platform jumping. I'll give a hint...if you've been using the analog stick in the flying portions preceding this, you definitely want to switch to the D-Pad during said jumping section near end of game. Something weird convolutes the analog left movement stick with the jumping mechanism, intermittently wonking out and prompting premature flight, loss of hang-time, etc. You'll see. Maybe the devs will fix this.Anyway, bottom line, it is a fairly enjoyable game that I would recommend...with one caveat. If you don't mind spending the $20+, go ahead and purchase; otherwise, wait for a sale at around $15 or so.			",37,3,1,2,1,0,3

The gameplay is solid if slightly simple - but its still very fun.The thing I like the most is the detailing in the animation. Facial expressions, idle animations, subtle things like these. These are the ways this ""8-Bit Retro"" game are improved upon beyond that era.Also, my wife is in love with Owlboy and how cute he is.			",182,51,3,47,13,0,29

												PROS:-Simple yet challenging mixture of 'platforming'/bullet-hell/twin-stick shooter-Gorgeously realized world-Characters with depth and growth - a character I'd seen as an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥made a surprising turn towards the end.-Very well-told story-Epic soundtrack-I like that upgrades aren't so much 'bought' as 'earned', where you get them by collecting coins, but the coins aren't actually spent on them.CONS:-Some frustrating set pieces. An actual platforming bit towards the end is rather frustrating and made me aware of a certain over-sensitivity in between jumping and actually flying-I'm sort of in two minds about the ending-You don't have much health, and opportunities for healing can be few in dungeons-Some checkpoint placement can range from irksome to downright sadistic-Some graphical effects (such as firing a character's musket) can be somewhat disorienting - but I've found myself to be somewhat sensitive to that kind of thing.All in all, this game's a real hoot.

												This is a really good game, but there's a few little things that I just can't quite ignore.The game, for the most part, is fairly easy with a few rather unforgiving and difficult sections torward the end. Luckily, these are far between enough that it doesn't make the experience a slog to get through, but it did hamper my enjoyment  a bit.The story really isn't anything to write home about in terms of originality. The bad guys are bad for the sake of being bad, the good guys are plucky underdogs, and there will be plenty of hunting for ancient artifacts. Where this story shines is in the character interactions, which are all very well animated and fun to watch... And surprisingly, you will want to see all these characters' story play out.And that leads me to my biggest bugbear; the ending. To put it simply, there just isn't enough of it, and it leaves on a rather unsatisfying conclusion. It wasn't so terrible that I wanted to curse my purchase, but it was bad enough for me feel very disappointed. Maybe there is another ending buried behind the various collectibles, but I've never been good at hunting all that stuff down, so my best bet is to wait for someone to post a youtube video of it.End of the day though, I'd say this game is worth is picking up, but if you need a satisfying ending...? You may wanna wait for it to go on sale first.TL;DR version: Great game, disappointing ending. If you're fine with that, buy it. If not? Wait for the sale.			",163,15,0,32,7,2,14

												I've never written a review for a game before, but I'm writing this because you need to buy this game. I haven't felt this attached to characters in a game for a very long time. This game brings back the memories of childhood, adventure, friendship, and love. These guys deserve your money, they created a masterpiece. Spend the money. Experience one of the best games of the year.			",114,12,0,2,6,0,12

												This game suffers from mediocre combat and in some parts frustrating level design.  The movement system isn't as much fun as I thought it would be for a game where you can fly from the get-go.  There's very little backtracking and a lack of puzzles for a game of its metroidvania flavor.  Owlboy, however turns out to be more than the sum of its parts.  None of these individual gripes end up being a deal-breaker, and the ups in my opinion far outweigh the downs.  Containing fun characters, a decent story, and easily the best pixel art I've ever seen in a game,  Owlboy is well worth your time.It's perhaps a bit short for $25, but it's a must buy if you can't get enough of the atmosphere of games like Fez and Hyper Light Drifter.  (I didn't mention the music holy ♥♥♥♥ the music) ",268,46,3,35,23,2,31

												By far and away the best game I have ever played. Everything about it is just so, polished. That's the best way I can described this game, polished. A game only gets this perfect when the developers spent 9 years perfecting it. It was worth the wait. The game never feels too difficult, nor does it feel to easy. The music fits the mood of the game and every stage you are at. This game deserves way more recognition than it's getting right now. Please, if you haven't already, play this game. Download it, turn the lights low, crank the volume up, and just submerse yourself into this amazing universe. It was an experience I will never forget. 10/10			",29,3,0,1,0,0,2

												This game is beautiful! I enjoyed this game every bit since i started playing it. Just because it has astonishing pixelated graphics, nice controls and a heartwarming story! Sadly the Story only lasts about 10 hours but it was amazing the whole time.And if you think the price is too high for this game think again because it's worth every cent that you pay and the developers has earned your support by working on this game for 9 years!So what are you waiting for (a price drop?) go and buy it right now! Unless you have a small amount of money then save them and buy this when you become wealthier ;).I would give this game 9/10 even though i thought it was amazing it has it's few flaws like that it's a tad bit too short for my taste but i still had a great time playing it and i think you will have one aswell.

												Owlboy is a 2D puzzle-platformer about an anthropomorphic owl named Otus who finds himself unknowingly in the midst of a cataclysmic disaster millenia in the making. With the assistance of friends he makes along the way, Otus solves puzzles, shoots enemies, defeats monstrous bosses, and unearths dark secrets about the world he lives in.  In terms of gameplay, the only thing that sets it apart from other platformers is Otus' ability to carry one of his companions while in flight. Over the course of the game, you encounter 3 friends who accompany you on your adventure, each of which has a unique ability that can be used to gain access to previously inaccessible areas, solve puzzles, eliminate enemies, and avoid or circumvent obstacles. Although a novel mechanic, it is utilized in generally uninteresting ways, resulting in a gameplay experience that falls a bit flat. The puzzles presented in the game aren't difficult in the slightest, and your companions' abilities are only used in the most surface-level puzzle-solving. Oftentimes, the puzzles come down to: use a companion's ability at this point to progress. Had more of the game's puzzle-solving revolved around switching between companions or combining their abilities in unique ways, the gameplay would have been much more enjoyable. However, this would have required fundamental changes to the story beats and progression as the first two companions are introduced in the first couple hours of the game. The third (and final companion) isn't unlocked until you are in the throes of the game's climax. To make matters worse, over the course of the game you periodically lose a companion, meaning that you only have a full party for what seems like the last hour or so. Despite the narrative justifications for this, it's frustrating that  one of the defining mechanics of Owlboy can only be fully utilized for the last hour or two of the game. The story itself is filled with the charm and whimsy that you would expect from a game like Owlboy. The game's narrative follows Otus as he attempts to save his people from a cataclysmic event which gets increasingly dire as the game progresses. There are some unexpected turns in the story that kept it from being completely predictable, but at the end of the game it was a pretty standard ""save the world from X because ancient people did Y"" narrative you might expect from an animated children's movie. Although it falls victim to some fairly common narrative tropes, the story was compelling enough to keep me engaged and interested for its entirety. Artistically, Owlboy is a masterpiece, and I struggle to think of a more perfect example of pixel-art done right. Whether soaring through the sky towards a floating continent, or dashing through lava-filled caves, every frame is a beautiful pixel-art painting. The environments teem with life as birds fly off into the distance, stars twinkle in the night sky, and the background and foreground slide along in some of the best examples of parallax scrolling I've ever seen. The character sprites and monsters are beautifully animated and brimming with personality that would make even Nintendo green with envy. The entire game is filled with screen-shot worthy moments that were composed with almost absurd attention to detail. Although the artwork in Owlboy is second to none, the soundtrack itself is a wonderful composition of scores that perfectly complement every scene. Lilting clarinets, violins, and cellos accompany Otus on his journey to save the world, instilling a sense of mysticism and serenity that is not often found in games. Unless you're one for scouring every inch of a game in order to collect every single coin imaginable, once you're done with Owlboy there's no reason to come back. There is no ""New Game+"", unlockable content, or multiplayer. That isn't to say that it would need any of that. The journey is a short one at roughly 6-8 hours, but considering the overall shallowness of the gameplay, any longer and it would have been a slog. There's no question as to when the game will come to a close as the story ends in a textbook climactic fashion. With most of the narrative threads being wrapped up in the game's bittersweet conclusion, the ending of Owlboy feels nothing short of satisfying. It's not disappointing, nor is it powerfully moving. Instead it feels absolutely appropriate, a perfectly competent bookend to what was overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Despite the lackluster gameplay and the occasionally frustrating traversal segment, Owlboy has stuck with me. From time to time I'll find myself whistling the main menu music or imagining the blue skies and gently swaying foliage of the introductory area, and I'm immediately reminded of the games from my childhood. 16-bit vibrant landscapes, colorful characters, and comical villain archetypes. Owlboy serves as a rose-tinted lens through which I retrospectively view the games of my childhood. It's nostalgic, charming, and beautiful.

												It's a little to easy, I had no issues beating the game, which is a shame.. I think some adversity is good. Other than that the game is near perfect, I had an amazing time playing it. Owlboy does a perfect job of engrossing you into the game, making you feel apart of the journey. It is a must buy, if your a fan of 2d games of any sort, or games in general. Happy gaming :)			",541,79,2,49,19,2,9

												Overall the game was great.  Good nostalgia, beautiful pixel art, good music, enjoyable story, and for the most part the gameplay was good.  However, there were a few gameplay/design choices that I thought were gimmicky and unnecessary only to try and add some difficulty to the game and just came off as stupid/annoying. You're an owl, there shouldn't be levels that try to use darkness as a way to add difficulty to a level.  You should be able to see. I thought that was a little silly.  Also, there is one boss battle where the map is constantly rotating as is your gamepad direction.  There are a few more design choices like the two I mentioned that just seem pointless and could have been better designed.  Other than that, the game was very enjoyable.			",73,24,0,11,1,0,3

												Pros-Fantastic pixel art-Great soundtrack that's very memorable-Solid level design (for the most part)-Great, ikeable characters-A surprisingly good storyCons-Most of the ""puzzles"" are just finding a certain switch that opens a certain door-I didn't enjoy a single boss fight in this game. They're way too easy and throw out the same attacks over and over and over again. I found that most of the mini-bosses (which are just huge hordes of normal enemies) were harder than the actual bosses-Enemies get pretty boring to fight as circle strafing just completely destroys each and every single one with only a few exceptions-Some enemies/enemy attacks blend right into the background, which gets pretty frustrating really fastOverall, I would give this game a 7.5/10 and would recommend it, despite its flaws.

												This game is simply put: beautiful. From the orchestral soundtrack punctuating every environment and story beat to the gorgeous display of 'hi-bit' pixel art craftsmanship Owlboy is a feast for the senses. It tells a simple story of an owl boy in his village but manages to infuse that story with surprisingly potent emotional arcs with characters who's motivations can change from fun NPC character in a platformer to a cuttingly real motivation of loss and despair, or shame, or unforgiving anger. The game feels tailormade to me in the sense of its artistry and fun platforming mechanics. It's the kind of game I would love to be a part of in the making. If you're anything like me, or even if you just enjoy solid platformers, then you should definitely pick this game up.			",106,19,0,11,1,0,6

												This was a fantastic game, and a lot more satisfying to play than I expected.Owlboy has a beautiful pixelated aesthetic that left me just sitting there staring at the background at times.  The animations are spot on, with expressive characters and enemies.   The music was beautiful and the sound design... well it was okay.The game plays well and I was expecting to find the ""always flying"" gameplay to be dry but the enemy designs kept things interesting.  I found that I struggled with the controls at times, but that was my own issues I'm sure.  I had to play with the right stick settings of my steam controller quite a bit to get a setting that felt right to aim with.The difficulty curve was a bit on the wonky side.  It provided a little challenge for most of the game but then about 2/3 of the way through it goes through the roof for about an hourish and then gets far too easy.  The boss design was nice, and most were fair but challenging.  Once you figured out the patterns it just becomes a problem of execution... which causes some of them to drag on awhile.Overall I like it and will be rejoining the game to find the rest of the coins and investigate a few things I couldn't figure out on my first playthrough.

												Take the moment in Chrono Trigger when you make it to Magus's castle for the first time, and the screen pans up to show you in amazing detail all of the castle. That level of detail blew me away as a kid. Now make an entire game with that level of amazing 2D pixel art. Add great charcters, music, and story. Only downside is the controls can be a little less than intuitive, but it does not ruin the game.			",194,64,3,16,17,1,26

												This is one of the best games I've played of this genre, if not one of the best games I've played in quite some time. The writing and gameplay are both top notch and the music is beyond stellar. The difficulty is perfectly escalated as the game progresses. Everything is literally perfect. Every character has a purpose and even though it's a feel good adventure the game isn't afraid to get dark at times. This is without a doubt the most underrated game out there right now and why it isn't being played more is beyond me.  ",49,14,0,14,3,0,7

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. As you all most likely know it took around nine years to develop and in my eyes it was worth it. Everything about this game is amazing, the graphics (some of the best pixel art I have ever seen), the music, the story, the gameplay. The game was a joy from start to finish, but the ending might have been the best part. Im not going to spoil anything, but I was a little teary-eyed. It has some very unique puzzles and gameplay mechanics. It also has a very interesting story and unlike many other games, I actually cared about the story and lore. It has a wonderful cast of characters and areas to explore. It may not be the biggest or longest games, but it is certainly worth it. Best of all though, is how Otus grows throughout the game.

P.S.: When I have more money I'll buy the soundtrack because I love it...P.S. I'll really miss Solus and Otus (and his gang of course)			",135,21,5,9,9,2,9

												I bought this game not expecting too much for an unknown reason. However I hopped into this game and couldn't put it down for the 6 hours of play time I have. The game's story kept me intruiged while the game play itself was great. The controls felt very clean and crisp on an xbox controller. I fell absolutely in love with the art of this game. It's probably some of the best looking pixel art I've ever seen. Some excellent platforming sections, and dungeons with puzzles all of which inlclude their own unique gimmicks. I love this game, playing it as the first game I've played so far in 2017, I think it's going to be hard to beat.			",107,13,1,15,11,2,10

												I rarely write reviews for games; I think i only did one to get the steam badge, but this game is worth writing a review for. I bought this game because it looked beautiful, and not a single landscape in the game disappointed me. Its very apparent that the programmers put love and detail into this game. Admittedly the controls took a while getting used to; throughout the entire game I found myself trying to press the spacebar to jump instead of pressing W. That along with the lack of a proper sprint button are my only cons for the game. To contrast to that, however, you get hours worth of beautiful places to explore, lovable characters to befriend, and a touching story that will nag at you until you finally beat the game. I can only hope D-Pad Studios next game holds up to the high standard they've set for themselves with this game			",71,3,0,5,2,2,8

												Wow, just wow. This game is amazing. It has really been a while since I played areally good 2D game likte this one. I just got into PC gaming not that long ago, and this was the first game I had in mind. I must say, this game is really worth playing. I currently have about 6hrs into the game, and I have loved every single minute of it. This game has a very solid story that will get you hooked on quite fast, the mechanics of the game and overall controls are amazing and very responsive, the soundtrack is just very pleasing to listen, and the characters themselves are very likeable. As you play this game, you will be immersed in the story and will grow fond of the characters. It is also really cool to see the main character, Otus, growth as the game progresses. Overall, I have really enjoyed this game and will continue to enjoy it. If you are looking for a good 2D/Adventure game with a good story, this is the game for you. Honestly, they even made sort of like an open world place, so they give the ability to explore quite a lot. I highly recommend this game!! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Utterly beautiful in many ways, Owlboy is a great game. It's a good deal of fun while still having a better story than it really has any right to have. The feel of the game is tight and reasonable. It feels more like Cave Story than Ori but generally in a good way. It feels smaller than Ori to me with me not really wanting to return to areas I've been in before. But it's a world that is wonderful to visit with mechanics that were fun throughout. Absolutely a great time.			",139,70,0,12,15,1,22
