												The DRM in this game is both intrusive, and draining on PC resources, and has limited activations to boot.  My CPU usage went from 7% to 100%, which should not happen in an imitation 8-bit game, and prevented me from starting it up a second time after the initial install.  What I did get to play suffered from controls that felt stiff and uncomfortable to use.  Even at 80% off, this is not worth the money.			",70,23,0,10,4,2,3

												The DRM with the 5 machine lifetime activation limit is just unacceptable. The limit was raised to 20 but it really shouldn't have any activation limits that doesn't replenish. The game is alright but the hassle to actually play the thing isn't worth it. Replenishing activations would have been the best move but they likely figured that nobody would ever want to play this game anyway. Low activation limits says to me that even Capcom didn't think it was a very good game.I burned 3 activations just to play it the first time. This was back when it still only had 5 lifetime activations.			",484,117,10,37,63,3,65

												Absolutely terrible DRM. Third-party DRM on top of Steam AND a 5-machine-activation restriction, to this day I have yet to play the game, because it simply won't go past the CD Key activation screen. It returns an ""invalid"" error. The product is nothing short of broken and the 5-machine-restriction is a major publisher practically begging its audience to stay away from its own product. Do not buy, despite the low price-tag, unless you feel adventurous enough to deal with its technical baggage on the customer.PS: I would like a refund, Capcom. Otherwise, we're done.

												I rarely write reviews but wanted to shed some light for the ""Activation key"" problems that people were having...Credits go to this article from the community hub -http://steamcommunity.com/app/45730/discussions/0/613940109841685105/In short -Report problem to https://www.fuzeqna.com/capcomsupport/consumer/question.aspFrom Level 1 Dropdown - Select ""PC""From Level 2 Dropdown - Select ""Dark Void Zero""- Provide your serial key with explaination- take snapshot (I used Window's snipping tool) of your activation error and also snapshot of Steam's receipt.Within the next day, Capcom's customer support responded and activated my key from SecuROM's database.  Now for the actual review of the game itself -After only playing this game for an hour, I would say that it was worth my $1 from steam's capcom sale.It has a nice classic, retro feel reminiscent of my childhood NES days.I will say that the controls are rather clunky which provides challenge of playing this game.The game allows you to map the controls on your gamepad and also switch to fullscreen (thru menu option or pushing ALT+Enter).Very simplistic and easy to pick up.Reminds me of a mash-up between Metroid and Contra.I only recommend this game for it being only $1 and having the will/courage to go through the trouble of activating your key.

												I like hard platformers but this one is hard for the wrong reasons. Basically you have only 3 lifes and if you run out you have to restart the whole level again(and each level is pretty big). If you make it to the second level with no lifes left, then you have to  beat that level without dying once or you have to restart the whole game and try to make it to the second level with more lifes.I got 99% in Super Meat Boy, because it's a fun and challenging game. With Dark Void Zero i gave up in the second level. Not because it was too hard but because it punishes failure too hard and doesnt respect my time.			",125,19,4,8,5,0,19

												I've played many 8 bit games in my day and I'm surprised on how well this one plays and handles with my controller. The music has that 8 bit Capcom feel to it when they designed their games. The objectives in the game are fairly simple to accomplish but there are portions of the game that may frustrate you. Kind of cool at the beginning too that you have to press on a button to blow on the cartridge to make it work, and also the reference to TV star Jimmy Fallon in the game. Graphically , yes it's retro but it's easily worth the X amount of dollars paid for , and even more so when its on sale. I just wish the activation mechanism was taken away as it's not easy to deauthorize a game without customer support these days :(			",276,99,12,30,29,4,26

												Abysmal. Dark Void Zero came out around the same time Megaman 10 did, trying to ride on the faux-retro wave Capcom had going. Unlike Megaman 9 and 10, which simply emulated Megaman 2's style, Capcom tried to make a unique gameplay style here. It didn't end well. The controls are finicky and hard to use gracefully, and the gameplay is just a slog, having to go back and forth every-which-way to get keycards and killing the same borning respawning enemies. Go play Section Z or Action in New York instead.			",759,206,29,90,55,11,99

												Very hard, often punishingly so. A perfect recreation of an 8-bit side-scroller, complete with the niggling issues that made those games so frustrating. 3 lives, no continues. So you die 3 times, you start again. Janky controls that end up getting you stuck on walls, shooting into mid air and trapped in corners. The enemies can take much less damage than you but that's about their only weakness. Constantly and almost immediately respawning, it's clear the developers had little imagination as to where the game would go and instead made one intensely hard level that with enough practise you could likely complete in around 30 minutes. Problem is, I don't have the will to memorize enemy locations and wrestle with outdated controls to actually get that far.			",158,34,0,31,18,0,49

Unless you are very good at these types of games, you'll want to play this on Easy mode (there are 3 difficulties) because it remains fairly difficult. There are only 3 levels apparrantly, but the game requires a hefty amount of skill to simply get past the first level. In fact, after 4 hours of trying I wasn't able to get past the first level's boss.			",354,56,17,30,10,2,29

												This game requires you to register with SecuROM. Another annoying DRM service. Upon first attempt, this did not work for me. Double DRM is extremely annoying, but even more annoying is games that don't work. However, an email to SecuROM solved the issue, took a day for them to respond, now the game works fine.Don't let the DRM issue keep you from buying this game. If you're a fan of NES games, this is a game you'll want to pick up. As annoying as it was to have to make the game work, it wasn't in any way difficult. One email and a bit of time, now I'm one more sweet game richer for it.I'd say that was a $1 well spent.			",764,198,12,66,52,5,89

												Key will not activate.  Jumped through all the hoops with Capcom customer support to try to get the key added to the database, and they just locked me out of my account on the customer support page with no way to contact anyone.  Capcom customer service is TERRIBLE.  DO NOT BUY THIS.  DON'T EVEN BOTHER IF IT'S FREE.Edit:  I have changed this review in response to a gesture from Steam Customer Support.  They have offered me a credit along with removal of this title from my library.THANK YOU, STEAM/VALVE.   I won't say another bad word about customer support. Capcom has not earned it yet.

												2015 Review! - TL;DR version - SecuROM problems resolved - play it now - GET THIS GAME!I held off reviewing this game after purchasing due to the fact that SecuROM was having issues. I am happy to say those issues have been resolved and you can now play Dark Void Zero after inputting your serial. Still sucks we have to deal with third party DRM but its better than no game at all! Simply put Dark Void Zero is leaps and bounds better than the original game on which it is based. This is a super retro style game wherein it definitely feels and plays like a classic 8 bit NES game of yesteryear. You can jump and shoot and with the use of your trusty jetpack, fly and hover. Its a challenging and fun game with a decent (if not silly) story. If you like retro style games but they never quite feel retro enough...this game is for you!PS: Disregard my playtime. I played this game to near completion on my 3DS and just wanted to try it out on the big screen with surround sound and it plays exactly the same! Controller reccommended btw!

												let us list the reasons this game should not be purchased for any price-the moment you boot up the game, you're hit with a securom security code thingymadoodle.this doesn't even work and in most cases won't even let you into the game.the security thingy only gives you a few licenses so, even though you paid for the game with your own money, you're limited to how many times you download the game.if you happen to get past all the security stuffs, the game is awful. it has terrible controls and the graphics look less pixelated and more compressed JPEG.have fun kids.

												The control is the biggest problem, but the sloppy design, blurry scaling (there is no native rez for this game, only fullscreen and windowed), sloppy framerate, weird hitboxes, and trolly trial-and-error level design also contribute.Never once do I feel that I am in proper control, able to effectively fight the enemies. I feel like a toddler trying to do heart surgery; there is NO way I'll ever be able to do anything precise.The weapons are generally uninspired, the story is totally DGAF, and the rocket pack handles like♥♥♥♥♥♥To top that off, you NEVER recorver your lives from stage to stage or on load, so if you use them all in the first stage (and you probably will, what with the insta-kill lava pits that you can't see because the lower 1/5 of the screen is obscured by your ""notifications"" EVERY SINLGE TIME you get an item), you will have NO lives for the second stage. Or third. You can't get 1-Ups from enemies. TL;DR - This game was NOT well planned, and though I spent $0.99 on it, I feel as if even THAT was too much.0.5/10			",76,5,1,5,3,1,2

For the 80's gamers it will be a blast from the past. It's not an ""unforgiven"" game it has difficulty levels so you can probably avoid fustration (unlike with the real hard NES games). So far so great.			",314,74,5,31,6,1,13

So you'll die at least a few times. The graphics remind me of the 90's 2D games; charming and stylish.

												The origins of this game, whether they are true or not, certainly ring true after having played the game. The reason being, this game handles as if it was designed in the early days of platforming, when game creators hadn't quite gotten the hang of how things should handle.The movement of your character isn't abysmal, but using the jetpack is far from the joy it is in the previous (or...  later?) Dark Void game.  You can hold the jump button down to rocket, which is OK for going up, but the delay makes coming down tricky to control, or you double tap, which is probably the preferred method but has some weird quirks, like a slight bob that makes aiming while hovering trickier than it should be.  The controls overall feel oddly unresponsive. This combines with moving, which re-adjusts your aim, making you have to do a lot of fiddly jiggering to really point the way you want.  All the while, getting blasted by aliens.  This could have been fine if it were a dual stick shooter instead, but the way it is makes dodging and firing a real chore if you want to be safe.And you do want to be safe.  Because if you take a lot of damage, you WILL have a ""low health"" alert.  That goes on and on.  And is annoying.  This just adds to the likelyhood that this game really was created in the 80s.The entire first level consists of collect keycard, open next door, collect another keycard, which is OK, but again, makes it feel dated.  I got to the first boss, and promptly lost all my lives.  And yes, since this is claiming to be an arcade game, having lives makes sense, but it feels just like worthless punishment here.For a bonus, while it's not the WORST music, it sounds like Mega Man cast-offs to me, uninspiring stuff that didn't make the cut for their better tracks.I guess for me, they either really found this game and decided to do absolutely no modernization, or they concocted a story meant to play on nostalgia and went out of their way to make it play poorly.  I really hope it's the first, which is forgivable.  The thing about nostalgia is that, people would have had to play the game before now to have nostalgia for it.  Either way, poor mechanics without the memories to back them up are a disappointment, and make this game overall not worth it to me.			",219,123,2,27,26,1,29

												Pretty accurate NES-style demake game that's better than the actual Dark Void! On the DS version you actually had to blow on the mic to to make the cartridge work.It goes for real cheap during sales, so you have no excuse not to get it.			",314,86,8,38,32,2,24

												Dark Void Zero really shouldn’t be as good as it is, but for what it is, a small venture through a couple of levels for a few bucks, it works. While the controls can often be stiff and the game itself short; it still works well to capture the rough and tumble days of NES gaming with its wonderful chiptune music, graphics, and challenging gameplay.

												My review in numbers so far (only played first level):Music: 7/10Controls: 9/10Difficulty: 6/10Retrofactor: 10/10This game feels like playing Megaman or Metroid again, as I did as a child on the NES... This game is NOT that clunky and hard as everyone else here seems to think... The other gamers probably have not played the NES games back in the 80s... The controls are awesome, sure it takes like 30 seconds to get the hang of the jetpack but then it becomes 2nd nature.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm loving this game! It's like I'm back in the 90's playing NES or a good old arcade box! Dark Void Zero is all that was great in those games, and yes, that includes the difficulty and all the frustrations of trying to clear the game! The music alone is a massive dose of nostalgia, gameplay is reminiscent of Contra or... well... I forgot. It has been a while since then! Anyway, this is a must for anyone who grew up playing games in the 90's, and a good lesson to y'all whippersnappers what good games used to be like.			",1359,491,48,184,161,14,237

												Dark Void Zero is a final push by capcom to cash in on retro gaming and quite frankly I find it a complete waste of time. The Nes era has come and gone so what exactly is the point of designing such a game in the modern era? Sure leader-board and achievements is all fine and dandy, but what about the gameplay and longevity? There is no randomization in the game, spawn points are the exact same in every playthrough, level and monster creativity isn’t really anything to write home about, and the game is insanely short at only 2-3 hours. The only reason to play this beyond the first playthrough is to score higher and get achievements. If this game was released 20 years ago it would still get outclasses my Metroid, releasing it today to compete against modern platformers and it would get outclassed by everything. If you are considering getting this game, get Capsized instead; same♥♥♥♥♥♥ better play value.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Absolute garbage. Even though it's in my favorite genre, this game has so many flaws its impossible for me to like it. For one thing, yes, it's an NES Homage, but the game design seems to be from the same era - dying just to restart the whole damn game isn't fun at all, especially in a genre about EXPLORATION you are PUNISHED for exploring. Don't let me get started about the atrocious platforming mechanics either.Do not make the mistake I made and do NOT buy this game.			",131,32,2,9,5,1,11

After upgrading to 10, I gave it another try and it worked. Don't know if the OS change fixed it or not, but it's working. This game is a ton of fun and better than the other, modern, Dark Void. It's like this game actually came out on the SNES. I have more fun with this than most modern AAA games released. Why can't Capcom just make games like this? Only complaint is the DRM.

												Dark Void Zero brings back the classic ""NES difficulty"", where games were short but hard as balls to beat.Besides the difficulty, it also captures the rest of the 8-bit feeling perfectly. Play this for a couple of hours straight and you'll probably think that you were playing some obscure NES game on an emulator this whole time.The levels follow the old ""get keycards, open new part of level, repeat until end of level is reached"" formula. This is then layered on with hard enemies and deliciously kind-of-frustrating controls (it's more frustrating when you're using the jetpack power-up, when you're on foot, the controls are actually extremely simple and straight-forward).As if this wasn't enough to make it a controller smashing game, there aren't any continues. You die 3 times (or more, since there are 1UPs through the levels) and you gotta start the level all over again and get the keycards again.Buy it, play it, do whatever you want with it.EDIT: !!READ THIS PART, PLEASE!! --- I forgot to mention something that some people love to complain about because... I dunno, they just do (I understand the frustration this brings, but calm yourselves. If this is a dealbreaker for many of you, then what in the actual ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you?). There is an extra layer of DRM on this game, aside from Steam. The overall hated SecuROM.This piece of DRM imposes a set number of times your game can be activated. There's a limit of 20 activations now since Capcom raised the number, instead of the 5 activations it had before.>>NOW THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART!<<: There's a way you can avoid using the activations. Before you uninstall the game for whatever reason, do this: right-click the game on your Steam library, go to ""Properties"" and then ""Set launch options"", write ""/revoke"" (without the quotation marks, of course) and RUN THE GAME (you must do this before uninstalling it!!)... and now you're safe to uninstall it without losing one of the activations!Have fun without having to worry about the DRM!Oh, and one more thing: whatever is said about SecuROM using the CPU like crazy is NOT true.

They should have polished the controls more before releasing this as it could have been a better experience.This game is Bangai-O meets a fakebit Game Maker Studio game.

												When I played Dark Void Zero for the first time, I WAS SO SURE that it is an old game from NES. It lasted for the moment when I tried to find it on some NES related websites and found nothing. What does that mean? Dark Void Zero have an amazing atmosphere and while playing, it really feels like old game. It bring so many good memories, when platformer games were simply and fun. It's not a long game, have only 3 levels and 3 boss fights, and if you are not begginer when it comes to this genre, you can complete this game in 1 hour. Is it hard? At first, on hard difficult level, but once you learn how to deal with enemies and boss, it will be piece of cake. I guess that's most fun thing in such a games. I can recommend this game to every platformer games fan, it's a great game.ABOUT SecuROM DRM - not only the activation limit was raised up to 20 times, but you can also revoke activation limit in this game, check the guide in community hub. Still, it sucks that game which already have a DRM (Steam) are using another one, just to make lifes of us, gamers, harder.			",1735,714,60,244,224,20,321

												A nice little throwback to the NES days. It is far too short, though, even for its price tag of $5. If it's ever on sale, fans of the genre can pick it up for a little over 3 hours of entertainment. Take my advice and play it with an XBox controller or something similar with a comparable D-pad.
