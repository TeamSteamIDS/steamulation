												剧情还是和前作那样有趣搞笑，游戏系统和前作没有本质上的变化，玩法上仅仅是多了开船和多结局。Fun and happy as usual, but the game system still simple as usual too. Now you can sail and choose your ending.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They say more of the same about this game. Yes it is, but hey: Deathspank is a great game already. So more of it wouldn't hurt, would it? I personally enjoyed the both and recommend them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												...in a life's journey paved in blood, and steel, and bacon...This game is the definition of 'hilarious'. There are so many great jokes and fun moments in this game, you simply can't stop playing it. Of course the gameplay, art style, musics and voice acting being really good helps too. I strongly recommend both this and the first one. They're both equally funny and awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deathspank Thongs of Virtue. More of the same. Exactly the same. Same gameplay, Same UI, Same items. Same enemies. More thongs. Many more thongs.As much as a sequel can often be completely worthless because in an attempt to innovate and streamline it loses what made the original so great the opposite is also true. A sequel that does nothing new whatsoever will often feel hollow and foolish.Deathspank Thongs of virtue is one such sequel. It's a very simple action RPG that relies heavily on a quirky sense of humor that attempts to poke fun at the RPG genre in general. Unfortunately while the humor and silly art-style could carry the first game both have been worn quite thin by now and you are left with just the shallow action RPG that form the base of Deathspank's gameplay.Nothing has changed other than the story and if you have already played the original Deathspank this won't be much different.You should note, this game has a game breaking bug that corrupts your savegame if you exit the game at certain locations. The developers fixed the bug but never shared the update on STEAM. You have go find it yourself on the Steam forums and manually fix your savegame. Guess EA is rubbing off on them.Not really a game I'd recommend buying if you already played Deathspank. If you're new to the series you can safely pick either although playing both will be a stretch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue is a terrific game.  The exploring and adventure of the maps is extremely fun, and the dialogue is even better.  It is a goofy game, but it is not so goofy that it ruins the finer points of the game.  It is just the right amount of ridiculousness mixed with the right amount of seriousness (in the missions) to be a perfect game.  Also, this game has virtually no bugs (at least I have not noticed any), and the gameplay is extremely fun.  I bought this game 4 years ago, and never got around to playing it until this past Saturday.  When I started playing it Saturday, I immediately got hooked.  I am usually not interested in RPG/Adventure type games, but this game just blew me away.  In my opinion, if you like RPGs, you should buy this game immediately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was happy to hear more DeathSpank would be coming. Thongs Of Virtue is basically more of the same, which is great. The new content includes new weapons (assault rifles, bazookas, etc.), enemies and of course many environments to explore, but the formula stays the same. It also has a great deal of fetch quests and grinding, which can be kind of tedious if you play longer sessions, but all things considered, Thongs Of Virtue is on par with its predecessor!Personal playtime total: 20 hours			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly it dont find this game to be any better than the first one if any thing i personally found the first game more fun.That being said  this game was still very fun to play albeit slightly more difficult than the first.The classic deathspank humour is still here and is just as good as before the story line is funny which i love the game play is for the most part very smooth (some little problems here and there)Bearly anything was changed this game other than the introduction of grenades and guns for the most part the weapon types are exactly the same and i liked that.The biggest problem i have with this game is the sudden difficulty spike that happens out of nowhere early on the same problem was in the first game as well as in both games i found leveling was tediously slow at the start and you kept getting rewards in the ways of new weapons and armour that are a level above what you currently are at the time and then you get shoved in to fighting enemies that can basically 2 hit kill you. Best thing i  found was to lure 1 enemy away form the rest kill it and repeat. If you have a friend with you who can play that makes it much easier ( the rainbow heal)once you can muscle past the difficulty spike the game goes back to having the proper difficulty curve it should have and continues feeling fair againAnother problem i had was teleporting with the outhouses the 10second odd wait after you teleport before you can move gets annoying as it throws you out of the flow of playing.Overall 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the stupid humor in this game. I love the stupid quests and stupid story. And I love the stupid characters.But the gameplay is weak. The combat system is clunky, repetitive, boring after a while. There will come a time when the fun from the humor will be defeated by the weak mechanics. After the that point, the game becomes bigger and bigger pain.I would buy it on sale and enjoy it while the fun lasts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DeathSpanks forte is the dialogue, but since I played the first game recently I found myself clicking myself through it a bit too fast in this follow-up. The added feature of ranged weapons would be nicer if the range wasn't ridiculous compared to blast radius and if you could actually see a longer distance in maps. I found myself dying more from my own grenades than anything else due to the extremely poor handling of such items. Still, it was a worthwhile playthrough with a nice conclusion to the Thong story.

												Picking up where the first game left off this Deathspank contains the same ridiculous humour. The game play is quite altered by the use of a huge number of consumable items, including ranged weapons and the corresponding lack of consistantly usable versions of the same. The story makes it all worth it though and despite the odd annoyances I fought to the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Dispenser of Justice, Vanquisher of Evil, and Hero to the Downtrodden, DeathSpank, is back! This time our hero journeys on the quest for the Thongs of Virtue. The game embodies a variety of classic RPG elements, tons of loot, quests and the same humorous touch we got used to in the first episode. If you liked the first DeathSpank, you'll also enjoy this one. + Funny storyline + Funny take on protagonist + Classic RPG elements+ Tons of loot, quests, and a multitude of equipment combos/sets+ Easy Achievements+  Local Co-op- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)Personal Ranking: 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is funny, it's true. However, the game's humour gets old quickly and the gameplay is just too simple to be fun. After some hours, all that is left is an endless grind with some funny and some boring one-liners. I would like to recommend this game, but I can't - the gameplay is just too dull.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Weakest in the series so far.  Quests are scattered, leading to a lot of backtracking and confusion when you get a quest you can't complete for another solid ten levels.But, if you played the first one and liked it, you should play this one before The Baconing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
