												It's exactly what it looks like. A good idea that's been hammered and melded and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized by the publisher to resemble the games that were all the rage in 2007. The cover based third person shooter. The modern military shooter. More zombies yay.The thing is the concept alone was enough to bring this on a slightly higher level. It's a♥♥♥♥♥♥port, so that brings it back down.Still, if you play and enjoy warframe, this should shed some light on quite a few things. After all, Warframe is the game Digital Extremes were trying to make when they made this one. I personally LOVE warframe, so seeing little recognizable things here and there keep me playing. It's--It's kinda like the videogame equivalent of Agents of Shield. It's the content you go to the movies for, but filered through layers upon layers of bureaucracy and rushed out the door... But the chunks of the cool stuff the creators wanted to create make the whole thing a bit more special. What's the moral of the story? Publishers ruin everything.tl;dr: If you like Warframe, play it. If you like Gears of War, play it. If you have a soft spot for the early last gen titles of 2007, which was arguably the golden year of that gen, give this a shot. If you're not tied to any of these, this game will do absolutely nothing for you.			",238,9,7,9,5,2,1

												Interesting concept, but flawed game. It's not that is bad or anything. It's fun, but it could have been so much more than it is. The things that made this game ""fail"":1-It tried to fit itself within the fads of it's time (AKA feel like a Gears of War knock-off) rather than try to have it's own thing.2-The upgrade and weapon marketing system it's just there to make you look for bonus items and money, making the campaign a bit longer (hint: play the game only using the single handed guns, it plays waaay better)3-Fighting the soldiers is more interesting than fighting the mutants, but in most of the time, you fight the mutants.4-The campaing was too short (especially if you ignore the bonus hunting).5-The story is a mess of events and characthers that you don't see most of it. Who is Yago, what's the beef with Nadia, what I did in the past that was so horrible and haunts me to this day? none of these are answered.But, I still recommend it: tons o' fun, each single handed weapon (the pistol, the sub-machinegun, the revolver and the sawed-off shotgun) complety changes the way you aproach a level, and at many times, you'll feel like a boss when completing a mission. In short: this game coulda been awesome, but it's just... good.			",62,9,0,1,1,0,5

												I'm going to go ahead and rate this as a game alone because as a 360/ps3 port it sucks. With multiple posts in the discussion about ways to fix graphical issues. I still could not manage to calibrate this game to my exact monitor resolution and ended up having to run the game way below my specs. None the less! As a game Dark Sector can be really fun. As you progress through the game you will unlock more weapons, get to ride four legged tanks, acquire more elements for your glaive (blade boomerang), and go from having just your arm infected to having a full blown exo suit! The storyline can be mildly forgettable (Big Bad Guy who wants all the power) but the game makes up for it with it's dark atmosphere, crisp power suit design, and responsive combat situations. Now I don't know about picking up the game at full price as there are a lot of other games out there with far more modern features on them. Though when the next sale comes around and the game drops down to 50% off. I highly suggest you purchase it as it is a fun little time waster and the combat system and lore within helped pave the way towards ""Warframe"" which is one of the top played games on Steam.

												Dark Sector is a game clearly designed for console play (xbox 360) which means a few things: The graphics are good, simplified controls, and checkpoint style saving. The gameplay is actually very much like Resident Evil 5 & 6. The first thing you should do is make a modification to the games config file DS.cfg and insert the line below (if you have a 16:9 resolution monitor):Graphics.DisplayAspectRatio=FullScreen4x3The game was messed up in converting to Windows and the 4x3 is actually 16:9. If you don’t make this change the screen resolution will stretch weirdly, and cut things off at the edges, unless you keep the resolution at 800x600. The game’s story is not fully explained, kind of like starting to watch a movie halfway through.  You play Hayden Tenno, some kind of international secret agent sent to the former Soviet country of Lasria to find and stop an evil guy (scientist?) named Mezner. Apparently Mezner is trying to spread a virus that converts people into mindless zombies and eventually mutates them into armored creatures. Unfortunately for you (or maybe fortunately) you get infected pretty early on and have access to a kind of drug that slows the infection while still keeping you from going insane like the other zombies. The virus still gives you powers though, such as a throwing glaive that pops up out of nowhere, and the ability to absorb the powers of some of the boss mutants you fight.As I mentioned earlier, the game is very similar to the later Resident Evil games. For example it’s a third person “over the shoulder” view and the default movement is walking. You need to hold a sprint button to run, and hold a button to “prepare” your gun for firing. There are a number of weapons in the game which you can pick up from fallen (human) enemies but they all have an electronic device that disables the gun after about 15 seconds. That means you need to find another gun or stick to your personal pistol + glaive. The glaive is a large spiked throwing star (like the Predator throwing weapon in Alien vs. Predator) that you throw at enemies and flies back to your hand. It can be pretty powerful, killing most human enemies in one shot if you charge it up. It’s also used for various puzzle solving since it can pick up “elements” such as fire, lightning, and ice. Most of the puzzles are pretty obvious once you recognize what’s needed, but your first playthrough you might think you’re stuck a few times. The game doesn’t have a map or objective tracker so if you somehow get turned around, you might not know you’re going in the wrong direction.Regarding the firearms in the game, you can actually buy permanent weapons from an underground black market arms dealer. These guns have no automatic disable lock and can be upgraded with “kits” that you find as collectibles throughout the game. These kits are one time use and do specific upgrades such as increase damage, fire speed, or clip size. You also find rubles (money) throughout the game and use it for your gun purchases. Bear in mind that both the rubles and the upgrade kits are limited. You will only get enough to buy 2-3 guns even if you know exactly where all the money is in the game. You’ll probably find more upgrade kits than you’ll ever use though (guns can only be upgraded a few times), just make sure you find the ones you want (damage and fire speed!). Side note here, the gun turrets that you can commandeer at various points in the game are practically useless. In most games when you jump on a mounted gun, you can kick some♥♥♥♥♥until you need to move on. I don’t know if it’s because the damage is low or if it’s just wildly inaccurate (old style iron sight), but when you’re using one of these turrets, it takes like 20 seconds of spraying to kill anything. When the enemies use it, they can kill you in a couple seconds if you don’t get to cover. And yes, I did try using short bursts instead of just holding down the fire button.If you’ve tried the Free to play game Warframe, you may recognize the hero’s name Tenno and the design of the armored creature that he’s slowly transforming into. The same game developer created both games so you can kind of think of Warframe as the distant future of Dark Sector. Pros:+Interesting glaive weapon is used throughout the entire game even though it doesn’t really get “stronger.” Not overpowered, and not too weak. The various elements can look pretty cool, like throwing a flaming glaive will catch your victims in a fiery explosion.+I enjoy horror games with hordes of zombies and interesting boss mutants. The bosses have weaknesses that you need to learn and exploit. You can’t just fire all your bullets at them. There is no difficulty setting in the game, and it can get pretty challenging at certain portions near the end.Cons:-This is one of those games which can give you a headache visually the first few times you play it. This may have something to do with the dark (almost black & white) game environment, and the slow movement speed (when you sprint, the environment kind of blurs a little around you).-Despite the fact that you can pick up guns from dead guys, there really aren’t that many kinds of guns. And the limited money you have means you will probably need to save up for a while to buy the “best” gun. That means you’re stuck with pistol + glaive for most of the game. If you just buy the first guns available, you’ll be missing out.-The game can be kind of buggy. If I alt+tab out, I have trouble getting back into the game window. There are a couple times you get into a power armor/walker and the button to exit doesn’t work. Not sure what’s going on there. Also, the game’s visual resolution setting I mentioned at the start really should have been fixed in a patch. I would recommend a controller to play the game, except that when you’re using a gun, aim is very important and I have poor control using my xbox controller. Even with my mouse, I miss a lot when shooting at distant enemies. There is only one sniper rifle in the game, and it’s the only gun where your aim drifts around when you’re looking through the scope (for realism). I don’t know who thought that was a good idea. Overall though, I’d say give this game a try if you got it in one of the Bundle Stars bundles a few months back.  It’s not horrible but there’s definitely room for improvement. The game takes about 7 hours to complete. ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												Personally, I enjoyed this game. The graphics, in my opinion, were relatively good, not very bad, though I tend not to be able to judge graphics very well, so, take that as you will. The enemy AI was relatively simple, typically they would just use cover, some would throw a grenade, some had shields and machetes so they would charge you, the AI overall wasnt too special, but not too bad in my opinion. The boss fights were all pretty simple, but still somewhat challenging, again, not too special, but not too bad. I found the glaive to be a fun and useful weapon throughout the entire game, being able to steer it mid-flight, throw it through fire, ice, or electricity to give it that element, and then explode that element if you wanted, and time your throws to do a power-throw, which did quadruple damage. The enemies were usually easy to deal with, except near the middle and end of the game, where there were a lot of them, doing a lot of damage, and taking a lot of damage. Though there were some problems with the resolution, which can be fixed through editing in the game's data, and a lot of issues with the controls, in some cases not even telling you how to exit a certain vehicle, *The key is X, by the way.* I still enjoyed this game overall. I got this game because of my interest in Warframe, and if you are interested in Warframe, or are just interested in Dark Sector itself, I recommend getting this game.			",154,13,0,8,11,0,19

												Okay, i admit i haven't touched this game in a while but that is because i keep playing the MMO sequel (well the Devs did say that Hayden was the OG Tenno for that game.)The game itself feels fluid in its movements and in my opinion has aged well.The story is engaging to me as it has conspiracy written all over it where the protagonist is always caught in the middle, clawing his way out of the filth and lies.The graphics are great and i simply fell in love with how the Glaive system works and seeing it slicing through your enemies is really satisfying to see.I'm satisfied with the optimization options as well as the graphical setting options that it has, it is also a very interesting concept and take on the TPS genre.Whether you pick it up on sale or in a bundle, its gonna be a fun ride. It is well worth the full retail price IMHO8/10 Should play again. ",426,66,10,61,38,5,34

												As a veteran player with over 1,000 hours on Warframe, I HIGHLY reccomend this game. You get to see the past of the first Tenno and warframe; how awesome is that?! I haven't beaten the game yet so I can't say much lore-wise, but I feel like warframe players would love it just because you get to see how the warframes and tenno came to be. Essentially, this is where the story all began, and I think its cool seeing how it evolved.*Edit:   After beating the story-mode/maingame/whatever u wanna call it, I think it was cool. Maybe because I played Warframe before playing Dark Sector made me think highly of it, but who knows; maybe I'm actually a flying ninja squirrel with the power to make ice-cream-filled gummy bears fall from the sky and cause chaos by attacking civillians with their base-ball cannons. Essentially what I'm trying to say is, I loved the game, but even for those who may not like it for who knows what reason,(aftr reading a few other reviews seems like some didn't think too highly of the storyline,) you may enjoy it if you're a Warframe player just because you get to see origins of the frames and you can also see how the game of Dark Sector evolved into Warframe.

												Dark Sector is a pretty repetitive game. The story isn't that great and some of the later enemies aren't all that fun to fight. So why even get this game? Because killing goons with the glaive is all you really need to do to have fun in this game. I guess it's worth it if you want to see where Warframe came from.There is also a window mode! You just need to edit the DS and Editor configs.The DS should include this: [Windows_Config,/Types/Config]App.DefaultCmdLine=""-nop -client -silent""Client.KeyBindings=Windows_KeyBindingsGraphics.FullScreen=0Graphics.FullScreenSizeX=800Graphics.FullScreenSizeY=600Graphics.ToggleResetDevice=0Sound.EnableEAX=0The Editor should include this:[MainGameWindowed,/Editor/WinRect]PosX=5PosY=32SizeX=1280SizeY=720			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Sector is from one of my favourite dev team, Digital Extremes (DE). Too bad I just recently played this game.Well I didn't know anything about the game except the old trailers about a guy in a suit sabotaging a space station. Then they didn't annouce PC version just console one and I didn't bother to look after the game. Few weeks ago I played it and here's my opinion!So the game changed so much since the old 2004 trailer but it's still a lot of fun. At first I didn't know what is this all about. Looked like a Metal Gear game but later it turned out to be a Resident Evil game. Especially simmilar to RE4. It's a standard 3rd person shooter game with over the shoulder view. The gameplay changes when you get the Technocyte virus and you gain access to the Glave. The Glave is a powerfull all purpose weapon you can throw and melee with. You can throw it into fire, ice barrels and electric boxes to steal thir effect. So you can electrocute,freeze, and ignite enemies. These elemental effects are also play big part in puzzles.You have a pistol at first and a secoday weapon which you can pick up from fallen enemies. Later in the game you can find upgrade packs like +accuracy, +punch, double fire and so on. These upgrades are cool but you have limited slots for your weapons. The bad thing is that you can't buff your Glave and most of the time you only use the Glave not the secondaries. So my suggestion is to buy stuff for your pistols. The enemy variaty is wide. You fight agains regular soldiers, shield guards, heavy soldiers and a large selection of infested citizens and soldiers. The only big problem I have is the movement. It is really stiff. You can't jump, crouch and you can't turn or strafe while sprinting. Also the levels are stuffed with invisible walls and there are not many secrets. Other problem is the melee system. you can't move while doing it and you have to wait 'til the animation is finished. Also there is only one execution move / enemy. Also a little problem that you have one button for many things like melee/vault/action...So yeah it's clearly a console game ported to the PC but at least we have it. The game lasts like 6 or 7 hours and has a lot of great moments. I recommend it when it's on sale. Pros: Horror Scifi elements The wepons are cool and the Glave has solid mechanics Story is good but not rly original Challenging situations Wide enemy varietyCons: Staight console port Clunky controlls Limited movement Some minor bugs Invisible walls ",240,35,7,9,10,3,17

												This game is surprisingly good. If you are a fan of Resident Evil 4 or 5, or a fan of Dead Space, then you will enjoy this game. Although it is a little rough around the edges, Dark Sector is a gem that is severely underrated.Gameplay: The game plays like other third-person shooters. It is cover based, so you will spend most of the game with your back against a chest-high wall while bullets fly all over the place. The weapons are pretty standard fare; you have some pistols, submachine guns, and some assault rifles. As you progress, you can find upgrades hidden throughout the levels that will let you augment your weapons at the black market dealer, as well as purchase entirely new ones. The most unique feature of this game is the Glaive, which is more or less a frisbee made out of sharp blades. You gain access to it after the tutorial level, and throughout the game you will gain new abilities, such as guiding it in flight or having it conduct electricity or fire. Guiding the Glaive through the air and slicing into enemies is very, VERY rewarding. Boss fights often center around using the Glaive to exploit a weakness of your enemy. Also, the Glaive can be used to pick up enemy weapons and ammunition from a distance, which is rather nice. As far as exploration goes, the game is very linear, with some puzzle solving here and there.Story: The story for this game is average, nothing out of the ordinary. You play as Hayden, a special agent who becomes infected with a virus that changes him into....well, you get the point, right? Your infection grants you superhuman abilities, and the Glaive as well. Aside from that, it's a decent storyline that gets the job done.Graphics: This game looks rather nice, maybe a little dated now, though. The enemies look good, and the envirnments are rather appeasing as well.Overall, this game is well worth the money. At only $10, it's a steal. If it goes on sale, then you should definitely think about purchasing it. However, you don't have to wait until it's on sale to buy it. If you want a game that is in the same field as games like Resident Evil, or Gears of War, then look no further. It also doesn't just copy and paste those games, but rather it goes in it's own direction.			",356,53,1,50,31,0,48

												The first thing the main character says is ""I don't want to be here"" and after the first chapters (boring levels, boring weapons, boring story and complicated controls) I wonder if by ""here"" he means the game. If so then I'm glad I'm not alone. But it gets better when he finally gets his special powers - the main character remains unlikable (almost on purpose), but using his glaive and various powers is very cool and gory.The game, in general, is a pleasant enough distraction for any fan of action or shooting games, if you look for a good/average story, don't bother. I only recommend this game because it was the stepping stone for Warframe.

												In my eyes this game is really underrated, a flawed piece of art. While it has quite some issues involving the PC port, some minor bugs here and there and the animations aren't quite there with some cutscenes, but HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥THE GAMEPLAY IS AWESOME!!!!The story is really meh, it's all over the place,  the writing isn't particulary good and the voice acting could be better. Basically you're this guy named Hayden who comes to this one place with a mission but before he manages to complete it, he gets infected and gains really awesome powers and you also have to stop this Mezner guy (who looks a lot like the main antagonist from Crash Bandicoot). Honestly this story looks like an excuse for you to be running around as a dude with really cool powers, but it doesn't really matter since YOU'RE A ♥♥♥♥ING DUDE RUNNING AROUND WITH REALLY COOL POWERS.Which brings us to the elephant in the room when it comes to this game and that is the glaive. It's what defines this game as BADASS! As you progress, you get more and more powers involving your infection and some of them are for the glaive, you can throw the glaive around and control it in mid air to slice your enemies more precisely when it comes to the limbs and hear their screams of agony! You can also apply elements to it like fire, electricity and ice for some really satisfying results. While the special powers are cool, the guns themselves aren't particulary great, except for the shotgun and the revolver. Oh, and the boss fights are really good altought there are some that have attacks with insta-kills, which makes the fights a whole lot more intense but at times quite frustrating. Overall, I'd say this game is worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dark SectorOverall Score: 6.5/10Short Summary:Your character (Hayden) is infected. You find yourself alone with no help and your role is simple: Kill every enemy.You gain a special weapon you don't get to see very often in TPS games which called 'The Glaive'.You make your way moving from place to place until you meet the final guy who started all of this and end it once and for all.Estimated gameplay hours: 8-12.+Visit the black market to purchase/sell Pistols/Rifles/Shotguns and weapon upgrades.+Encounter endless soldiers/infected enemies and mini-bosses, all in very dark places with suitable soundtrack.+Killing enemies with The Glaive is fun, especially with slow motion. (Yes, slow motion.)-Storyline and character movement is lacking but is not taking the fun out of this game.Enjoyment: (8/10) - This game is addictive.Repetetive: (6/10)Replayability (2/10) - Only if you want to use other guns lol.Frustraiton (0/10)Boredom (3/10)Strong Tip: You don't get alot of Black Market cash so use it wisely.. I would recommend using a pistol & shotgun. You feel like a badass with a shotugn in this game as well.Overall Score: 6.5/10* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale.****** Recommended On Full Price.

												A rather good story of its time, the progress of how from a normal human Hayden slowly evolves to the end game character shows how much the story was thought out. The combat system works really well too, the glaive directional controls to the 2 handed combat with the throw star and a gun, it was just awesome.			",172,9,0,28,6,0,6

												This is one of the most under rated games ever. I love it even with its flaws. Yes the story is hard to follow and the gameplay might be repetitive for some people. Not for me. Love the glave and the weapon upgrade system. And the atmosphere is just awsome. Even the graphics are still good in my opinion. Warframe is more in line with the original concept of the Dark Sector MMO but this game shines on its own. It is one of the most played games on steam and I am happy for the developers success. I hope they will one day make a sequel to this hidden gem.			",321,28,4,36,9,0,34

												Dark Sector is a game by Digital Extremes Ltd. In it, you play as a military spy named Hayden Tenno who travels to russia to stop the spread of an infection that a bioterrorist is spreading and ends up infected himself. Due to a mental conidition, he feels no pain from the disease and doesn't turn into a crazed monster like other victims. His arm also spawns him a glaive, a weapon you'll probably be using a lot in the game no doubt. As Hayden progresses, his mutation advances and he gains new powers. gameplay. The gameplay is pretty fun and the storyline makes even more so. While the story doesn't affect gameplay, the plot is at least detailed.  as for the gameplay itself, it can be tiresome and frustrating from time to time. Often, you'll end up taking cover behind objects to avoid enemy fire while they do the same. Often, this results in long tedious fire fights. Thankfully, you can sometimes kill them faster by using your glaive and aiming at them carefully. There is one enemy that makes fire fights difficult and it's a melee solider with a riot shield. They'll come to you while you're behind cover which often forces you to fight back. Here, the only way to break their cover is to either run behind them or hit their shield with the glaive and shoot them while their stunned. This can get a little frustrating at times. As mentioned eariler, the Glaive plays a major role in combat. The Glaive can be thrown to slice off enemy body parts and limbs, used as a regular melee weapon (not exactly the best decision IMO.) or used for a finisher when enemies are stunned (they'll glow red) This violence caused the game to get banned in Australia actually. Eventually, you'll be able to aquire other abilities, such as covering your glaive in fire, ice, or electricity for additional damage and stun properties.The game also has a variety of guns but you'll need to pick up money found throughout the game to purchase them. This is another flaw with the game. Since there's only a set amount of money in the game, it will take a while to be able to purchase anything and you'll never be able to purchase everything. The Glaive can be used to pick up fallen enemy guns (as well as other objects in some cases) and use them for a short time (they have sensors that indicate if someone infected is using them or not and stop functioning after a few seconds.). This can prove useful in log fire fights. The enemies and monsters/infected are varied and each one fights a little different. Soldiers will throw inferon gas at you which is dangerous since you're infected. The infected range from using clubs to throwing projectiles at you. The bosses are big and each one has a different strategy to take down.The thing that hurts the game is that it came out during a time when other third person shooters hit the scene causing it to lose some attention and causing some to classify it as a ""clone"". It had to compete with Resident Evil 4 as well as the Gears of War game of the time.  Graphics. They look good and they're not too hardware intensive even at 1280x720 res with all settings enabled on my computer, I can get a decent FPS most of the time. Like most newer games, the graphics use post processing. The environments are also pretty dark and mysterious as well most of the time. Sound. The sound is pretty cool. The Soliders will yell at you when they see you and scream in pain when you slice a limb off. The infected will make a variety of groaning and hissing noises which can be a little creepy at times. The music ranges from creepy to stealthy James Bond style music. It really depends upon what's going on in the current chapter at the time.overall: 7/10. Due to flaws with money and and certain gameplay aspects, it's not perfect but not bad either. There isn't a whole lot of replay value as unfortunately, you don't get to restart the game with your powers and weapons but replaying can be enjoyable enough. The game was made by Digital Extremes Ltd, the people that made the ftp game Warframe (also here on steam.) Warframe is considered by many to be a sequel, due to the numerous references to Dark Sector and the faction the player's in being called ""Tenno"" in honor of the first tenno. (which the devs said was Hayden).  Worth picking up if you enjoy warframe. The price is fair and cheap as well. 9.99 for the game.			",20,4,0,5,2,0,0

												I Love Dark Sector. I have played through it at least 5 times now. Beginning to end.  I think what keeps me coming back, other than the unique art-style, is the combat. The combat is so fluid and dynamic. The weapons are all fun to shoot, enemies are interesting, and the glaive is one of the most fun weapons to use in any video game.  You can't go wrong with this game. Especially for $10.			",168,24,2,14,10,0,11

												This is game of mixed opinions and really based on what your looking for. The gameplay is amazing, it utilizes all of its mechanics smoothy, cleanly and smartly because of the nice spread of puzzles built arround the central mechanic: The Glaive. The story sucks ill say it straight up, if you require a gripping story than erm yeah no (Though if you play warframe and like it, shouldnt have any problems at all). The Graphics are smooth, dark and well balanced with visual effects. This is indeed the offical (not offically confirmed but lets be real) prequel to Warframe and its visuals, lore, and general gameplay (more or less minus the healthy obession with a glaive). Id reccomend it to anyone thats a hardy fan of 3rd person shooters with some thought required to play it. Also it has a very Metroid Prime feel to it, that room to room, you know something is in this room i just dont wanna go there feeling.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tenno't of Ten!Just kidding. It wasn't perfect, but it was very unjoyable. The Positives: The story is nice, the gameplay was interesting, the sound design was pretty good, and the way your character developes was handled well. On top of that, several of the enemy types were interesting cosmetically.The Meh: The controls were a little wonky, but not bad. There were some glitches and oddities, but nothing game-breaking.The Negatives: Sense of direction wasn't always clear, I got lost at times. Also, the gunplay wasn't very reliable. I usually had to rely on the Glaive (melee/thrown weapon you get early on), and only found the semi-auto weapons to be good with ammo conservation. Also, the boss fights were kind of weak because all you have to do is repeat a few steps to kill them.Final thoughts: It's worth playing through. It's fun once you get used to the controls, and is great if you're interested into where the Tenno (from Warframe) began. That being said, I'm amazed that very few things from this game made it over into Warframe!  There are several things that I wish would be added to Warframe from Dark Sector in a future update!Rating: 7.5/10			",241,4,0,17,3,0,17

												Kinda linear, no farming for cash, easy to miss upgrades. All that aside, I really like the game.The glaive is hilariously good as an unlimited-use ranged weapon. The fact that gun pickups last 30-odd seconds before blowing up in your hands and if you like it you need to go buy one is kinda ingenious.Given how little cash there is scattered throughout the game world, you have to pick and choose what weapon upgrades you get. Do you want damage? Increased clip size? Explosive rounds?This (in addition to the linear fashion of the game mentioned earlier) actually contributes to replay value, as you can go back again and find all kinds of stuff you missed the first time and use completely different weapon builds.The story's fun, a bit dark, and has twists to it that are actually done in a manner where a second playthrough makes you say ""How did I not see that before?"" It's a good game. 8/10.			",65,8,1,16,2,2,10

												This game has some minor flaws being a port from console to PC, but with some quick and easy config file changes you can play it in HD and it is a great game.If you play Warframe than consider this game to be the ""LORE"" of Warframe giving you the storyline that leads into what is now one of the best F2P games available to play. I have started a full game playthough on my YouTube channel for any who might be interested in seeing the game unfold. Have a look and please share your thoughts.

												A third person shooter with a cover feature and a twist: a ""glaive"" you can throw at enemies and it comes back to you. Mostly unoriginal, heavily inspired by Half Life 2, originally made for consoles, looks like another victim of publishers. It's fun to play, but has clunky keyboard/mouse controls and a not very entertaining take on combat challenges. I had to play it in god mode (cheat engine) because of the controls, and I enjoyed it. No regrets for money spent. I suspect that originally the story events took place in Poland, or Romania, or Hungary, and later they hastily changed it to Russia, to please the publishers. Because there's nothing Russian there except for Google-translated labels on crates. Sometimes I'd get stuck, not knowing where to go, which was actually a breathe of fresh air after all these modern games that tend to hold your hand and drag you along the script. The story makes an impression of something made up in a hurry, but while being nothing special it isn't insulting either. I like how it drops you in the middle of some action and you're figuring out what it all means. Also I like how you are forced to think and come up with some ideas when you're dealing with bosses - it's not just shooting it X times to kill it. It even has some economy, you can buy guns and upgrade them. It felt a bit short, but then again - it would have gotten really boring, be it any longer. Keeping all that in mind, you're welcome to give it a go, especially if it's on a sale. A sequel with better controls and updated graphics would be not a bad idea. Throwing this glaive was quite fun, especially when charging it with elements.			",197,132,5,19,11,2,15

												Despite the poor reviews on Metacritic, I still strongly urge all my readers to try this game out.I recently wrote a review on the game ""Singularity"" and these two games seem to have a lot in common. Like Singularity's time warp, Dark Sector's gimmick is its player-controlled glaive, a weapon when thrown, allows the player to maneuver it to his or her whim.Beyond that, there's not much to say about this game. The plot is forgettable and much like the time warp, this gimmick also wears out fast. However, the mindless killing and badass glaive kills made me stick with this game until the credits.If you're looking for a fun game with little depth but loads of fun, this is it. Don't come in expecting a masterpiece, just expect to have fun.Grade: C+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												This game is such an underatted gem. You play as a guy called hayden tenno who starts off like generic white guy that shoots foreaners that is until he gets infected that turns him into a metallic bad♥♥♥♥♥with a glaive. It's story is pretty entertaining surprisingly with some cool ideas. Visuals have aged well it's designs and metal textures are impressive, oh and the gore effects are great. Sound is mixed the sound design is great guns sound powerful and choping limbs with enemies screaming in pain is fun. The voice acting is very good and the music is eh .The gameplay is pretty rad it starts off standard but when you get the gliave it feels differant. You have a great arsenal of weapons along with your glaive which gets better later in the game. My only problems is that weapons are a bit too pricey and there is some poorly explained mechanics. It's an awesome game definately worth the price.8.5/10			",340,5,1,7,5,2,4

												If you want more lore behind Warframe and to see what the world was like before it, play this.The good; it's a very beautiful game overall, the style is great and for the age of the game, it is rather beautiful. The environment is great and lively overall; some of your enemies seem outright ready to♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves when you approach. It supplies some very tense moments that, even though you are the first Tenno (Warframe players know that this means a beast of a person that can take out hordes of enemies...), for at least the beginning of the game - You will feel like the small fish in the pond next to some of the enemies. It's a fun challenge that set me often muttering ""No no... Don't tell me I have to fight that.. I ain't ready for it."" Just look around for items that will help you. It's not always well shown. There are some problem solving elements you need to work out as well,  but as noted in the bad, it's not always well directed that you're supposed to do things, you have to figure it out on your own.The bad; it is a port from the Xbox 360 and the controls reflect this, lacking a lot of tuning that the PC release needed - Prepare for sloppy controls that take a lot to get the hang of. It seems to be missing a minimap feature or any sort of guidance at all... Though some classic gamers may feel this is how things used to be, but I spent thirty minutes sculking around a dead end only to discover I was supposed to figure out I had to something for another five on a hunch that 'this may be it...'. The mod system is interesting but like many - You can't remove the mods. There is no explaination toward it and to be fair some mods would be great to allocate elsewhere after learning this early in the game.In all, worth a play at least if you can get around the controls and don't mind figuring out exactly what you need to do on your own.

												As of late, I've been on a cheesy movie kick. Movies like Commando, The Last Starfighter, and Universal Soldier. Action movies that take themselves deadly serious, but are over the top hilarious, and feel kind of kitchy. After marathoning these beautiful pieces of garbage, I asked myself: Are there any games like this?Dark Sector is one such game. Dark sector is a game trying so hard to be serious and dark, yet made by a team so inexperienced and unfamiliar with the Unreal Engine, that it often trips on it's own shoelaces. This game has UI-resolution issues, floaty character movement, not nearly enough ammo drops, no online (only LAN matches, which is a tribute to this game's age), special abilites that are either overpowered or completely useless, and lackluster special effects.But the game is trying so gosh darn hard to be a dark gritty sci-fi action tale, it's absolutely adorable. If the game acknowledged how cheesy and stupid it was, I wouldn't shy away from describing it as a second rate...no, third-rate MGS3 clone. Imagine if MGS3 was made by a much less talented team, was much less ambitious, and yet at the same time, just a bit more morbid. This is the kind of game you lump in with games like Legendary, Ride to Hell, and Rogue Warrior. Games so bad, you absolutely have to experience them at least once. Wait for a sale, as $10.00 is double the price of what it's worth, but give it a shot. The game is begging for your approval.			",199,18,0,22,9,1,24

												So basicly I played this game as a fan of Warframe, which is already a fantastic F2P MMO now. However, I have to say I only recommend this game for ones who want to know the background of warframe. For such game released in 2009, it has really done bad in both graph and gameplay. For example, when you are running, you just can't turn with mouse, really hard to operate. The glaive and the element system is a good try as it was introduced then in warframe, called damage 2.0. The glaive is used to solve most of the mistery and kill bosses, sometomes boring though.Meet the prototype of Excalibur and NYX, also a boss called jackal are fun, you can see how they evolved these years.In general, a good game without detailed enough designation, a fan game, I hope DE would give us a better SP game with this universe but a better experience like warframe			",93,12,0,7,4,0,2

												Interesting to play if you like warframe. Gameplay is mediocre and a bit too clunky. Not bad for an older game. I quit playing at this boss fight in a chapel, too many cheap deaths and having to start all over. Got boring. 6.5/10			",140,13,0,43,4,0,25

												You'll notice right off the bat this wasn't made for PC. PC settings are extrememly limited. Like, ""you can only change the resolution limited."" This port is a little stiff. I remember I played this on the xbox 360, and it was fun due to the controls being similar to gears of war 2 when that game was out at the time. So, I felt right at home with the controls. With PC however, the combat feels kind of frustrating trying to play this with a mouse and keyboard. Even with a wired Xbox One controller it still feels kind of ""off."" On top of that, aiming is not smooth, and trying to run and move with the WASD keys can cause carpal tunnel if you don't switch some of the bindings on the keys. Graphics are meh, and the sounds of the guns are pretty weak. Even though I enjoyed this game my first playthrough back on the 360, I can't recommend this game on PC due to it not meeting the standards we expect to have as PC gamers. I bought this for about $1 on♥♥♥♥♥ and it's not even worth that.			",65,0,2,5,2,0,5

												Really, one of my personal favorites from the X360 era. It's not quite as polished as the AAA games of the era, but if you get into it, it's a lot of fun. It's all about the glaive, baby. If you use guns all the time, this game will be boring, and you'll be missing the point.			",372,66,15,37,15,2,25

												This reviewers only say ""If you love Warframe then you're gonna like this game."", Well I was one of the people that bought Dark Sector when it got released(It was actually the first game I ever purchased, so it has a special place in my heart).And when I first saw something about Warframe I was like ""Holy S-! This looks a lot like Dark Sector."" Because the image had an Excalibur and Grineers that look similar to the Lasrian guys with the protective suit.So in other words, if you Like Resident Evil 4, Mutations, Third Person Shooters, you're gonna like this game.Anyway,Positive aspects:-Curious enviroment;-Interactive cinematics(also on Warframe);-Black & White Gameplay Intro as if shrouding the mistery of the man beneath the mask and the things happening around him(You can turn that off if you want);-Good soundtrack;-You think you could kill everything with only a gun, well now you have the Glaive;-Cut people in half, in slow motion;-Scary Zombies(Scarier than Warframe's Infestation);-Random Hulk appearing out of nowhere and ravage the area;-Dark sewers, because why not?;-""Hey! It's Yankee Doodle! He's come to town!"";-Quick time events that scared the sh-t out of me-Nice powers brah!;-Cool suit brah!;-Riding a mobile tank;-Enferon ftw;-Revenge sweet revenge. Or not... #sadfaceNegative Aspects:-Display Options can screw your HUD-The Aim, You have to feel the sweet spot with the red highlight, otherwise you'll always miss;-Game is too easy(Beat the game and unlock Brutal difficulty for good A.I.);-Short cash for few weapon choices;-Who is Hayden?;-Plot holes everywhere(would have apreciatted if there was more info about the characters and the world);-Resident Evilish backtrack(not that bad though);-You can honestly just play the whole game by firing the Glaive, almost no point on having a rifle;-If you buy a rifle, NEVER buy the Sniper(complete waste of money... its just my opinion though)-The Ending, when you feel like they could have added more, since it seems that it did not end there(maybe they were already thinking forward for when we started playing Warframe, idk).Still, 10/10 Would cut everything in half again.One of the best games for me, special place on my heart, money well spent.

												I picked this game up on a sale because, as you probably already know, it's the prequel to Warframe, a game which I play a lot.Funny thing is, I ended up enjoying the game in and of itself. Story was adequate, but nothing special. Hayden's face annoys me when he talks, and his eyebrows are a little frightening. Mechanics are what made up for everything. Glaive mechanics are really satisfying, and designed well. The gun upgrade system was lackluster, but then again, you don't really ever need to use a gun (except for in the very beginning). Boss battltes felt larger-than-life, like they ought to, and the moodiness in some of the darker areas (cemetery, morgue, hospital, cathedral) was really well done. The cemetery in particular gave off a lot of excellent spooky vibes, and I enjoyed it.The end of the game was satisfying, and the last boss battle in particular. The fights were hard, but not frustratingly so. Whenever I died, I felt like it was my fault, instead of bad game design. All in all, good game. Spooky, you learn more about the origins of Warframe, and it's got a multiplayer feature too (which I haven't really tried out, but seems promising).			",135,32,9,11,4,1,6

												Wrote this with the intention of not playing anymore but, will trudge on after learning this ties into another game I'm playing now.  Unless you're in the same position I'd say this isn't worth it. Awkard binds: why is ammo pickup a completely different bind than interact?  The glaive: isn't really all that useful when it's way easier to just insta headshot enemies.  It's less accurate, has travel time, has a limited range and takes longer to refire.  That said I tried to use it exclusively cause why not use the slower but, more fun weapon that's on the boxart.  Getting the timing down for power throws is fun but, boring in a gunfight where as soon as you peek there's 4+ enemies endlessly shooting at you.   One shot mechanics: Pretty surprised to run into this on the default difficulty.  Unless there's some dynamic scaling here some encounters can be pretty  Feedback: This one was extremely apparent.  Things like am I doing damage to this boss? Or the fighting music dying down despite there still being enemies. Sparks/Electricity in a boss fight that are just visuals when the game has taught you electricity has a mechanical importance. Ties to their other games: This is a pleasant surprise since I'm just trying to clear a few games from the backlog but, this is actually a prequel to another game.  I'll leave this intentionally vague in the rare event someone's in the same position. ",380,90,9,67,26,3,51

TL;DR near the bottom!A quick note:  If you're a fan of Warframe, Dark Sector is definitely a game you want to check out.  I actually had the game on Xbox 360 a long time ago, and I didnt get past the first two chapters;  imagine my surprise when I found out the game is actually a prequel to Warframe! All this time, I had no clue.  I thought Dark Sector was just a third party title inspired by Resident Evil and Gears of War, with a protagonist who I've always thought resembles a young Donny Osmond.As far as gameplay mechanics go, this game is unique and fun.  The protagonist's main weapon, the Glaive, is really cool to use and is satisfying to kill enemies with.  However, the game is also painfully hard at parts where it doesn't have to be.  Some parts are easy and you feel like a Glaive weilding Super Soldier (Warframe roots in play).  At others, it feels like you've been dropped into Dark Souls. Don't get me wrong, I love Dark Souls.  It's just a very drastic change of pace that happens quite frequently.The story, felt a little weak.  There were a lot of unexplained things, and I feel like had there been more explanation the story could have been great.  For example, the protagonist comes across a character he seems to have had extensive history with.  Players, being new to the game's story, have no idea who this person and want to understand more.  We're not told anything about their past.  Ever.  This is very unsatisfying in the long run, because it just feels like wasted space for character connection.  Even details about the main character himself, Hayden Tenno, are missing - we're shown where he is throughout the gameplay but we're not really sure how or why he's there.  The story does explain some of it, but not enough to really make sense.  The game has a ""Black Market"" where you can buy weapons and apply upgrades you collect throughout the world.  However, the system seems almost pointless.  It takes forever to get enough money to buy a weapon.  And, if you get a weapon and decide ""meh, I don't like this"", chances are you won't have enough to buy a different gun if you sell it back.  I made this mistake, and went through half the game with a gun I didn't want.  Pro tip (not a spoiler, really):  Although the Black Market ""VX Carbine"" looks like a normal semi-automatic rifle as depicted in its picture, it actually functions like a bolt action sniper rifle and has a scope you can't remove.  Why the devs did this, I don't know.  And yes, that was the gun I got stuck with, which wasn't bad because I like snipers, but was annoying because I thought I was buying a semi-auto mid-range rifle.One final comment I have is about what I'd call the game's ""Puzzles"".  The game tends to go from fast paced combat to slow paced ""figure out how to progress"" parts.  Some of these puzzle areas feel less like actual puzzles and more like ""figure out what the devs actually intended for you to do"", which was frustrating.  Some took one minute, while some took 20-30 minutes for me to un-stick myself from.  This would be ok if I was playing, say, Portal, but it feels very out of place in this game.  I think the devs were just trying to be creative with how the player could use the Glaive to interact with their environment, which is always cool, but it wasn't executed well.  TL;DRPros:-Prequel to Warframe, shows how it all started-Fun Gameplay; The Glaive is a very unique weapon.  A fun side note:  The Devs are adding more of it's features into Warframe (I can't wait for that).-Donny OsmondCons:-Story ≠ Clear-Game has one difficulty, yet seems to switch between Easy and Hard very frequently.-Poorly implemented features such as gun shop and environmental puzzles.Overall game ratings based on your enthusiasm towards Warframe:None: 5/10Kinda: 7/10Warframe Addict: 8.5/10Play on, Tenno.

												6.5/10Recommend at severe discountOverview: Third Person ShooterThe Good:+ The only good thing about this game is that it has multiple weapons to choose from that can be purchased from  a vendor in various locations in each level.  You can also find upgrades throughout the level that you can customize your weapon of choice. + The boss battle are somewhat interesting only because the rest of the game is so repetitive in its design. The Average:This game looks bland both artistically and technically.  Each level looks and feels the same with very little variety between them.  Textures seem washed out, characters are not very well detailed and the levels look very uninspired. The story is mostly told in between levels. The story is very forgettable, characters are one dimensional and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. The main character is boring and uninteresting. The story feels like it was created after the game was made as an excuse to kill things. The level design suffers from 'corridor shooter syndrome', you go through linear hallways until you get to a wide open area where you proceed to kill the enemies and then proceed to the next wide open area...over and over and over again. The gameplay and combat only make matters worse, there is nothing wrong with it on a technical level, everything controls smoothly but the combat scenarios change very little throughout the entire game. Nothing interesting happens in combat. The main premise of the game is that you get a glaive that you can use on your enemies and solve puzzles. The glaive is fun to use and it does feel satisfying to decapitate your enemies. As you progress the glaive gets upgraded making it more powerful and useful to use in combat.  However you can only carry one sidearm and one two handed weapon thus your strategy in each combat encounter changes very little. To make matters worse enemy variety is also lacking. For the majority of the game you will face only two types of enemies, those that shoot at you and those that rush you. Every once in a while you face a third type of enemy that actually requires some strategy to take down, the problem is, these are introduced late game and are so few and far between it makes little difference in the end. Conclusion;Everything about this game is average. It does everything right on a technical level but it feels so repetitive to play because there is little to no variety in the environment, enemies or combat scenarios.  Getting this game on discount is the only way you will get your money's worth here.			",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												I bought this game because I loved Warframe, wanted to see other games made by DE, and because the Warframe Fanfiction (by Kalenath) I read uses dark sector in it's story..in the end, being even the tiniest bit related to Warframe and its fanfiction is the only reason I felt obligated to finish it..It's not made for PC, as others have pointed out.and Expect a lot of gunmetal gray.when shot, you will shake more than a crying baby in Johnny Cash' arms.you can pick up enemy weapons, but they will explode after a while..and yes, I understand that it's a mechanic explained in the lore... but that doesnt make it any less of a stupid mechanic..If you want to support Digital Extremes by buying a previous game rather than Platinum in Warframe, go nuts.. I don't regret giving DE money for this game because I think they're great.but if you're here hoping for an amazing story (subpar) and awesome combat mechanics.. then keep looking, you get a glaive (throwing blade) later on and yes, chucking that thing at necks is fun... but thats literally the only fun part of the combat			",70,5,0,25,10,0,8

Straight forward action and no increassing difficulty.IA of enemies is a bit weak, anyway and, an easy game for someone done to this kind of games.Interesting fighting mode, with a gun in a hand and that kind of triple-blade boomerang (that also serves to pick up things in the distance).Not a big history but, interesting enough.

												I played this on the Xbox 360 when it first came out and I am still impressed with it. While it is nowhere near what was originally supposed to be released it still came out amazing. I wish and would almost beg for a sequel more linked to Warframe but this is still an amazing game trying to connect it to Warframe and in its own right. The controls are abit of a pain to get used to on keyboard and mouse though so fair warning there. Would I play it again? Yes and have. Would I play multiplayer? Maybe on xbox 360 it was fun but frustrating sometimes. When playing this game do not play with Warframe in mind and expecting alot of similar things. Yes character designs and weapons are similar to that of warframe but this is not as fast paced or comes with alot of warframe abilities and weapons. It will show you the roots though of what began the amazing universe.			",234,11,1,23,7,1,9

												It's hard to get the game to work right on most computers, but if you can manage it, then it works fine.  The story is cheap and predictable, and you get reminded of whats going on so infrequently that it's easy to forget why you're even there.  I kept hoping the story would redeem itself but the ending was the definition of anticlimactic.  The controls are terrible, you move at a brisk jog while ""sprinting"", and you can only dodge in the four cardinal directions.  It has a mechanic for taking cover, but it's almost not worth it because so much of your body is still showing and can be shot at.  The bosses are cheap and just have a lot of health.  The fights get really repetative and you go on for hours fighting the same types of enemies in almost the same conditions.  I got the game because I thought it would give some insight into the story of Warframe, Dark Sector's successor, but there is no such insight to be gained.  I wouldn't have minded that if the game was fun, but it's really not.  Cannot recommend.			",289,69,0,54,19,1,43

												This was one of the 2 games I was given when I got my xbox 360 for Christmas back in the day and unfortunately, I was too young and ignorant to enjoy it back then. Now however since my 360 is broken I got it on steam to give it a try since I love Warframe. While generally speaking the game feels very dated(Since it is 8 years old) but it still really fun. Personally, I used the glaive every chance I could because it was far more satisfying than just blasting the enemy with the plethora of bullets they give you. There's a reoccurring vendor in the game that lets you buy weapons and upgrade guns, all that means nothing since the starting weapons are just fine and the guns are great even un-upgraded. One thing I would have to mention is how….dumb the default keybindings are.mele/open door: SpacePick up ammo: ZTake cover: LeftCtrlThrow glaive/AfterThrow ability: CGrenade: QEtc. I quickly realized how bad they were and remapped them to much more sensible buttons of course (Glaive to middle mouse button for example).This game is also full of “Puzzles” of having to use elements and your glaive to beat bosses or open doors. The game basically gives you everything you need to succeed but tells you nothing and you are expected to die a few times trying to figure out what to do with it. About 90% of the time if you find an element (Electricity, fire, ice) then it's going to be used for something in a puzzle and you need to start looking.All in all Its a great game and totally worth $10 for the experience, Whole game playthrough on average is about 8Hours.

												You want to play a shooter game without guns, than this crap is for you.  Enjoy being shot to death while your stuck using a slow moving, inaccurate, short ranged bladed disk.  If not for the absurd amount of times you can be shot before dieing, this game would be all but unplayable.  With how utterly superior your starting sidearm is over your fancy toy, I have to wonder if any of the games developers realized how dumb this special weapon was.On a side note, make sure to turn up your brightness to play this game.  Otherwise all you'll see is black.			",645,283,8,121,52,1,146

												It's okay. Pick it up in a bundle or at 90% off.Pros:- Looks pretty nice- Has some fun spotsCons:- No cover system. In a shooter. Oh the enemies can take cover, just not you. You can't even crouch.- You don't really need a cover system anyway, because enemies are dumb as bricks.- You have to manually fix the widescreen resolution in the config file or the game warps it. I'm pretty sure widescreen monitors existed in 2009.- Everything is bulletproof. Just stand behind a tent if you're getting shot at.- The powers suck for the most part, and the game forces you to use them by taking away most of your guns. The pistol you get to keep is still better than the powers. The best thing about the powers is picking up dead enemies' guns so you don't have to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ powers anymore.- The story suffers from the eight deadly words of writing: I don't care what happens to these people.- You have no context for anything, and the protagonist is a whiner. See the eight deadly words above.And yet I still somehow recommend it. There is fun to be had - just don't pay full price for it.			",187,39,11,14,16,1,9

												The hardest part about this game is fighting the urge to quit and uninstall it because it is just not very good. At all. I played a long way into it, until the invisible boss you fight in the water, and it was such a horrible boss fight that it was, combined with the rest of this games awfulness, just the last straw. This game, just like Velvet Assassin, is one of the most terribly generic games I have ever seen. Your guy is a p-ssy and can only take a few hits but you do get a magic shield that you can activate but it only blocks things from the direct front. You get to carry two weapons and get a special power blade you can throw that comes back to you but it completely ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, one of the worst weapons I've ever seen in a game. The levels are extremely linear and the graphics are horrible. It has decent gunplay though. Use guns whenever you can, although ammo is scarce and most of the time I was forced to use the truly God awful blade weapon. However I did find a ammo glitch around chapter seven. Well maybe not a glitch, but I sold my AK and bought a shotgun and it came with 184 ammo which is a lot. I was so thankful when it happened because like I said, the blade sucks real bad as a weapon.  The sound is not programmed well either. Voices are very, very low in some cutscenes and the sound of the wind blowing really loud overpowers every other sound in the game and gets very annoying. It is very generic and very easily forgettable but is worth it though if you can catch it on sale for like $3 or less because that's about all it is worth. And if you are using a 16x9 resolution such as 1920x1080 like I am, you will need to apply a scaling fix that is easy to do. Search the games forum for a post I made titled ""16x9 resolution fix"". And NEVER alt+tab out of this game or it will crash, which is something that is unforgivable with PC games. Games that aren't alt+tab friendly should be outlawed. This game is easily a 4/10 and that is being generous.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Weak story and rather mediocre gun combat. The glaive (throwing frisbee blade thing) is the only fun thing about the game and despite my play time, I have played it to completion, so it's also a short game.I can't really recommend it at all, unless you go into it knowing that it is mediocre. But as I said, fun can be had with the main throwing weapon in the game and execution moves, which you will grow tired of eventually because there are only so many execution animations.

												After playing the game I could only think about how cheesy and boring this game is.They try to make me feel sad about a certain part near the end of the game but it's impossible because the person wasn't even shown often. The ""plot twist"" was expected, I'm not even sure if it was meant to be a plot twist or not.The gameplay feels fun and unique at the start of the game, but the more you play the more boring it gets. The sprint system is awful, the turning sensitivity while sprinting is so slow that there really is no point in even attempting to sprint. The story is slightly cliche and like stated earlier, cheesy, there is an infection and for some reason your character isn't killed or turned crazy (there might be an explanation that I didn't catch though, if there is can someone please tell me in the comments)The same enemies come back over and over again and this wouldn't be too big of a deal if it wasn't for the fact that they are so boring to fight. Get into cover, wait till they stop shooting, peak out press and hold c, release, almost kill, press c again (or run up and do a finisher), dead. Level design was pretty good and has a very different feel from any other game I've played, sometimes I would get confused about where to go which wasn't really a bad thing. The way the enemies pop out in the levels is same old, there is a door and the enemies magically pop up infront of the door.And for people who are here because of Warframe, just know this doesn't exactly explain the lore of Warframe like I thought it would. It shows how the entire thing started but not much more.Tl;dr just watch a gameplay on Youtube, the game is very boring to play through and doesn't explain much about Warframe (for people who came to understand the lore of Warframe)			",172,4,1,14,2,0,1

												As a fan of Warframe, I decided to take a look at Dark Sector, the supposed prequel to the Warframe lore. However while this game may have that within, I couldn't be bothered to go beyond chapter 4.At first I couldn't even load up the game properly, it would just futz around like a fish out of water trying to display in the right resolution. It wasn't until I found a guide on Steam as to how to properly config the game before startup, which revealed to me how laughably bad this port was. As for the gameplay, being a product of the cover-shooting era of gaming, that is literally all the game is: find convenient waist-high cover to plop behind and just start shooting or throwing your glaive. Obviously none of the high-speed acrobatics that Warframe is known for, but Dark Sector just plays super slow in general. Sprinting feels bad, rolling feels bad, melee combat feels bad, and Hayden has the frailty of a wet sheet of paper. The only thing that really felt good was pulling off insta-killing power throws with the glaive. And even then I got to a point where I realized that the glaive was the end all be all weapon at mid-to-close range, so guns became almost silly to use.Overall, I just feel like this game has been a victim of bad aging; gunplay is super clunky and unsatisfying, unlike things like Warframe that are super quick and at least somewhat responsive. Then again, that could also be me being used to Warframe and expecting something closer to that. Either way, I didn't enjoy my time with Dark Sector. But if you've got some interest in some Warframe backstory, it's on sale, and you think you can deal with slower cover-based shooting, definitely pick it up and try it out. Otherwise stay far away from this one.			",224,27,3,10,7,2,11

												I'll start off by saying I do not recommend this game.First of all this port is terrible, there is so much wrong with it it’s hard to know where to start. It is locked to a 4:3 resolution, anything other than this will break the game, it had massive frame rate issues, a lot of controls are bound to the same keys, glitches left right and center and the menus are frustrating to use due to half mouse half button combination that messes both up.The concept for the game is pretty solid but the execution is very lacking. The Glaive is fun to use at first but then it just becomes another dull part to a dull game. The setting should be interesting but I found myself not caring. The enemies are bullet sponges and no fun to fight. The weapons are shoddy and annoying to use and finally the story, what story.If the idea of the main weapon interests you play the first half but don’t bother finishing it, most of the game is just boring and frustrating leading to no pay off. Have fun? ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												What I look for most in a shooter is technical performance, and this game falls short in every aspect. Sometimes I can take cover behind a wall and shoot right through the edge of the wall, sometimes I shoot past an obstacle and still hit it. The AI barely suffices. You'd think cutting foes in half with a huge fan blade growing out of your arm would be fun, but it's dull. The firearms feel soft too. Let's add an uninteresting story and a lack of variety to the mix.			",151,93,6,13,13,0,20

												An awful game that really just deserves to be forgotten. Despite playing as an elite military operative, you are completely unable to reliably hit targets at 10 feet with any weapon. This incredible inaccuracy makes Dark Sector one of the most annoyingly dull games I've ever played, a problem that is only compounded by the fact that the enemies become more bullet-spongier as the game progresses.The story makes no sense and the promise of turning into a resident evil style bio-weapon Ninja is cut short by the fact that, rather than undergoing a full body mutation as the game makes you believe, the ninja shown in the trailers is just the protagonist in a weird ninja suit. Furthermore, this ninja suit doesn't actually do anything. You can't take more damage, you don't do more damage, you don't move faster, the invisibility skill is obtained on route to pick up the suit.. The only thing it really changes is that you're able to pick up miniguns dropped mech-suit enemies. Considering the reason you go to get the suit in the first place is to defeat another weird ninja suit guy and that fight doesn't involve a minigun the whole thing just feels ♥♥♥♥ing pointless and dumb; which more or less sums up the whole game.You'd be better off playing Warframe, the spiritual successor to Dark Sector, and is actually half decent if incredibly grindy.

												Do you want a console game with little attention paid to the PC port? This could very well be your answer.Take on the role of Generic Console Action Hero #34853 and shoot your way through countless hordes of forgettable enemies. Wield the Bat- sorry Glaive with such unique powerups as getting charged by environmental hazards, remote guidance and extra powerful throws. Use melee finishers to see the same few animations repeated over and over against the horde of faceless enemies. Marvel as you're unsure of how much damage you have taken and whether you can risk taking another shot at your enemies or if you have to duck out of the way to heal up for an unspecified amount of time.And it's not just the gameplay that ""takes inspiration"" from other games, the story itself is a very tired: Oh no, there's an infection, that will turn people into mindless murderous zombie type creatures, running rampant in this area we're sending you, we totally have something that'll keep you safe. What's this, you got infected!? But you're special so you don't turn into a mindless beast, instead you gain powers!It's not all bad, but with the few things it does well and the many things it doesn't I'd wait for a 75% off sale before picking this up. Hence me not recommending it.			",232,27,2,25,11,5,44

												To start, the menus all suggest using the ""A"" button to confirm choices, but the button doesn't work.  If you move the mouse or press the keyboard, you're told that the [enter] button will substitute - it doesn't work either, though.  Once you get into the game, it's evident that the aspect ratio hasn't been adjusted to match the screen resolution.  It's bad enough that the perspective is wrong, but bits of the HUD are displayed outside of the visible window.  Otherwise, the game seemed like a black and white clone of Metro.Life is too short for playing bad games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a fan. I don't know if it's issues with the PC port or if the console version is this bad too, but I honestly couldn't invest any time past the prologue because of the issues.- Terrible A.I... in just a few minutes I watched enemies pop up out of thin air, run directly past me without attempting to fire, as well as shoot me when they really shouldn't have even been able to see me.- Controls are about as precise as a sledgehammer. I tried playing with a gamepad as well as a keyboard/mouse, seems to have serious mouse acceleration and when playing with a gamepad it was simply impossible to aim accurately even with the sensitivity settings changed.- I don't know what year this game came out, but I'm sure it looked like♥♥♥♥♥♥then too. Character models are awful, animations are awful, the damn pattern that flows around the outside of the screen in the start/pause menu looks like it is designed for a  480i display.Positives... well, it physically runs, which is better than some PC ports. I wouldn't buy this thing even for 99c.			",260,67,6,38,39,3,71

												good game on consoles, not so much on PC. This game is really really really bad, there are zero graphics options except for 1. post processing 2. enable fog and 3. ambient occlusion, this wouldn't be too much of an issue except for the fact that this game is horribly unoptimized for pc and getting good frame rates is impossible unless you play the game at its native 4:3 720p. for reference i can get 70fps on battlefield 4 at 1080p, with darksector i was barely getting 24fps @ 1080p.The Game play is non-existence. its like playing a broken version of gears of war except the enemies are 5x more idiotic and will literally run right up to your face and unload all their ammo until you use you're super powers to blast em into oblivion. this game is unchallenging, repetitive and gets boring fast. i'm actually surprised the game got a 66 on metacritic, it deserves less.

												In this game, you play as the lead singer of Linkin Park on a quest to still be relevant. You encounter terrifying things such as a black person who sells you guns. In the end Mike Shinoda comes out and sucks your dink, but no one ever finished the game so I'm the only dink he sucked.			",361,88,5,26,41,4,24

												The port is as bad as Dark Souls can get. It's a shame I can't like this cause it's the base and the beginning of Warframe.The combat is dull, movement is bad, story is far from perfect. It definetly isn't the worst game out there but does not offer you anything interesting if you aren't interested in Warframe.			",289,22,9,22,17,4,26

												good sound effects, bad voiceacting.nice graphics for a low budget game,animations are moderate with a few weird looking bugs.they ai is pretty bad.the controls are easy.i guess with a few changes the game actually would be fun to play, BUTunless you really save your ammo, you will have to kill most of the enemies with the almost useless boomerang knife.that takes ages and is pretty annoying.all together i would say, you dont miss out anything if you dont buy it.

												It's the worst game that I played in last years. It's boring. Nothing is happening in this game. We are exploring many simillar locations and killing the same enemies by whole game. Sometimes we have are fighting boss. Unfortunatelly, this fight are not very challenging. Method of killing them is pretictibly. Authors didn't even try to  come up with some new ideas.Story is the same as gameplay. Boring and  predictable.I can't recommend this game even to my worst enemies. It's better to again, play Gears Of War.For me 2/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So while waiting for a major update in Digital Extreme's ""new"" game Warframe- I decided to go back and play the old game everything spawned from. Dark Sector's default controls are horrendous. Mechanics are clunky even after you rebind your keys. You might as well not even try to actually shoot anything- since there is no actual precision.All that being said, Dark Sector is amazing. It is a shining example of how good classic old games used to be before the market started mass producing the copy/paste garbage they do now, feeding off of the same series until it's bled dry. The story was... a bit lacking, but it was original and interesting nonetheless. The music was PERFECT. Combined with the graphics used the atmosphere of the game actually left me with chills and fear of what was coming.The enemies were hard, very hard. Part of it was artificial difficulty but the rest was genuinely fun mechanics and skill relating to control of your weapon(s), managing your ammo, and keeping very aware of your surroundings and positioning- of both you and your enemies. The way the market and upgrades worked really made me think about how to spend my money and collected gear. The BOSS fights lasted quite some time and I actually had issues figuring a couple out, one of which I still can't figure out if it was a matter of just repeatedly hitting the boss to progress...If you would like a good nostalgia trip back to the time of fun old games, Dark Sector would be a great choice. It's decent length, and fun throughout. Constant changes in enemies, environment, and mechanics make what should feel repetitive not- keeping things fresh and fun. Speaking of mechanics, the very simple aftertouch ability is something that really sets Dark Sector apart. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure no game did it before, and even now I have yet to see it in another game.Final Rating: 8.5/10			",110,3,2,7,11,1,9

												So after a while of playing this game and reaching Chapter nine i feel like im finally ready to review this game. so lets start with the  pros and the consPROS:-glaive mechanics work fantastically-weapon system is easy to get the hang of-visually pleasing (imo)-Variety of enemies-easy upgrade system-cool elemental stuff-hayden tennoCONS:-sessions where you get stormed with 100000000 enemies at once-though the variety of enemies you always seem to fight the same kind through one chapter-cover mechanics can be a bit janky-cant take upgrades off the weapons if they are applied by accident or other ways (at least i havent found the way to do it yet)-trashy melee combat-no objective marker making it hard to know exactly where you going or what you are doing (you will know generally what you are doing and where you are but you kinda dont get any details)So overall i feel like this game is super cool and definetely worth picking up. if this review didnt convince too bad. DO IT ANYWAYS. thats all i had to say. Thanks			",98,7,1,8,14,0,4

												Excelente jogo, pena que cheguei até uma parte e desisti, não estava com saco de continuar, tem um inimigo que para matar tem que ter muita paciência, na primeira vez que enfrentei ele matei, porem na segunda não consegui e acabei desistindo. Isso não é culpa do jogo e sim minha, pois dificuldade é o que deixa o jogo interessante, recomendo esse game, muito bom mesmo.			",411,150,14,32,27,3,38

												A combination of creepy atmosphere that will have you jumping at shadows interspersed with sweet cover-based combat with guns and mutant abilities. The dark is dark and the gunfights are great, also some weapon-as-tool puzzle elements to stress you out.			",513,104,0,55,25,1,36

												Dark Sector thrusts players into the role of Hayden Tenno, a covert operative sent on a dangerous mission into Lasria, an Eastern European city on the brink of ruin that hides a deadly Cold War secret. In the midst of this mission, Hayden is attacked by an unknown enemy and infected by the TechnocyteAnd I recommended you to buy this game for 3 reasons:1.Cool Gameplay:play as Hayden Tenno the first generation Tenno of Warframe MMORPG with strong Glaive and some weapons,with the gameplay a little bit like RE series this game make me want to play it 5 times2.Cool Graphics:This game was the most perfect pc port,if you have a strong pc you can open all effects on this game and maximize your resolutions3.Cool StoryThe things I want in this game:1.Please Remaster this game2.Please make an online multiplayer games not LAN games3.Please make a Steam Cloud save system,because that is the only thing stopped me to continue my progress			",571,181,17,109,78,11,108

												If you're a dedicated Warframe player, this is worth a look. The 14 years of unfulfilled game development for Warframe is as much its' Lore as anything else, and so is this game - for better or worse.When the Aftertouch mechanic is introduced you might start having some fun, but in the end of the day this game is Warframe's ancestor in too many ways...The grind, the weakly tied together systems and old-fashioned development ideals (Which are justified this time by the fact that this game is indeed pretty old)Aside from that, the game's story and setting are famous for being decided by a man in a suit and a sack of money, not by anyone creative or capable of original thinking. What some of you may know as Excalibur, a suit so sleek and well designed that it instantly became the poster-boy of both games and for a very short while an entire generation, will be introduced as ""You remember that suit?"" And nothing more.So as I've said before, if your expectations are low and you are deeply invested in Warframe, this is worth a look.Otherwise, might wan't to let this game rest in peace, knowing that its' true form is being built as we speak. Sort of.			",265,81,5,18,15,3,28
