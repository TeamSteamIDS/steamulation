												If I could sum up this game in one word, that word would be ""fine""The game does everything just fine, but you can find other games that do everything better. The RPG elements are fine, but other games are better. The Fighting is fine, but you can find better elsewhere, The graphics are fine, but... you see what I mean?Nothing wrong with the game, actually it's.... well, fine... just nothing spectacular			",859,416,29,87,90,10,94

												You get to progress through the story playing one of three characters (dwarf, human, or elf) while being able to swap characters at any point in the story. The two other characters that you did not choose become AI and help you on your journey. You get to explore Rivendell, Brill, and many more and talk to some of the Fellowship, but your journey is not with them, instead you head north towards the Grey Mountains to fight this game's antagonist, Agandaur. The game is fairly short, but there is a lot of replay value. You can play through the story as another character and find secrets that you couldn't with any of the other characters. Once you beat a difficulty, you unlock the next one and you can continue to level and gather further upgrades.The scenery is very beautiful but the levels are as linear as ever. Nothing is destructable with the exception of barrels and boxes and a few certain locations where you have to blow through a door. The gameplay is decent. It's a basic hack and slash with various ranged attacks depending on the character. As you level up, you can put skills into your talent tree and unlock a few more skills on your action bar. The cooldowns are lengthy enough to keep you hacking and slashing until you get to unleash your abilities again. I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys the lore or Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I learned a few things I never knew and there are a couple easter eggs. I got this game for $1 dollar during the bundle and I would NOT recommend you buy this at $19.99. There are a TON of bugs. There is a brightness bug during some of the levels. Side Quests sometimes disapear. Your saves can get deleted. Some game mechanism are poor as well. The hit box on all the characters are huge. You can shoot an arrow to the left of them and they still get hit. When you want to squeeze past your friend, you get stuck by invisible barriers. The barriers are everywhere as well. WORST OF ALL...the game is abandoned. The ownership of the game was sold and then the game was abandon. No more patches and no more support. Wait for a sale and see if you can get this cheap.

												There need to be more co-op RPGs like this.It might be an easy and short game, but I really, really enjoyed it. If you have two friends you often play games with, then you should definitely check this one out. It's best played like that, with this game only benefiting you from playing co-op. Each character has their own secrets which can open up areas that hide loot, and each character has a race skill which can help the other characters out. The combat is very satisfying, because you can pull off some awesome dismemberments and decapitations, and even do Fellowship strikes or kills when all characters are attacking the same enemy.At first sight it looks like it offers the typical character selection, being a Mage, a Warrior and a Ranger. But none of these characters HAVE to be played like they usually are. I played as the Ranger, and you would assume he would mainly use his bow in combat. I really only did when there were enemies you could only reach with ranged attacks. The game gave me the option to use two-handed weapons, dual wield two one-handed weapons, or use a one-handed weapon in combination with a shield too. There were plenty of skills which would increase my effectiveness with either of these weapon combinations, as well as skills which would give me new archery abilities or give specific bonuses to me using my race skill.I feel like this game is a nice combination between an action-based hack-and-slash game, with the looting system of an Action RPG/Dungeon Crawler, and a story and setting which fit right into the LOTR series. I'm not saying the story is interesting enough to make every LOTR fan play this game, but it's also not ruining any part of the lore. It might just be a little more interesting for someone who likes the LOTR story than for someone who doesn't care for it at all.			",596,93,33,41,22,8,27

My score: 7.5/10Playthrough time: 16 hours 30 min (single player: main story and most side quests, listening to most conversation)Pros:+Good action RPG combat, severing orc limbs is fun+Lots of well put together LotR story elements/locations for fans to enjoy+Enough levelling and loot to keep things interestingCons:-Gameplay can probably get repetitive if you play more than 1-2 hours each time-Combat system and leveling/skill tree isn't that deep for hardcore players-Fiddly character change system-A few glitches may crash the gamePerformance notes:The game is great for using the Xbox 360 controller and playing on the TV from the couch.Graphics performance R9 280X, 1080P max settings: 60 FPS (V-sync) all the time except for a few stutters when loading new textures.Main review:If you will enjoy LotR: War in the North depends on how you're going to play the game, and if you're a fan of the LotR world. The game is best played casually a few hours at the time, If you play it that way, and you're a fan, the game will probably keep you entertained all the way through and has a lot going for it when it comes to the story and locations.If you're not interested in the Lord of the Rings world, and come just for the action RPG, you'll probably find the game lacking, especially if you put 3-4 or more hours in to the game each go, then the game will probably feel quite repetitive.The game tells a story of three heroes (man, dwarf, elf) indirectly helping the fellowship during the LotR story. You run in to quite a few characters from the books/movies, and visit familiar locations as Bree and Rivendell. The locations in this game generally look great, and all the characters has quite a lot to say, so the story builds up well with lots of background information available if you like to listen to conversation.The main part of the game has you battling mostly orcs in a third person action RPG style. The combat style doesn't differ much through the game, you can select any of the three characters (but switching between them is only allowed upon clearing a section of the current chapter, or after visiting towns, and is a bit clunky), use a light or heavy attack, ranged attacks and magic/skills. You level up and unlock/improve skills and get better gear/other loot that improve stats, but the gameplay doesn't change that much. You're still hacking/shooting at orcs most of the time.I really enjoyed the combat, and the levelling/loot was enough to keep me interested all the way through, and combat is fun. Sometimes after getting the enemy HP down enough you get a prompt to use a heavy attack for a limb severing finish that for me never got old. Just as satisfying every time.The game has some nice boss battles as well, and every chapter has a few events that mixes things up. The game also supports online co op (up to 3 players in total). Unfortunately, I haven't been able to try this, but I can image this game can be lots of fun with 1-2 friends.As for the glitches: At the final chapter, there was a game breaking glitch, for some reason when navigating the tunnels the game got really choppy and crashed when the frame rate got too low. Apparently a common problem, and the solution was to set the graphics to minimum and get through that section with as little on screen as possible (aiming at the floor while moving helped). When out of the tunnels, restart the game and everything is well again.Update: Apparently the problem is AMD related and another way of fixing it is by installing the 12.6  version of AMD Catalyst, Click for a guide.I enjoyed the game and will do a ""New game+"" some day.

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North surprised me. I bought it expecting that it wouldn't be very good, as movie adaptations often suffer from a multitude of issues. This one, though it does have some issues, manages to avoid the worst of them.It does so by not making the main story or characters have anything to do with the content of the movies, instead focusing on some other folks doing a different quest during the same time span. You get to cross paths with the heroes of the main story, but your story does not really impact the main events of the movies. Some have criticized the game for this, but if you look at it as just another adventure in the lands of MIddle Earth, it's fine.War in the North takes you through a series of events unfolding, unsurprisingly, in the north part of Tolkien's maps. The villain is a bit contrived, but the rest of the journey is filled with the same kind of delicious aesthetic that the movies used to bring Middle Earth to life. I don't remember everything in the appendices of the novels, so I don't know how much of this stuff they just made up for the game, but it's all believably Tolkienesque enough that you won't think about it much unless you're a Tolkien scholar. In short, they nailed the flavour perfectly.The gameplay is solid third-person action-RPG fare. Controls and movements are fluid, there are skill trees, and item upgrades galore. Each of the three characters plays differently enough, while still allowing the player to customize the skills and abilities toward their preferences. All characters are capable at both melee and ranged combat, all have damage-boosting abilities, and all have support abilities, so you get to decide what you want to be good at.There are a couple issues I found with the game, namely the crafting system feels tacked-on and falls short of its potential. Inventory space is limited as well, so you run out of room for all the crafting materials. The two issues are certainly related. Part of that stems from the fact that you occasionally get gems that you can socket in your items, but using them means that you must either destroy them or the item you put them in, which disincentivizes their use. Further, they're rare to find, and have randomly generated stats, like all the rest of the gear. Which is another sore spot.Gear. The game tries to do the fun loot hunt minigame, but falls short. The items generate very random stats. It incentivizes collecting ""set"" items that unlock powerful additional bonuses, but there are so many of them and not enough drops happening to make that worthwhile. I found that I was better off just using the best individual pieces of gear, regardless of set.Sidequests are all pretty bland, fetch-quest type stuff, and kind of feel like filler, or an excuse to involve a given character in the story. Not a high-point, but could be worse.Each area has enough secrets in it to keep you going back for more if exploration is your thing, and you will have to go through with each of the 3 characters (or play multiplayer coop) in order to find them all. That's not a bad thing necessarily, as I found the world was a joy to explore for the mostpart, and each of the characters was fun to use and level up.It's priced appropriately, is on for 75% off pretty regularly, and actually a good deal at that price.

												Starting a new branch of JRR Tolkein's ""Lord of The Rings"" series, this quest based game plunges the player into Middle Earth as either a human (Eradan), elf (Andriel) or dwarf (Farin) to fight against the dark lord Agandaur in the North providing the fellowship with time to destroy the ring. This game was a personal favorite of mine. You battle through the North, accompanied with loyal friends, on a variety of dificulties with boss battles at the end of each level providing a harder challenge each time. On completion of the game you can restart to where it all begins with all your gear and complete it on a higher difficulty. The game also has multiplayer for those missions you need help with. Again this game is a personal favorite and I HIGHLY recommend it as a game easy to spend multiple hours on with an enjoyable gameplay and ending.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												While it certainly isn't the best hack n slash action game you'll ever play, Lord of the Rings: War in the North proved to be a fun game despite its flaws. This game was designed as a multiplayer experience, so you should play with a friend if you can, if not prepare yourself to constant variations is gameplay as you'll have to change characters more often than not. In the end this was not a setback, as each has a slightly different play style so changing characters (ranger, elf, dwarf) proved to be varied and amusing.This game is first and foremost aimed at Lord of the Rings / Tolkien fans. If you count yourself among those, you'll be satisfied. I played this game as I was reading The Silmarillion again which proved to be a good choice as the story is not focused on the main events at the end of the Third Age but on the fight against the forces of Sauron in the north of Middle Earth. Don't expect Bethesda or Bioware levels of lore in this game, just relax, enjoy the story and focus on what this game does best - combat.The fights are intense, combos are easy to execute and enemies' limbs fly all over as you chop Orc after Orc. If you want a good hack'n'slash experience, look no further.“The world is full of peril and in it there are many dark places”  ",264,53,8,32,16,3,52

LotR: War in the North. A worth side-story? Mh. Let's see.In ""LotR: War in the North"" you will play as a dwarf, a ranger or an elf. The events play parallel to the main story of LotR, so you will see some known faces. The story is simple: Sauron wants to rule ""middle-earth"" (as far as we know from the movies/books). One of his leaders Agandúar (?) is stationed in north of ""middle-earth"" (no sh*t) and you have to stop him. So you play behind the scenes. Yeah, nothing big, but it's ok and exciting.NOTE: The desciption says, that ""War in the North"" is an Open World game - that is not 100% true. You run from map/location to the next and you are able to visit this place again (although does not make any sense).To the facts!++ for fans: a must have++ familiar soundtrack++ known spots, enemys and characters+ some ""untelled"" background knowledge+ easy controls (hack & slash style)+ good atmosphere and nice sound effects+ nice special-moves+ good animations+ some sidequests- you can't save on your own (but it saves every 10-20min)- the (german) synchro was horrible- the dialogues sound like from Google Translator- flat characters- the endboss was...too damn easy - I died more often from a troll- little playtime (about 10 hours)- graphic vulnerabilities (from 2011...)- the multiplayer is nearly dead- no choices that affect the storyAs you can see, there are 1:1 positive/negative arguments, but I still recommend this game (because my expectations were not too big)!So! If you want a short-hack&slash-(koop)-LotR game - this is the adress: http://steamcommunity.com/app/32800Must have for fans - Must look for all the others. I don't regret these 5€ (sale) and it was a nice game in between (three days).War in the North: 6/10 dead orcs ",134,14,3,25,19,0,28

												The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is an action RPG. When starting a new game you are able to choose one of three heroes to start your adventure. Each of these heroes have their own unique abilities. However you are able to change the character you play as at any point by leaving the game and coming back to it, this means that you will not always be stuck with one character during a playthrough.Earning XP works like it does in most other games - (killing Enemies = XP, Completing Quests = XP)Once you have leveled up you will be provided with a few points to level up your stats such as stamina and will. You will also be provided with an ability point to unlock a special ability.

												Good solid game that I would definitely recommend.  Pros:- good storyline with lots of lore- good voice acting- just enough sidequests to not detract from the story- skills received a noticeable, but not overpowering bump when leveling them upFew things that could have been better:- wish voice acting was same as the movie, but still good- inventory management was sort of a mess.  No good comparison mode when looking at vendor to inventory, too much junk loot and not enough loot you'd want to wear even towards the end- AI for your companions is not very good, but I imagine a ton of fun to play co-op- save points are a little strange. i.e. beat the boss, go back to town, interact with a vendor and see save icon after, quit game > log back in and I have to fight the boss again?  Strange.  I could see this being an issue on the harder difficulties that might take a few times to beat.- respec should be much cheaper imo - probably figure you'll do it in heroic and legendary- companions on solo play - I was fortunate enough to read up on this before I started giving good loot to them.  Apparently it disappears so you should only trade to another play and never the computer.I do like that you get to pick up where you left off when playing through the next difficulty level.  I'll probably come back and give at least heroic a whirl.  Legendary sounds brutal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:- Gameplay- Story- Graphics- Well developed co-opCons:- Unfixed bugs & glitches- Bad voice actingYou can play as either:- Eradan, the 'Ranger' and a dúnedain. He can use a sword and shield, or dual wield swords and has a bow and arrow for ranged attacks. He also has access to stealthy attacks. He has the unique ability of finding secrets.- Farin, the 'Champion' and a dwarf. His combat style focuses on melee but he also has a crossbow for ranged attacks. He has the unique ability of mining for gems.- Andriel, the 'Lore Master' and an elf. Her combat style is mostly focused on magic but can also dual wield a sword with her staff. She has the unique ability of creating potions from items found throughout the world. With that said you can use her very much as a 'support' character.It's a lot of fun using all these characters with friends, without them you'll get bots as partners that aren't as useful. I strongly encourage co-op! Single-player won't be the same... Also those glitches ARE there! And there are a lot of them!

												This game got some really lousy reviews, so I went into it expecting the worst. But as it turns out, it was not as bad as everyone says. It's a pretty - albeit shallow, linear and generic -  action game that was a welcome change after the huge open-world of Skyrim.I think one problem people had with this game is that it was originally advertised as an RPG. This game is anything but; it's a third-person melee fighter in the vein of Hexen or Dark Messiah. Yes, there are some rudimentary RPG elements (quests, stats) but at its core ""War In The North"" is pure action. Although the graphics aren't jaw-dropping, it does boast a number of spectacular vistas. The characters are generic but appealing nonetheless, and the story likewise. It does lack in variety, however; your avatars only have a limited moveset and you'll be fighting off the same handful of monsters throughout the entire game. The levels are more varied, but are incredibly linear and despite some impressive set-pieces nothing you haven't seen before. This definitely limits its re-playability, even with the co-op mode, but as a change of pace from larger games it was still a welcome experience. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun action-RPG-lite, hack-n-slash with nice linear storeline that parallels the events of the LoTR movies... and it's 3-player co-op.The game appears to be getting a bad rap lately which I'm guessing stems from crashing issues on Win10.  We played this game for 25+ hours on Windows 8/8.1 without a single glitch in various networked co-op configurations (2-player and 3-player), but Win10 causes the game to crash in various situations - one is solved here:

												I'm gonna be honest, I didn't knew what to expect from LOTR: War in the North, I only decided to play it because The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was almost coming out here. Let me say this right away, I haven't had so much fun in a LOTR game since LOTR: Return of the King on the Xbox. War in the North is basicly an Action RPG, it reminded of Dragon Age at some times gameplay wise. You can play with one of 3 characters, Eradan (Man) which is the Ranger class, Farin (Dwarf) which is the Champion class and Andriel (Elf) wich is a Lore Master (mage). When you level up you can upgrade each one of your stats (stamina, will, strengh, dexterity etc.) and you can also level up a skill which is either passive or active and you use it during combat. Storywise the game takes place on the North while the Fellowship make their way to Mordor. The game plays really well ( I did found it easier to play with a 360 controller though), the combat is satisfying yet I felt like it was somewhat simple with a lack of combos and variety to it. You also have an inventory to store your items and your loot, which I don't know if it's random, and you can sell the stuff you don't want at a store or certain ""checkpoints"" that appear on each level. Two things I really like about LOTR: War in the North is that the game rewards exploration, by gaining access to secret areas and finding extra gear to either sell or equip, the other thing I also liked is the character design and the dialogue system. Basicly the dialogue system works like in Mass Effect, Dragon Age and KOTOR, I don't know if this was made on the Bioware dialogue engine though. Eitherways, either if you're a fan of the LOTR world or not it is certain that this is still a very good game and that you don't need to be a fan of LOTR to enjoy it, it's satisfying, it's fun and the plot is very engaging, you can't go wrong with this one, play it!

												War in the North is an action-RPG built with a strong focus on co-op. All of the familiar characteristics of the action-RPG genre are here, from shops and loot to blacksmiths that repair weakened or busted weaponry; as well as some combo-based swordplay.War in the North is all about action, and the action starts when you pick one of the three characters.  No, you can’t pick any of the actual LOTR characters.  You’re stuck with these relatively generic goofballs, doing relatively generic things in a generic fantasy world populated by generic quest givers. Several builds exist for each character though, and you can even build the wizard in melee combat and kick♥♥♥♥♥surprisingly.  Other than her, you’ve got your typical LOTR ranger and warlord archetypes to play as for sword and bow combat. The control scheme doesn’t really lend that well to a keyboard and mouse, so I highly recommend making the investment for a controller if you don’t have one already. With a completely forgettable character lineup and story that only serves to get in the way or set up the next hub/killing field, it’s been a long time since I ran into a hack and slash that I really never feel like loading up again after putting down.The highlight of the game, as every LOTR game should have a great soundtrack and voice acting to back it up, and this delivers. While the actual context of the story is pretty pathetic, the production values are high enough to keep you listening rather than skipping cutscenes.Games graphics are also rather good. Given sufficient hardware, the game will shine and shimmer even in the bloodiest of fights.While it doesn't reach the heights we wished it would, War in the North is still a solid experience with more than enough content to justify checking it out. Overall 7/10.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												This game is strangely compelling, given that in its core it's pretty much a mediocre brawler-type, corridor-driven action ""rpg"". I'm playing it in local coop, which undoubtedly adds to the fun factor. What probably provides the most fun for me are the random lore tidbits you find out through dialogue with the various less-explored NPCs like the Great eagles and the random Dunedain rangers you encounter all over the game world. The dialogue is okay, with characters sometimes directly quoting the movies/books. The story is actually fitting the lore strangely well, dealing with a secondary force of Sauron stemming from the cold north and preventing an imminent attack on Rivendell (if I remember correctly, Gundabad was always an Orc nest, and was never really explored/explained in the source materials).The fetch ""quests"" are as basic as you can get, including one painfully tedious quest at the beginning of the game where you literally go tell a girl that a guy is in love with her, and then go back to the guy to tell him she also loves him... I mean, wow, go tell him yourself, he's standing literally twenty meters from you, and you're both doing absolutely nothing!The loot system is bland and basic, as is the skill ""tree""- with a total of maybe three or four skills per character. Your ""skills"" are extremely basic, especially with the ranger class, where you get a ""skill"" to strike hard at one guy and a ""skill"" to swipe your weapon through multiple enemies. The combat is actually not bad, all things considered- you have your roll dodges, block, various defensive options including a magical anti-arrow barrier that also heals the party, and the enemies can be relatively varied and requiring different approach methods to defeat. Still, everything seems a bit basic and unenthusiastic, especially compared to something like Shadow of Mordor.The loot system is made so that everything is completely separate for every player (a la Diablo 3), but that also includes experience- it seems that kills made by one player only award experience to that player- leading to the relatively support-oriented elven Loremaster ending up underleveled compared to attack-oriented dunedain Ranger and dwarven Champion and having to replay some levels to gain enough experience to buy better equipment.The graphics, while pretty and completely in-line with the movies' visual design, are nothing to write home about. That does provide a benefit of working well on older hardware, though!Overall, I'd recommend getting this game while it's on a heavy sale (75% off or more), especially if you're able to play it in LAN coop with a friend or two. It did keep me playing for a relatively long while, and I plan on completing it, so it gets a thumbs-up from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Lord of the Rings: War in the north is action role-playing game. The game takes place in Middle-earth, the same timeline as the fellowship of the ring, except you're not going to be with the fellowship here, not even you're going to join the battle of Helm's Deep or the Siege of Minas Tirith. You have your own battle here in the northern part of Middle-earth. You will be able to explore Rivendell or you may call it Imladris, the town of Bree, Mirkwood and more. You can choose 3 different characters, each from different race, different abilities and different secrets to found throughout the game. Choose Eradan, a human rangers from Dunedain, Andriel, an elf lore-master from Imladris or Farin, a dwarf from Erebor. Any characters you choose, the rest will become your AI companion.The game has good and decent gameplay. It's basic hack and slash game but each characters can also use different ranged attack such as crossbow. The story of the game is linear which makes the level also very linear. Items are vary in this game, and items with better quality can be found as the characters level progress and playing more harder difficulty. Once you beat a difficulty, you can continue playing from the start point on the next difficulty level but retaining your characters level and items. You can also play cooperative with your friends here.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North has good graphics. Each level and stages in the game have great detail on the environment, which makes Rivendell have really beautiful scenery and the enemy castle a very bad place to see. Animation is also good, though sometimes there is a small animation glitch when an orcs dies.But I also will tell you that this game has downside too. Unfixed bugs and glitches are common here, you may see a sword thrown up without reason, the AI companion is somewhat foolish too, using ability when their foe is already dead, or sometimes they even will become your problem. The acting is also not that good, even the voice acting too. But this game is still recommended from me.+ Gameplay+ Cooperative+ Storyline+ Graphics+ Replayable- Bad AI- Bugs- GlitchesRating 8/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Just started playing throught this with two friends, it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.1. You each have a different role and different gear associated with it - Champion: Straight up heavy DPS, uses big two handed axes and maces, he can also use 2 handed swords with one hand. - Ranger: Agile DPS, can dual wield swords/maces/hammers and can use greatswords. - Lore-Master: Healing and procective magic, she can also use her staff as a melee weapon when needed.2. ♥♥♥♥ING LOOT IS AWESOME. Each of you get your own seperate loot that covers all 3 classes, so you'll need to take breaks every now and then to give eachother the items for their class and vice versa.3. Combat is kinda like Dragon Age on a console. You know, the hack and slashy♥♥♥♥♥♥ But it's extremely satisfying for all classes.The overall feel for the game is kinda like an MMO and Borderlands mixed together, it's really well made and is up to standards even 3 (nearly 4) years later.If you've got an odd number of friends that you regularly play games with (like myself), I would definitely recommend this to you!9.5/10			",205,29,2,31,18,0,9

												Journey to the less known northern boundaries of Middle Earth in this full-blooded hack and slash game with the focus on the co-op mode. Though it bears the name ""Lord of the Rings"" do not expect anything breakthrough, nor complex, nor anything colossal. The gameplay is a hack and slash stereotype, but that is compensated by the recognizable characters, monsters, lore and, of course, the multiplayer. In my experience any co-op game is fun to play, and this game delivers a very satisfying co-op mode, but its single player experience is solid too.

												This game was tremendously fun... dont get me wrong, but the shuttering and crashing of the game quickly weather the players experience to a minimum. Chapters 2 and 8 took me and my girlfriend well over 10 hours to complete because of the sheer amount of resets, computer crashes, and shuttering that we had experienced. I have heard that these problems only occur with AMD cards, so you could try your luck with NVIDIA.I do recommend the game on the grounds that it is tremendously fun when it is playable. The graphics are great and the camera angles do not impede on the experience very often. If youre into swords, shields, bows and arrows, and magic... this may be right up your alley.

												I just finished War in the North and thought this was a seriously underrated action RPG. Really enjoyed it. The progression is linear so if you are looking for a Open World Sandbox go find it somewhere else but don't let that dissuade you from giving this a shot.  I played this Single Player so cannot speak to the Multplayer game here but had fun playing it alone. It started off a little slow but I thought the story was believable and the voice acting were good and it was the right amount of tough (on Normal Mode). Whenever I thought I was starting to breeze through Orcs, I got hit with a boss or some Trolls that made me have to actually think about how I was going to progress. The only downsides were that the camera angles got a bit jumbled in big fights (Dodge Dodge Dogde!!!), bows were ehh (even as a Ranger), it was kind of short (I beat in in 18 hours and I'm OLD), and don't plan on respeccing because it costs a LOT. I picked this up cheap and got more than my moneys worth. Hope this review is helpful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not to mention that you get to talk to some major charactors from LOTR (allbeit only a little, but still cool). I also have a new found respect for Eagles, they are just the best.

												While the gloriously grisly combat was immensely addicting and the authentic lore was the perfect vehicle for the ride through Middle-earth, unfortunately, unaddressed and well documented issues persisted.   During my second play-through with the difficulty elevated, my over powered Dwarf wrecking ball encountered too few a challenge.  The stars of the show though were a giant eagle voiced magnificently by John Patrick Lowrie of Halo and Half-Life fame and the coup de gras was the minacious dragon voiced by Keith Szarabajka's guttural and orotund vocals.+ Flawless Widescreen for FOV adjustments and resolutions above 1080P.+ ReShade with SweetFX 2.0, Profile ""More in the North"" by Atyth for visual enhancement.

												Great game to be played with friends, but i wouldn't recommend it if you're going to play it SOLO!Pros:  - Coop Campaing (up to 3 players) - LOTR history based. - Explains why the eagles didn't help frodo to carry the ring to morder xDCons: - BUGS, BUGS EVERYWHERE! (Chapter 8 - part 2 was a living bug) - May not be recommendable to be played solo if you're a casual gamer. - Some communication problems (Client <-> Host) while playing coop (not much of a problem, but still)So if you really want to buy it, try to find a cheap reseller or wait for the closest sales (christmas in this case) because it's not worth to pay $20... or at least not for me haha			",269,34,15,26,13,4,49

												I'm gonna do something crazy as hell in this review: I admit I haven't finished this great game yet.And you know what else? It's one of the most underrated, excessively bashed on, unfairly abandoned games in my entire collection, and even that I've encountered in my career. All because it came out something like within a week of Skyrim, but that's a personal view.What do you get for <$20 (its cheaper during sales obviously)? one of the most fun cooperative hack and slashes around, that's what. Blending awesome combat, a fairly original story quite true to Tolkein's work, and basic RPG elements like customizable gear and a full inventory as well as basic side quests, this game had true potential and I really do hope someone who cares gets a hold of the rights to it and shines it up proper. Until then, it's more than worth it's cover price. Consider buying if it's up your alley, but I won't pretend this is a game for everyone.			",96,12,0,11,7,0,27

												7.5/10PROS+ Satisfying combat (animation, sound, gore)+ Three characters, three spells each, allows for varied gameplay. Can switch between characters per chapter too+ New charater perspective on Hollywood favourites such as: Radagast, Elrond and Strider+ Plenty of scenery to enjoy. Rivendel looks great in this game!+ Tells the tale of a story most fans won't be familar with; so its a new adventure for some+ 12 hours game time (for the story) with extra hours for side line questsCONS- Repetitive combat at times so try to switch character- Requires a lot of looting during gameplay- Skill tree cannot be reset easily which is annoying- Character change is also annoying as it requires re-loading- Encounted 2 glitches but weren't super frustrating- Movement is clunky at timesHighly recommened to any Middle-Earth fans. Recommed bursting through the 12 hour story-line within three days. Strongest weapon for bosses  Ranged weapons seemed really OP in this game  ",81,8,9,7,13,3,10

												This game is, for sure, canon to the Lord of the Rings and it's also awesome.First of all, the player will experience the world of middle-earth by views unique, some of them shown some of them not in the 6 movies, also many references to the 4 books and the notes of mr. Tolkien. This game is a piece of art and it should be treated as much. It's price is more than reasonable for its long story and content and those who were unable to have access to the 4 books, might find this game for informative and interesting than they thought. Though the gameplay itself is not bad, I will give cons to this game because of the following 3 : 1. Very small lvl cap, in other words you cant max out your character ( dont worry you can buy respec item ;) ). 2. sudden difficulty changes, for example there is one sequence where you have to go from agile goblins and orc, to Uruk and Trolls. 3. No actual need for skills, yes you may fall in battle and yes you may get grabbed by that troll, but dont worry, only if the entire team falls before one gets up you may be able to lose, also in addition to that if you fill your pocket and sell whatever you dont want, you can get extremely good equipment, which will turn current, suppossed to be, strong enemies into childs' play.Although this game is good and if you are a fan of Hobbit or Lord of the  Rings you might find it interesting and even sometimes exciting. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!			",54,3,0,11,4,0,4

												Cool co-op : 3 player mode. You can try to play alone but it's way fun in 3 ( some levels are too hard to solo).Nice settings, lore rich so those with a hard-on for R.R. Tolkiens LOTR and The Hobbit will see familiar faces and get some cool insight. So even if this is a 3rd person LOTR hack and slash, expect dialogue ( skippable, OFC) . Combat is interesting as you are not heavely restricted to a fighting style: you can go headfirst to melee a troll with the Mage ( see what happens :P ) but encouraged to follow the classes. Nice loot and high replay value.AMD users: do not buy! this game si poorly optimised for AMD VGA and constant crashes will plage your experience. I only finished this game after changing to an Nvidia card.			",261,47,4,33,21,1,55

The hitboxes are kinda big for your character and the enemies and this can be good and bad at times.- Movement and combat is kinda clunky/rigid, it is a bit annoying at times.- Invisible walls are everywhere.- The AI of your companions can be kinda stupid, if you fall, instead of them going to your help they will try to kill any enemy first then go to your aid and this can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes.Aside from that, this game is fun and the story is good.

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a hack and slash RPG and takes place in the north during the trilogy in Middle-earth. While the game is NOT canon, it tries to fit into the lotr lore and it does a decent job at it. You can play as a dunédain, a dwarf or an elf.  It is even supposedly possible to play this in coop mode with up to 3 players, but I heard there are some problems coming with it.+ The premise is good+ Lots of fan service if you are into that kind of stuff+ visually good looking+ good skill tree+ This game made the protagonist ask gandalf why the eagles don't fly to mount doom to destroy the ring. :'D+ you can pick up a lot of different weapons and armours. + there are dunédains in this game that were CUT in the movies. damn you, peter jackson- deus ex machina eagles. please no more- the looting pop up message is annoying since you always have to find your mouse that is all over the place- soundtrack was underwhelming- only one save slot and it's not possible to manually save either- lots of invisible walls. also, the maps are very linear (console port)- I haven't tested it, but the coop mode has supposedly some problems like desyncs, crashes etc.Technical informations: Be warned if you have a AMD graphics card. If you have a nvidia card, you can try out disabling vsync for this game in the nvidia control panel in order to increase your FPS from 60 to 120. It's still capped though, but it makes much more fun playing at 120.Replay value: Potentially high if you are really digging this game, but for me ""average"" is more fitting hereRating: 7.0/10Recommendation: Yes if you are a lotr fan or like the setting			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rating 6.5/10Overview: Third Person Action RPG The Good:+ Choose between three separate characters each with their own unique passive and active abilities. + Story, dialogue and voice acting are solid and do a great job making the lord of the rings universe feel alive.+ Lots of different locations to explore within the LOTR universe + Challenge levels+ Great sound designThe Average:Not the best-looking game, some areas look decent while others are bad. I would have liked better use of colors as most areas seem to be a mix of brown and green. Certain textures seem lo-res as well. Characters give great details about side quests which help flesh out the universe, the problem however is that every side quest is a collect-a-thon. Plenty of loot to find and the loot itself looks great when you equip it however the items you find are not very exciting. The only stat you will be looking at is whether it increases damage/armor. Combat, although controls well starts to feel very repetitive half way through the game.  The character skills are not diverse enough and the combat isn’t deep enough so gameplay starts to drag out. The Bad:- Terrible, terrible technical performance. Framerate drops, stuttering after major events, graphical glitches etc. This seems to happen at very odd times. Most of the time the game will run smoothly but then for some odd reason the framerate will drop drastically, the game will start chugging even though very little is happening. The worst was at the very last level where I was getting 1-10 fps even though nothing was happening. Setting everything to the lowest option seemed to have fixed it however.  - Multiplayer is dead which may not be a bad thing because playing co-op tends to cause game breaking bugs. Conclusion:I believe this was Snowblinds last game. Like most average games there was a lot of potential here but failed to live up to it due to lack of time and money.  If you love lord of the rings, this is a good game to play however the numerous technical problems and average gameplay hold it back.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												This is a fairly decent action rpg experience, set in the world of Middle Earth.  The environments and characters are what makes this game worth playing in my opinion.  There are some locales that will be very familiar to LOTR fans as well as completely new areas, all of which are done fantastically.  There are a ton of familiar faces to see and converse with such as Aragorn or Gandalf, and quite a few new characters to get involved with.  Other than that it's a pretty generic experience.  Pick your class, fight through a level full of continuous bad guys (orcs, goblins, Uruk Hai, etc.), then a big boss battle at the end of the level.  Rinse and repeat.  This game should definately be played in co op with some friends to make a far better experience.  All in all it's still a good game especially if your'e a LOTR fan, I would recommend picking it up on sale.			",229,29,8,40,25,4,46

												This is a fantastic game. Great story and detail. I don't believe being able to choose the dialog is necessary, unless it actually changed the outcome of the conversation. Some of the lines are pretty epic though. And the power of the sappers is a bit rediculous, just like the Dwarves explosive bolt (over the top with explosiveness, but super cool). The fighting can sometimes be a little repetative but is awesome enought that you forget about it. The fighting style of each character is so different that each new play though you have the coolest fighter. Yeah good game. One of the best Lord of the Rings spinoffs ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review of Lord of the Rings: War in the NorthAre you a fan of adventure?Are you a fan of replayability?Are you a fan of collecting incredible amounts of original loot and gear?And most of all: Are you a fan of LOTR?If you answered yes to these questions, this game is absolutely for you. And if you answered no, it's also absolutely for you.The game was released the same year as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and i think it has been overshadowed by it. Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is by far one of the best games i've ever played, but still. This game offers a whole lot of things Skyrim (and other rpg's) didn't. One of the best things about this game is the combat. You will be slashing your way through a huge collection of different enemies with great pleasure. Decapitating orcs and Uruk-Hai has never felt better!And while it's an old game the graphics still hold up quite well, and with the ReShade by ScureHD it looks really good.All in all this game is amazing, but i think the price on Steam makes people unsure on weither or not to get it. A tip: Buy it on♥♥♥♥♥for £2 (hush hush)			",68,3,1,9,3,0,1

												I must say I got this game for £4.99 on the steam sale and I was not expecting it to be very good! I was proven wrong it's highly addictive once you get going, I never get tired of killing orcs and trolls and it's even better when you slice off their heads arms or legs and it splatters black orc blood all over your armour! better still is the slowed down action as you deal the killing blow to an enemy reminding me very much of the film 300. The village of Bree looks great as does all the places you visit. I would of preferred the actual actors voices from LOTR but you soon forget about that as the game itself is well thought out and is interwoven with the quest of the ""one ring"", even though it is a quest which is entirely seperate from that. I hope they make another game set in middle earth because I really like it as would any LOTR fan I rate this game at 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Final Thoughts:It's an overall good game if you & friends are looking for a RPG / Hack & Slash game to play.The game has been abandoned for quite some time.. so don't expect a patch anytime soonWould of been great game if Snowblind Studios had of updated their game and released a DLC(s) for it....

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North, is a fun game to play. It has a Skyrim feel to it, in my opinion. Different storyline from the actual series of films, but, of course, has bits and pieces of original subject matter. Tons of action, weapons, and magic - which generates a favorable way to blow off some steam (on Steam). I also admire the option of choosing between characters, whom each have their own role.I have come across a few glitches, but overall, this is a satisfactory game to play.			",54,8,3,8,6,1,2

												The combat and a lot of aspects of this game make it a fun and really enjoyable experience. It's a pretty straight forward game. Fun skills, Different heroes have varying playstyles.Unfortunately, even with the communities extensive efforts and file fixes, this game still crashes me into blue screens at certain points making it unplayable for me. The Barrow-downs is the first place when general bluescreens begin and later on chapter 8, The Sewers crash to BDOS. In a ""good"" run the game just closes. One of the fixes is to change a bunch of general video options to minimum and use iron sights on a character and stare at the ground in order to get past the sewers. This is not ""a fix"" just a way to dredge through an area. As of making this review, I have 36.9 hours in the game and have enjoyed everything not involving the blue screen errors and general crashes. So, this is a regretful ""not recommended"". I have restarted the game 2 times in order to enjoy most of it as much as I could again. I do feel like I've got my enjoyment from the game unfortunately, I simply cannot finish it at all. The crashes are too prevelant by the end of the game and I simply can't find a fix that works for me.			",116,10,0,13,4,0,7

												6.5/10grapghics-7/10gameplay-6/10story-        6/10controls-   7/10replay V-6.5/10If a 5 is truly average, then this game is above a 5. The graphics are nice for the for the time that the game was release and they still hold up ok today. The controls are simple and there is a watered down skill tree with a few spells and tricks to spice things up a bit. The only issue I saw with the controls was that if  I paused the game or went into a menu, the d-pad and joystock had to be neutral when you return to the game. For instance, I could not pre move my d-pad or joystick  and unpause the game or the game would think the stick was still in neutral and my character would not move. I would have put the stick back into neutral and then move my character. It's a small thing but it did impact my gameplay. This is not an open world game. I think linear path work well with some games but this would have be a better game if the gamer has the ability to explore the world and not be stuck on the narrow path. In this story, you are not the main character working to save the world. You are more like a B-squad with a side mission that will make the A-squad's mission easier and instead of saving the world, you save a region. There are many challenges that you will face but the game boss that is suppose to be so powerful is not even mentioned in the any of the LOTR books or movies. That's a huge downer. Each town is unique in appearance and there are a few characters to interact with. There's tons of loot that gets better with each difficulty which can be unlocked by beating the game. There is a leveling system that allows you to customize your character. You play as one of a trio that you can switch between after completing each stage. The other characters fight along side you as AI unless your play with a friend or two.Overall I would rate this a 6.5/10. It was able to keep me playing but there are other games that I could have spent my time on. Get it on sale and it is worth the money. ",234,17,6,39,7,1,8

												Let me preface this review by saying do NOT play this game by yourself. It's really boring and frustrating as the AI for your companions can be a little stupid.Summary:If you're looking for a good co-op experience, this game really brings back the old Lord of the Rings: Return of the King gameplay with some nice surprises like loot for your character and while it's not very appealing to the eyes and the story is silly, the experience you get from the co-op gameplay outweighs all that.Things I like about this game:RAndomized Loot (Players will not find hte same loot in chests and stashes and there are even item sets that you can complete)Leveling up is similar to borderlands, There are three branches of the skill tree, each focusing on a specific aspect of your character's classUp to 3 player Co-Op (LAN or Internet connection)Encourages and rewards exploration of levels (even though the game is linear, there are secret stashes of loot that players can find if they take a little extra time to explore the level)Small Mini QuestsOrcs and Goblins are the main enemy here but there are also other enemies like Undead that you face as wellThings I don't like about this gameThe animation of the bad guys seems like it was worked on more than the good guys, and the good guys animation feels stiffI think even by 2011's standards the graphics are a little lack-lusterThe beginning is bassically ""3 heros meet in a bar and talk to Aragorn and decide to go slay some Orcs, have at it player"" there's not a strong sense of direction here as to what you need to do when you first start your new game ",118,14,0,10,4,0,12

												Bottom line is, if you own an ATI card, don't buy this game. Even for $5, it's not worth the headache of constant crashes and disconnects. I wish I had scrolled down the reviews more to have seen warnings about ATI cards. It started out as a pretty great co-op game, with slightly jaded graphics and not top level game mechanics, but still playable and enjoyable. Then chapter 2 hit, and it all went to hell in barrow downs. Missing textures, random disconnects and system crashes at various intervals, especially in the middle of hard fights - problems either for you or friends connected to your game. The first few were just a minor annoyance because the game was quite fun but, when it kept happening, my friends and I just had to give up in frustration. It was a sad thing too, because the game is pretty addictive.The biggest annoyance for me is how the game's minimum requirements actually state that ATI cards older than those from 2006 will run this game, and how that is basically untrue after the first chapter. I begin wonder if I can get my money back just for that partially false statement. I don't want to go through the trouble of listing my system specs, but it runs anything recent like DA:I or FC4 on ultra without issues. I use an ATI 290X.			",93,6,0,22,6,0,21

												LotR: War in the North is an action, hack and slash RPG. I must say, i not played many hack and slash RPG in my life as they are mostly console games and not the most popular games on PC. After this game, i might look for more.You take command of an elf, a dwarf and a human. However you can play only with one at the same time:-) you could play together with your friends or if you do that allready in other coop games and you want just some single player game then its doable so aswell. If thats the case AI take command of the other 2 characters.This game is from 2011, i believe its pretty good game for that year. Not exceptional, but a good one. The story take part at the time of the adventure of Frodo and co. Your job is to sabotage the northern army of sauron and assasinate the leader of this army. Your actions are important so they cant pursuit the ring-bearer and so they cant lay siege on northern elven/dwarf/human settlements. The story is linear (well, allmost all games has linear storyline, thats not bad if its good).Your journey will bring you through many, so far unseen areas and allready known areas of Middle-Earth. You will meet brand new characters and known heroes. The game isnt epicly long but it took me good 20hours until i finished the story (with some afk) so i really suggest to buy the game, you will get a long entertainment for your money and if you see it on sale, well, just grab it, less than a movie ticket price for 20hours:-)The combat is well designed, offers some variatons and different tactics, there are many points where you can swap between characters. Game isnt repetitive, there are a huge variation of enemies, you wont face just orcs. The bossfights are different, some are pretty challenging but its not too hard on normal.I think it is or was more common for this genre, that you cant jump, space is an evade button. The game map is pretty straight forward, you cant wander around, this is not an open world rpg.I would really recommend the game to anyone who looking for some fantasy hack and slash game and eager to kill some orcs/trolls/spiders.

												9/10This game is enjoyable to play, as the main aim of the game is to slice orcs. Some people say it gets boring after a while as the whole game is the same (to slice orcs) Which gets true, But i always seem to go back and play it again in a few weeks. The combat is great, and uses a variety of skills (depending if your Man,Elf or Dwarf) to defeat Agandaurs minions. The only other problem i had with this game was it is too short, There are about 8 levels (Including Fornost,Barrow Downs, Ettermoors, Gundabad, Mirkwood, Uglost Lair, Nordinbad and Carn Dum) This roughly takes about 15-25 hours to complete. Of course, you then play it at a harder difficulty afterwards and find new armour,weapons etc. Even though the game is fasirly short I still highly recommend it as it is one of my faviourite games, and is very fun to play.

												The game is a great mindless hack-n-slash and I wish I could finish it.  Unfortunately, War in the North is broken on several AMD gpus, and has the potential to blue screen your computer in various sections of the game (specifically chapters 2 and 8).  It will also crash to desktop without warning.  If you have an AMD gpu, I recommend only playing this game if you're willing to go through several driver downgrades to get the game working.

												Although the graphics are a bit outdated, and most of the world textures are of low quality due to the game actually being a console port - the combat is very addictive and fun. The ""bleached"" out color palette can easily be changed by using sweetFX. The game is stable, didn't crash a single time and works very smooth on maxed out details. I absolutely recommend it!Too bad most of the map pins can't be accessed and are there just for lore info. But still - you'll get 10-15h from it by just playing through the normal mode.

												Genuinely fun hack-and-slash, orc genocide simulator with a touch of RPG. The game has decent plot line exploring events in the north while the Fellowship was journeying south without taking too many liberties with the lore. Gameplay is a little short, as I finished the main story line in about 20 hrs. Replay value lies in the two increased difficulty levels that which are unlocked over successive play throughs and the co-op function.The graphics were initially buggy, and the game did crash several times when I first started playing- I have an NVIDIA GeForce GT 760M. But the Steam Community was able to determine that the touch screen keyboard function for Windows 10 was the source of the problem and provided steps to disable it. With the game working well, I was able to see and admire the detail of graphics put into this game, which certainly has held up over the years- the detail and articulation of the great eagles were well done.Overall, I would say that if you are a fan of LOTR, this is a simple, fun purchase though I recommend picking it up when it is on sale (which it frequently is).

												Lord or the rings War in the north is a nice game. It isn`t perfect but I myself found it very entertaining. Games combat system is okay. Little repeating but what game doesn`t have kinda like repeating combat. The repeating is like tried to fix by adding multiple different enemy types, unique combat having bosses etc. Games combat can be a little glitchy at times. Sometimes enemy teleports to a different location, you cant hit critical strikes or enemy dies and dissappears or just dies and looks still to be alive. (All lags I remember to have experienced are on private multiplayer match). Overall game is great it is fun to play on co-op and without co-op. Storyline in`t the best but you dont have to follow everything. Main goal is just to beat up Agandaur thats it. I will rate this on scale 1-5 to 3.5/5.			",314,75,9,33,12,1,37

Solo[/b] : the AI is dumb as ♥♥♥♥, the only thing they do good is that they evolve their stuff. I can't finish the game in solo because the AI is too dumb to make the 2 characters use their spells together, the healer never heals, and the dwarf tank never stays attacking the same target, so the ennemies were all at 95% health when the dwarf died :DMulti[/b] : you can't play with 2 friends, one will always get disconnected. There are some guides to make it work but you have to use some third party software like hamachi or something like that. But it's kinda fun when it works. The race exclusive secrets you can find are cool, sometimes you drop nice stuff, and fights can be epic with bosses when you are using your abilities right. In conclusion, a good idea on paper, but not enough money to acomplish it :/ ",109,30,4,14,11,1,13

												I think it's a pretty enjoyable game, expecially if you play with friends (you might get bored playing alone). It reminds a little of the old LOTR hack n slash for ps2, which i loved as a child, of course it hasn't the best storyline but it's funny.The only bad thing is that the gameplay is short (i finished the story in about 14h), i would have enjoyed more levels			",24,0,0,5,3,0,0

												No option to disable the crappy VOIP. Dont buy this game if you want to play with friends and use TS/skype or any other voip software. The voip is hard-coded into the game, meddling with the steam voip settings doesnt work as the game simply ignores your changes. Seeing as the most popular topic on the forum is the *disable mic* topic, it clearly shows how the devs dont give a crap about anything, I wont even start about the amd cards issue.This game has one positive feature, and that is coop. And it is ruined by the voip. GG refunded			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Apparently it is documented that AMD drivers after a certain version just simply don't work right. Aaaand, don't even get me started on the storyline that can't be changed or the imbalance of characters. If it worked right, I could get along with it. As is, skip this one.			",100,3,1,9,2,1,0

												This is a fantastic, old fashioned, co-op quest game. If you're looking for something fun to do with a friend, this just might be the game for you. Because it is a little old, there are some bugs. For instance, my friend had trouble with it crashing on his computer after a few minutes because of a graphics application for touch-screen computers, but once he looked through some forums, he found a way to fix it. The graphics in general are not the best (I have several screen-shots of floating trolls XD), but the fun story and mechanics more than make up for it. This is definitely a game to play for the experience and fun, not really for the high quality visuals. I loved every minute of this game, and I will more than likely play through it again in the future.			",31,2,2,1,1,0,0

												Two years after release, Lord of the Rings: War in the North is on sale for a very meaty price of $73.99(AUD). It is a sub-par 3-player coop RPG ailed by a number of gamebreaking bugs including connection issues, lack of display and audio options, framerate issues and awful screen-tearing. Dialogue choices have no repercussions - you can threaten or remain passive and nothing will happen, although the 3 classes do somewhat complement each other in combat.  In-game chat is always on (rather, unable to be switched off)- and strangely enough, or 'logically' perhaps, your voice echoes markedly when you step into a cave- actually, they just echo anyway. If the developers thought it would make the game more immersive, newsflash- It's just f****ing annoying. Dare I say it, not even a bucketload of Athelas could fix this lame title, whose gameplay utterly bemuses the casual fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game at first feels a little shallow, but over time it's true colours emerge.  It really feels like a 3d version of Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance 1 and 2, which makes sense as I think some of the same developers were involved.  The combat is fairly good and would most likely be a blast playing with 2 other friends (I've only been playing solo at this point).  This game is well worth the $5 I paid.  I would say it would be worth buying even at $20.I'm very fussy with the games I spend my time on, and I can say that LOTRWITN has been enjoyable and I look forward to playing through the campaign a few more times at different difficulty levels.

												The story of this game plays neatly alongside the Lord of the Rings and it's 3 episodes. I found it interesting how faithful it was even to The Hobbit before & the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the narrative. You'll see. The graphics are of high quality and gameplay is in 3rd person mode. In anticipation for Shadows of Mordor which apparently plays between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, this was a decent filler! The effect of their efforts is negligent on the original Fellowship (Frodo and his partners), BUT, the effect of Frodo's efforts is felt by our trio as he destroys the ring! We have an excuse to emerse ourselves in a Middle-earth game here so WHY NOT! A worthy Lord of the Rings game.Game on.			",906,268,12,52,34,7,57

												It took me close to 20 hours to finish this game and I have not played it in co-op mode. The multiplayer lobby is always empty.I cannot with honest heart recommend this game to even to the most hardcore LoTR fans. Let me explain why:This is a console port, one of the worst I have seen yet. The UI is awful and there is no way to remove the annoying overlapping key binds from the screen.I haven’t seen any game more linear than this. Invisible walls everywhere and i mean EVERYWHERE. You can go only in one direction: forward.The combat is extremely boring and repetitive; you will be doing the same moves over and over again in a course of the entire game. The skills (spells? or powers?) are simply laughable.  The only positive thing I can say about this game is related to the story. The point when you meet few of the characters from the original movies is cool. Well it is, until you get to hear them speak - the voiceover wasn’t done by the movie actors, but by some random people.The graphics are bad even on the highest settings, sometimes the game freezes and/or crashes for no reason. There are too many unfixed bugs like floating dead enemies or enemies stuck in walls.I say, don’t waste your time and specially money on this game.			",133,18,1,8,7,2,19

												Updated since completion!If you've got a buddy that you want to play this with, and you're both able to drop the $5 while it's on sale, DO IT. I think playing solo isn't terribly fun, but playing with a friend is awesome. The game itself is pretty average, but we're having a blast having it as a cooperative game. It feels a lot like a throwback to some of the PS2 LOTR games that you could play coop, but brought to more modern graphics and other standards.You can see this game is 5 years old, but for the price of $5 on sale, it's great. I may not drop the current regular price of $20 on it, but for the sale price, awesome buy.The story is surprisingly interesting - I wouldn't say it's terribly deep, but I didn't expect it to be nearly as good as it was. You run into a lot of characters from the film and even some characters from the books, as well as many new characters that we've never met. I was expecting everyone in this game to be kind of dull and boring, but the game is more rich than that, thankfully. The gameplay is a little repetitive, but if you're someone that likes hack and slash games with some skills on the side, you'll enjoy this. I definitely did. Tldr: Buy with a buddy, solo will probably be too boring. Surprisingly deep and fun world.			",191,12,0,28,10,1,20

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a 3 player co-op God of War like, Diablo style action RPG with a 12 hour campaign, lots of rare loot to find, and a surprisingly enjoyable story. A lot of the time, these types of games just have a story to push you through the levels, but I found myself really liking the characters and caring about what was happening a long the way.The story takes place parallel to the main Lord of the Rings story, where you occasionally cross paths with the Aragorn, Frodo, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship, on your way to fight the War in the North against Agandaur, a powerful servant of Sauron. And spiders. Lots of giant spiders.This ended up being one of the best co op games I've ever played and one of the few really good Lord of the Rings games besides Shadows of Mordor. If you're looking for something fun to play with 2 other people or just want a good action RPG, pick it up.			",186,20,1,15,7,0,2

												Fantastc Game!9/10It is one of the only good Lord Of The Rings Games ive actually played and i had loads of fun singleplayer and co-op.Pros:Great combat system and it flows very well.Good storyline and lots of lore.Nice to be able to switch characters during missions and then not loose out on levels for that character.Graphics were godd for a 2011 game.Very fast loading in no waiting at the load screen for up to 5 minuites. It just loads in almost straight away.Interesting Characts and the option to play each one.Good ranged weapon combat flows well.Love being able to upgrade you're stats and skills.Loved the fact that you could choose you're own path in the final mission.I liked it that when you completed the game it went onto the next difficulty and kept all you're skills and upgrades and all of your inventory. So it was like carrying on the games but restarting (if you know what i mean) and it felt nice not to have to loot up more and more.Cons:Voice actng was not that good and they used the same actor for the two sons of Elrond.Looting. Although you dont have to loot half of the game is spent looting around the maps if you want to be able to have money or good rare items or stones. Looting for me wasnt so bad but it seemed that f you didnt lott you would end up completing the mission with no health pots, coins and other good weapons and armour.The amount of missions were lacked. I completed this game in 9 hours without trying to speed run. It just felt to rushed (the storyline) and it was ruined at the end. It could have had missions interlinking with what was happening with frodo and his felowship.I think they also should have put in a skip all option for dialouge scenes.(when you had to choose what you wanted to say)I am not sure if it was me and my other friend but we experienced major co-op lag. We would only be able to play for an hour before he lagged out and whenever he joined it just lagged him out again.But All around This game was great! I have always loved Lord Of The Rings games and this is a definite must for fans like me!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just got through the campaign in nine hours - and that's WITH revisiting some areas to finish a couple of side quests.  That being said, that's how much time you're going to spend on a single play-through.  If you're going to do a run with all three characters, and on both normal and heroic difficulties, you're looking at 50 to 60 hours of semi-original gameplay.  Coop is something I'd like to do sometime.  Maybe that'll add another 20 hours.Have you guys ever played Lord of the Rings: Third Age?  This feels like that game if it were shorter and didn't have turn-based combat.Really quickly, I'm going to give a run-down of what I definitely do and do not like - spoilers ahead.I liked the world: The devs of this game did an absolutely outstanding job of creating their world, however stunted it may be in certain areas.  Rivendell and Nordinbad were good examples due to how outstanding the architecture was, but the best area for me was the Barrow-downs.  They NAILED the atmosphere for that area, and looking out at all the outstanding crags and jagged rocks planted in the rolling green hills gave me chills.  Inside Gundabad was epic as well, being able to look across the void and see all these different things going on.  I like the weapon system: There are a bunch of weapons in the game: hand-axes, battleaxes, short swords, long swords, hammers, staffs.  You can dual-wield one-handed weapons after unlocking a specific perk thing.  While I've only played as the Ranger, there was still a great deal that I could toy with.  It seems to be about finding your style, but there's also moving between dual-wielding and broadsword wielding in order to balance damage and speed.  Also, weapons break down after time and need to be repaired by a forger.Similarly, I like the equipment system:  Giving yourself the best armor while looking for repairs on what's about to break.I like how weapons and equipments can be imbued with properties: You know, stuff like ice damage, fire damage, shock damage.  Boosts to strength, stamina, health, power.  Same kind of gimmick from Skyrim, but executed well here.  Some equipment/weapons do not have slots - others have multiple.   Fun figuring out what to trade off - damage or health?I like the checkpoints: almost every level will have checkpoints where you can sell your loot, buy very basic things like weak armor and potions, and you can return to the last safe area (Bree, Rivendell, Nordinbad).  Good for getting out if you need and dumping inventory.I'm conflicted on the lore.  I like what it tries to do, especially regarding fallen Dunedain cities and Carn Dum and the dwarves, but it comes off as something that these three characters should not be able to rise up against.  Aragorn wants you to defeat Sauron's right hand man, like no big deal champ thanks for the help?  Oh wow check out these sick dwarves taking out the whole of Mt. Gundabad with this awesome secret weapon?  That's literally Deus ex Machina.  I'm conflicted on the combat.  It's monotonous, but the perk(???) system makes it a bit interesting.  Once again, that's not something I've fully explored, but it breaks the monotony of LMB spam and the RMB coup-de-grace.  The only real hate I have is for a Mannish faction that follows Agandaur.  The grunts of this Mannish faction are overpowered.  Their swords extend beyond what their model shows, and they attack FAST.  They do not get knocked back.  Don't expect an easy one-up over these guys.  Spam your special attacks and ranged.  Or the devs can fix these guys, whatever.Can't think of anything else that I really do hate.  As a Tolkien fan who wanted more but knew this wasn't canon at all, I give this a 7/10 because I got it on sale.  Do not get this at full price. ",135,5,0,9,13,0,11

												Okay, so, I spent an hour writing out a lengthy review of this filled with insight, in depth information, pros, cons, and fully described aspects of the game with no spoilers. Then Steam decided it was going to not going to let my review go through, then proceeded to crash before I could copy what I had written (lesson learned: type out the review in Word or Notepad before copying it here). Because I don't have the energy to write out that lengthy of a review anymore, we're going to shorten what I wrote down to the important aspects of it.Rating 3.5/5-0.5 points for Difficulty scalingThe game has a co-op feature for up to three people. I beat the final boss in less than five minutes on the first try, yet other battles in the game took me an hour because I was playing solo. The game shouldn't punish me for playing solo. I shouldn't need to cover two different sides of a battle with hopeless AI that can't do it for me when solo playing.-0.5 points for Combat/MechanicsI chose to play just the dwarf for the entirety of the game rather than switching in between missions. Perhaps sticking with one character was the wrong choice because the combat is overly repetitive. Once you unlock some of the skills, it becomes a tad more varied, but then quickly goes back to repetitiveness. Atack, attack, dodge roll, attack, skill 123, attack, rinse and repeat. Nothing special. Also, there is no jump but instead a dodge roll, which is fine. However, there are many aspects of the game where the designers definitely made it seem like there was a secret on a ledge, but lo and behold, you can't jump. A few bugs where you can't attack, or can't hit a crate, or can't move around an object were present, but didn't take away from the experience.-0.5 points for MiscellaneousLack of a save function other than visiting a shop or travelling to a different place. And my biggest gripe is the inability to compare weapons when trying to buy something. I shouldn't have to look at my gear, memorize the stats, go into the shop, look at the boots there, realize I forgot the stats of my equipped item, back out, and do it all over again. That is beyond tedious. And the last miscellaneous complaint is the challenge missions. Much like any game like this, there are challenge missions where you have to defeat multiple waves of enemies. Unfortunately, after spending 30 minutes on a challenge mission, you get nothing for beating it other than the experience from killing the monsters. I went through 20 healing pots and didn't get a single reward for my troubles?+1 point for Visuals/Voiceover The game isn't anything spectacular visually (it IS five years old), but it has a certain charm to it and does what it can to honor the world of Middle Earth. The voiceover work was a real great point of interest for me as a voice actor. Most of the voice over was well done with fantastic casting. +1 point for Lore/StoryFor any fans of the books/movies, this game definitely does a good job of immersing you into familiar territory. There will be quite a few familiar faces, and a whole myriad of new ones. There are familiar locations like Rivendell and Bree, and a few new ones like Nordinbad (a Dwarven city). +1 point for Skills/Gear/LevelingThis one was on the fence for me. I was afraid the system was going to be too simple, but it turns out it's rather nice. Leveling up grants three points to be spent in either Strength (melee damage), Stamina (health), Will (mana), or Dexterity (ranged damage). Then you get to put one point in your skill tree. Each character has three active skills you can unlock with respective trees underneath those skills. Unfortunately, each tree has randomly thrown in skills that often don't have anything to do with the skill you unlocked. The gear isn't visually impressive. Finding a new sword won't WOW you visually, but a clear stat difference can be seen when using it in combat. I could go into more detail, but, the entire system is just meh, but I don't have many complaints on it.Overall, the game isn't too bad. The replayability is pretty good because once you beat it on normal mode, you unlock heroic mode where you can play through again but stay the same level so you can unlock more things and get better gear. I would recommend playing it with a friend rather than going solo. tl;dr Not bad. Not good. If you're a fan of LotR, give it a try. Play with a friend.			",93,20,0,13,18,1,6

												Played the game with a friend, had fun for the whole duration I believe.There are three characters to choose from... To best explain the three choices, think Warrior, Rogue and Mage/Priest (They aren't called these in the game though). You don't have to stick to one character through, you can change after every level if you wish to.The combat is nice, I played the Lore Master (Mage/Priest) most of the time, I liked the skills. You aren't really limited to only ranged attacks though, melee is effective as well.There are some class-specific secrets but we did not replay (yet, maybe in the future, but not for the secrets.. Just to have fun again!)I haven't played it solo but it should still be fun but co-op games are (almost) always more enjoyabled with friends, no?			",148,17,3,22,12,3,33

												I DO NOT recommend this game to be play in Co-op mode. You'll be stuck at Barrow's Wight boss fight if you are the joiner and get disconnected from the host after defeating the boss. The host will passed that stage to Rivendell without a problem and be farther ahead. This what happened to me while I was playing Co-op with my cousin. The problem was I could not proceed from there while I went back to single mode. There is a invisible wall that exists during the boss fight that keeps you from running up toward him. The possessed ranger was already dead, but all the sound effects, dialog, and music was going as if I were fighting the boss. It corrupted my saved game. The SOLUTION was I joined someone game who was at Chapter 2 The Barrow-downs and proceed from there to Barrow's Wight boss fight and then to Rivendell. I know it will waste your time, but just hopefully the host won't kick you or leave the game. You'll get disconnect from the cutscene for Rivendell. I joined back to the same host as quickly. Then I exit the host while I was at Rivendell and from there on I was at Chapter 3. Other soulution is to start the game all over in a single mode.This game is fun, but have glitch, and issues when playing in multiplayer mode. Most of the time you'll get disconnected and saying you lost connection from the host.Best to play it in single mode. Just to let you guys know ahead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Damn it. This is an exercise in frustration - [bold]crashing is strong in this one[/bold].Already at the second chapter progressing is painfull because of that...Even worse off that the game itself looks and plays not as bad as it crashes. While it certainly lacks polish in some moments like inventory management and NPC interaction, you would want to at least play it through once(I know I want).You may get lucky and miss all the crashing business with this title, but chances are pretty thin, so even on sale this is a questionable purchase.(Can only imagine the frustration from the multiplayer when one of the players gets the crash-out...)

Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a fine game. It has every basic RPG aspect and it's pretty fun in co-op. However, it's just mediocre and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and it's completely fine to love this game, especially if you're a LOTR fan, but I don't think it's worth the full price. Nowadays you can get it for like 2€.Pros:☼ Fairly good storyline☼ Co-op☼ Fun combat system with satisfying finishers☼ Lots of LOTR trilogy elements ☼ Enough loot and levels (40) to keep the gameplay experience fresh☼ A fair amount of different enemies☼ 3 different characters to choose from (dwarf/ranger/elf)☼ Immersive soundtracks☼ Runs even on a toasterCons: ☼ Characters lack personality☼ Multiple glitches☼ Gameplay is linear and may get repetitive☼ Lack of skills☼ Lack of options (e.g. resolutions)☼ Bad inventory management☼ Outdated graphics☼ Voice chat is not mutable in co-opOverall, 7/10. If I had to sum up this game in one word it would be ""average"" ",203,42,10,15,12,1,17

												This game is surprisingly fun, even for someone who is not into the LOTR franchise like me.This game is designed for 3 players, but can easily be played with 2 players aswell. If you are 2 players, I recommend nobody picking the dwarf, since he is too overpowered and you will just be brainlessly stomping through the game with him.However, the game has a few technical flaws. For example, the built-in voice chat is not mutable, and when restarting the game some of your preferences get lost (like the game's audio settings or the arrangement of the items in your inventory). I've seen quite a few other reviews mention alot of crashes and bluescreens, I never experienced such an occurence though.If you can live with a few technical downsides like these, you can have a few great hours with this game. As reference, it took me about 25 hours to complete the game 3 times (once on each difficulty).			",1180,415,52,163,176,23,240

												I saw the Lord of the Rings franchise games were on sale, so I read the reviews of this game, and it interested me enough so I picked it up. I bought it at around 2pm and the next thing I know, it was midnight! This game is so much fun, I hated to turn it off. 10 straight hours playing, and I love it! I wish I had played this game years ago. Going to probably buy it for my family to play it too now. The only thing I think this game could really use is cheaper health potions in the beginning. At around 200 silver a pop, I felt like you had a harder time starting off. But after you get further in, all my money problems are solved and I can blow tons of money on potions and not even feel it. Great game guys! Pick it up today!!			",23,3,0,9,11,0,4

I've underestimated this game when I first watched its gameplay videos but it suddenly came from WB bundle, so I decided to gather 2 friends and give it a try. We just couldn't stop playing it, It has quite a decent plot and storytelling, decent gameplay and it's incredibly fun to master teamplay and invent simple or more complex tactics with customizing your character's skills or gear.

												A fun co-op RPG with a fairly linear story, LotR War in the North is an entertaining game. Don't expect to be blown away by anything in particular with this game, it's just solidly good all around. Not amazing, but good. The 3 playable characters are all fun, but there are only 3. The looting system is decent but the lack of shops bugged me, selling items to a glowing patch of the ground seemed weird and cheap. The combat is responsive, but repetitive. The co-op is alright, but buggy. Do you see where I'm going with this? All in all, the game is fun. If you can grab it on sale or as part of a bundle, do it. If not, you choose.

												I had this game in wishlist for some time, because I wasn't sure if it is worth full price. So when it was on sale I grabbed it. And I was very pleasantly surprised.  Story isn't ground-breaking creation, I would say decent or average is more accurate. But its strength is in addictive fighting system and LOTR setting, accompanied by beautiful soundtrack. And of course coop mode gives some extra points. Also you will meet some old friends from movies, mainly in Imladris(Rivendell). I wouldn't believe I could spent 55 hours in this game, but it was well spent time.Positive:-LOTR setting-coop mode-talents, secrets, weapons and armors unique to each playable character-fine voice acting-Farin is really OP(in solo play it can be great help, mainly on harder difficulties)Negative:-simple story-Farin is really OP(on the other hand in coop, it can be annoying)I suggest you to wait for some sale and then it is must have.

												LOTR: War in the North is a fairly straight forward action based rpg, which nevertheless brings on many hours of fun.Plot: the game seeks to expand on Tolkien's Middle Earth by presenting a side story that happens along side the War of the Rings. You get to play as either Eradan the ranger, Andriel the lore-master, or Farin the champion, to thwat the plans of Sauron's commander, Agandaur. While exploring vast landscape from the Shire, to Grey Mountains, and Mirkwood, you get to meet members from the fellowship of the rings, side characters such as Radagast the Brown, and even a mighty dragon. If you've played LOTR: the Third Age, the narrative of this game is fairly similiar.Gameplay: the 3 aspects of a good RPG are present in this game, namely - statpoints, skilltree, and itemization. As there are limited points and inventory space to go around, decisions must be made into how your character is created. While the diversity of types of character is definitely limited, it is enough to keep you entertained for a 20-50hrs long game.Unlike The Third Age, this game is a action based RPG and each 'encounter' with orcs requires some sort of finesse to defeat them. However, the game is not too hard, and it actually becomes easier as you unlock the heroic, and legendary difficulty levels. On the same note, a major flaw in this game is that the difficulty is based on the character you choose *winks* Farin, rather than the level you are playing on. Also, unlocking the 'legendary' difficutly, requires you to complete the game two times on it's fairly short storyline. This may get boring, although the lure of better items, hitting the maximum level, and uncovering all the secrets/collecting all 50 achievements is enough to keep a player going. Quests in this game is fairly one dimensional as most of them cannot be missed as long as you diligently explore the maps and talk to the NPCs. More details shoud be added to the  backstory to make this game more vibrant and interesting. 'Secrets' on the other hand requires some time spent exploring and manipulation of the ever annoying 'game save' mechanics, and this may frustrate players unless they find a guide (which there are surprisingly few online). Lastly, this game UI is clearly based on the console version, and some mechanics such as character movement and inventory management, feels clunky and poorly done up. However, this is not a problem after taking some time getting used to it, although, a PC game controller will certainly improve the experience.Audio/visual: the landscapes and character design are extremely well done for a 2011 game with details such as seeing the weaves in Elrond's shirt, rock patterns in the background, and blood splatter as you chop off the orc's head. While the game's background music and action sounds are vibrant, the voice acting could be better, to add more life to the storyline, and make the hero jouney seems more epic. Together, the atmosphere of the game felt a letdown as the good visuals such as the never ending rain in Bree is not complimented with audio effects to bring about an immersive expierence.Verdict: Overall, War in the North gets more fun as you progress along the difficulty levels, and your character feels truely powerful on the final difficulty level. However, the clunky mechanics, limited depth to the character's development, quests and backstory limits this game from  being an epic RPG. Also the game design restrict it to around 60hrs of gameplay before it gets repetitive. Thus, this game would be a good buy during steam sales as a form of pasttime, but definitely not a must-have, unless you are a Lord of the Rings fan.Disclaimer: this review is written based on solo-play only, and I have yet to encounter any bugs with this game.

												I really wanted to like this game. I was beyond excited to see a co-op LOTR game, and I snatched it up for friends and family. I started playing and enjoyed the story and loved the characters. I was even willing to overlook the black hole that your companions cary (NEVER give your companions anything, you must equip manually or risk loosing it forever).  I was eager to join in on campaigns with my BF, and just let the game absorb my soul.So what went wrong...well the inability to play after a certain point. For some reason a few chapters in, the game just freezes and crashes. I have tried everything I could find in the forums, I did everything I could think of. Months went by with me loosing faith in a game I was enjoying. Now the only fix I have is to uninstall the game and resentfully look at it in my LIbrary. I also feel a bit guilty for buying such a glitched game for everyone.			",64,32,0,23,12,0,13

												As an avid LOTR fan, I can say I'm awfully disappointed with this horrendous turd of a game. Since there aren't any PROs, I'll just go ahead and list the CONs.- Pointless story which is completely irrelevant to the LOTR movies/books.- Terrible gameplay. To sum it up in one word: REPETITIVE. Expect to grind through the same mobs of enemies and reused bosses for the 10 hour length of the game.- Awful dialogue and voice acting. Hearing the same cheesy one-liners from the characters over and over again drove me crazy.- The graphics for this game are totally outdated; even for a game that was released in 2011. (Playing on ultra settings, I saw no difference between the visuals in this game and the visuals in LOTR: Return of the King on the ♥♥♥♥ing Gamecube.)- Bad UI and inventory management. This makes the process of navigating menu's and matchmaking incredibly painful.- Poor level design. Each chapter is basically a rinse-and-repeat. (Field, Cave, Building. THIS x INFINITE.)Unfixed Problems/Bugs/Glitches:- InGame mic voice chat. It allows players' mics to constantly be open and there's no way to disable it. (A complete bummer for some people that use external VOIP software such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo.)- Black screens and game crashes. Expect to replay entire segments of the game because of this. (These issues are even worse for AMD users.)- Issues with savedata.This game seems nothing more than a cash-grab and is a complete disappointment for true LOTR fans.Please save your money. Don't buy this game. ",435,99,13,37,25,4,43

												Let me describe the experience of attempting to play this crappy port of what maybe could be a good game, but I couldn't tell you because i've never been able to play it. It starts off with you loading up and inviting your friends, while you are using your 3rd party chat server, you have now discovered that voice chat is forced, and there is no way to change any of the settings in game to eliminate it. Not to mention the steam voice option is just terrible in general. After you decide that, hey we will just use keyboard to chat in game, after wasting hours of time trying to fix the voice feature. Trying to join up with friends is awful, you can connect and stay in the lobby and load up the game, but once you are in game, it kicks someone randomly. Why is it that we can play so many games flawlessly and yet this game has such issues? It's because they pushed out a port of this as quick as they could, and then never patched anything, They couldn't even be bothered to put an option for disabling the chat feature.I'm so disgusted and now i'm out of hard earned money, not to mention my time that I spent trying to troubleshoot this awful game into working. I spent my entire weekend trying to get this game working being optimistic and hopeful. It's not worth it. Just stay away, go get it on whatever console that it was intended for, maybe that version will work better, but I would definitly research that carefully as well.TL;DR Version: The game is buggy and unplayable, touts a multiplayer style of gameplay that doesn't work, and doesn't allow you to disable or change any microphone settings that are very terrible. Stay away from this game at all costs.			",598,120,13,70,55,6,62

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a great game, following the story of the original Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien, yet providing an alternate part of the story. Here you control one of the 3 heroes from the legendary races, Dunedain ( Human ) , Elf and Dwarf. Talking about graphics, this game is pretty good considering it's from 2011 and uses the Dark Alliance Engine, which I find extraordinary for a hack-and-slash game like this. This game earns his name as an RPG, having many characters to talk to and having enough side quests to make the story not seem linear. As for battle mechanics, this game does pretty well. Fast paced action and fast responce allows the player to make extraordinary combos. To top it off, there is the ""Hero Mode"", which activates after a critical hit has been made. This allows the player to inflict massive quantities of damage, provided that he can hit constantly and elude the blows of enemies, most of which you knock you down or stagger you for just enough time for you to lose your combo.The game lacks a bit if it is to be compared to Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, with less to barely any combos, which made the first title so enjoyable. Yet the second title compensates with alot of loot, sprinkled with that I believe to be legendary weapons, some even imbued with fire.Other factors to keep in mind are multiplayer and replayability. The game seems to have extraordinary capabilities for co-op support, even non-LAN-based, which LotR:RotK lacked, yet I haven't had the opportunity to try it. As for replayability, this game seems to have 3 difficulties : Normal, Hero and Legendary. Considering that you can combine different classes with your friends to make the perfect team, where each player can chooses the character best suited for him, I'd say that you can defilitely replay this game.

												Played this with friends a few years ago and it was extremly fun, And now we are playing it again and its just as fun. Perfect game to play with a couple of friends. Hard to find games like this that has co-op. Story rich game, and fun combats. Cant say i have run into any problems with runing this game myself.And i wish there where more games like this where me and my friends are all the main characters insted of many games where there is just 1 main character and the rest are followers.

												Definitely a worthwhile play.  If you're an RPGer that likes a little co-op play then this is perfect.  THe storyline keeps you wanting to know more while the combat and gear machanics are interesting enough to warrant a little exploration.  A little short for my tastes, but I'm also an old fashioned RPGer so I typically expect 70+ hours out of my games.  I'd say you can finish this entire storyline in about 5 hours.			",30,3,0,8,0,0,2

												Played it for almost 100h on different accounts now. The game is quite simple actually, but you can get a lot out of that simplicity. ** Basics- Three different characters (Ranger, Dwarf, Elf) - Direct movement (WASD/Left Stick), direct aiming (Mouse/Right Stick)- Always all three characters in play. Coop or NPCs. (Many people have technical probs with coop. You might want to check that out.)- Different levels with multiple Zones (Mirkwood part1/2 ...)You enter at one point, exit at another one and destroy everything that moves on your way. - Grab the loot! Obviously!- Enter different towns between the zones. Sell/Buy/Repair/Get Quests. - Unlimited free travel to replay visited locations. (However the many boss mobs are not thereif you revisit a location.)** Visuals- Not high level for current gen, but it looks decent. - Sets and Landscapes are very well designed. Some areas felt like walking through the cover of a classic fantasy book. ** RPG- No real character based roleplaying. You can choose between a few conversation alternatives. But you cannot change the NPCs or your characters or the story in any meaningful way. It is about as linear as Diablo.- Very small number of town based quest. Almost all quest are about gathering loot during the fights.  ** Fighting- Hack&Slash + Ranged Shooting. You will be using both and it is quite fun. - Dwarf and Ranger use crossbows and bows, Elf uses magic bolts. - Some meele weapons are also class character exclusive. - Basic combo slashing ""AAA"", get a note for a critical attack, ""B"", knockdown/kill. - You fight smaller groups along the way and bigger mobs/bosses in arena type areas. ** Skills- Specific skill tree for all three characters. Kind of similar but the trees help to enhancedifferent playstiles or at least different feel. - Each skill matters but might be less usefull depending on your build. - Respec token available, so don't worry. ** Leveling- Level 40 is max. - Level 20 is roughly what you get after a first playthrough. - Unlimited playthroughs. Difficulty raises up to 'legendary'.- Attribute points are more important for equipment requirements than stat changes. ** Some Notes- Don't go for that one ultimate item set. At least not until you approach legendary. You will grow out of items a lot. Use that to have fun and replace them many times. Use your elfstones, try different weapons. In the next playthrough you will laugh about the stats of the former one. - Helpful item boni change over time. In the beginning you want more armor, more health, more coints etc to not die. In the end you want damage multipliers and cooldown reduction to get through those puny orks fast. - A single item with x5 coins can remove all your money worries. - Rare items are rare! You need quite a few playthroughs to get the 'perfect' equipment.You will be finishing the game with eyes closed by that time. - Your item inventory is large. Keep alterantive weapons for different situations. - Use mirrors to customize your appearance. Made the characters a lot more likeable to me. - Switch between characters if you cannot finish some area (should not be the case) or maybe a quest requires a certain character. *wink*- Don't stress yourself over lost items/opportunities etc. You can replay as many times as you like. Just carry on. - Special boni carry over from weapons to special moves. A good reason to go for dual wielding. ** Suggestions- Dwarf is considered the most powerful character. He has a broken overpowered ranged attackthat takes the whole challenge out of the game. Spare the dwarf for later, if you are interested in the other characters too. Its hard to fight big mobs and strong bosses with an axe, if you can one-shot them anyway. - Ranger is the most 'dull' (and kinda dumb looking) character. But if you want to play a sword and bow fighter, you can have a lot of fun with that guy. Ranger is a good start for a first playthrough and does not suffer from game ending op attacks. - Elf is primarily written as healer/supporter for the other two. You become the nanny for them when you play the elf. Makes the fights different and more rewarding. ** Elf tips- You are the NPC healer. But as a player you have to look after the other guys. That can be very frustrating when you play with two NPCs for dwarf and ranger. Make it your challenge to keep those little dummies alive. - When one NPC dies, the other one instantly tries to revive them. Even if they run into a mob and get killed instantly. After that you are the only target left and have the mob all to yourself. And not time to revive your buddies. Annyoing, but also challenging and a great reason to curse those stupid NPCs!!- Yes you DO need dexterity for your magic missiles damage. But all characters get high ranged damage without dexterity anyway. Attributes don't effect damage output that much. Focus on meeting item requirements. - A very rewarding build is to go for the Elfs AoE attack. A nova/splash attack that can later take out entire mobs of the strongest enemies. No Dex needed. Not much power (mana) upgrade needed.- Ranged attacks have a high mana cost and don't profit from casting cost reduction. - Elemental attacks and other modifiers take over from melee weapons to AoE attack. - Collect the ingredients for potions and USE them. Your inventory will be full with that stuff, so at least drink it.  - You can build an AoE based Elf that kills almost any enemy with a single splash attack and does rarely need a potion for health/mana at all. VERY rewarding after all the babysitting. - There is one boss towards the end that your gf might find very disgusting. ;)""She"" drops a staff sometimes. Take a good look at that one and think about dual wielding and some quest rewards you might have collected...			",108,14,1,12,8,1,6

												I bought this game because of the co-op and because there aren't many RPG-Action Co-Ops out there. It seemed like a great opportunity to play my favourite game genre with my friend. And it might be a decent experience, if you get around the bugs, some of which might force you into restart.My rating without the bugs is 7/10. My rating with bugs is 4/10. I would not recommend this game for its full price, but with discount and some friends to play with, you might give it a try.PROS:Apart from being a co-op game there really isn't any other positive outstanding feature in this game, because as an Action-RPG game it provides only a mediocre gameplay experience and boring dialogues.CONS:-Pour graphics even for 2011. Compared to Witcher 2, which was released in the same year, LoR: War in the North is something from Stone Age.-Simple battle system: just fast attack and strong attack, blocking and few skills. There are no combos and, if you are patient enough, you can just hold block and attack simultaneously, without taking any damage (apart from ranged attacks)-Confusing crafting system, unless you learn the names of all the plants and components, it's hard to understand what will be the result of your crafting.- There is no push-to-talk, you are forced to listen to all the background noise from your gaming buddy's microphone.-If you finish a quest, you can return to complete it again. I can't understand whether it's meant to be like that or it's a bug. Either way it doesn't help you to understand what to do next.- No mini-map. It's a big problem in Burrow-downs cave system and Forest for apparent reasons.- Bad camera work – does not always follow the character.- BUGS!!!1. Some quests get stuck. No solution. Restart the game or change the host (if co-op).2. Completed quests revert back ""in progress"", if you return to the same area.3. Some enemies (bosses), which should spawn, do no appear.4. Sometimes it's not possible to revive your allies. Normally it's possible.5. I started to play this game with my friend. But on our second co-op session this game told me that he has progressed further than me and that I will not be able to get achievements and to save my progress. However none of us had played the game in single-player mode after the previous session, so we were on the same line.6. Graphical glitches.			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												Overall, it's your standard beat 'em up hack and slash, but it's got a great amount of LOTR flavor thrown into it.  You can chose between three rolls, a human ranger, a elven mage, or a dwarf warrior, giving you a fair bit of variance between how exactly you kill Orcs and Uruk-hai (and a lot more.)  The maps are quite a great sight seeing experience with a large bit of map interactivity, rarely leaving the feeling of playing the same thing.The setting itself is just so perfect for a video game, leaving you to follow your own unique LOTR story while maintaining everything which has already been made.  It truly casts you into the line of your favorite story hero, even during the co-op experience.  Which leads to the games greatest feature - Co-Op.War in the North is AMAZING in co-op.  The game was seemingly made for it from the ground up.  If you're looking for a hack and slash co-op game, this might just be the one for you.Similar games:  Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, Fable 3, Batman series, Darksiders series, Brutal Legend, Witcher 2.

												8.7/10 LOTR: War in the North sheds a whole different light on the story.This game has got to be my favorite LOTR game (Haven't played Shadow of Mordor, thats next :p). What is really cool about this game is it doesn't just retell the story of the fellowship but rather a group of three with a quest equally as important. You do get to see all the characters from the movies at one point but the main focus is on your group. One thing that is rather strange is that everyone you meet is always saying how this story should be written down, but I guess that was to stress the importance of your mission. The combat in this game felt kinda dull, while you had a range of abilities you run into enemies that are just copies of each other but with different skins and greater stats. So once you master how to defeat a troll you shouldn't have a problem again. When you play singleplayer your two companions aren't really helpful for anything but reviving you. They will keep guys occupied but have no finishing capabilites. You find at the end of the mission you did 3/4 of all the damage dealt. Overall this game was a lot of fun. The side quests aren't too interesting but the main questline is where everything comes alive. If you have yet to, pick up this game and give it a shot.			",75,2,3,14,9,0,8

												For the most part, War in the North delivers a satisfying romp through Middle Earth. It looks good, sounds good, and you get to explore a few really interesting places and meet some fun characters in search of random loot. In a rare stroke of ambition for a Lord of the Rings game, you're also presented with an original story rather than going on the adventures of Frodo & Co. for the umpteenth time. Some parts get more than a little fanfiction-y, and combat isn't as fluid as it needs to be, but even in areas where the game has glaring flaws, you manage to have just enough fun to overlook those shortcomings.

Some battles requires you to target specific part of bosses and involves quick-time events.

												Dear fellow gamerAfter just 17 hours me and my friend finished a single playthrough of the game in co-op. We discovered something: this game is a must in co-op! We had loads of fun and we were frustrated more than once when we couldn’t kill a boss or troll. But in the end we got through and concluded that this game is more than awesome!! On the other hand we were let down by the final battle, which was simply tooooooo easy, since we had more difficulty defeating the first boss in the game. THE STORY: We were pleasantly surprised by the fact that the story is interwoven with the actual storyline of LOTR. You even come across characters as Aragorn, Gandalf, Lord Elrond, Legolas and Gloin (known from the Hobbit-trilogy) and even Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. You follow three companions (Eradan, Andriel and Farin) on their quest to defeat a minion of the dark lord Sauron. On their way they make several friends and stops in the north of Middle Earth.GRAPHICS: Not bad at all for a game that is already 4 years old. We saw a fair amount of detail on armours, buildings and the like and didn’t realise we were playing such an old game.INTERFACE: Convenient use of hotkeys and a useful minimap! The inventory was a little off, since you had very limited space and images for additional and trivial objects in the world of Middle Earth.GAMEPLAY: We found it very useful that you could see the name of your friends on screen even if they were in an entirely different place/room. A very useful feature of the game is that you have the option to exchange items with other players that are only suitable for that particular race. Conveniently enough there were several sell/buy/return to civilisation-points.- For the Ranger: Very smooth movement of the character during a fight and one of the current reviewers enjoyed the swordplay a little too much at times. We liked the convenient switch between two-handed, one-handed, dual wielding and bow very useful. And, contrary to some other RPG’s,  the realism of being attacked whilst you are looting or switching weapons was very satisfactory to us! We loved the critical, brutal, legendary, etc. strikes with the swords and headshots with the bow too. They lead to some pretty funny ways of dying! We would’ve loved an alternative attack with hotkey ‘2’ while using a two-handed sort, but that could just be because we didn’t unlock every skill in the skill tree. Conclusion; Eradan was a great ranger.- For the Lore-master: Andriel has some great abilities to use in combat, as a supportive mage. For example, she can conjure a magical shield that can protect you against arrows and magical blasts. She also can use her staff as a melee weapon, that is actually quite strong. Because of her Elven ancestry, Andriel can use herbs to fabricate potions to support herself or her companions. This can be decisive at some points in the game.- For the Champion: Not applicable (yet), but Farin is awesome!! He got us out of trouble more than once…more like a thousand times…LOL. ALSO FUN;	- You can use your Eagle friend to do all the heavy work for you.	- You meet a dragon; Which seems to be very popular amongst gamers.	- Turrets!Overall conclusion: 'The Lord of the Rings - War in the North' is a must have if you are a fan of the LOTR, RPG and/or co-op gaming, with a bit of hack & slash in it. We had hours and hours of fun (and yet more to come) and we didn't get bored with the storyline once, even though all those trolls were a pain. Me and my friend decided that we definitely are going to play this game a few times each year... *Totally not addicted*Enjoy the game!			",188,61,4,44,38,2,50

												This game is definitely one of my favourites that I own. It isn't exactly amazing, but it isn't bad at all. The story is pretty good, nothing too exciting however. You don't really get any sort of connection with the characters. You're kinda just an elf, dwarf and a human who are tossed together, it feels. Throughout the game you get to visit places such as Fornost, the Barrow-downs, Rivendell and even Carn Dum, the capitol of the old Angmar empire. As far as pros go, the story is alright, and you can tell the devs did put a bit of research into things. There's a few nice name drops here and there as well. The soundtrack is pretty good, and none of the levels are exactly impossible, though in some cases it can get that way pretty easily. Combat is alright, consists mainly of LMB for light attacks and RMB for heavier attacks, or a critical attack when the enemy has a yellow arrow over their head. You also have 3 abilities for melee and 3 for ranged, used with the 1, 2 and 3 buttons. You also have a handy eagle to call with the fourth. Combat isn't exactly amazing however, I'll admit, though it's pretty simple to get the hang of. Isn't slippery or hard to adapt to whatsoever. You and your companions are, in a way, tied in with that of the Fellowship, and several things that occur in the movies happen because of things you did, which is pretty neat.Now to the cons. This game is pretty well known to have a LOT of bugs. There's a few quests in particular that are very buggy, and you can easily screw yourself over with them. If you're focusing on whether this is canon, I've seen mostly people saying that it is not canon. The achievements aren't very bad at all, either, though the ""strength of our alliance"" achievement is extremely tedious to get in my experience, and is very buggy as well. There is a lot of issues when it comes to balance. As Farin, the dwarf, unlocking the explosive bolt can do up to 150k damage from what I've seen personally. Which can instant-kill trolls and usually 2-3 shot a boss. Took around 8 shots or so to kill the final boss with it. Now, what I said earlier about the levels sometimes being crazy hard comes down to you. If you run out of health potions, you do NOT have the option to save manually. So, if you go into a level, run out of potions and can't leave (example being a later stage of Nordinbad) you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed, and you have to do it on your own. Ended up doing this myself and trying to do it with no health potions, which isn't too easy. To 100% complete the game there's a minimum of 3 playthroughs to get the achievement for beating the Legendary mode. This is a little bit of a con as well, in that there isn't really any sense of a challenge. Mobs do a little more damage and take some more as well, but it never really is an issue.Now, be warned, two levels in particular, the Barrow-downs and Carn Dum are very well known for crashing computers. I run the game flawlessly on ultra settings, but I crash constantly in these spots. I read that it has something to do with AMD drivers or something along the lines, but I don't know much about that. Just be warned that it does have some crashing issues.In the end, the game is pretty good, has a good bit of replayability, it isn't boring or stretched thin, and it's pretty well rounded. It does have a lot of bugs and isn't the greatest with balance in the second and third playthroughs, (being in your favour as opposed to being in the enemy's favour) but there isn't really any game breaking issues. The community isn't too lively, though if you really want the one online achievement, you only need to post in the forums of the game that you want help and people flock to it. I believe the game has a built in system that causes open mics constantly, which is EXTREMELY annoying when you're an English speaking man, but get stuck with a very angry spanish child being scolded by his father while a Russian laughs and calls him a ♥♥♥♥♥ for it. It isn't amazing, but it isn't bad at all. I personally really like the game, it has a great feeling to it, and it's nice to be able to have a good lotr game. Be warned that the voices of the few fellowship members you meet are not the same as the movies, so don't get too hype thinking they'll make a cameo. I'd definitely recommend this game. I'd give it an 8/10, only lacking the two points for the crashing issues, lack of a challenge in the later levels, and balance issues that break whatever challenge would have been from the Heroic and Legendary difficulties. (Probably worth mentioning you have NO interaction with Mordor, Sauron, Isenguard or anything of the such. You have your own quest that you and your companions are going on dealing with the North. Don't go in expecting to see the black gates.)			",85,8,1,13,14,0,15

												It's an alright game for $5.This game plays alright, it's a typical hack and slash game you can play with up to 3 people online co op.+Multiplayer Co-Op online with private/public matches for campaign mode+Easy to learn and play+Has built in voice chat with no need to press/trigger a speech key+Decent graphics for a game that is what... 5 years old?+Basic skill trees with stat growth you can pick from+Basic alchemy for Elf character+Loot system for Common to Rare gear-If you have a specific type of graphics card (Radeon series) you have to download certain drivers to stop game from crashing randomly-Can be annoying to host a game and have friends join as a new character since characters passed a specific point in game will have auto save/save features disabled completely-Built in game voice chat sucks. It lags, cuts out, and is not stable.Over all worth $5 if you're looking for a LotR game to kill time with friends for mindless slashing and hacking			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good game to play alone and even better to play with your close friends because there will be missions that with extra human help will go smoother. It has plenty of story, (voice acting could be better but isn't bad itself), most places you'll relate from the movies and good characters to please the fans. The gameplay has some minor bugs, nothing that ruins your experience in my point of view, because you emerse yourself in the action of the story and look aside of that to save someone or to give that finishing blow on a giant troll/giant spider XD. The controls take a couple of minutes to get used to but if you are used to play this tipe of games then it will be a piece of cake for you to play it. To me, being a fan of the lord of the rings movies and all, this game is quite good and shows another side of this epic battle against evil and you feel good being a part of it and helping the heroes gain time to destroy the ring of power.And besides, just to see your character fly in one of those giant eagles like gandalf in the movies is just priceless XDI absolutelly recomend this game! :D			",130,29,4,16,10,1,11

												Lord of the Rings? Check!Coop Story? Check!Killing hundreds of orcs? CHECK !!!!11Wow what can I say, I LOVED playing this game with 2 friends. It's ♥♥♥♥ing epic..Buy it together with some friends and enjoy it. There's nothing better than playing Lord of the Rings with friends. (Slaying orcs alone is okay as well, but its freakin' awesome when there are 3 people running through the orc lines and slaughtering everything).Buy buy buy! Totally worth its money!!

												Spent hours upon hours of my life playing this outside of Steam when I was younger.I beat the game several times on each difficulty, and then started all over again. Awesome game with a very complementing atmosphere, crisp visuals, three great protagonists, and gruesome combat.Unfortunately, LOTR: WITN is rather linear and only has an illusion of being 'open world'.Still I HIGHLY recommend it, and for the sales price of $4.99, it's definitely worth it.

												Great hack and slash game with coop up to 3 players total. The graphics are a bit sketchy, you'll run into some clipping, and you may encounter some glitches which stops you from completing side quests. Also, you cannot mute your coop partners voice (mic) or use push to talk. You and your whole team will be speaking freely, so dont fart, cough, spit, puke or crunch loudly or you may annoy your team lol. There is a workaround for this that worked for my friend, but it did not work for me. I got this game for a great price and it was well worth it.			",258,66,4,11,40,2,19

LORD OF THE RINGS: WAR IN THE NORTHREVIEWYes, this is yet another adaptation from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings novel trilogy, one of the best fantasy book series of all time. It also uses characters-model from the movies...but...it's a totally different story. Kind of. In the south, war breaks between the Dark Lord Sauron and the free people of Middle Earth, as shown in the movies/books. But the game shows a ""hidden"" story: a fellowship composed of Eradan, a Dunedáin (man), Farin, a dwarf and Andriel, a she-elf. They too, embark in a journey to fight for the north of Middle Earth, at the same time of the LOTR trilogy battles in the south. It's an interesting idea and the plot develops really well. With the presence of beloved characters that will make a LOTR fan smile, a decent villain and some good character development for Beleram, an Eagle that helps in the journey, i liked the story. The ending is also epic and amazing with a challenging boss fight. Talking about boss fights, the game have a lot of them and they're all pretty good. The game is challenging even in the lowest difficult (normal) because of tough enemeis in high quantities. Sometimes is frustrating because of your companions AI when you die in combat, but it's pretty rewarding, as this game is about loot and there is a lot of it. You can choose one of the three characters to play, and all of them have unique skills to upgrade and purchase, that's real nice. Also they have unique abilities and usable weapons, making the variation of playing with each one of them unique. You can even play online, whick makes the game a lot more enjoyable. But while playing offline, the companions AI is pretty bad, and sometimes you die just because they messed up while trying to ressurect you. It's frustrating. The graphics are outdated, and the facial animations are bad, but the scenarios are really awesome. The combat is very cool with all aplicable skills and upgrades, use of potions and weapons, inclding ranged weapons. But it gets too repetitive. The whole game is a bit repetitive, there is no puzzles, just go and kill a thousand enemies, proceed, then do it again. It may have RPG elements, but it's pretty linear besides the fact you can travel to some places, and challenge maps in scenarios from LOTR trilogy. There is dialog system too, which have zero impact on the story and only serves to know more about events/begin side quests. There is some side quests and some of them are decent, but there is only a few. The soundtrack, as expected, is awesome and have some beautiful melodies and epic combat tracks. You can call for Beleram support, which is awesome and helps a lot. The game length is good for an action game and you can replay in higher levels of difficult with the same weapons and equipment (there is armor and other stuff in good quantity). Kind of new game+, adding replay value because you can use other characters. You can swap characters during the campaign by only going back to menu or at certain points, and giving them items mean nothing, they don't use them and you should switch at least one time to up their skills and equip the loot they found because those dumbasses don't do anything alone. The game have some bugs too, as usual.+Replayability+Boss Battles+Epic ending+Decent plot+Beautiful scenarios+Lots of weapons, armors, skills, upgrades+Secrets and loot +Good characters+Absolutely epic ending sequence and boss fight+A few sidequests+LOTR Trilogy characters! +Lots of enemies types+Challenging and cool combat+Epic soundtrack+Unique characters skills, weapons +Challenge maps +Co-op+Eagle support-Some bugs-Stupid and bad AI-Outdated graphics and poor facial animations -Very repetitive-Horrid UI-Dialog does not impact nothing in the story-Very linear-Sometimes frustrating -Boring sometimesA decent Middle-Earth tale with some good inspiration on it, but nothing impressive. 7,5/10 ",239,22,1,36,31,2,59

												It’s sadly just a very generic game. Every aspect of the game screams mediocrity from the story and characters to its unbelievably basic hack and slash gameplay. The dialogue and voice acting is very poor, I ended up skipping most of the conversations it was too boring to sit through. The writing in this game is absolutely awful, it comes a across like someone who is still learning English wrote it. They had the opportunity to tell an original story in the Tolkien world and they completely wasted it by making the plot very by the numbers and bland. It’s the gameplay that kills this game for me, I couldn’t stand how basic and repetitive the whole experience was. I had to eventually mute the game and listen to youtube videos in the background just to get through the game. The game also has this low budget feel to it, like all the animations all feel very stiff for example. The lack of variety in the level design and the environments also make the game a massive chore to play through. The very basic rpg mechanics save it from being awful but it’s not enough to save it from being a bad game.3/10 (Bad)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												Do NOT buy this game.Developers appear to have forgotten game after the day it has been published. Thanks to a sound bug, you will either install two microphones into your computer hack one and go throughy a hacky long route or play the game single player OR just enjoy ECHOES all the time. This simple bug can be fixed with In-Game Voice Chat On/OFF options but developers seems to be caring less about audience than they care about a fruitfly.Other parts of game is above average, you might expect to pay 5 to 10 dollars on discount and enjoy a good multi- NO you can't because you will hear achoes all the time and game is designed to be played multiplayer so this game is worths nothing.

												This is an ok game. Very interesting to see another side of the LotR universe, but it gets pretty bland honestly. But the reason I can't recommend it is simply because if you own a Radeon card, be prepared for much frustration. The game is so unoptimized for these cards that it becomes practically unplayable. Two whole chapters require workarounds just to make the game playable. If you don't heed this warning and try the game anyways, be prepared for a lot of crashing, blue screen and every other error under the sun.			",157,19,0,13,4,0,5

												An absolutely wonderful game. Then why the negative review? Let's see:Pros: -great story ( the action happens in the same time with the fellowship of the ring)-you can co-op through the campaign with 2 other friends-you have multiple builds for your character with various spells, armours, enchantments etc.-a handful of sidequests-quite easy to get 100% of the achievements.-when you finish a difficulty, you can advance to the next one with all of your gear, coins, and your current level ( Diablo stuff)Cons:-well, if you are an AMD graphic card user, good luck playing the game! Since the release of the game (2011) it's almost impossible for you to play the game. I have an HD 8850M which is more than enough for this, but it's so poorly optimised, that you will get stuttering every 2 minutes and the game will crash every 10 minutes. Fortunatelly I have a 4th generation i7 and I was able to play the game on the integrated graphic card which struggled a little on medium settings, but the game was playable.-this game has the most  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice chat I've ever seen since I play multiplayer video games. If you join a lobby with your friends or any random person, the game will activate your microphone all the freaking time! It's almost impossible to stop it. How is it possible for someone to release in 2011 a game in which you can't deactivate the voice chat?After many tries, I finally managed to get rid of it.All-in-all this is a great game, I would say it is very underrated and it is perfect if you don't have much time to spend on, as the campaign can be finished in 8-10 hours, but unfortunatelly, the voice chat and the AMD graphic cards problem have a huge impact on it and I'm really sorry but I can't recommend it.

												Been ages since I've last played a Lord of the rings game and this one sure is one of the best. Alright where to start? Well the fighting mechanics is really good, except when you fight the enemies it will get repetitive. The game has a nice leveling system, especially for newbie players new to the rpg world. Almost all the boss battles feel the same. In single-player you can only choose one character at a time, you can only change at the end of a level. Co-op is very fun, especially with the right group of friends! Graphics are very nice and don't need a lot to run for a good gaming PC/Laptop.My rating for this game: 6/10			",69,3,0,1,3,1,3

												First off when I started playing this game i was expecting more of an open world style, and i was surprised just what consisted of this game at hand. The style of game play was enjoyable, it had a classic/RPG style. The world was more like a path way that you keep on moving by to get the next part, with some hard boss battles but if you get stuck all you have to do is join someones game online and then simply play with them till you level up, which in turn allows you to progress. I found the voice acting a little poor, the graphics are decent and would run on a budget pc grand. the online co-op was great fun. all in all I am glad i purchsed this game. story line 7/10voice acting 6/10features in equipment and upgrades 8/10 * quite like an RPG game in the sense of wepons and abilltys abilitys 8/10overall 7.5/10			",64,3,4,2,2,0,1

A chance to visit the Burrow-down, Mirkwood, Angmar or meet famous characters like Radagast or Elrond enrich the experience and I recommend this to anyone who wants to get hyped before the Hobbit comes out.

												I originally gave this game a negative review. However, after putting some more time into it, I feel that if you get this game on a heafty discout (as I did), you will definitely feel satisfied after the experience. However, I highly recommend you only buy this game if you either a) plan to play with friends, or b) have a high tolerance for frustrating games (see below).Here are a few things I think you should be aware of before you purcahse this game:- The UI is terrible. It is cleary optimized for console/controller use. Even then, it's full of nonsense. Also, be aware of the fact that unless you're using a Microsoft Xbox360 controller, you'll run into problems (I have a Steelseries 3GC, a PDP Afterglow Xbox360 controller, and a MS Xbox360 controller).- The AI is stupid. Your AI teammates are of little help, and tend to get in your way. If you play as the Loremaster, you'll spend a fair amount of time trying to heal them. If you play as one of the other two classes, you'll find you're doing most of the work yourself and reviving your AI teammates often.- The interface is terrible. The Keymapping makes little sense, is not customizable and is frustrating when dealing with 'Skill 4' and summoning Eagles (they're mapped to the same key and I have not found a way to change that).- The inventory system is a nightmare. Your inventory is only accessable on your current character, meaning you cannot equip your AI teammates. The AI is left to auto equip whatever inventory you're not currently using and thus makes managing it quite difficult. In multiplayer, some traded items would just disappear.- You cannot switch characters in game. This makes it a chore to keep your teammates up-to-date with stats. Often you'll find yourself three levels ahead of your teammates in terms of equipped skills before you get the chance to sort them out.- The save system is out dated. It's based off of a checkpoint system which is poorly thought out.- Finally, this game is poorly optimized. It is filled with bugs that may not be game breaking, but are certaintly frustrating and annoying. Including a particular graphic bug which causes a transparent white flashing throughout and entire level. I could not find a solution for this problem, and after searching the internet, I can confirm it is not my graphics card as many are plagued with the problem.In the end, if you can get this game on a great sale and have a craving to play a Lord of the Rings themed video game - and you're willing to tolerate some frustration - this is worth it. I would also suggest Lego: Lord of the Rings. The voice acting and music comes straight from the three movies; it's very well done.As a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, I think it is worth it to mention that this follows Peter Jackson's movie version, sadly. Although, it is to be expected from a WB published game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really underrated co-op hack and slash RPG for up to 3 players. I know not everyone is into Lord of the Rings or that sort of thing, maybe you feel this is only for those who are fans? Well, as a fan I can say they made the world 100% accessable to those who maybe never read the books or saw the films. You can just appreciate it for a fantasy game, but at the same time the game offers options through dialouge trees (a bit like Mass Effect) to ask more if you're interested, and it explains everything, even the most basic plot if you truly know NOTHING about the story.The gameplay itself is very fun, just basic hack and slash but I was never bored. You get random loot drops that can be sold, traded with party members or equipped. The storyline takes place during the events of LOTR, and it uses the look and feel of the movies, but they explore places the movies never covered, which for a fan is a real treat, and I think they did a good job. Again, you can just enjoy it for what it is, and enjoy the game just fine. The enviroments are nicely varied from ancient ruins, to forests, to snowy peaks and inside mountains, and more giving the game a nice feeling of progression and variety without feeling stale. Being an RPG, you of course gain XP points through combat and questing, and you can level up your character using character trees that fans of Borderlands or Dead Island, and any such games, will understand easily. You can pick betwee 3 characters - A Dwarf, A Man (Ranger), and an Elven Mage (which doesn't make a lot of sense with the lore, but it's a nitpick). Each character has a special ability that can be tweaked per the player's liking, and you can play your own way. The game can be enjoyed in single player, as the AI takes over any non player characters, but the game really shines with having 3 players in a game each with their own strengths and abilities. It's a fun little game, took me about 12 hours to play through, and after you're done, you can do more playthroughs where the enemies and loot are better to go along with your leveled up characters. So, if you love LOTR or Middle-Earth stories, check it out, and even if you know nothing about those things, but like RPGs, co-op, action packed gameplay, you'll enjoy it, and maybe even become interested in the world.

												I originally gave this game a negative review. However, after putting some more time into it, I feel that if you get this game on a heafty discout (as I did), you will definitely feel satisfied after the experience. However, I highly recommend you only buy this game if you either a) plan to play with friends, or b) have a high tolerance for frustrating games (see below).Here are a few things I think you should be aware of before you purcahse this game:- The UI is terrible. It is cleary optimized for console/controller use. Even then, it's full of nonsense. Also, be aware of the fact that unless you're using a Microsoft Xbox360 controller, you'll run into problems (I have a Steelseries 3GC, a PDP Afterglow Xbox360 controller, and a MS Xbox360 controller).- The AI is stupid. Your AI teammates are of little help, and tend to get in your way. If you play as the Loremaster, you'll spend a fair amount of time trying to heal them. If you play as one of the other two classes, you'll find you're doing most of the work yourself and reviving your AI teammates often.- The interface is terrible.

												The War in the North is a simplistic co-op RPG that'll have you hacking and slashing your way to Carn Dûm. The pathing and story are linear, but if enjoy the lore from the series and like teaming up with your friends against bands of Sauron's army then War in the North should not be passed up. The only questionable aspect of the game is the pricing and value so you might want to catch a good sale for this particular item since its gameplay is limited.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												If you are a fan of Middle-Earth, then you must play this game. This game does a phenomenal job of being true to the Tolkien's writings. The 3 main characters aren't found in any of Tolkien's tales but all the supporting characters are more than fimiliar faces. Many times you will talk to NPCs and they will make refrence to events in The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and even The Silmarillion. If you have absolutely no interest in the Lord of the RIngs, then this is still a fun game, but don't excpect quality on the level of Dragon Age or The Witcher.			",133,21,3,12,9,0,9

												Ignore the measly 66/100 metascore for this game. It is fun, frantic, gory and has a wide range of enemies for you to hack and slash your way through.Graphics for the time of release (2011) are above average, in my opinion.Unique Areas that are not in 'The Hobbit' or 'The Lord of the Rings' gives this game more appeal and a nice fresh quality to it.Definately worth a play through, the game is on the short side but with Heroic and Legendary difficulties to play through and a nice amount of side quests, this is worth the money you put into it.I would personally give it an 80-84 myself.

												Pretty fun game. Only played a couple levels in Co-op and it's much better than doing it single player, but it's still lots of fun.It fills in some lore around the war of the ring, mostly taken from Christopher Tolkien's ""history of the war of the ring"", which is pretty cool. There are several interactions with members of the fellowship of the ring. Character models based on the movies, and they got voice actors that sound kind of like the hollywood actors, but they're far enough off that it feels a bit cheesy.Otherwise the game is super generic, but has strong action controls and is pretty fun. It's basically a LOTR beat-em up. Graphics look like early XBox 360. The port is pretty lazy, so you can't tweak too much. Everything's pretty nice looking and artistically great, but it really looks like a console game.A single playthrough takes about 9-10 hours and there are 7-8 varied environments and plenty of different enemy types.RPG elemements are minimal. The skill tree is pretty cool and there's plenty of loot to be had, but companion gear management is awful and it's pretty unclear about how they level up.Note that keyboard controls are awkward. This game was designed for consoles and the port is a lazy one, so best to use a 360 controller.All in all, a fun game that gets way better if you have some friends to do co-op with. Definitely worth picking up for around $5 which will get you a nice 10 hour playthrough. The are 2 New Game + modes that make the enemies a lot harder and the loot better, but unless you're playing with friends I can't see anybody actually wanting to do this.			",563,110,12,60,30,4,70

												My chief concern with the game is the lack of instructions.  The game is pretty fun though.  Alt key will switch weapons btw.  I figured that out pretty late.  Also, the game saves automatically if you're at a safe location.  I kept looking for how to save.  Now I have to figure out how to swap characters easier.  Fun game with a good story.  Movement is a little clumsy, but intuitive.  Fighting same way, it gets more fun once you level up and gain ""skills"" for that character.			",5,2,0,1,1,0,4

												I had fun with this title and would recommend it to action rpg fans in general and anyone interested in Lord of the Rings. I got it for a decent price around $8 and it provided me with around 12 hours of gameplay so I think I got my monies worth :)You pick one of three characters and journey to stop one of Sauron's generals who plans to start war in the northern realms. You can pick a ranger who can dual wield, a lore master (healer mage) or a tanky dwarf. They generally all play the same with a few unique skills attached to each class. Combat consists of mashing the normal attack and hitting the strong attack once enemies are weak to cause critical damage or finish them off. Levels consist of areas where you have to defeat waves of enemies before the next area is unlocked and you pick up gear for your characters and level up.I played this game solo but I can see the real fun is with playing with friends which I haven't tried, not even sure if it works or not considering this is an older game. Your AI companions can be pretty dumb often getting preoccupied fighting one weak goon while you get swarmed by enemies. You can only switch between the characters at checkpoints which is a shame and only your main characters look will be affected by what they are wearing.The music and the voice acting are great although some of the dialogue is cliche. You do have some dialogue choices during the story but it doesn't really matter what you pick. The story itself is weak and predictable and when you finally defeat the last boss you instantly find out that the original Fellowship completed their epic journey making your efforts seem kind of pointless.Overall great game and still playable in 2016. I only wish you can freely swap between characters in battle and setup all your characters with loot and equipment that you find in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well after about 2 hours of setting up it finally worked. For us, there was a specific order in which we had to set everything up, one of us had to switch to a different computer, the other one had to be the host and every one of us had to make some funny sound settings to disable the ingame voice.But after all that I really did enjoy venturing out with my friends. The combats were somewhat interesting, though we only finished on normal mode were everything is a little bit too easy, and the abilities matched the characters. We played the default MMO setup with healer (my role), tank and damage dealer, which worked great.Some abilities seem to be a little overpowered. There is, for example, this big shield (we called it ""the bubble""), which deflects every projectile anybody shoots at you and heals you. This includes bosses. Therefore you sit in it waiting and shouting in order to get the bosses in melee range.All in all, the dialogs are linear but believable and well made, the story feels good and the atmosphere is deep, even though it can get a little monotone after too long periods. The graphics are not the best I've seen even for the time the game was released, but they are still not too bad to look at. The textures of your armor and characters are somewhat well made even though some animations may be a little set off. Sometimes the voice isn't fully synced.We finished the game in about 10 hours in 3 sessions.			",328,81,4,42,21,7,79

												Took me awhile to start this game, because of all the lack luster reviews and whiners about it. However once I finally found the time to sit down and start this up, I was pleasently surprised. Ok so its not a hard core RPG, nor has an extensive gear database, and your companions are only good for distraction. However the game was ""fun"". I found it a worthy use of time, and I never felt like I wasted money (granted it was free with something else I bought haha).Only one point in the game I was very ticked off with (the part with the two trolls, and a door, in the Siege). I must have failed so many times with that, and ONLY passed it because the trolls 'glitched' and just stood transfixed on the door instead of hitting it. Only bad part of the game, ridiculous difficulty (worse than the end battles!), and only passable due to a glitch.Anyhow, I enjoyed this game. Smooth graphics, wonderful locations and atmosphere. Also had great audio and music. Well worth the time as I found it ""fun"" (which is all a game should be!).			",116,22,2,5,8,0,9

The game is ment to be played with coop and with the coop experience you get to not only play with friends or random people but you also get to do more things such as finding secret room and defeating enemies a lot quicker instead of dying all the time.ProsStory is amazingSwitch characters during missionscut limbs off of orcsequiped character with different itemsbosses follow the LOTRConsForce voice chat onlineOnline bugs get disconnected almost all the time			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												This game is the definition of mediocre, yet in its simplicity I've found that I've had a ton of fun with it. The hubby, roommate and I picked it up off of the WB Bundle and were surprised with how much we've enjoyed it. It reminds me a bit of the PS2 LOTR titles from back in the day: simple skill trees, linear progression, differences in loot being numerical, etc. That said, it's definitely a nice romp to go through with 2 friends at night when you don't feel like committing to a deeper game. I plan on 100% completion for it, and if you've got some free time and a coupel of buddies, its definitely a guilty pleasure.			",90,15,0,20,12,0,10

												my friend and I beat this game a few times all the way up to legendary and stopped. Its a good game. AMD cards will have issues. I couldnt get it to run without work on windows 10 but it's been a while. COOP is where it wins. If you have trouble with the game taking the mic oh well deal with it. It was a port and works pretty well all things considered, thats one of the few major problems. Would have loved to see them make more games like this. (without the mic always on)			",54,3,0,8,4,0,7

												This game is REALLY average. The combat consists of LEFT CLICKING and Spacebar. Oh, and right click when you see an orange triangle. The combat is extremely boring, and unengaging. It's also really annoying when enemies constantly stun-lock you. Enemies with 2 weapons are the worst, you'll constantly be hit and stun locked unless you block them, but if you are constantly being hit in the first place, you won't be able to block because you are already being stunned. The game throws tons of enemies at you, mostly to hide the fact that the game has a shallow combat system. You can press space to roll, which clips you through enemies, and is extremely effective. There's not even a penalty to spamming the roll! Meh. The enemy types in the game are also usually very meh as well.   Your AI teammates are the dumbest people out there, if the last one is alive, they will constantly try to revive you, NO MATTER WHAT. Even if there's only 1 hit left to finish the boss. Or they won't even try to evade the enemy, they'll just take it in order to revive someone. Regarding certain enemies, there are big ones who smash you, and toss you and make you ragdoll around. These are easy to beat, but when there are multiple enemies, it's a chore, because you'll be forced to hit them 1 or 2 times, roll away, come back and hit them again. You'll be able to use abilities here and there, but those aren't very effective and they cost 'power'. The game also has an RPG element that is very basic. You get XP from killing stuff, then you level up. After you level up, you put points into attributes and you pick abilities, either passive, or activated.  There are very few abilities, and they aren't very interesting, save for the Ranger's Stealth, the Lore-Masters bubble shield thingy, and the Dwarfs War Cry that supposedly does something useful. The game also has really bad AI management. You tell them to attack or defend. That's it. AND even when you tell them to defend, they will often times, leave you to kill an enemy. When you give them gear, they will throw it away most of the time and use one that sucks, because you can't manage their inventory. They will usually throw it away once it breaks or reaches low durability from what I can tell. This is also very annoying, because they will toss away high tier gear in order to replace it with ANYTHING that isn't about to break. You can't even tell if it's about to break, you just stare at your teammates and check if what they are wearing looks cool. If it doesn't you probably need to add new gear to them. The story in this game is incredibly bland. SURE, it's staying true to the book, but that doesn't mean you can't add anything that makes it interesting. The main characters are also just people you don't really care about, you don't even get to know their real backstory, and you get no emotional ties with them at all whatsoever, unless you get hard looking at the elf. Regardless, the story is also only about 10 hours long, longer if you do it alone, and shorter with friends.That's including the side-quests. There are about 20 ( or less ) side quests in the game. I'm not even kidding. And the rewards are usually rendered useless by 2-3 levels anyways. The game's matchmaking found me with no players, so I assume no one plays this anymore. You can trade items to other players, but that only matters if you can actually find someone to play CO-OP with.Overall, the game is really bland. It doesn't have any variety, and it's KEY selling points are average. I thought the game would be better, but I am disappointed with what I saw. It could have used a better combat system, better AI, better enemy variety, and better RPG mechanics. If it had all of those, I'd give it an 8/10 if I were to score it. But if I were to give it a score right now, I'd say 6/10, and that's being generous, as I do know the series, and I appreciate the amount of time they put into the lore. ( not pointing out the bug where the dwarf calls a ranger 'KINSMAN'  )			",91,18,1,6,9,0,22

												If you are looking for something LOTR related and do not have anyone to play with or wish to play alone, you could grab this. When it is on SALE that is.As to if you want to play it with your friends? In that case you will encounter two things that will devastate your enjoyment of this title. Those two things being disconnection issues that completely wipe ALL your progress in the level that you are playing with your friends, along with ALWAYS ON VOICE-CHAT. Now there are ways to go around that Always on voice-chat, but it is NOT worth the hassle.As to the disconnection issues: You lose all your loot, all your levels and all your skillpoints you gained in that level / session. The loot in your inventory / what was equipped on your character does not get saved. The moment you rejoin, those things are gone. Period.As to the always on voice-chat: Extremely crappy audio quality, no way to change mic levels or audio levels of other players, and no way to turn it off or mute others. Workarounds include using another microphone and setting it as the primary audio device and then muting it but let us be frank here. How many of us actually have another microphone, and do we really want to connect another microphone / headset JUST for a single game? I dare wager only few of us are willing and able to even try that.In other words, an okay single-player LOTR game for 5 bucks of less. For 20 bucks (19,99€) though? No. Absolutely not worth it. Especially if you are looking for something fun to play with your friends. In that case, the sale price is not worth it either.Graphics are also from the early 2010 era so it is not a pretty game either. It was not a pretty game when it came out either if the graphics are to be judged.			",234,41,2,31,29,4,46

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a straight forward 3rd person RPG hack & slash with loot game. It can be either played solo or co-op with 2 other friends, each taking control of one character. Fans of Lord of the Rings will enjoy the lore, characters and locations. There are 3 difficulties adding some re-playability but for the most part the game is linear with only a couple of paths that you can deviate from and find some secret loot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've had this game in my list for a long time and never bothered playing it, and actually am regretting not enjoying it sooner. The combat seems pretty amazing and you are just pulled into this beautiful game with its decient voice acting and scenery. Highly recommended playing with friends as the AI tends to die rather often. Definately worth playing, or if you are feeling a bit skeptical you can just wait and grab it from a sale/bundle accidentally as I did.			",366,41,8,38,16,1,25

												I played this game about 5 years ago and came back to it recently in the hopes that it's many issues at the time would be fixed. I really enjoyed the game and co-op was a ton of fun, but I experienced the very same bugs and technical issues that made the game unplayable for me since day one of release. Certain areas in the game cause crashes and disconnects and when you're not crashing to desktop you often have to restart the game completely due to some bug or another. It has great gameplay and potential for fun with friends, but it's not worth the dozens of crashes and hours wasted on them replaying areas just to crash over and over again in an attempt to get through a single playthrough. Sadly it's just another sloppy and unpolished game that developers make and never give it another glance after it's release, the kind of game you really want to enjoy but it just won't let you. If you want to give the game a try on sale and you've got a lot of patience, go for it. But I wouldn't drag your friends into it with you if you want to keep them :p			",259,59,3,36,23,3,55

												I liked the old lotr hack n slash games and this is close to that.The RPG elements could be better but I shouldn't matter much if you treat this like the old hack n slash games.There is however a game breaking graphics problem with some AMD cards.The game crashes often at certain parts of the game and makes it almost impossible to pass.I have tried multiple times to pass these sections and what it comes down to is a big waste of time for me.I managed to pass one such section by doing something ridiculous like zooming at the floor the whole time while your graphics settings are at it's lowest.But in the next playthrough where there seem to be more enemies some parts seem to be unpassable.Have tried the numerous reported fixes ( lowering all graphics settings, rolling back to old graphcis drivers ) but none of them work for me.Not sure if this is something AMD or the game devs should fix but as it stands nobody is fixing it.So I would recommend this game if you do not have a AMD 7xxx card ( Which I have ). Otherwise I cannot recommend it.			",97,8,0,12,11,0,20

												This is really an excellent game. I have no idea why it scored so low in the reviews. A good story, excellent voice acting, nice graphics with tons of options for the PC version, and it never crashed on me once. it's a pretty long game (expect about 15-20 hours your first time through on Normal), lots of secrets to find, three different characters to play (each with their own play styles and each of them fun), and it has an absolute metric ton of loot to find, all of which alters the look of your characters, to go along with some good customization options.The combat is simple but takes awhile to master, and it does get more involved on Heroic and Legendary difficulties, both of which are excellently balanced (though there are a few huge difficulty spikes in certain quests.)All in all, this is an awesome game, well worth 20 bucks. This is the game Diablo 3 should have been.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got it in humble bundle, simple hack and slash combat, easy to run at max settings, 3 characters to play as and fairly good rpg elements. The combat does get repetitive after a while, game crashes randomly and the skill trees for all of the characters are pretty basic. 3.5/5 ",139,11,3,18,7,2,4

												A decent hack-and-slash set parallel to Frodo's quest to destroy the one ring. A tad repetitive, a tad bland, I've also experienced slight performance issues on AMD cards. A good lazy-sunday game to play with a friend, assuming you can bear the in-game voice chat which can't be turned off and sounds like you're talking to your buddy who's in the bathroom.

												This game is based in the lord of the rings universe, and the story takes place, at the same time as the first lord of the rings movie.If you know something about lord of the rings, you would properly like this games story to some extend. The game builds on the lord of the rings universe, and you have to visit locations, that are kind of new to the averige lord of the ring knower.The game still focuses on main charecters such as the fellowship of the ring, and many more main charecters. Your journy in the game has nothing to do with the fellowship, but focuses on killing Saruns right hand (sorry if I spell some names wrong, but they are not so commen)Your journy starts at an inn, and then you move on througout the lord of the rings universe. This brings you far around the country, and you get to visit many interesting locations. There is a forrest with spiders, an underground cave with undead, A fortres with orcs just to name a few of the locations.You can take controle of one of three charecters. Each charecer, has his or hers own thing to do for the team. We have a dwarf, who functions as tank for the team, which mean he will be the first to attack, and the one to take the most damage, but still have enough life to surviev. This character uses heavy weapons and crossbows mostely, but can also use small weapons to channge things up.The secound charecter is a human, who mainly focuses on range attacks, but can also go into combat with duelweld, or a sword, and a sheild. Since this charecter is mainly focusing on damaging, he is the one to damage enemys, while the tank, takes the beating from all the enemyes. Of couse the dwarf can fight by themselves, and thats why the game is great, becouse you can basicly do whatever you want, when it comes to classes.The last charecter is an elven mage, who focuses on healing. She uses magicel attacks to attack enemyes, but is the weakest of the three and therefore needs the most protection.The gameplay is a bit different for each of the three charecters, and therefore you can have a different experince with each charecter. But the goal is the same with all three, kill all the enemyes as a team.The game is best to play with you friends, and since there is only three classes, you don`t have to hold the big gamer party, in order to have fun with this game. I completed the game with two of my friends and we really enjoyed the game, all the way through. We can say though, the story felt a bid lacky at the end, but I will of couse not spoil it. But if you know your lord of the rings movies, you will know what happens at the end of the first movie, and therefore the ending will not be a huge surprise for you. The loot and trade system between charecters is a bid odd, but besides that, you can clearly see when your charecter evolves on he`s or her`s equipment througout the game, this gives a really satesfing feeling, which you will know for neally all RPG`s.Now I want to talk about the ending, that is not about the plot, but more like the events at the ending. In the end of the game you get all kinds of awesome items, and you get all new and great talents. But then you fight an easy end boss, and all that awesome stuff you just got, can`t be used, I know you can play your charecter on another person playthrough, but still, the game is far to short to do all the stuff you want to do.A note to end on, the AI in this game is good, but only for your enemyes, if you play the game alone, you will see your allies are really bad, and don`t really contebute with anything. This is a problem if the charecter you need is the healer, since the healer won`t. Well, heal at times.This game is really good, and I highly recommend to play it with you friends to get the full experince of the game. But you can of couse play it by youself, and still have a good time with it. This game get`s a thumps up. 6 out of 10			",477,148,8,54,46,9,70

												A decent game, if you know what you're going to getI really did enjoy this game. I love the Tolkein universe and I think the idea of the story running parallel to the story from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy worked well here. Do not expect an RPG experience, this is much more of a hack and slash, and there are many moments that break the 'immersion' of an RPG game (randomly buying items, mid level, from a floating pool of light, etc.). Story/Presentation: 6/10Agandaur, a high ranking commander of Sauron's forces is marching to destroy the north, and you must stop him. That is the meat of the story. Whilst this is nothing original, and there are no plot twists and things to keep you guessing, it serves its job well enough. The story is fleshed out with characters from the Original LOTR story (Gandalf, Aragorn etc.) and it works well to keep to the original lore (from what I know). There are side quests, but they are sparse and sometimes hard to give a crap about. I finished many of them without even realising (found an item from killing an orc, turns out a dwarf wanted it for a quest).I say 6/10 because as stories go, it is hard to go wrong when Tolkein has done the bulk of the work! The thing that brings this score down to me is how bland the playable characters are. There are many characters in this game that have quite interesting personas, the playable characters are not among them.Gameplay: 5.5/10Nothing inventive here. I played the ranger all the way through, and although the abilities that you learn (from a talent tree similar to world of warcraft), I found that most of the time you'll be mashing the attack button from start to finish. There are some AI problems, if your allies (who were clearly designed to be played by friends) see a ranged unit, they will walk slowly towards them, shooting at them, whilst melee heroes hack them to pieces. Other than that the AI is actually quite fine. I will also note here that you can 'switch character', but you lose all items from your first character unless you switch back again, so I really don't see the point. It seems like a big design flaw to me, but I had no need to change my character anyway. 5.5/10 because it serves its purpose fine, and there's a lot of gore and fun to be had, but at the end of the day its too repetitive.Visuals: 8/10Whilst the graphics are nothing to rave about, they are really quite good. The linearity of the game means that the surrounding environments look quite beautiful, and there has been quite a lot of effort clearly put in to the design of the scenes. I am also going to mention the gore as well, it is nice to see a bit of blood and severred limbs that is startlingly absent in almost all Lord of the Rings games. The hack and slash gameplay IS quite repetitive, but lopping heads and arms off never really gets old.Replayability 6/10Whilst I doubt I will play through the game again, there is the option to do so with a higher difficulty, and naturally with another player character. I think this is a nice idea, but personally I would have rather put the difficulty higher on my first playthrough, than be forced to wait until I've completed the game once. That being said, it's a nice option, and I think many will enjoy playing through again with a second character.Conclusion: 6/10A fun game, nothing special, but worth a play through. I don't think this game is worth a full price purchase, but if you see it on offer definitely give it a go. I got this game from the humble bundle, and I thought I'd end up brushing over if but I'm glad that I didn't. Take that for what it's worth!			",142,23,1,30,16,0,12

												I love this universe. So when I learned that it was going to be a new story I was definitely looking forward to this game. Plus the mature style of gameplay is something I always wanted in a LOTRs game. I cannot get enough of these types of games (RPG) and being in one of my all time favourite universes is just a bonus! If youve ever played Dragon Age or The Witcher Series than youll enjoy playing this. Although, it can be rough around the edges sometimes, emotionally and character models wise its still a pleasure to play. Pros: Mature LOTRs gameplay         Taking focus to another storyCons:The Characters you play are pretty plain.(Youd think if your on a quest with two other people youd talk to them and           develop a relationship)         Weak story Emotionally. Just didnt pull me in to take about whats happening. I could see how the concept of it works but didnt translate and for a developer I believe this to be the hardest things to create in a videogame.8/10If youre on the fence about this one pick it up. It is well worth it.			",413,126,14,44,39,6,82

												6.5/10War in the North is the tale of a dwarf, elf and ranger wandering the wastes and plains of Middle Earth away from the main events of J.R.R. Tolkien's book and films.It's a respectful hack and slash action rpg, with the major gripes being the lack of much ability progression and a lot of the same enemies appearing over and over again. A mildly coherent tale against a relatively unknown antagonist is only brought back from boredom due to the rich lore that has been previously established.Reminded me of the Two Towers on PS2 back in the day. Three characters playing on screen, Each one has their own unique moves, spells, and abilities and you fight against Sauron's minions in the North. One can get involved with alchemy, another with breaking down walls to find treasures, upgradeable weapons, gear armour etc. Other games do everything it offers better. There are a few short appearances from the major LOTR characters in Rivendell but their sudden appearance and disappearance only cements the insignifance of the playable characters. Campaigh is about 10-12 hours long, bit longer I would think on higher difficulties. Best fun is the 3 player co-op. Got this on a Humble Bundle nearly a year ago, but worth a look if you have it and are itching for an average Action RPG or a LOTR game til Shadow of Mordor arrives.			",293,97,5,50,32,3,34

												TLDR? Go to bottom for list of pros, cons.Lord of the rings games to my opinion tend to be good just for having that vibe.But forget about lord of the rings for a moment, because what you have here, is the one and only game that pulls it off to actually FORCE people to play together without the feeling that you are ""forced"" to play together!!!!This game is all about the team. You have a ranger (DPS), a warrior(tank) and a loremaster(support) class. Each class as before mentioned having their own task. Loot is given to each individual, which negates fighting over loot. The loremaster will have crappy damage, but great supportive skills, the tank can take a lot of damage and aggro, while the ranger has low health but can deal massive damage. Besides this, areas can only be finished when everyone is together, but the action always leads you towards it. Besides this great job, is the story compelling and very similar in feeling to the movies.Pros:- Great story- Best co-opperative gameplay EVER!- Great combat mechanics (per class different)- Reasonable replayability (switching of classes)- Good leveling mechanics that keep you compelled.Cons:- Medium to short campaign.- Ranged attack is too spot on.When in doubt. Buy this game!			",215,59,1,29,37,3,29

												THIS IS A BIASED OPINION As I am a Tolkien who_ re.I was really pleased about all the lore and the storytelling. The gameplay is kinda repeatitive because theres not much combo or abilities to use. But at least you can switch between 3 characters.  I like how you get to see more gandalf, more eagles, more radagast, more aragorn (briefly) and also bilbo. Old dear Bilbo.`Been a Tolkien fan I'd give this a solid 9/10. But in reality its more like a 7.5/10.   8/10 if you play with 2 friends. and 10/10 if you are 3 LOTR fan. ",254,21,5,34,10,2,17

												War in the North is an interesting mixture of action-RPG and cRPG.It has the fun third-person action and excellent itemization of a good action-RPG. But it also has the extensive dialogue and great worldbuilding of a good cRPG. Add in the Lord of the Rings setting and you have a recipe for a wonderful game.The game is set during the events of the LotR books and movies, but mostly covers events in the north that weren't depicted in the books and movies. Those who have played the Battle for Middle Earth games, or Lord of the Rings Online, will find some familiar elements. But this is very much a different story and it takes a little more leeway than most with LotR lore.That being said, the LotR setting is used to great effect. The game is very consistent and the extensive dialogue features a lot of attention to detail. Many iconic locations from the books are depicted beautifully, such as Bree and Rivendell. And the characters all look like the actors in the movie trilogy. That's where this game's most crucial flaw comes in: voice acting. The familiar characters from the movies (of which there are a fair few) do not share the same voice actors. As such there's a very real disconnect with most of them.As to how the game plays: you choose one of three characters. You then travel with this entire party, and can switch characters between chapters. You can even play the campaign in co-op with friends, but with the heavy dialogue and cRPG elements it lends itself better to singleplayer. The AI takes over the other characters in singleplayer and you can give them some of the loot you don't need to boost their effectiveness. And there's a lot of loot, and item sets, and all sorts of stuff!Both the story and environments are linear, with very few choices in either. The story would only have been even worse were it non-linear, as is it's passable and the dialogue carries it through. Likewise the environments are extremely linear, but very detailed and interesting. These may seem like flaws, but in my experience they didn't hinder my enjoyment of the game overly much.As such, I'd say LotR: War in the North is a surprisingly good RPG. It has strong cRPG and action-RPG elements and offers a very enjoyable experience. Reasonably lengthy too, without overstaying its welcome too much.Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a huge fan of the LOTR universe, so I got excited when they said that there will be a new game about it. to buy the game and. When I finally aquired the game, I dove into the world of Tolkien once more. And I was fairly happy with the results that I've found. First of all let me say that the world of LOTR ""war in the north"" is a delicous a mish mash from many of Tolkiens LOTR's resorces. Like the books, movies, cartoon animations as well as the endless Imagination of snowblind studio. Which makes a woundful effort in blending the game into character with the rest of the other stories without feeling stragnly out of place. The visuals are just amazing and the dialog is heroic and thoughtful. The events of  LOTR ""war in the north"" characters were invented, well crafted, and detailed by the grandfather of modern fantasy Tolkien. You play either one of three main characters: the female elf lore master Andriel "" the sorceress "", the dwarf warrior Farin ""the warrior tank"", and a human Dúnedain ranger Eradan ""the roge"". In the beging the trio are seen walking into the Prancing Pony in  the city of bree, heading to a table were Aragorn is sitting. They inform him that the Shire Guard at San Ford was attacked and that the Rangers have suffered a great loss. After the raid a Ringwraith mets with a man of great malice and power called Agandaur. He tells the Ringwraith that he had done as Sauron commanded and he has started gathering the Orcs of the north at the old ruins of Fornost. Farin questions why the enemy would build up a force against the Shire and Aragorn replies that a hobbit with a great burden is on the move to Bree. He asks them to help him keep the Hobbit safe by thwarting the enemies preparations at Fornost. And so begins your adventure. The game play is a decent standard type of action RPG . Nothing ground braking INTERSTELLER MECHANICES THAT CHANGES THE GAMING WORLD!!! or anything like that. Nevertheless, still decent. All three characters have mele and range attacks when battlling the endless hordes of orcs, cave trolls and goblins. There is also a combo system which makes the game more responsive. When a yellow bar shows on an enemy's head you get a chance to do a critical strike chope some heads off and gaining more XP.  The pacing of the game is done well. However, there are too many mounted cressbows sequences that kinda feels repetitive to a point.  On the other hand the game has a good co-op game play of three players. Which changed the expreance of the game altogether. You and 2 more of your friends can jon forces and lead the attack on the eeevil orc meness. And saving the hobbits for certain dooooooooom. Overall, the game is a wonderful piece of art that shouldn't be overlooked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fairly good movie-based game dressed up as a Gears of War-feeling Diablo clone.The plot follows TLoTR from a group of heroes parallel to the main story of Frodo, adding a lot of backstory and ""meanwhile..."" kind of lore for diehard fans. There's a lot of good exposition and the custscenes are well done.While the game is firmly planted in the Action-RPG tropes of Diablo and Titan Quest, it plays a lot like Gears of Wars, minuse the cover mechanic. Sprinting feels like the ""roadie run"" and the rolls are almost the same. It's made using Epic's Unreal Engine 3, but its strking how much this game borrows gameplay mechanics from Gears of War with an ARPG shoehorned in and then told using the trimmings from TLoTR's plot.Visuals range from good to great and the sound is satisfying, but nothing amazing. Combat is fun and it's a delight to knock a big, ugly orc's head off and then fel his friend by slicing his leg off.In case you're wondering, yes there is a multiplayer mode that allows you to play through the game in co-op.Overall, a nice buy for anyone a fan of ARPGs and/or TLoTR with a farily decent amount of replayablity.

												This is a underrated action hack n slash rpg.  The storyline is decent, the games graphics look pretty good.  Obviously it has some issues which is why it has a 60 something metascore at the moment.  The biggest of these issues is chapter 2 and especially chapter 8 there is a very bad bug for amd users where they will constantly crash and be unable to finish the game.  There are ways to get past this though if you check on the forum.  The main characters aren't really well developed but I believe thats how the developers intended it to be.  The characters ingame are portrayed as the same actors  that were in the movies.  Sometimes you will wish you had a few more moves to use, but regardless the game was still enjoyable for me even though its a bit short, especially considering I got this in a cheap humble bundle I can't complain.

You get to visit some cool places in Eriador from the books that are not in the films or other games, including the Barrow Downs, Ettenmoors, Gundabad, and Carn Dum. The voice acting can be hilarious at times as well. That being said, if you're not a LoTR fan, this is simply an above average A-RPG-like.			",107,16,2,10,4,0,17

												This is your generic fantasy rpg game. I would not even bother with it if not for the setting...Middle Earth ! And damn it adds a lot to the game. You can play as 1 of 3 characters (elf healer/mage , dwarf warrior / crossbow guy  and the ranger / tank dunadain.(2-handed sword dunadain warrior op:) ). Anyway I picked it up with 2 other friends and I really had fun...until I started getting blue screens. I dnk why I encountered this problem since my computer never behaved like this with any other game and i meet the specs with ease. It was not from the graphics settings of the game (tried so many options) and it felt really random (would happen at random times in the game , not even twice in the same place). Just wanted to lay that out before I continue. The action / Rpg elements are solid with different talent trees (and the leveling is at a good pace) , a lot of loot (that also changes how your character looks) and the coombat feels good and smooth , fluid. The graphics are decent , but an RPG is not about the graphics and since the gameplay is good i am willing to overlook that. The story is your pretty tipical fantasy story with a middle earth setting , but I admit I enjoy that (although it is predictable). The voice acting though , it's kinda on the low side. Also playing with friends increases the value of the game so much so keep that in mind.In conclusion I would say that you should buy this game at full price if you are aware that you might encounter bugs and blue screens and are ok with it and if you have friends to play with.Otherwise wait for a sale if you want to buy it as playing alone will soon become boring and start to feel like a chore.

But even with the glitches I can't really walk away from this game.  For any fan of Middle Earth, this is just stunning.  The graphics are beautiful and incredible and the lore is pretty spot on.  You play as a small group that fights in the north to buy time for the fellowship of the ring.  You get to encounter six of the members of the fellowship, along with other notable characters.  And they really bring a sense of familiarity, the character models were designed to resemble the cast from the films.  All in all, I really, really love this game.  Glitches be damned.

												This game is brilliant fun to play. It tries to capture the spirit of Tolkein's world and does it much better than the new Hobbit films do.I was playing it with an X-Box controller which made the gameplay very easy.Graphically it's somewhere around the Oblivion level. The detail on the armour for the characters is lovely.AI wise, it's not always the best, but equally so for ally's and for enemy's so you are never unfairly outmaneuvered.I have an AMD and didn't have any issues that many of the people on here are complaining about...maybe try a different character at that point and see if it has any effect (seems the Ranger causes game crashes).Either way, if you like your fantasy games (and in particular if you love Tolkein), then this game is a great find, especially if you hold off until the sales.

												THIS IS A BIASED OPINION As I am a Tolkien who_ re.I was really pleased about all the lore and the storytelling. The gameplay is kinda repeatitive because theres not much combo or abilities to use. But at least you can switch between 3 characters.  I like how you get to see more gandalf, more eagles, more radagast, more aragorn (briefly) and also bilbo. Old dear Bilbo.`Been a Tolkien fan I'd give this a solid 9/10. But in reality its more like a 7.5/10.   8/10 if you play with 2 friends. and 10/10 if you are 3 LOTR fan. ",254,21,5,34,10,2,17

												A decent game, if you know what you're going to getI really did enjoy this game. I love the Tolkein universe and I think the idea of the story running parallel to the story from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy worked well here. Do not expect an RPG experience, this is much more of a hack and slash, and there are many moments that break the 'immersion' of an RPG game (randomly buying items, mid level, from a floating pool of light, etc.). Story/Presentation: 6/10Agandaur, a high ranking commander of Sauron's forces is marching to destroy the north, and you must stop him. That is the meat of the story. Whilst this is nothing original, and there are no plot twists and things to keep you guessing, it serves its job well enough. The story is fleshed out with characters from the Original LOTR story (Gandalf, Aragorn etc.) and it works well to keep to the original lore (from what I know). There are side quests, but they are sparse and sometimes hard to give a crap about. I finished many of them without even realising (found an item from killing an orc, turns out a dwarf wanted it for a quest).I say 6/10 because as stories go, it is hard to go wrong when Tolkein has done the bulk of the work! The thing that brings this score down to me is how bland the playable characters are. There are many characters in this game that have quite interesting personas, the playable characters are not among them.Gameplay: 5.5/10Nothing inventive here. I played the ranger all the way through, and although the abilities that you learn (from a talent tree similar to world of warcraft), I found that most of the time you'll be mashing the attack button from start to finish. There are some AI problems, if your allies (who were clearly designed to be played by friends) see a ranged unit, they will walk slowly towards them, shooting at them, whilst melee heroes hack them to pieces. Other than that the AI is actually quite fine. I will also note here that you can 'switch character', but you lose all items from your first character unless you switch back again, so I really don't see the point. It seems like a big design flaw to me, but I had no need to change my character anyway. 5.5/10 because it serves its purpose fine, and there's a lot of gore and fun to be had, but at the end of the day its too repetitive.Visuals: 8/10Whilst the graphics are nothing to rave about, they are really quite good. The linearity of the game means that the surrounding environments look quite beautiful, and there has been quite a lot of effort clearly put in to the design of the scenes. I am also going to mention the gore as well, it is nice to see a bit of blood and severred limbs that is startlingly absent in almost all Lord of the Rings games. The hack and slash gameplay IS quite repetitive, but lopping heads and arms off never really gets old.Replayability 6/10Whilst I doubt I will play through the game again, there is the option to do so with a higher difficulty, and naturally with another player character. I think this is a nice idea, but personally I would have rather put the difficulty higher on my first playthrough, than be forced to wait until I've completed the game once. That being said, it's a nice option, and I think many will enjoy playing through again with a second character.Conclusion: 6/10A fun game, nothing special, but worth a play through. I don't think this game is worth a full price purchase, but if you see it on offer definitely give it a go. I got this game from the humble bundle, and I thought I'd end up brushing over if but I'm glad that I didn't. Take that for what it's worth!			",142,23,1,30,16,0,12

												I am a huge fan of the LOTR universe, so I got excited when they said that there will be a new game about it. to buy the game and. When I finally aquired the game, I dove into the world of Tolkien once more. And I was fairly happy with the results that I've found. First of all let me say that the world of LOTR ""war in the north"" is a delicous a mish mash from many of Tolkiens LOTR's resorces. Like the books, movies, cartoon animations as well as the endless Imagination of snowblind studio. Which makes a woundful effort in blending the game into character with the rest of the other stories without feeling stragnly out of place. The visuals are just amazing and the dialog is heroic and thoughtful. The events of  LOTR ""war in the north"" characters were invented, well crafted, and detailed by the grandfather of modern fantasy Tolkien. You play either one of three main characters: the female elf lore master Andriel "" the sorceress "", the dwarf warrior Farin ""the warrior tank"", and a human Dúnedain ranger Eradan ""the roge"". In the beging the trio are seen walking into the Prancing Pony in  the city of bree, heading to a table were Aragorn is sitting. They inform him that the Shire Guard at San Ford was attacked and that the Rangers have suffered a great loss. After the raid a Ringwraith mets with a man of great malice and power called Agandaur. He tells the Ringwraith that he had done as Sauron commanded and he has started gathering the Orcs of the north at the old ruins of Fornost. Farin questions why the enemy would build up a force against the Shire and Aragorn replies that a hobbit with a great burden is on the move to Bree. He asks them to help him keep the Hobbit safe by thwarting the enemies preparations at Fornost. And so begins your adventure. The game play is a decent standard type of action RPG . Nothing ground braking INTERSTELLER MECHANICES THAT CHANGES THE GAMING WORLD!!! or anything like that. Nevertheless, still decent. All three characters have mele and range attacks when battlling the endless hordes of orcs, cave trolls and goblins. There is also a combo system which makes the game more responsive. When a yellow bar shows on an enemy's head you get a chance to do a critical strike chope some heads off and gaining more XP.  The pacing of the game is done well. However, there are too many mounted cressbows sequences that kinda feels repetitive to a point.  On the other hand the game has a good co-op game play of three players. Which changed the expreance of the game altogether. You and 2 more of your friends can jon forces and lead the attack on the eeevil orc meness. And saving the hobbits for certain dooooooooom. Overall, the game is a wonderful piece of art that shouldn't be overlooked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The voice acting can be hilarious at times as well. That being said, if you're not a LoTR fan, this is simply an above average A-RPG-like.			",107,16,2,10,4,0,17

I had to go back and dig out an old 400 GT to get past the broken parts and finish the game. Also it isn't a very long game, but lots of fun. If you see it on sale pick it up!			",53,5,1,7,5,1,4

												It speaks to the lowest instincts of gamers: A ton of items to collect (even sets!), button smashing for hack'n'slay and looking more and more badass throughout the game. But besides that, the story is well researched and fits into the world of Tolkien. Especially when you talk to unimportant NPCs you can learn a great deal about Middle Earth and its inhabitants (I didn't know what's the story of Arwens mother, for example.) The whole design is more like in the movies, in contrast to the colorful and comic-like design of LotR Online. The levels are really tube-shaped, the story is very strict with few side quests (and they got nothing to do with the main story). I recommend playing it in coop! It's a shame there is only an online coop-mode and no local coop, made even worse by the horrible ingame voicechat (which has, I have to admit, nice ideas like echoing when you are in caves) that has a terrible quality. Overall, I do recommend this game.			",76,16,1,8,14,0,3

												This game is brilliant fun to play. It tries to capture the spirit of Tolkein's world and does it much better than the new Hobbit films do.I was playing it with an X-Box controller which made the gameplay very easy.Graphically it's somewhere around the Oblivion level. The detail on the armour for the characters is lovely.AI wise, it's not always the best, but equally so for ally's and for enemy's so you are never unfairly outmaneuvered.I have an AMD and didn't have any issues that many of the people on here are complaining about...maybe try a different character at that point and see if it has any effect (seems the Ranger causes game crashes).Either way, if you like your fantasy games (and in particular if you love Tolkein), then this game is a great find, especially if you hold off until the sales.

												Heavily reminiscent of Snowblind's previous games, mainly Baldar's Gate: Dark Alliance. The same formula is applied here, with instanced dungeons leading from point A to B with some chests scattered through-out. Multiplayer coop is an asset to players, though opting for solo will include the two other classes on your journey under AI control.The interface is polished and pleasant to use, with tabs for skill trees, inventory, stats, and quests. The graphical quality is good and I have not noticed any blurry / lazy textures. It is an interesting use of the Snowblind-style engine combined with the LotR universe.			",327,83,16,34,16,2,35

												War in the North is an interesting mixture of action-RPG and cRPG.It has the fun third-person action and excellent itemization of a good action-RPG. But it also has the extensive dialogue and great worldbuilding of a good cRPG. Add in the Lord of the Rings setting and you have a recipe for a wonderful game.The game is set during the events of the LotR books and movies, but mostly covers events in the north that weren't depicted in the books and movies. Those who have played the Battle for Middle Earth games, or Lord of the Rings Online, will find some familiar elements. But this is very much a different story and it takes a little more leeway than most with LotR lore.That being said, the LotR setting is used to great effect. The game is very consistent and the extensive dialogue features a lot of attention to detail. Many iconic locations from the books are depicted beautifully, such as Bree and Rivendell. And the characters all look like the actors in the movie trilogy. That's where this game's most crucial flaw comes in: voice acting. The familiar characters from the movies (of which there are a fair few) do not share the same voice actors. As such there's a very real disconnect with most of them.As to how the game plays: you choose one of three characters. You then travel with this entire party, and can switch characters between chapters. You can even play the campaign in co-op with friends, but with the heavy dialogue and cRPG elements it lends itself better to singleplayer. The AI takes over the other characters in singleplayer and you can give them some of the loot you don't need to boost their effectiveness. And there's a lot of loot, and item sets, and all sorts of stuff!Both the story and environments are linear, with very few choices in either. The story would only have been even worse were it non-linear, as is it's passable and the dialogue carries it through. Likewise the environments are extremely linear, but very detailed and interesting. These may seem like flaws, but in my experience they didn't hinder my enjoyment of the game overly much.As such, I'd say LotR: War in the North is a surprisingly good RPG. It has strong cRPG and action-RPG elements and offers a very enjoyable experience. Reasonably lengthy too, without overstaying its welcome too much.Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Hack and Slash adventure that is simple and fun for 2 or 3 friends. Beautiful environments. Good graphics. A well done game overall. The skills may be a little simplistic and the attribute system as well as the items may lack luster, but this is a solid game. A gem in the mines of Erebor! This game is under rated and I am suprised more people don't play it.			",932,278,22,121,88,12,141

												TL;DR: A must-buy if you you're running NVIDIA; get ready for giant eagles with majestic pants.LOTR: War in the North is easily my favorite hack and slash style game. It has a pretty decent storyline, good voice acting, and good graphics, and excellent replay value. You get to talk to some major LOTR characters, and fly around on giant eagles that look like they are wearing amazing feathery pants (I'm not even kidding). The inventory and level-up systems are great, making the RPG element of the game extra fun. The co-op feature is definitely worth getting into as well. I've honestly yet to find a game like this that I've enjoyed nearly as much. Biggest issue I have with this game is the crashes. In graphics-intensive parts (specifically chapters 2 and 8) it almost never fails that the game will freeze, then crash altogether. This seems to happen with AMD cards and renders the game unfinishable for anyone running on AMD from what I've been able to research. If you're running NVIDIA you should be fine. I actually purchased War in the North used for xbox 360 to avoid a lot of these issues because it was less hassal than swapping out my card. It's a shame they haven't fixed the crashing problems (it seems the developers have written this one off), or this game would be A+, and well worth the $20. As it stands, however, I'd suggest purchasing the game when it goes on sale, and be prepared to deal with a few bugs. Apart from the bugs War in the North is everything I personally want in a hack and slash RPG; the game itself is fun enough to inspire me to buy it, again, on a separate consol- if that says anything.

												“It's a dangerous business going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off ... “Hearken to me fair folk of Middle-Earth - are you a devouted follower of the writings of the linguistic, literary mastermind and father of modern fantasy, the one, the only - Professor J.R.R Tolkien? Are you ripe for adventure, lore-exploration and feisty combat? If so - then, The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is most certainly a game you would enjoy.As a person who revels in the realm of fantasy and enjoys reading, watching and playing anything related with it, I am of course a loyal acolyte of Tolkien's Legendarium. Therefore, I have played almost all the Middle-Earth related games out there, starting all the way back with The Fellowship of the Ring (2002) all the way to this game. Seldom could I find a game that gazed it's lofty magnitude upon me and capture my thirst and love for Tolkien's world - as War in the North. While some might compare it to the works of legendary games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (my all time favourite game of all times), I find such thoughts folly, as The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, offers a far different experience: to put it frankly and to the point - 'tis a game for those who truly enjoy the vast amount of Tolkien's books (with references being pulled from works such as The Unfinished Tales, The Silmarillion and The Hobbit). Yet, even those who aren't particularly die-hard fans of the series, such as a good friend of mine, could still find this game's storyline, it's quests and characters and the combat system itself, interesting. Character customization is limited, yet quite sufficient in my humble view, game combat is entertaining and fun, if a tad repetitive, the locations and plot are top-notch. The three character races you can play being: Dwarf, Elf and Man have their own unique playstyle (the Dwarf is  your tanky all-weapons master that can pretty much take on Sauron's forces on his own, the Elf being that vital link healer/mage that can provide your little band of heroes that so needed back-up support, and the Man being a sneaky, archer/ranger who can also duo-wield and perform sneak attacks. Additionally, I found it equally rewarding to play the game in single player and in multiplayer with one or two friends, for a true 'Fellowship' feel! And while, indeed the game has aged somewhat in terms of graphics - I believe it still remains an amazing testament to the power of Middle-Earth. In short - I full heartedly recommend The Lord of the Rings: War in the North to anyone who wishes to further deepen his understanding of Middle-Earth and explore the largely untouched story of Sauron's attempted conquest of the North. PS: The soundtrack is so beautiful!''May the wind under your wings bear you where the Sun sails and the Moon walks!''			",14,1,0,6,1,0,3

												Great fun little game. It's nothing complex or mind blowing but it has decent graphics still for 2016, good controls with a xbox wireless controller, runs exceptionally well besides a few bugs and stutters, has different characters who's playstyle and trades vary. It's pretty linear but if you're a lotr fan you'll enjoy it if you like non complex rpg's. I wouldn't hesitate buying it at full price.			",90,8,0,0,1,0,1

												A truly average game, that still is quite a lot of fun when played with friends. The story is rather generic with simple gameplay and there are bugs galore (co-op players stuck behind barriers) and selling and buying is a chore (no compare view, so telling if an item is better than your equipped item requires a lot of work. Still the game has its charm, and I had a lot of fun playing through it with my wife, with the RPG elements (stats and loot) highly addictive and keeping it interesting. 7/10 (when played in co-op)			",710,263,22,74,55,6,80

												It's a decent game, there are just some flaws which bring it down. I originally played through basically the entire game on PS3 until a glitch occurred that made it so I was unable to progress past the spider boss regardless of how many times I beat it. The game is quite a bit of fun on co-op and the combat is simple and satisfying. However, quite possibly the biggest problem with this is that the game forces voice chat upon you. There is no options in-game to disable the voice, make it push-to-talk, or to even mute other players. There is no way to disable the voice in this game without disabling the audio entirely. This wouldn't be a problem if the game chat was half decent, but from my experience it's delayed, echoey, and just overall unpleasant. Apparently there are work arounds for this, but I couldn't manage to figure them out, and really, I shouldn't have to go through that just to do something that should be so simple. Eventually I found the voice chat as part of the game's charm, but I don't really mean that in a good way.The skill trees offer a basic variation to each of the characters' playstyles without getting unnecessarily complex. Treasure chests and hidden caches give a reason to off the path in search of better gear. There isn't much exploration to do otherwise, though. If you enjoy always getting new gear and improving stats (like me) then you will enjoy the equipment aspect of this game. Combat can get a bit tedious and there doesn't seem to really be variation in objectives. It's always going to be go here, defend here, open this all whilst holding off waves of orcs and the like. This is kind of to be expected, though. It's not like there was much else that could have been done with this style of game, but in long sessions you may find the game becoming repetitive. If you have friends to play this with I would recommend it. Maybe not for $20 though. If you don't have friends, well, the AI isn't all that sturdy from my experience, so you'll be doing a lot of reviving.Gloin / 10.			",178,32,4,13,10,0,7

												OK first thing you should know is I've already 100% this game on ps3. Me and my friend love this game. It's brilliant simple co-op is the best thing going for it. So here's the quick low down. Pros-Brilliant yet simple combatLoot! Being able to buy/sell equipment. Always looking for a better sword or armour is almost a must for me. 3 classic 'classes' mage/healerRanger/warrior  champion/tankSet in the already neck deep full of lore, the world of middle earth.  Co-op system works perfectly. Cons-Story is a bit of a let down and I often found myself smashing the button to skip conversations.Very linear altho you can return to previous locations to level up and look for secrets. Ai is about as stupid as Ai can actually get. I've had enemies run into walls and start stabbing wildy. Meanwhile my allies are casting buffs with nobody around. (sometimes using skills detrimental against enemies despite none around) No customisation for your Ai companions.  Overall 9/10. For me this game despite its issues is brilliant. Me and my friend have already found time to play together and I'm loving relaying through this game. (totally skipping the story) if your into a simple hack n slash rpg. With equipment looting, your likely to enjoy this a much as me (especially if your as big a LOTR nerd as me)  if your not Into any of the above categories I'd suggest skipping this game. 100% worth getting on a sale.

												This game shines in coop-multiplayer!I bought 3 copies and played it with my kids, and so far we have not been disappointed. If you are looking for an interesting, simple hack n slash game that works fine with 3 human players, this is it. Basically an action game, with some simple role-playing thrown in and a linear story to follow, it allows for some really interesting coop playing if you have 3 human players. The whole story depends on your party of threee, so the game already looses much of its charm if only one of the 3 heroes is AI-controlled!!!I would not recommend it if you want to play alone, there are better single player hack n slash games around. For a good 2 player hack n slash experience I can recommend ""Hunted"" - but if you have 3 players, go for ""LotR: War in the North""!			",2445,1048,101,338,327,27,459

Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a fun game to play both solo and in (2 or 3-player) co-op.The story is straightforward but well themed, gameplay is fine and the soundtrack is very nice.Despite a few issues which I will point out below, the game still gets a thumbs up for me. The game can freeze or crash on certain systems with AMD video cards and the lastest drivers. On average my game crashed every about every 2 hours. I reinstalled the video drivers and even tried beta versions but this did not resolve the problem. Some say you have to install a really old driver to fix the issue but I have not verified this. Otherwise, the game runs smooth on highest quality, except for the last area which seems to be laggy for a lot of people even with newer GPUs or Nvidia ones. It feels like the difficulty doesn't scale up in Heroic and Legendary modes. I would not have minded e.g. twice the number of enemies on hardest difficulty. The game only saves when you see the save icon, so not necessarily after travelling or a boss fight. You might want to talk to a shop keep or smith and cancel out to force a save if you just got some new loot or a reward. The AI can be derpy at times too. Buddies and enemies can get stuck in some areas or teleport around. One optional mission (the mithril one) can not be completed without someone playing as dwarf. If you are playing by yourself as either lore-master or ranger you will have to revisit a certain area as a dwarf. I think there is a money glitch which gives you infinite money once you reach 999,999. At least you can buy some nice equipment for your buddies (like 300k crossbows). Level capped at 40. It would be sweet to be able to unlock and upgrade all skills and be even more OP. Oh well.Played on: Windows 7 with Xbox 360 controller, 3 playthroughs as lore-master (1 in co-op), all achievements.			",250,45,6,20,7,1,15

												Great and somewhat underated game, can play it as 3 player coop or let the PC control the others.Its pretty linear but its a good story with some side quests and interesting boss fights along the way.Word of warning - the game has voice chat permanently enabled, with no simple way to disable it.

												It's a fun co op adventure game. The inventroy is similar to Diablo. Interesting storyline and fun game play but the resolution is messy and the game isn't grasping. It's not that bad but LORD OF THE RINGS, so that would be the main reason why you want to play it, The Storyline so far is pre fun but there isn't much variety in the game. 3 races and they are the stock standard class of any medi evil game. Not bad for a hack and slash especialyl when you grab a friend or two. Ghetto Sauron 7/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												When u play Lord of the Rings, first thing that comes to mind is epic landscapes, awesome fights and an even better storyline. War in the North has those too but not in the grandeur u would expect. War in the North is a really nice hack and slash rpg game whose quality rises expodentially when u play it on 3 person coop mode. Full packed action and brutal fighting is what u get almost all the time. If u like hack and slash buy it, its worth it. If not then dont bother at all.			",108,7,3,19,4,0,23

												The game is EPIC! It's definitely worth it. The game has amazing graphics, great gameplay and a LEGENDARY storyline. The event in this game is during what happens in the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. This is just on the far North. A battle on a different front, but just as important. As for the graphics, they are getting a bit old, but are still very appealing and good looking(for a game made in 2011, it's amazing). And last, but not the least - the gameplay. Amazing - you can switch between a dwarf/elf/human. Also you have level, gear, gems, skills - its amazing. The targeting system is quite good and not your typical click-to-target. Overall the game is great I would give a 10/10. I love it. Especially if you play it with friends it's even more FUN! Yeah, I would also recommend playing the Dwarf. He's the best! :D			",30,2,1,1,0,0,1

												Many LotR fans might expect a slow-paced, narrative-heavy, immersive experience. War in the North however just gives you a middle-earthy vignette or a short stay in a very stripped down Bree, Imladris, etc. to provide you with weapon repairs, a shop, and an excuse to leave said location after ten minutes or less. Thus the equipped, we meet the meat of the game, a very linear romp through dungeons, moors, forests etc. where our job is to whack everything we meet. That's it. It's actually quite fun, but in a ""a drink and a laugh"" (ideally with up to two mates in co-op mode) way more than in a ""curled up with a book and an unending sense of wonder"" way, if that makes any sense. The game feels extremely arcade-y, from graphics to linearity to gameplay. (To actually put it in a real arcade, they'd have to turn the RPG-y clickable dialogs into cut scenes, and that'd be it.)Mechanics: The game has three main characters (dwarven ""warrior"", human ""ranger"", elven ""wizard""), of which the latter is a woman. Each character has their own skill tree. Characters that don't have a human player are controller by the AI (so if you play solo, you'll play in a group of three with two computer-controlled characters). The looks of your avatar can be edited (if you manage to find a mirror in-game, of which there are at least two), but the editor is very basic (a handful of attributes with six or so values each (hair color, face shape, eye color, hairdo -- in fact, that may be it already).The game caters to the casual gamer. The combat system provides for some token variation without being complicated, and it's nigh impossible to get lost in the levels. If you only get to play once a  week, no problem, it's not like you could forget the current quest (""follow the path, kill everything""). The player characters are never really fleshed out in terms of backstory, so that's another thing you can't forget, and the story is pretty straight forward. Easy mode actually is easy. The game works nicely with a 360 controller. I can't speak to the other two classes, but the ""loremaster"" (wizard) skill tree had a sufficient amount of sane options.Gameplay for the most part is quite fluid, though confusingly, WitN introduces a variety of game elements early on (while you're still learning the ropes and what to expect from the world; there is no out-and-out tutorial level) that are never picked up again later -- there's a side-quest that will timeout and fail if you do too many other things before completing that quest, but it seems to be the only one that does that. There are ""mines"" in the very first location that we're taught can be used to break large structures in the environment, except that we never see the mines again later on, and there's pretty much 0 interaction with the superstructure for the rest of the game. Another early level has a ""find the key to progress through this door"" situation, but again, it's the only time that happens in the entire game. (To add insult to injury, this happens after we've been taught for a good while what chests look like in the game -- only for the key to be in the sole chest in the game that looks different. Specifically, it looks like a slab of stone or a sarcophagus or what not. Also, it's in the darkest part of the dungeon, so, good luck not running past it.) Mind, those things are not so much a nuisance as they are puzzling. Had they planned to have more content to that effect? Was QC asleep? What was going on? :)Long story short, if you like fantasy and would like to solo or co-op through linear levels of a fantasy world that happens to nominally be MiddleEarth (it's much easier to believe the Middle-Earth part during the interludes; the action/arcade sequences feel like they could be anything), go for it. It's a nice, uncomplicated, casual game. If you're more the RPG/adventure type or expect deep immersion or generally feel like Tolkien is serious business, you may wish to give this game a pass.Bought for $1.99 or so during Steam Sale, which, seeing as I completed the game, made it an excellent buy. Buy at $4.99 or better. It may only be worth full price to big LotR fans -- ones who are OK with the premise of an arcade-y game, and one where you don't play a character from the books.

But beware if you plan on playing this game you will have to play co-op or have to play as the dwarf to get the skill taunt, as in chapter 7 part 3 its pretty impossible to kill 2 trolls whilst needing to protect a gate. The game also has more flaws such as this being an RPG you cant swap characters and this is very annoying as you cannnot choose what upgrades for them nor can you change thier equipment, you can only give them items, whether they use them or not is another matter so you have to take notes down as to what defence and strength they have.

Posted: September 20, 2015
												3rd person, hack and slash, story driven, action RPG in Lord of the Rings universe, that follows the story of the Lord of the Rings books / movies, yet is presented from a different angle, where you play as one of the three heroes set on a quest to eliminate Sauron's mysterious ally in the north.Story is very similar to the movies, and you meet many known characters throughout your journey, like Gandalf, Frodo, Bilbo, Aragorn, Legolas and many more. Most of the time you can only interact with them in ""safe"" hubs like towns and scripted cut-scenes.Even if you didn't watch the movies, there's fair amount of lore available through dialogues if you chose investigate dialogue options. I didn't encounter choice and consequence in dialogues, so probably they are straight forward and just there for information, lore and story.Combat is mostly hack and slash, with melee weapons as well as ranged ones, depending on hero. You defeat enemies, find loot in linear levels with some hidden passages and secrets here and there. After leveling up you get skill points you can spec into 3 trees, and stats points you can increase stats with, so your basic RPG elements.You can find, buy or get as a reward different kinds of armor pieces and weapons. I have no clue if you can equip your AI controlled allies, but you can trade with them, and if you play in co-op, it's a good idea to trade and offer items you don't use to party members, as you often find items not wearable by your hero.Co-op is strongest aspect of this game, it's really fun and enjoyable, with great synergy between heroes. Dwarf can be tank or tanky melee warrior, Elf has healing, shields and support spells, and Human is basically archer or rogue damage dealer. All heroes have some sort of ranged attacks and require some aiming to successfully hit enemies.Game offers some side quests and challenge locations besides the main story. You can revisit almost any level for additional loot and XP. Dwarf can collect ore and bash through weak walls to uncover secret areas. Elf can gather herbs and brew potions as well as dispel magically sealed areas. Human however can only gather hidden cashes of supplies, and is a bit dull compared to other heroes.There's decent variety of enemies in the game, orcs, trolls, spiders, humans, wyrms, dragons, just to name a few. AI is straight forward, usually rushing you head on as melee or shooting from range with ranged attacks, bigger creatures and bosses have special attacks and require careful positioning or dodging to not get hit. You can easily fall in battle after couple direct hits, unless you dodge or block the attacks.Environments look good yet lack detail, texture quality on characters is decent with somewhat low quality on environments. Visually game looks similar to ""Game of Thrones"" game. Voice acting and facial animations are decent enough and sound similar to the characters from the movies, yet I doubt there's any line from the actual actors in the game.For a game made in 2011 it doesn't look that good, and could be much better with serious polish, never the less the story and 3 player co-op makes this game very enjoyable 12 hour experience. With hero switching and story replay on harder difficulties, this game will give you up to 30 hours of ""content"". I experienced some disconnects while playing in co-op, so it has some network issues, make sure if someone disconnect to not advance in story, and just remake the lobby.Enjoy.

												Terrible brawler, everything about the game is wrong down to the most basic mechanics.Even though the game runs at 60fps with no drops on my system it feels like 25, everything is sluggish and delayed like I'm playing through OnLive. Every movement or action has input delay and recovery animations from being knocked down can take control away from the player for 20+ seconds. Enjoy wailing on an enemy for an entire minute while they make no effort to counter or block you, the enemies in this game are mindless sponges, the only danger comes from being overwhelmed by the endlessly respawning minions as 20 of them crowd you at once. Invisible barriers and clipping issues are rampant, every object and character has an invisible sphere extending beyond them that will clip with anything you get within about a meter of, making judging distance completely unintuitive. Laugh as all 3 characters get stuck in a doorway that looks like it should easily fit 5. It isn't hard to make a brawler, and yet this game fails in every category.			",185,12,4,19,14,3,30

												3rd person, hack and slash, story driven, action RPG in Lord of the Rings universe, that follows the story of the Lord of the Rings books / movies, yet is presented from a different angle, where you play as one of the three heroes set on a quest to eliminate Sauron's mysterious ally in the north.Story is very similar to the movies, and you meet many known characters throughout your journey, like Gandalf, Frodo, Bilbo, Aragorn, Legolas and many more. Most of the time you can only interact with them in ""safe"" hubs like towns and scripted cut-scenes.Even if you didn't watch the movies, there's fair amount of lore available through dialogues if you chose investigate dialogue options. I didn't encounter choice and consequence in dialogues, so probably they are straight forward and just there for information, lore and story.Combat is mostly hack and slash, with melee weapons as well as ranged ones, depending on hero. You defeat enemies, find loot in linear levels with some hidden passages and secrets here and there. After leveling up you get skill points you can spec into 3 trees, and stats points you can increase stats with, so your basic RPG elements.You can find, buy or get as a reward different kinds of armor pieces and weapons. I have no clue if you can equip your AI controlled allies, but you can trade with them, and if you play in co-op, it's a good idea to trade and offer items you don't use to party members, as you often find items not wearable by your hero.Co-op is strongest aspect of this game, it's really fun and enjoyable, with great synergy between heroes. Dwarf can be tank or tanky melee warrior, Elf has healing, shields and support spells, and Human is basically archer or rogue damage dealer. All heroes have some sort of ranged attacks and require some aiming to successfully hit enemies.Game offers some side quests and challenge locations besides the main story. You can revisit almost any level for additional loot and XP. Dwarf can collect ore and bash through weak walls to uncover secret areas. Elf can gather herbs and brew potions as well as dispel magically sealed areas. Human however can only gather hidden cashes of supplies, and is a bit dull compared to other heroes.There's decent variety of enemies in the game, orcs, trolls, spiders, humans, wyrms, dragons, just to name a few. AI is straight forward, usually rushing you head on as melee or shooting from range with ranged attacks, bigger creatures and bosses have special attacks and require careful positioning or dodging to not get hit. You can easily fall in battle after couple direct hits, unless you dodge or block the attacks.Environments look good yet lack detail, texture quality on characters is decent with somewhat low quality on environments. Visually game looks similar to ""Game of Thrones"" game. Voice acting and facial animations are decent enough and sound similar to the characters from the movies, yet I doubt there's any line from the actual actors in the game.For a game made in 2011 it doesn't look that good, and could be much better with serious polish, never the less the story and 3 player co-op makes this game very enjoyable 12 hour experience. With hero switching and story replay on harder difficulties, this game will give you up to 30 hours of ""content"". I experienced some disconnects while playing in co-op, so it has some network issues, make sure if someone disconnect to not advance in story, and just remake the lobby.Enjoy.

												I got this game in a humble bundle expecting/hoping for something along the lines of Return of the King from the days of old....but nope. Terribly shallow, boring gameplay. Mindless button mashing combat. Forget about combos, just press A for quick attack, or press B for power attack, or Z for weak♥♥♥♥♥ranged attack. Abilities are so dull that you almost never notice that you've used them. Equipment/loot is just like any other ARPG of this type, except with no flavor whatsoever. Story was cliched dribble on top of hilariously cheesy dialog and voice acting. If you want a solid ARPG there are literally hundreds of better choices out there. This game is bottom of the bargain bin at Walmart, but with half decent graphics. It wouldnt meet the expectations of a child raised in the wilderness by wolves who doesnt even know the concept of a video game. Avoid at all costs			",151,7,2,17,19,2,41

												Online co-op is plagued with issues. The ingame voice interfered with other software and worked extremely inconsistently, to the point that our 3-man team had to kick one player out permanently because the game wouldn't let us play with him. The combat is repetitive, the maps are cramped and linear and riddled with clipping issues. The game kept crashing.TL;DR Not worth your time or money.			",110,36,0,17,28,0,23

												This game is more linear than your school ruler. You move in straight line from point A to point B like a train on a rails. Step fight, step fight over and over again. Pathetic dialogs do not contribute into the atmophere.If you wana kill mobs you better look into Diablo style games. This one looks like an attempt to make a game than a game itself.Whats good: amazing work of artists, Middle-Earth scenery and backgrounds are breathtaking. Too bad you are not allowed to step aside from your rails to deepen into the surroundings.Characters are set but some kind of visual customization is present. Thanks for that at least.Recommeded only for most dedicated LOTR fans, consider it a museum excursion interrupted by annoying fights.If you wana good gameplay you better not to bother.

												I like the way this game forces the in game voice chat on you so that if you are in a co-op game and on skype with your teammate it sounds like you have an echo, which just makes the game more immersive as it all takes place in caves. I tried to play without also being on skype but ran into problems as one of LOTR:WitN's most interesting and unique difficulty mechanics is that it crashes every 5 minutes. 6/10			",148,35,6,11,6,2,30

												LOTR: WITN is an adventure/hack'n slash/RPG game aimed to be played in CO-OP. If you can't recruit 2 more friends to play along, brace yourself, 'cause you gonna suffer. As I said, aimed to co-op, means the whole history is played with 3 characters at the same time, of which you just can control one. The other two, if you don't have anyone to share the struggle with you, will be given to the most annoying/dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IA ever made. This is kinda annoying but if you have friends to play with you, the experience is very rewarding and funny.From my PoV, I find odd how this game was abandoned by the developer. It will not require THAT much of effort to tune this game and adjust some minur stuff.Needless to say, the lore is very interesting and the overall 'RPG experience' is nice (concerning loot and build-craft). I would like more choices to make and not only the illusion of choice. ps: About bugs, I just finished the game with friends, but one of them was not able to save the game and unlock the Heroic Mode. So we went back there to help him. But Agandâur just bugged big time, and my char is stucked in the last piece of land in Carn Dum, without hope to be released.			",61,3,0,0,2,0,5

												For the TL;DR people out there - game offers great gameplay, good story, fantastic music and nice visuals.Aaand now for the other people:The gameplay is a mix of hack 'n' slash and rpg. It's really fun and doesn't get boring. The game also lets you play as 3 diffirent characters - each of them having diffirent armors, weapons, skills, and their own other characteristic things (Like one being a warrior, one a ranger and one a mage). The only problem with the gameplay that I have is the fact that it's kinda unbalanced. The game itself seems quite easy for the most part, and the challange missions are overly hard. Though it still isn't a huge problem in my opinion, thankfully.The story is a not-too-complicated, good and entertaining story. SMALL SPOILER Though you get to meet the characters from the original LotR story, which is quite radThe soundtrack is really good and has that LotR-ish style, of course. It really fits your current environment in the game.The graphics are quite good (except on the main menu, where for some reason they are awfully blurry, but that's just the menu) and puts attention to small details - like your character getting temporarily dirty after rolling on the ground. The game also makes some really badass looking view changes and slow-motion when delivering the final blow to the last enemy in your area, which is awesome.Really reccomending buying this game to people who like actiony games.

It's a great hack and slash, with lots of loot.Pros: -Great Art work and level design-Music is Great-Vocals are great-Story is great-Long game of good action and battles-It's LOTRCons:-Game has a few mechanics with combat that are ok could be better. Just remember ROLLING is your new best friend which will get you out of a lot of annoying situations!-Game crashes are a major issue with this game. I did manage to figure out what was my problem and fix the crashing. I made a GUIDE on how i FIXED my game which may work for others.GUIDE:

-Inventory system is not the best and there is no static placement of items in your inventory-can't replay zones that you currently cleared to find more loot.

												--- THIS RECOMMENDED IS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU PAID LESS THAN 6 EURO ---This game shows 100% why the PC master race hates the consoles so much.Now lets list all the things they did wrong:Character switching: you cannot midarea switch character, now i cannot for the life of me figure out if its just cause consoles are so weak they couldnt implement it, or if someone actually thought it was a great ""feature"" to have....cause reasons?Inventory management: its just a mess, clicking on a weapon on your character dont mean its marked in your inventory, so when selling or repairing, you better make sure its the right thing you actually have marked, and not what appear logical. (a free punch in the jewels, tells me more than 1 person have sold an item they were using)Dont get me startet on how incredibly weak the gear switching is, if you play solo you have to log out, switch char and then gear up, so unless you can remeber exactly what the other 2 are wearing, it just a massive hassle.No going back: ye gods, how i hate that completely linear console way, where you drop downa a 30cm drop and now you cant go back, its in the top 5 reasons why consoles are the worst.Durability: its just so meh to have durability, and having to repair stuff, yuckCompanions: When you play solo, they dont wear the gear you give them, or play by the skills you put point into, thats just weak sauce.Im sure there are a ton more stuff that i forgot.But when all is said and done, i played the game to the end, and didnt regret it, my ragemeter was just maxed, at seeing that a few core changes could have made this game great, now its just mediocre.The combat is fun, albeit i am partial to blood, gore and dismemeberment, you have RPG elements, and gear upgrading, story and VA is decent.

												The game is a real fun to play but it's very unstable. After playing with my friend all my characters' stats and inventory were replaced with his. The second time I wanted to play I lost entire game progress and had to start over. Also the game constantly crashed when I tried to complete Lorien level. Despite that I still enjoyed the time I spent on playing it. I never completed it because of the issues mentioned before but I still enjoyed it.			",195,40,8,23,13,3,34

												I bought this to play with my husband and after about 5 hours neither of us has any desire whatsoever to load this again, not even for half an hour, not even when there is absolutely nothing else to play.Super awkward fighting system. (Sorry, but after spending 600+ hours on Dark souls games maybe my standards are a bit high. But seriously, pretty much any other 3rd person action/rpg game will beat this one in fight mechanics, except for maybe Kingdoms of Amalur.)Completely linear levels, you're basically on rails the whole time.And graphics/animations are just way too old feeling.Story and dialogs are boring, awkward cameo appearances of famous characters just to remind you ""hey! please like us! we're lord of the rings! yay!"".I can't believe how many good reviews there are, and i'm very disappointed i got tricked into buying this. I think some people just love everything that has a Lord of the Rings stamp on, and they forget to judge the game for its actual GAME properties. If you love Lord of the Rings so much go reread The Silmarillion again or something, instead of justifying this sh**. Also don't forget to mark this as an ""unhelpful"" review because you're angry that i insulted your tastes.			",66,12,1,35,11,0,14

												A beautiful game that deserve to be played.Although the price may seem to be sligthly too high, it is definitelly a must once one sale. You'll get 10-14 hours of story about the Middle Earth and will follow a group of 3 heroes that try to make difference at the North. A story trully is beautiful and you'll meet some characters from the book/movies, will get to talk to them as well, which in my opinion was a great plus to the story.As I already said before, the story itself is beautiful. Characters are well writen, music is beautiful, voiceacting is perfect and atmosphere is fantastic. Another thing that I found to be great (although didn't used it myself too much) was the ability to switch between characters in the end of each level, so that you could try all playbable character without starting the game all over again. Co-op is also an option (although I played solo because I wanted to get into the story as much as possible) and it is infact a lot of fun !All in all, I really did enjoyed the game and can't but recommend it!

												Amazing game really fun, nice voice acting and looks really nice, story is great also. The Ai you have with you can be stupid and go die but when you learn that you can tell them to defend you its okay but if you have 2 friends to play with then you should definitely try this out i bet you will have alot fun. At chapter 8 part 2 to 4 it will crash hard i dont know if it matter to put everything at lowest but i did and 800x600 window mode, didn't really work before i figured out that if you have bow and zoom in at the ground all the time when you move except at fights to you get the save at part 4 when you get outside then i could change everything back to normal and finish game. sorry if bad english			",95,14,2,12,11,1,2

												A well balanced game with a good coop gameplay, but on the other side the game seems to get easier as you progress and for some user the stuttering just kills it making it impossible to play. Overall I would say its a good game, but it has some issues so it all depends on what kind of experience are you looking for, personally I would like to see the game get harder as you progress trough the campaign, for that I give it a 7.5 out of 10!

												Longish , with a variety of locations and a system of cooperative fun combat that will make us enjoy as never slicing necks massacring orc and goblins with arrows and magic spells . War in the North is a very good action role-playing game , but its simplicity in the combat system is paid eventually face a somewhat repetitive development that leads us away from the larger ones. Still, any Tolkien fan should miss.			",32,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Don't buy this. This game was hastily ported over to PC and has too many problems to list. Me and my friend purchased it on sale to just play through togeather, not excpeting much other than a cheap game to waste a weekend or two. First thing you'll notice is the terrible in-game mic and the fact that you can't turn it off at all, which means if you have TS or Skype going you have to decide between terrible quality or an echo. Secondly the game crashes and glitches out constantly. Some are just funny things with NPC interations or ragdolls but other would break the game by not allowing you to progress any further because a boss or event decides not to show up. Our golden example of this was when the Final Boss decided he didn't want to show up for the fight, effectivley breaking our save file at the end of the game. Even reloading doesn't fix it. It's also terribly optimized in certain parts of the game. I have a decent computer that can run most new games at the highest setting yet there would be fits of lag in crowed areas, the worst being Chapter  8 where you crawl though the rust tunnels. I had to look at the ground the entire time else I would instantly crash.Mediocre game full with breaking bugs. Don't bother.			",129,19,0,11,7,2,8

												I finished this game with my friend, and it's just uggh... TERRIBLE. This game is full of bugs and glitches. I made a pro-contra list for you guys just READ IT BEFORE YOU thinkin’ on buying this product. Pro + Contra:+Beleram is highly the most useful and interesting character of the game. He was good in every single frame on this damned game. -He was buggy like everything else in the game.+Many types of weapons and armor. Design was acceptable. -UNBALANCED weapons. Not really profession specific. -Maximum arrow cap is 80 WHICH IS TOO LOW especially against wave of high HP orcs. +Graphics just fine, but...-...often buggy and BEWARE! MASSIVE FRAME DROPS AHEAD! -.-"" even if you have an i7...+Private co-op can be made easily- Tabbing out often makes you drop (all of your items since the last checkpoint will disappear)+Easy inventory system-Sometimes items just disappear... I clicked on a reward box and my reward suddenly disapeared. O_O+MOST FUN OF THIS GAME: A bug but it's SO FREAKIN' awesome we laughed our ar*e off when we saw a dagger which randomly appeared in somebody's hand during cutscenes :DOVER ALL...I recommend this game for a playthrough but ONLY ONCE! And you can be so frustrated when it's done. (and not because you finished it)Is it worth it for full price?ABSOLUTELY NOT! PLEASE -.-""			",475,143,11,53,52,7,103

												I like the LOTR franchise, but the games seem to be hit or miss.  This RPG is the latter.  The game menu is unintuitive and having to exit out of inventory everytime you search an enemy is a chore.  Voice acting is alright, but better for some characters than others.  The story is forgettable and you don't really form any kind of emotional attachment to the characters.  Enemies are what you'd expect, except there are a lot more trolls.  Good lord how I hated the trolls.  Also, there is a boss about halfway through that may have been bugged for me (or not) that took a good 5-10 minute of hacking at his legs to bring down.  I also expected that there would be more areas of the game to explore, as there are more locations on the map than you actually visit.  Apparently they are there to explain lore, but that should have been explicitly stated.  Pass on this title.			",283,69,3,22,10,2,14

												Jacko Rating 7.5/10What a hidden gem this game turned out to be!  I bought this game on sale and was greatly surprised and impressed with this LOR Hack n Slash.  Better than just about every LOR game to ever be released apart from the latest one Shaow Of Mordor, in fact although a few years old it still has one of the best Co Op modes if not the best Co Op mode in any LOR game to date.Graphics and sound are average but the combat and team format that you play in (team of 3 which 2 of which can be Co Op) is what makes the game and gives you such great enjoyment.  With a touch of open worldness about it in some parts (especially Rivendale) this path lead hack and slash is easy to pick up and gets you in the thick of it right off the bat.Reccomended to buy on sale and try not to pay more than 10$ to really get your value for money.

												Multiply my ""hours on record"" by 2 or so to get closer to the real amount of time I've so far spent with this game.Greatly underrated game. While certainly not perfect, it does its job really well of delivering a battle-heavy stroll through really beautiful and atmospheric locations of War of the Ring Middle-Earth, following a plot that is simple and yet of some very respectable quality. Gameplay is straightforward click/key-to-hit combat with a number of abilities based on button combos. While the characters do not always respond optimally, a few hours of play and you'll be more than at ease as you go toe to toe with big nasties. A regular stat & talent-tree based progression with unlockables as well as upgradeable equipment give it the little RPG flavor that deepens gameplay a bit, without complicating things too much or making the game try to be something other than it is: a very decent hack and slash experience.The rendition of all the places we visit is beautiful due to how much personality and distinctiveness each environment has and the characters certainly work well, surprisingly being generally closer to book than film in terms of how they speak and behave, which is really pleasant. The focus on oft-neglected Book 1 environments (Barrow Downs, Fornost, Ettenmoors, Misty Mountains... with a very nice escape through Mirkwood) is also a very pleasant change from the usually inevitable tropes of Rohan and Mordor.While somewhat repetitive as all games of this type are, the game throws enough action and enough variety in enemies (from goblins to trolls all the way through uruks, savages, spiders...) to keep things interesting from the first level to the last. A good bunch of abilities and three quite different playable characters help in that regard.It was never game of the year material but it scores points for being a mostly well done product into which a lot of care has gone, despite its shortcomings and limitations. Very decent gameplay, beautiful environments, high quality music, interesting story moments. I recommend it. It deserves the follow-up that it will unfortunately never get.			",76,25,0,20,10,0,10

												LOTR: WITN is an adventure/hack'n slash/RPG game aimed to be played in CO-OP. If you can't recruit 2 more friends to play along, brace yourself, 'cause you gonna suffer. As I said, aimed to co-op, means the whole history is played with 3 characters at the same time, of which you just can control one. The other two, if you don't have anyone to share the struggle with you, will be given to the most annoying/dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IA ever made. This is kinda annoying but if you have friends to play with you, the experience is very rewarding and funny.From my PoV, I find odd how this game was abandoned by the developer. It will not require THAT much of effort to tune this game and adjust some minur stuff.Needless to say, the lore is very interesting and the overall 'RPG experience' is nice (concerning loot and build-craft). I would like more choices to make and not only the illusion of choice. ps: About bugs, I just finished the game with friends, but one of them was not able to save the game and unlock the Heroic Mode. So we went back there to help him. But Agandâur just bugged big time, and my char is stucked in the last piece of land in Carn Dum, without hope to be released.			",61,3,0,0,2,0,5

												The fighting is great. The story is impressive(I have never read the original). You don't need to collect equipments like Diablo. Although some character skills will break the balance of the game which influences your game experience(For your game experience, you should never or less use those skills), I still want to play second or third times after I complete a playthrough. If the game has more freedom, it will be much better. 动作爽快，剧情丰满（我没看过原著），不需要刷刷刷（虽然有个别技能会让游戏进入“无双”模式，不过你不用或是少用就行了）。即使通关了我仍然愿意继续二周目甚至是三周目。不满的地方只是希望能够再自由点，不过其实已经做得非常好了！			",1010,324,33,155,93,7,173

												War in the North delivers a well-paced narrative which was born in the non-canon events of Tolkien's Middle-earth. While Frodo and the Fellowship were dangling from a pitchfork above a kettle, the northern lands were defended by stalwarts (unknown) heroes, of which you happen to be part of. As you progress through the story you'll come to realize that, no matter the difficulty, your NPCs are dull and won't serve you well in dire situations.That's where CO-OP mode kicks in. Secure a Teamspeak server with your friends, form your heroic trio and go kill some of Sauron's lackeys. FOR GONDOR!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It pains me to do it as a fan of the LOTR series but I'll be giving this game a no-go. While there are good aspects of the game (storyline, LOTR lore, cameo characters and decent graphics for a 2011 game) the gameplay is quite frankly, just terrible. It feels like the developers of the game didn't spend enough time fine-tuning the game and making it user-friendly, such being able to compare items efficiently in your inventory when buying weapons and armor - you do get the basic up and down atk/def comparison but nothing for slots or other stat bonuses so you're stuck with exiting the shop and checking your item again. I found that a real pain as I was constantly changing armor and weapons throughout the game. The game was overall buggy with the AI support characters being ridiculous and getting stuck in certain areas. As I played most of the game single player, it was really hard to make it past certain levels without getting help. Yes, I know it's a co-op game, but the single player option is there isn't it? At least give me decent AI or options to customize their skills or armor!I liked the story and thought the script writers did a pretty good job of working around the LOTR universe and making it feel real. Some cutscenes and story bits were pretty good - until I got to the gameplay. It just spoiled it for me :(			",33,7,0,10,1,0,1

												Don't buy this. This game was hastily ported over to PC and has too many problems to list. Me and my friend purchased it on sale to just play through togeather, not excpeting much other than a cheap game to waste a weekend or two. First thing you'll notice is the terrible in-game mic and the fact that you can't turn it off at all, which means if you have TS or Skype going you have to decide between terrible quality or an echo. Secondly the game crashes and glitches out constantly. Some are just funny things with NPC interations or ragdolls but other would break the game by not allowing you to progress any further because a boss or event decides not to show up. Our golden example of this was when the Final Boss decided he didn't want to show up for the fight, effectivley breaking our save file at the end of the game. Even reloading doesn't fix it. It's also terribly optimized in certain parts of the game. I have a decent computer that can run most new games at the highest setting yet there would be fits of lag in crowed areas, the worst being Chapter  8 where you crawl though the rust tunnels. I had to look at the ground the entire time else I would instantly crash.Mediocre game full with breaking bugs. Don't bother.			",129,19,0,11,7,2,8

I made a pro-contra list for you guys just READ IT BEFORE YOU thinkin’ on buying this product. Pro + Contra:+Beleram is highly the most useful and interesting character of the game. He was good in every single frame on this damned game. -He was buggy like everything else in the game.+Many types of weapons and armor. Design was acceptable. -UNBALANCED weapons. Not really profession specific. -Maximum arrow cap is 80 WHICH IS TOO LOW especially against wave of high HP orcs. +Graphics just fine, but...-...often buggy and BEWARE! MASSIVE FRAME DROPS AHEAD! -.-"" even if you have an i7...+Private co-op can be made easily- Tabbing out often makes you drop (all of your items since the last checkpoint will disappear)+Easy inventory system-Sometimes items just disappear... I clicked on a reward box and my reward suddenly disapeared. O_O+MOST FUN OF THIS GAME: A bug but it's SO FREAKIN' awesome we laughed our ar*e off when we saw a dagger which randomly appeared in somebody's hand during cutscenes :DOVER ALL...I recommend this game for a playthrough but ONLY ONCE!

												This is easily one of my favorite games.Highly recomended for LOTR fans!My only complain would be the faulty ingame voice chat that you cannot(or couldn't as I played it back in Nov 2013)disable. It was very laggy and when you wanted to use skype you got ghost voices all over the palce. Few ingame glitches, though so minor that they aren't even worth mentioning.Entertaining combat and lots of good voice acted NPCs to talk to! The environment is superb, the locations bring nostalgia and the loading screens make you want to jump into a Tolkien book once more.I recommend getting it on a sale and if you do - buy 2 extra copies an play with friends. It is not as enjoyable when you play solo due to the poor companion AI.Overall I'd give it a solid 8/10 in CO-OP and a 6/10 when Soloing.			",148,15,1,12,7,0,12

												This game is a lot more fun than initially expected, the mechanics work well and the levelling process is interesting enough to max. The story is compelling though not as much as the serie it is derived from. It plays easier and is more compelling when played with two friends. The side stories are nice and give for a fine additional touch. However the game does not arrive without it's flaws because If played alone (speaking from own experience) it might get repetitve. Creating the combination strategies with up to two friends and trying to complete the hardest modes is what makes the game fun. With a possibly ignorant AI the latter is difficult to achieve. Therefore I recommend the game, however do not buy it just because you are a fan of the series because you might get dissapointed without your favourite heroes being playable and but little references made to them throughout the story. Besides all this I hope you have fun playing it if you decide to buy it.			",94,9,2,12,2,0,2

War in the North is a very good action role-playing game , but its simplicity in the combat system is paid eventually face a somewhat repetitive development that leads us away from the larger ones. Still, any Tolkien fan should miss.			",32,0,0,1,0,0,0

												I finished this game with my friend, and it's just uggh... TERRIBLE. This game is full of bugs and glitches. I made a pro-contra list for you guys just READ IT BEFORE YOU thinkin’ on buying this product. Pro + Contra:+Beleram is highly the most useful and interesting character of the game. He was good in every single frame on this damned game. -He was buggy like everything else in the game.+Many types of weapons and armor. Design was acceptable. -UNBALANCED weapons. Not really profession specific. -Maximum arrow cap is 80 WHICH IS TOO LOW especially against wave of high HP orcs. +Graphics just fine, but...-...often buggy and BEWARE! MASSIVE FRAME DROPS AHEAD! -.-"" even if you have an i7...+Private co-op can be made easily- Tabbing out often makes you drop (all of your items since the last checkpoint will disappear)+Easy inventory system-Sometimes items just disappear... I clicked on a reward box and my reward suddenly disapeared. O_O+MOST FUN OF THIS GAME: A bug but it's SO FREAKIN' awesome we laughed our ar*e off when we saw a dagger which randomly appeared in somebody's hand during cutscenes :DOVER ALL...I recommend this game for a playthrough but ONLY ONCE! And you can be so frustrated when it's done. (and not because you finished it)Is it worth it for full price?ABSOLUTELY NOT! PLEASE -.-""			",475,143,11,53,52,7,103

												Don't buy this. This game was hastily ported over to PC and has too many problems to list. Me and my friend purchased it on sale to just play through togeather, not excpeting much other than a cheap game to waste a weekend or two. First thing you'll notice is the terrible in-game mic and the fact that you can't turn it off at all, which means if you have TS or Skype going you have to decide between terrible quality or an echo. Secondly the game crashes and glitches out constantly. Some are just funny things with NPC interations or ragdolls but other would break the game by not allowing you to progress any further because a boss or event decides not to show up. Our golden example of this was when the Final Boss decided he didn't want to show up for the fight, effectivley breaking our save file at the end of the game. Even reloading doesn't fix it. It's also terribly optimized in certain parts of the game. I have a decent computer that can run most new games at the highest setting yet there would be fits of lag in crowed areas, the worst being Chapter  8 where you crawl though the rust tunnels. I had to look at the ground the entire time else I would instantly crash.Mediocre game full with breaking bugs. Don't bother.			",129,19,0,11,7,2,8

												I will start by saying it is a beautiful looking game with good story, alot more money was spend on looks than gameplay, but that doesnt make it a good game when dealing with game breaking issues. The AI on both sides are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to say the least, ranged characters focus on melee, everyone hit box is too big and get caugh up on each other. The controls get glitchy sometimes during sessions but other than that are fine, except the drawf and when he gets explosive bolts, you lose the ability to use the crossbow for normal use. As you level up your regular attacks pretty much compare to your power moves or critical moves late game. In the end I wish they put more money into the programming of the combat than looks.It gets worse gameplay wise once you hold off the siege in Nordinbard, Beleram is not where the marker is telling you to go. The lightning in Carn Dun is gamebreaking. It remains unfinished.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL:DR: No matter how good you think this game is, DO NOT BUY THIIS UNSUPPORTED AND BUG-RIDDEN SOFTWAREWhile this game offers compelling action gameplay, character building and 3-player co-op, the bugs will suck your will to play it. I have spent a similar amount of time troubleshooting the game as I have playing it.I have played this game in local co-op mode (3 players, LAN) and we have had:- game not running after install;- multiple re-installs;- blank screen at Mount Gundabad;- one player being constantly kicked out of the party at Rivendell;- at least one player per session being randomly kicked from the hosted match;- Other small performance, inventory, graphical, sound and quality of life bugs.Running the game across 3 laptops, 1 Windows 7 and 2 Windows 8.1. No superfluous software running in the background and all video drivers were current and windows updatd to current.This game would only be suitable for someone who is a single-player masochist who is willing to either run with multiple saves and/or unintended means to get over the bugs. A shame, as it is a good concept poorly executed and now consigned to abandonware.			",29,17,0,35,9,0,26

												I'll try to keep this short.+Fun, gameplay, graphics, story. But only once.-Multiplayer, inventory, levelling, AI (see below), repetitive gameplay and story.I've played through twice, getting boring, on 3rd playthrough, no-can-do. Why? the NPC AI is abominable.Given that you need three chars to beat the game (especially in ""hold this map"" mode), in higher levels its just impossible because the AI is so inefficient.So, overall, it kills immersion, kills fun, kills gameplay.I'm not asking for a refund, but I'm not recommending either.

												One of the best LOTR games I've played in awhile. The parts I enjoyed the most were the concurrent story that takes place along with the story of the fellowship and the history that is easily accesible to learn more about Middle-Earth. Another great part of the game was the story and the empathy and true friendships you make through the story, and nothing will make you feel more than during the dwarven siege quest. Oh and you get to meet a dragon (and i bet you think Smaug is bad).			",54,4,0,17,15,0,7

												This game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ and is just terrible.  Multiplayer is super bugged.  It separated my friend and I when we both clicked on the map to travel to the same place.  We got stuck and had to exit.  The more I play, the more bugs are revealed.  Enemies have the ability to blink and skate around.  Dead things vibrate uncontrollably on the floor.  Potions never drop.  Some parts are extremely easy and some parts are extremely difficult.  There is also this dumb thing where your voice echoes when you're in caverns.Running into Gandalf and Aragorn was not that exciting.  They both had the same stupid look on their face.The dumb bird was useless.  It needed me to use a feather for it to attack my enemies.  If its smart enough to talk, it should be smart enough to see me getting ♥♥♥♥ed in the face by a horde of op terrorist bomber gremlin things.The more I play, the worse this game gets.  I keep fighting the same trolls over and over again.  You have to click each item to repair instead of repair all.  I keep getting separated from my friend.  The characters say the stupidest things ever and Arwen looks pregnant.The dumb eagles should have went with Frodo instead of this random three man fellowship.  We are extremely useless and in no way helpful in stopping the evil Sauron.  The eagles are so op and powerful.  They should have been more useful.			",259,49,7,42,29,3,56

												TLDR: Third Person hack/slash RPG similar to Dragon Age 2, but set in Tolkien’s Middle-Earth. Melee combat has a similar feel as the first Witcher game where you kind of need to flow from one hit to the next to build up strike power. The game appears to be built around multiplayer co-op, but I’ve only played single-player thus far. WARNING: If you have an ATI/AMD video card you will probably have technical trouble with this game. Big thumbs down for the game breaking bug (near the very end) - 2/10. Would have been 6/10 if the game actually worked.If you liked Dragon Age 2 more than you liked Dragon Age Origins (not many people do) you might want to give Lord of the Rings: War in the North a try. The game is more linear and focused on combat than world-building. This might have to do with the fact that the “main story” is happening elsewhere (Fellowship of the Ring) and you’re just the distraction to help Frodo sneak into Mordor. You play one member of a trio of adventurers at around the start of the first Lord of the Rings novel. Before Frodo, Aragorn, and their buddies start their journey to Mount Doom, Farin the dwarf (melee fighter), Eradan the ranger (archer), and Andriel the elf (mage) are fighting the good fight against the servants of the dark lord Sauron, who are led by a bad dude named Agandaur. Since Agandaur is Sauron’s right hand man fighting the bad fight in the north, your goal is to smash him and draw Sauron’s attention away from the south, where the Fellowship of the Ring are making their way into enemy territory. The game is played in the third person perspective and while you can only play as one of the three characters at a time, you get opportunities to switch which character you’re playing between game chapters. Really though, you should probably stick with one character per playthrough because the game will auto assign the stats and skills of the characters you aren’t using when they level up, and you won’t get much opportunity to customize if you keep switching around. Unlike the Dragon Age games, you don’t control the whole team, just the guy you’re playing. Also, you’re controlling all your character’s attacks as well, not just designating a target.Like many hack and slash action RPG’s you run into a lot of loot and equipment in the game. You pretty much have as many equipment slots as Diablo 2, but most of the gear you find is “non-magical” and can be easily compared to similar pieces. This means there isn’t much in the way of randomly generated loot stats, and you don’t need to spend much time grinding for items. In fact, you probably shouldn’t even buy weapons from the vendors because chances are you’ll just find something better in about 10 minutes.Pros:+Co-op gameplay available so you can go through the single player campaign with a friend or two. Each character has a unique “secret finding” skill that can only be used when a human is controlling the character (in single player, you only find secrets that your character can “see”) so if you have a full team of human players you can find all the secrets in a level. Also, bear in mind that like many squad based games, you can revive your allies if they’re knocked out. So you don’t need to spend too many healing potions if you know your buddy can just bring you back to life at full health.+Decent story that takes you all over Middle Earth (well, a lot of it) and involves some of the characters from the Lord of the Rings books/movies. Why don’t the eagles just fly everyone everywhere? Play the game and find out!Cons:-This is the big one. If you have an AMD video card like I do (Radeon 7850) you will find the game has extremely poor frame rate at many places. I was unable to finish because at the last chapter, the game slowed to a crawl and would crash out repeatedly at the same place. Searching online, this seems to be a problem for a lot of people. My friend has an nVidia GPU and didn’t have this issue.-The “critical hit” system of the game can be fun sometimes but after a while it gets really repetitive. You built up power by continuously hitting a single enemy uninterrupted and eventually you can use a power attack with a chance of instantly killing them. Problem is, this means it takes like 2 minutes to kill many of the more powerful enemies, especially near the end of the game. Also, you only hit one enemy at a time no matter how wide your swings look, so attacking large groups of bad guys is really annoying (the little ankle-biters keep interrupting your combos against the big guys).-Despite how linear the game plays, it’s still possible to miss side quests because many of the quest items are randomly dropped. Cleared the whole area and didn’t find the special quest rock? Too bad for you, play through it again.-You can’t see the enemy’s life (except for bosses) and most bad guys seem to have a ton of life. This is probably intentional to force players to use the critical hit system more, but it means every fight seems artificially prolonged. Should it really take 50 hits to kill an orc?Overall, the game is fun (when it’s working) if you enjoy hack and slash and want to dive once again into Lord of the Rings lore, but there’s a lot of room for improvement. The fact that there are 3 playable character classes is reason for replay, but from what I’m told they’re mostly the same. If this game is in your backlog you should push it back in favor of something better, but it’s worth playing eventually: IF you have an nVidia graphics card. The game’s developers have abandoned the project so the crashing/low frame rate issues will not be fixed. The 90% of the game that I got to experience was sort of fun. ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

Also, if you are really into the Lord of the Rings universe this will be a treat.  Gameplay is just simple one to two button kills with range weapons invovled.  Graphics are not the greatest, although the characters models look high quality, but the enivorment is kind of bland.

												If you have an AMD card, don't bother, you're just going to have a mess of problems in Chapter 2 and Chapter 8. I managed to get through Chapter 2, despite the crazy amount of frame drops, stuttering, crash to desktops, had to restart the computer a few times, etc. Chapter 8 though. I just can't do it. I manage to get to a part where I'm supposed to find a lever after travelling through a series of sewage pipes under a fortress and the game just freezes up after a crazy amount of stuttering and frame drops. Just not good optimization for AMD cards.The game itself isn't bad. It's a fun action RPG in the Tolkein universe, so I was sold right away. You get to choose one of three characters, a man, a dwarf, and an elf. And you're not stuck with just that character, you can switch off in the main menu and continue from where you left off with any of the other characters. The combat is neat, but maybe a bit repetivie. The graphics are okay, but the character animation is pretty terrible. The combat animation, however, is actually great. The story isn't too compelling but you get to explore recognizable parts in the Tolkein universe as well as areas that have been mentioned but not necessarily explored in the novels or films. Basically, the plot involves the three characters banding together to fight off an evil force to the north while the Fellowship travels south towards Mordor.I should mention the gameplay as well. It's extremely linear. Basically, you enter an area which is counted as a ""Chapter"", and you continue along a path in that area in Middle-earth until the end of the Chapter. So it's not open world if that's what any of you wanted to know.If you have an Nvidia card and are a Tolkein fan, this game is good fun for its duration. No real replay value though.7.0/10 (Nvidia cards)5.0/10 (AMD cards)			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												Let's make this review as the game is: short, but juicy.The obvious +'s of the game are it's lore, background and story. It plays in the original LOTR world, with the original lore, original characters (you will meet the fellowship, Bilbo, etc, albeit only a few have the original voice actors). The plot and quests are believeable and fit nicely into the original LOTR plot.The graphics are fine. Controls, too, which is a surprise, given it's a console port. Might want to take this as an example for other *coughDScough* games.The Coop mode is nice and definitely upgrades the game's feeling. If just because the AI is horrible and needs to cheat the rules to actually be remotely useful.So... it looks nice and has a nice story? You already noticed what's lacking? Jep, the gameplay.The gameplay itself consists of running through linear levels, picking up loot, chests and secrets along the way, whilst slaugthering pile after pile of enemies with a few 'bosses' in between. Albeit those 'bosses' are often ridicolously weak, with the game's toughest points being the 'defend the gate' style horde attacks.Which fades right into the next issue: The game is too easy. It comes with two further unlockable difficultys, but actually the game becomes only easier on the 2nd run, given you, by now, have a pretty well-skilled character who (if you know your numbers) is built towards synergizing mass slaughter. (Note that me and my mates got too bored of the game to try a 3rd run on the highest difficulty setting, but I don't expect things to change.)As you can guess, inbetween nice (but boring once you know them from the first run) dialogues and repetitive slaughter is only boredome or exploring the map for glitches (floating trees are my favourite). The game definitely does not offer a lot of content.As mentioned above, the AI (at least for your teammates in singleplayer) is lackluster, nuff said.End result? 6/10It's fun to play once or twice, short enough for it'S repetitive melee system not to become boring, but not exactly an awesome game by any stretch. If you see it on a cheap sale (5@ and below sounds good) AND have someone to play it with, grab it. Otherwise, not really worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jeez, I don't even know where to start. To make things simple, if you can buy this on sale for $5 or less, then I'd say it's probably worth playing if you're into generic hack and slash RPGs. Otherwise, this could have been an awesome reimagining of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance or Champions of Norrath but falls flat in so many areas. Combat encounters are loads of fun at first because you're not hindered by the awful AI partners; they can actually kill enemies, revive you, and face groups on their own without your constant babysitting. About 6 hours in (of around 12-14), the beefier enemy types stop reacting to your moves which turns the fun hack and slash combat into a chore of ""XXY, roll away or block, XXY, etc,"" and reviving your AI partners because they don't block or roll. About another 2 hours after that, though, you run into enemies who interrupt your attacks and can stun lock you, so good luck reviving anyone once one of your partners is down unless you're lucky (or play Ranger and abuse his Evasion skill). There's also no sense of empowerment as you gain new abilities and equipment. Even ignoring the fact that most abilities (for even the Lore-Master/Wizard) are just boring power attacks that have a cooldown, they never end up doing enough damage to make them feel worth while as you progress through the game. New enemies are thrown at you in such a way that by the time you're doing significantly more damage, the enemies have double the health they used to.I'm not sure how common the technical issues are (seems like more of an AMD thing), but unless you want to downgrade drivers you can probably expect to deal with an inconsistent framerate that BOMBS for seemingly no reason at certain points in the game. Bugs are littered throughout as well, but I didn't run into anything that wasn't solved by quitting and reloading a checkpoint.I should note I didn't play any coop in the game, so maybe that saves some of the issues with its combat, but it's hard to believe the studio that made the amazing Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath released this. It could have been so much more.			",948,450,36,149,93,10,136

												!!! Might contain spoilers !!! Pros:- Addictingly fun combat.- Fun classes.- Comfortable controls (gamepad).- Partly very well done and thought-through.~ Hilariously bad story and voice acting.*Cons:- Unlike the PS-version, there is no couch co-op.- Not enough content. (E.g. areas and equipment).- Boring body armor skins.- Bad AI.- Bad combat mechanics for a few enemy NPCs.- Saddest, easiest and most pathetic final boss fight ever!- Feels really low budget.- No function for comparing equipment.- Frequently crashes / freezes.- Generally buggy.- Bad controls (mouse & keyboard).- No jumping ;(~ Very bad story and voice acting.*Conclusion:- Amazingly fun and addictive, mainly because of the combat! Worth the money!I've mostly played this game on PS3 and I thought it would be better on PC, but it's extremely badly ported! However, you won't lose more than a few seconds of progress when it crashes.Despite all of it's many, many errors and bugs it has brought me and my friends many hours of fun!*All that I remember is that I laughed my butt off due to, what I remember as, the most worthless story and voice acting. Maybe isn't as bad as I remember it. But if it is, you'll still get a good laugh out of it. So.. yeah.			",83,7,3,13,7,0,22

												I can't believe people like this game! It's terrible console port and game was clearly made for casual console gamers. Even game menu is terrible - they had to think really hard, how to make it that bad and unusable. Graphics on maximum are awful, there are not many resolution settings, and what's funny, to enter option you have to first click Settings and then a menu shows... with only 1 option which is ""OPTIONS"", why? Same when you try to start the game - ""You are attempting to run the game. Do you really want it? 1) Yes, start the game 2) No"" Human character looks like actor from a cheap movie, fortunately you can change that.Dialogues are written very poorly, like game target was 10 yo children.Controlling game with mouse is irritating - Y axis is less sensitive than X.There are crates every-freaking-where, that you can destroy to get loot. It's like collecting beans in HARRY POTTER.When you run out of HP, your character starts crouching and enemies ignore you, even when you follow them.There are tons of invisible walls - 1 step of stairs, but approached from wrong way? NO PASSAGE! Some rocks half of your height blocking the path - NO WAY.I'm a big LOTR fan and it's sad that most LOTR games are pure♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't know why people accept how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is. They give it a big + just because it's about Middle-Earth? Please don't do this, you are the reason they keep making such ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.			",1874,698,88,247,256,23,329

												***** ATI USERS BEWARE, AS OTHERS ALREADY MENTIONED, THIS GAME ISN'T OPTIMIZED FOR YOUR CARDS AND IT WILL RANDOMLY CRASH. NEAR THE END OF THE GAME IT WILL CONSTANTLY CRASH. *****^ I didn't know that before i start this game, so it dissapointed me.The game itself is a casual RPG game, a nice way to spend an evening or two. Nothing special.It's somewhat repetitive with the battles but nothing tragic. It's fun and simple.Not recommended for ATI users as well. Near the end it was literally unplayable because it was crashing constantly at Carn Dûm, stuttering and it was full of artifacts. I tried many guides with the hope it can be fixed, but nothing helped significantly. And some guides suggested to update bios or install older drivers. Of course i wouldn't go so far and put my self into such trouble for this game. I managed to complete it, by giving my save files to a friend of mine with nvidia so he could pass the point where my game was unplayable.Anyway, despite the terrible optimization, the game is okay, has okay graphics, it's a bit slow with the dialogs. Wouldn't spend money on it though, maybe when it is -85% off. If you have money and nvidia, take it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE WITH AMD GRAPHICS CARD DRIVERS!!! Crashes in Chapter 2+ completely impeding progress! if you're not using an AMD GPU you may be fine? I am not able to test this. Buy at your own risk!---My actual Review---This game is fun. I have enjoyed the 6 or so hours I've played of this game tremendously. Running around, looking forevery secret is right up my alley.Combat is a little strange because there's almost no indication of you taking damage other than your healthbar decreasing sometimes. Other than that one quirk, this is a solid game, and I'd rate it a 4/5.The driver conflictions with newer AMD drivers than old 2012 drivers, however, make this game completely unplayable. I have crashed once in the boss room in chapter 1 and 5 times in the Barrow-Downs in the beginning of Chapter 2. It's completely unplayable.If you're using an AMD GPU Don't even bother buying the game. It simply isn't worth the hassle of downgrading and upgrading every time you wanna play the game.Unfortunately, due to this critical flaw, the game is a 0/5 for me as it's unplayable. Such a shame.

												The game feels as if they're just using the IP of Middle-earth for the sake of it (much like Shadow of Mordor). It's as generic as it comes for a game. It might as well have been a Dragon Age game and nobody would notice a difference.The gameplay itself gets fairly repetitive. You take control of one of three characters and do the same thing over and over until the level is finished. You level up as you progress and get better gear (though it feels like they've taken a generic RPG element and just thrown it in). But the other two characters you don't play as also level up alongside you. So eventually they're completely outmatched by the enemies and you need to gear them up. This requires you to actually log out and log back in as the new character... you can't just switch between them or gear them from one character.There is also a part where the game just decides to ramp up the difficulty for no reason. It's a random spike of difficulty out of nowhere. You have to protect a gate from two trolls, who can take it out in about 15 - 20 seconds. Problem is, they just ignore you and run right past you, even when you're stabbing at them. I had to wait until the game glitched and the trolls froze on the spot before I could beat it, because the DPS you'd need to take them out before they reach the door only a few feet away is way beyond what you'd be expected to have by that point.There is no way to save manually, so sometimes you'll waste a lot of time fighting a load of enemies, want to save but you can't until the end of that section, which could be anywhere, you don't know. And if the game crashes (more on that further down), you've wasted all of your time.AI is pretty stupid. If you get taken out, you get a chance for your teammates to help you back up. But half of the enemies interrupt them before they can get you up fully, so you have to wait. Instead of them killing the enemy then trying again, they just keep going in a loop of try to help, get interrupted, try to help, get interrupted, and then eventually die. Sometimes they'll just run into the enemies that killed you, get trapped in them and just keep trying to run at you with no success.But the reason it gets a solid 'no' recommendation is just because of all of the graphical problems. Some levels (like the Barrow-downs) are so glitchy that the game will crash all the time. My own PC is high-end and takes punishment from any other game without issue, it just puts out some heat. But even on the lowest settings, this game creates graphical glitches (weird glowing and static-looking graphical elements) or just crashes to desktop. It's not the sort of thing you expect from a game.Overall, a buggy game that feels like it's just been given a LotR coat of paint and brings nothing to the table that other games of the same type don't do already. A cash-grab that relies on Middle-earth fans (who, ironically, will cringe at the lore-breaking elements, like American accents, a dragon, and constant use of eagles).Edit: I recently just found this in my ""Unfinished"" section. After loading it up, I remember why. I'm currently stuck in a part called ""Carn Dum"". It's basically a load of blood-filled sewers. However, the game is not coded well enough to run properly. It crashes every single time you try to just walk through the game. That's all. Just walking will crash it. It can even crash your entire PC, not just the graphics driver, so watch out when playing this game. It's a damn liberty.Steer clear of this mess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game is full of bugs and i haven't been able to finish it without at least 10 crashes and occasional gameplay bugs in each playthrough. Finished the game four times, just for the info. Crashes should be less frequent with nVidia GPUs but they're still nonetheless. I mysef have experienced somewhat horrible experience on different AMD GPUs, especially in the last level, the Carn Dum fortress.The game itself is a fine coop rpg, and hadn't it been for all the crashing, i would have had recommended it. Had some fun playing with a friend, until it started crashing for him (with nVidia GPU) in the Barrow Downs. Shame on you, Snowblind.			",57,5,3,14,11,0,22

												Do not buy this game. It crashes constantly for a lot of people including myself. Once you get to the second chapter you start to see odd glitchy visuals then crashes. It happens every single time, right on time after Chapter 1. It crases randomly as well. The only real fix so far, is to go back to an older driver on your gpu. Like who wants to do that crap? Which means you can only play that one game until you're finished. Then you can upgrade back to normal. What a crock man. Awesome game that was poorly optimised and never patched. Yeah great Dev support there. Why does everything suck? Since I am past the idiotic 2-hour mark, I am stuck with this piece of trash. Sigh.			",133,5,2,7,3,1,1

												If your are playing this as a single player it might work, however if you are interested in playing this with a friend or two, abandon♥♥♥♥♥♥ Theres plenty of working co-op games out there and this is not one of them.Here is some of the problems you will face if you try to play this game in co-op:The game features its own voice chat function which works so poorly that you will not be able to understand a single word because of the bad sound quality. THERE IS ALSO NO WAY TO DISABLE IT. I had to download a virtual adio cable program just so I could actually chat with a friend using another program while playing.If you were lucky enough to get into another players game, buckle up for strange crashes, disconnects when visiting windows and a good spike in your blood pressure every time you try to give an item to your friend. It will most likely vanish into thin air. Getting used to the menus will take longer than I ever put into this game since they are made for a controller. There is mouse support but much of it is just nonsense.I will have to say that the game supports alt + f4 so escaping its horrors is quick and easy.			",319,68,7,37,42,1,44

												The ever-expanding Lord of the Rings franchise is one that I constantly find to be treading the treacherous line between gratuitousness and sincere narrative expansion. It remains my fantasy world of choice, and offers an incredibly rich setting in which to stage new adventures and exploits of novel characters. Developer Snowblind (known for RPGs Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest, among others) brought us War in the North, following a previously unseen band of heroes concurrent with the events of the Fellowship, much in the same vein as EA’s The Third Age back in 2004.Tolkien's vision was of such wide scope that I have absolutely zero problem with this premise, and could happily see it repeated time and time again. In my opinion the source material allows for a massive degree of expansion, which some games have captured extremely well. War in the North, however, is not one of them.It’s a hack-and-slash action-RPG wherein you control your choice of an Elf mage, a heavy-handed dwarf with an axe, or the quintessentially rugged Ranger. You are tasked with dealing with Sauron’s forces in the North of Middle Earth, preventing his self-proclaimed right-hand man Agandaur from gaining influence while the Fellowship proceeds south. You’ll bump into familiar faces along the way, gaining experience from fallen enemies to acquire new combat skills and purchasing more powerful gear, which can also be found in chests scattered around levels.Progression is simple through the segmented areas, and NPCs offer sidequests should you speak to them in each hub area, usually with the promise of a small reward.As I said, there’s more than enough imagination to go around, but I hate to see the wonder I had instilled in me through reading about Middle Earth abused to shoehorn subpar titles into the marketplace, it really gets to me on a personal level. All the licensed characters are here, Frodo, Gandalf, everyone you’d want to see, but the Lord of the Rings experience feels entirely lacking. The great strength of that mythos is the magnificence of the world; Tolkien's description was so vivid in his attempts to express the beauty and wild danger of the land.Unfortunately very little of this feeling is captured in War in the North - textures and colours are dull and flat even at maxed settings. Furthermore, the lack of detail was apparent to the point where I was having difficulty distinguishing 1080p from 720p resolution, something that is usually night and day in other titles. There was little variation models and level design is utterly uninspired, even over the range of environments that are present. Getting through the game simply consists of ‘kill a load of things, collect loot, kill a load more things, collect loot’, with little in the way of variety in enemy design or challenge.Furthermore, there is very little use of licensed music which was always one of the strengths of Peter Jackson’s cinematic imagining. Instead the score is bland and repetitive, not distinctly bad by any means but certainly unremarkable. On the note of sound, many elements of the game’s story are told through cutscenes; while they are rendered in-game using your character’s specific gear sets which is something I actively like to see, the voice acting is just embarrassing on the whole, with the main cast sounding bored and uninterested. It’s a shame too because the eagle that comes to accompany you on your adventure was cast exceptionally well, being portrayed by the talented John Patrick Lowrie, whom you may have heard as The Sniper in Team Fortress 2, among other roles. Unfortunately the supporting characters generally do not share this fate - Elrond, Bilbo, Gandalf, all of them sound dull, sadly.All that being said, there are a few features that salvage War in the North from the maw of worthlessness. For all the combat was highly repetitive, it was extremely fluid for the most part, and I enjoyed the fast pacing awarded by ‘Heroic Mode’. Essentially chaining blows without receiving damage increases your capability to deal it, which acts a preventative measure for simply mashing buttons, instead encouraging dodging and well-timed interrupts.I also liked the item system - drops from enemies and chests are entirely random, meaning that coming across a rare piece of loot gives a feeling of genuine excitement. Themed armour sets can be collected, and suitable gear elements can be adorned with elfstones to provide additional stat bonuses should you need them. Herbs and other flora can be collected around the game world and combined through a limited crafting system to produce potions and items to aid you in battle, often providing powerful abilities such as enhanced strength for a short period of time.Unfortunately trying to produce an appealing Lord of the Rings game at this point is playing with fire, and I think Snowblind got singed. I do believe War in the North to be arguably adequate as an RPG in its own right, but it falls short of the admittedly very high standard that we have come to expect given the size of the fandom. Pick it up if you want a fast-paced RPG to have fun with, but be aware that no new ground is being broken, and for a Tolkein-esque narrative you’ll definitely want to look elsewhere.

												If your are playing this as a single player it might work, however if you are interested in playing this with a friend or two, abandon♥♥♥♥♥♥ Theres plenty of working co-op games out there and this is not one of them.Here is some of the problems you will face if you try to play this game in co-op:The game features its own voice chat function which works so poorly that you will not be able to understand a single word because of the bad sound quality. THERE IS ALSO NO WAY TO DISABLE IT. I had to download a virtual adio cable program just so I could actually chat with a friend using another program while playing.If you were lucky enough to get into another players game, buckle up for strange crashes, disconnects when visiting windows and a good spike in your blood pressure every time you try to give an item to your friend. It will most likely vanish into thin air. Getting used to the menus will take longer than I ever put into this game since they are made for a controller. There is mouse support but much of it is just nonsense.I will have to say that the game supports alt + f4 so escaping its horrors is quick and easy.			",319,68,7,37,42,1,44

												This game uses steam's built in voice chat system to create a poor quality call between you and the people you are attempting to play co-op with. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if you had any way to disable or mute this call and use higher quality software, but no were is this possible. The only way me and my friends found to diable the in game voice chat was to install an external program and trick steam into using it as a recording device. This resulted in several in game glitches such as one were a voice would repeatedly say the phrase ""Trial"" every 10 to 15 seconds. We propably spent an hour trying to get this game set up to play co-op and because of that it cannot receive a recomendation. I also feel as if more people need to be aware of this issue before they go to purchase the game.			",91,9,1,17,9,0,16

												While this game eyes great, it does have a lot of potential. However, various things deny that potential. 5 second knockdowns, your companions blocking your way, no flinching upon being hit resulting in just dropping dead, litte logic within the story line and to much a linear way to play.Also, having to choose a single class and the game forcing you to play that class till the end of the game, since all the fancy equipment you gave to your AI companions will be gone when you select them. Making sure that once you change, you've got no way to match the equipment to that level, unless you buy yourself the equipment, which is only possible after  you've reached Rivendell. All in all, if the devs payed some more time upon developing the game, it would've been recommendable and enjoyable. Now it's just a frustrating experience I must add. So, if you're looking for a decent Lord of the Rings slasher, I'd suggest playing the games made 10 years ago, or the somewhat newer Middle Earth: Shadows of Mordor.			",130,24,8,17,11,0,11

												Finally I found out what ended the battle for Middle-earth. General with the movie/book is small, but the principles are the same. We play for the 3 characters: archer, dwarf and mage. Not very convenient that you can not switch between them during the game, but a year the game makes itself felt.Very glad to meet some of the characters from the book, who did not even change the name.The game looks like a normal RPG world. Do not expect that it will surprise you greatly and will show you the amazing mechanics...If you like the world of Lord of the Rings or just like to run around with a sword and chop enemies, then this game is for you. I look forward to any official reissues with the current mechanics and graphics.			",244,47,19,19,28,4,15

												There don't seem to be many detailed reviews, so I will try to write one for everyone. Though I feel it is going to get thumbs downed a lot because I am not a die-hard LOTR fan and I don't kiss the franchises♥♥♥♥♥The ReviewIts a good game, but I thought there would be a lot more to it. The ending and the entire story really feels irrelavent to the actual story.I was also expecting the story to be much much longer, seeing as how it would play in the timeline of the 3 movies, but instead the game didn't take long to beat at all, or at least not as long as I had expected.This game took me 11 hours to beat, and about 8 hours of that is gameplay, while the other 3 hours is storyline.Seeing as how you meet the fellowship before they depart, I thought you would be a group that played a part in the movie, but were more in the background, sort of like you had a part in the story that the books and the movie didn't show. The in-game map shows all of the locations of the LOTR, Helms Deep, Mordor, The Shire, etc.I thought we'd take part in the battle at Helms Deep, that maybe we would fight some Orcs/Goblins that had followed Frodo and Sam, without their knowledge, as they were about to destroy the ring. I thought we would be able to explore places like the Shire and some of the other major places in LOTR. But instead, you go everywhere EXCEPT those places.By the end, I feel like the War in the North and all of what is done in this game is irrelavent. Like it played no part in the main story, like it added nothing important to it. You have this ""right hand"" of Saruan, Leader, but I'd think that if he was that important, powerful, and in charge, he would've been mentioned in the movies or books, so adding this enemy seemed pointless.Overall Cons- The gameplay is quite annoying, feeling clunky and based on button mashing.- You can tell the game was built on the purpose of co-op. seeing as how everytime you switch characters, your previous characters gear is changed to a default kind of gear, so you cant set other characters gear unless you are playing as them.You also cannot switch characters as you please, you can only switch between chapters, so you may as well stick to 1 character throughout your entire solo playthrough.- The Orcs all feel the same, like a bunch of brutes, and all take 7-10 hits to kill, EACH. Which makes it frusterating and boring when you're fighting large groups of orcs.- There is no build with any of the characters or their friendship. They are simply 3 travelers who decide to fight the war in the north. There is no character build, no relationship built by the 3, and all of their personalities are the SAME.* Remember how Legolas and Gimili had that funny relationship where they would have a contest of who would kill more orcs in a battle?* Remember how Legolas and Arigorn had a brotherly kind of relationship?* Remember how Arigorn and Gimili had that semi funny moment where Gimili asked Arigorn to toss him over to the bridge at Helms Deep, then said ""Don't tell the elf!""?* Remember when Gimili tried to jump across a bridge, that he thought he could make, while a demon was chasing them and when he jumped he almost fell, and Legolas grabbed him to save him and Gimili yelled ""not the beard!""?The point is, there was relationships built within the fellowship. Here, there is NONE! No relationship, no friendship build at all! You will end the game not caring at all about ANY of the charaters, except maybe the birds.I was looking for the dwarf to have that battle-thristy personality, the elf to have the wise personality, and the human to have the smart and careful personality. But instead, they all have the same, bland, boring, personality.- Your AI teammates can be quite annoying when they are struggling to revive you or your companion, or when the elf wont heal you when you're 1 hit away from death, or sometimes they will not follow because of 1 single enemy so when you run into another group you'll be left struggling while they sit back with their thumbs up their♥♥♥♥♥trying to kill this 1 single orc archer that they cant hit or kill and once you are down they will take forever to actually reach you since they are now the prime targets of the group of orcs that just murdered you dead.Pros- Its semi-fun to play. I played it solo, so its probably better with co-op.- Its cool getting to meet most of the fellowship before they leave onto their quest.- The leveling up system is pretty nice, like any other RPG game.- Has NG+ so when you start a new playthrough, you don't lose all your gear or your level(s).OverallMaybe my expectations were too high, maybe my standards were too high, but I am very bummed out about how this game turned out and how it ended and the time it took for me to beat it.I recommend to get this game while it is on sale. Maybe its because i'm not a die hard fan of LOTR and I am not an♥♥♥♥♥kisser to the franchise, but to me, this game is a MAJOR disappointment, and not worth $20. I bought it on sale, and I think its a good game if its worth $5 - $10. But this game is NOT all that it is made out to be. Its good, and I reccomend buying it when its on sale. At full price? No.Rating: 4/10 ",237,34,0,17,16,1,18

												This game is strangely addictive, mostly people I haven't played a TPRPG in a while and also because the game itself has satisfying combat.However with that said, I wouldn't recommend this game. There are so many bugs it's almost like playing a beta and the terrible optimization is causing certain high end pc's to tank and CTD. There are plenty of alternative TPRPG's out there including mmo's, so don't feel like you're missing out. In terms of lore not much is being offered and the story itself follows the cliché Human-Elf-Dwarf combo fighting to save middle earth during frodo's quest from one of Sauron's minions. Think of the films but this is something off too the side that's happening behind the curtains.			",165,29,10,24,10,0,23

												What can I say.... this game is just mediocre. No seriously, like after the whole OMG its Aragon! OMG I can cut orks heads off and OMG most of the fellowship in rivendale, it just dies down to repetitive game and a character progression reminescent of skill trees of the old but half the size, yea no wonder it is just eh. Im not saying this game is bad and all but it is just not fun! I admit as a fan of the fantasy genre, I love Lord of the Rings, but this game is said to be a side, non-canon story, but it is still a good story none the less, and that is what pushed me to finish the game. It is a standard hack and slash affair, but in this case, the controls feel sluggish and sometimes irresponsive, and I can see this is just a console port to PC. Also it doesnt help that every mob apart from 2 out of the 6 archetypes there are, will knock you down and make you immobile for a good 5 secs, which you wait for your character to stumble around and get up. Like the only 3 moves those 2 do will constantly knock you down and they are the most common of enemies in this game! This game is definately not worth the amount it is asking for now, it is rentable at best from a video store for $1 or $2, whatever it is at your store, and the only reason why I got it on PC is cos it was in the Humble Bundle and I got it without a choice and I wanted FEAR. Also did I mention that your team mates are solid and if you played single player like I did, they would stand there and be in your way and not move until after 3 seconds of running into them. Yea..... 2/5!P.S. Coop is dead on PC!			",250,40,8,40,15,4,23

												QUICK A QUESTION:Do you like Lord of the Rings? THEN STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME.Dear god, I can't even begin to imagine what these guys were thinking ""Let's make a Lord of the Rings game, make a somewhat interesting side story with a lot of potential, and then, when we include characters from the movies, let's just NOT add any of the original voice actors! Brilliant! We're bound to be GOTY already!""And the premise is good, it's basically LotR 9/11 and LotR Return of the Electric Boogaloo in terms of gameplay, but you're given three new characters with which to deal with, all of whom are as interesting as watching paint dry. The characters old and new are interacted with in a Mass Effect stylized conversation wheel, however, any and all choices you take don't cause any specific outcome, in fact, they make the game even worse. I don't know what it is about this game, but I imagine the voice actors were high as a kite when they did this gig, because they all have a rather monotonous demeanor to them, like they've just taken 10 second sleeping pills, and each second is slowly bringing them deeper into the realm of sleep and are trying to at least finish the conversation with you. The characters you can choose from are ""Discount Gimli"" Axe, Dwarf, same type of gurgled talking that sounds like the beard is to blame for his gargled speech. Then you have ""Discount Aragorn"" he has the exact same stance when it comes to fighting with a great sword, same footing and everything and for some reason, he seems to insist slowly looking more and more like aragorn slowly through the evolution of his armor. Finally, we have ""Original character script 003921609"" if you take a character editor, and click random, this is what you get, she's just as bland as her two companions, but just so happens to be the most useful, since she can create a sanctuary which protects from arrows, and heals.The game has a certain feeling of Mass Effect to it, except the cover system was taken out, and a medieval weapon system was added, the characters feel heavier just like in Mass Effect. Your choices, if there are any last I remember, have no impact, conversations are struck up for a two minute conversation so you can find out how Gimli is feeling about the whole situation or if Galadriel just so happens to be on her rag (if only that were an actual question, I would give this game a full ten out of ten truth be told) But instead, you're given lack luster questions to which you can respond in three different and sometimes two different manners, this has no outcome at all and is pretty much useless to even bother responding, you have more repercussions when you go to the doctor about a toy car up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Rest in Peace Ryan, that still makes me laugh to this day) Honestly, the best part is the ending, because you're done, it's over, you get to stop playing, unless you're out for the achievements, in which case my sympathies. Don't get me wrong, this game is pretty fun when you have two other people to share the pain with, because misery loves company, but, alone, it's blank horror mixed with having to take breaks from feeling sick.

												This game is a complete technical mess. For one it forces Steams' VOIP with no option to turn it off, and exaggeratingly adds enviromental audio for caves and caverns and such, which makes everything sound jagged and awful. It also crashes alot, and the save system for co-op is awful to the point where we couldn't continue our playthrough in chapter 3. The technical side aside, the combat system is basic but somewhat fun, the inventory system is really bad and screams console game. The voice overs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful and cringy. I can't see myself playing this singleplayer and only when really drunk would consider co-op fun.In short, this game does NOT deserve a ""very positive"" overall rating.

You have this ""right hand"" of Saruan, Leader, but I'd think that if he was that important, powerful, and in charge, he would've been mentioned in the movies or books, so adding this enemy seemed pointless.Overall Cons- The gameplay is quite annoying, feeling clunky and based on button mashing.- You can tell the game was built on the purpose of co-op. seeing as how everytime you switch characters, your previous characters gear is changed to a default kind of gear, so you cant set other characters gear unless you are playing as them.You also cannot switch characters as you please, you can only switch between chapters, so you may as well stick to 1 character throughout your entire solo playthrough.- The Orcs all feel the same, like a bunch of brutes, and all take 7-10 hits to kill, EACH. Which makes it frusterating and boring when you're fighting large groups of orcs.- There is no build with any of the characters or their friendship. They are simply 3 travelers who decide to fight the war in the north. There is no character build, no relationship built by the 3, and all of their personalities are the SAME.* Remember how Legolas and Gimili had that funny relationship where they would have a contest of who would kill more orcs in a battle?* Remember how Legolas and Arigorn had a brotherly kind of relationship?* Remember how Arigorn and Gimili had that semi funny moment where Gimili asked Arigorn to toss him over to the bridge at Helms Deep, then said ""Don't tell the elf!""?* Remember when Gimili tried to jump across a bridge, that he thought he could make, while a demon was chasing them and when he jumped he almost fell, and Legolas grabbed him to save him and Gimili yelled ""not the beard!""?The point is, there was relationships built within the fellowship. Here, there is NONE! No relationship, no friendship build at all! You will end the game not caring at all about ANY of the charaters, except maybe the birds.I was looking for the dwarf to have that battle-thristy personality, the elf to have the wise personality, and the human to have the smart and careful personality. But instead, they all have the same, bland, boring, personality.- Your AI teammates can be quite annoying when they are struggling to revive you or your companion, or when the elf wont heal you when you're 1 hit away from death, or sometimes they will not follow because of 1 single enemy so when you run into another group you'll be left struggling while they sit back with their thumbs up their♥♥♥♥♥trying to kill this 1 single orc archer that they cant hit or kill and once you are down they will take forever to actually reach you since they are now the prime targets of the group of orcs that just murdered you dead.Pros- Its semi-fun to play. I played it solo, so its probably better with co-op.- Its cool getting to meet most of the fellowship before they leave onto their quest.- The leveling up system is pretty nice, like any other RPG game.- Has NG+ so when you start a new playthrough, you don't lose all your gear or your level(s).OverallMaybe my expectations were too high, maybe my standards were too high, but I am very bummed out about how this game turned out and how it ended and the time it took for me to beat it.I recommend to get this game while it is on sale. Maybe its because i'm not a die hard fan of LOTR and I am not an♥♥♥♥♥kisser to the franchise, but to me, this game is a MAJOR disappointment, and not worth $20. I bought it on sale, and I think its a good game if its worth $5 - $10. But this game is NOT all that it is made out to be. Its good, and I reccomend buying it when its on sale. At full price? No.Rating: 4/10 ",237,34,0,17,16,1,18

												When I bought the game Lord of the rings: war in the north I thought it would be a more background story about what happened in the north mention by Gandalf in the film. If the armies in the north were not stopped, there would be no victory. Unfortunately, I will never find out what happened by playing the game because every time after a save my game crashes. It can happen that a game crashes but after every save is too much for me. I want to play but the game does not allow me. So I dont recommend it. ",8,0,0,3,3,0,1

Music is still going and your like ""hmm well there's still beer and stuff to enjoy and people to talk to, but I don't know these people and the fun might not last that long. Seems that the party animals have allready passed out drunk. I could go home and just watch netflix and get wasted with my roommate or stay here and have some mild fun with the people who aren't passed out."" There ya go. I felt like this was a game I had to of enjoyed much earlier, not saying you can't have fun, but probably not as much fun if you bought it in 2011 on release. The price for this isn't bad at all. So if you got Birthday money/Christmas money/or just plain got 20 bucks to blow, go for it. I, personaly, did not have the fantastic experience that I was told by everyone you would have.

												You can consider yourself lucky if your game hasn't crashed while in-game without a recent save.The game(play) itself is good, the combat is enjoyable and satisfying. But with the bugs and crashes, this game is a dislike from me.The crashes happen at random times, and it's annoying if you haven't recently saved the game, as you'll have to repeat again to the spot where you was when it crashed. When you go down, both AI try and help you, therefor drawing the attention of enemies to the reviver, and getting knocked down while being revived. Terrible AI, they cannot navigate very well.I'm on a low-end video card (Radeon R7 240 2GB) and I can run this on Max settings, including Motion Blur, etc at 1600x1200 with decent fps. The mouse movement is terrible, it's jaggy and I can't spin/turn fast without getting confused.It can get repetitive, but at times you forget it's getting repetitive and continue.Gameplay 7.2/10Stability (Bugs & Crashes) 3/10AI 4/10			",55,2,0,5,3,0,5

												Epically disappointing. The multi player just froze and if you play single player, it DOES NOT allow you to switch your three characters in play, or save any skills points. So you have one character who is strong and the others are weak, which ends up putting you no position to kill the first orc....ahhhh facepalm. If I was the designer of this game, I would hide under a rock, what a rip off.			",9,8,0,0,0,0,0

												This game isn't the greatest, the story is Ok i guess and the gameplay is kinda fun. The problem with the game is that it is SO buggy. On some of the last levels i ran with around 3 FPS compared to my 40 FPS in the rest of the game. Some boss fights can bug out and it is very game breaking.Overall i would say if you really like these type of hack'n'slash games enjoy but don't expect a master piece.			",367,110,5,58,39,3,37

												Starts off nice and hack and slash, doesn't give you much variation in attack styles. Whichever character you pick you're still left either at the mercy of your cohorts to revive you or trying to revive them which during battle soon gets old. I've only had this on the drive for a couple of hours and already contemplating removing it. The difficulty is far too steep and there is no incentive to keep trying once you've started to shout expletives at the game. Shame because the graphics aren't bad who doesn't like the LOTR characters and world, if only they'd belended this one with Shadow of Mordor (which in my opinion lacked a variation in enemies despite being fun to play).

												This game is bad.Don't get me wrong, it's actually really fun to play. However, the game is clunky, looks terrible, voice acting is bad, and the story is so boring and forgettable that I don't even remember what my characters name is, so I just call him Gimli. Combat is surprisingly satisfying, and although this game gives me literal cancer, I had a good time playing it with my buddy. If you pay 10 bucks or less for it, I'd say you got your monies worth.Otherwise... well you might be a bit upset.			",60,1,3,15,6,1,2

Pros: Good story Fun Combat Decent aesthetic appealCons: Broken multiplayer Mediocre leveling system Very Linear Why I cannot recommend this game:My friend and I purchased this game to play together, it was a fun experience for about 30 minutes before he was booted from the game for seemingly no reason. He was able to rejoin soon after, but about ten minutes later it happened again. This time the game said he was unable to play with me any longer as I had progressed in the multiplayer too far, though I had only remained in the game an additional 2-3 minutes. He caught himself up to where I was on his own, but the game still did not allow us to play together anyway.			",105,30,1,10,6,1,7

												This game is pretty fun but it is crippled by a very stupid flaw - if you want to play coop and talk with VOIP you will find that you cannot use Skype or any other external chat program because this game uses Steams VOIP and you CANNOT TURN IT OFF. This causes so many problems and there is no quick easy fix for this. All I wanted to do is play this game coop with a friend and chat on skype like we do with dozens of other games. But because of the way this game uses steams VOIP which you cannot turn off it makes that impossible. So we just gave up on this game which is a shame because it looks pretty fun.

												Was pretty fun to play for one night, but not sure I'll come back to it. Nice visuals and combat moves. Fun simple combat and tag team system. Probably would be more fun as multiplayer. Levels became a bit repetitive with not much regard to plot progression (Oh here's another board with exploding goblins running in and I have to shoot them off with this giant crossbow). Everything was fairly linear. Inventory item building, repair and trading seemed needlessly complex and sort of there just to appeal to the Diablo fans.			",189,83,1,16,18,1,39

												There are times you want to play dungeon crawlers and you look to the online where you will rack and stack yourself at end game with specific builds, items, and do your research and reading.  There are other times you want the simple joy of killing a lot of creatures in a nicely themed area, with a mild bit of challenge, gear and leveling that is easily managed, and played with a friend or two.  This is a wonderful dungeon crawler to unwind to, and the kills are quite visceral (that awesome level of physics and gore that'd you'd expect when a goblin meets an axe wielded by a dwarf in combat).

												This game is hilarious with friends. On its own its awful becuase of the glitches and absurdness of the rest of the game that makes multiplayer good. But with 2 friends its extremely funny and is definetly worth it.			",76,25,0,11,9,0,12

												There are times you want to play dungeon crawlers and you look to the online where you will rack and stack yourself at end game with specific builds, items, and do your research and reading.  There are other times you want the simple joy of killing a lot of creatures in a nicely themed area, with a mild bit of challenge, gear and leveling that is easily managed, and played with a friend or two.  This is a wonderful dungeon crawler to unwind to, and the kills are quite visceral (that awesome level of physics and gore that'd you'd expect when a goblin meets an axe wielded by a dwarf in combat).

Posted: September 9, 2013
												Lord of The Rings War in the North is surprisingly a very competent game. It cannot compete with the AAA titles with hand to hand combat and fantasy element, but it is good enough to be worth at least one play through. From the start it is evident that the developers put great effort into the game to make the environment shine with detail and realism. I was surprised to see such quality of level detail, despite the levels and gameplay being linear. The character models and armor are very detailed as well. Every time you put newer more advanced pieces of armor it reflects on the model of your chosen character. Be it helmets, arm guards, leggings, body armor. All of it. It is also very accurate as far as movie content. Human, Elven, and Dwarven armor and items are what you'd have seen in the Lord of The Rings movies. It is not surprising since the publisher of the game is WB.Positives written above do not come without the negatives. Nearly every level, no matter how spectacular in appearance, has plenty of invisible walls. These invisible barriers can be incredibly frustrating because often you'd find yoruself checking whether you can go in a particular path only to find that it is simply blocked by an invisible wall. As is the case with even the best games on the market, the level design becomes less impressive, and often shows plain lazyness as the player reaches the 2nd half of the game, and eventually the ending. Some areas start looking less detailed and more rushed. Invisible walls become bigger, lighting less consistent, etc. War in The North also has issues with inventory organization. You may eventually gather enough weapons or armor to fill all the alloted slots in the inventory. Some items can be old, other items too high for current level, and there is no way to organize them. Neither manually nor automatically. You cannot select an item and move it in the inventory. Player just ha sto move the cursor over the items to see the stats of each. Another rather inconvenient drawback is in the design of the game for those who want to play single player as opposed to 3 player coop. You have the option to ""give"" your excess items or items meant for other two classes to your CPU controlled teammates. This is a very poor design gaffe because CPU does not  always equip the item gifted to them, nor compensate the party for the item value. Once it is given to a teammate controlled by the CPU the item is as good as gone. This is not an issue if you play coop with 2 or three players. The other player actually gets the item and can use it. Similarly, when you play coop you can actually exchange items with each other to acquire complete sets of items meant to be worn together. They may be strangely acquired by your CPU partners, and when you switch characters between levels you may see the items that could complete your set on the other player you have picked to play as, but you are not able to either put it in any ""shared chest"" nor give to another player. Wasted opportunity.Combat is very satisfying and as the character levels up you have a wide choice of upgrades and moves and magic spells to pick from. The upgrade tree is very similar to that of Borderlands games in which you have three columns of skills which you invest points in to unlock the most powerful ones on the bottom. Once again, when you play single player you control your own player's upgrades, but the CPU manages them automatically and utilizes them in hit and miss fashion. Sometimes you'll see the Lore Master (Elf lady) use some of her very helpful spells often, other times you won't. Thankfully you can switch to another character midgame to experience their gameplay style. Whatever you upgrade them with and equipment you give them will be present again if you select them in the future, but not when CPU controls them.The plot and the story is ok. It is not very impressive, but should be interesting to any fan of Tolkien universe or the Peter Jackson movies. The events take place at the same time as the Lord of The Rings three books. You encounter some characters mentioned in the books, get to visit iconic locations such as Lorien and get to talk to most of the main characters of LOTR. The cutscenes are very well animated, most of the time. Some cutscenes are just cheap fill ins where characters just stand there. Characters are voiced by quality voice acting, but unfortunately the same voice actors are recylced for many characters which feels very cheap. The main antagonist of the story does not impress too much because not much of their background or motivations are reveled to the player.Thankfully and to benefit of those who just want to kill some orcs, goblins, urukhai, and whatever there is a survival mode available and at least 3 maps to play it on. You basically fight many waves of enemies. Pretty fun. After the main campaign is complete you are able to replay the game on Hero mode. This is actually pretty good because you can save up the ""Gifts"" that big characters give you upon completing their side quests. If you save the Gift for the Hero mode you will not get under powered items but instead get to choose a gift from high level items which goes all the way to level 40 or 50. Also replaying is fun if you play as one of other two characters. Each of them is fun to play because of pretty unique abilities and moves.			",486,97,9,67,43,1,99

												An hack & slash Action RPG set in Middle Earth that boasts a fun and visceral combat experience whilst also catering to loot collecting and gearing up that so many of us like. Bring a friend or battle the hordes of mordor online, as co-op makes this game truly shine at its best. Performance wise it can be abit iffy at times, but can certainly be looked past.Overall a great game that certainly will keep you occupied for a long time.			",222,24,3,36,11,0,8

												MOST UNFAIR REVIEW EVER!And the developper suffered from it. Sure there are ""better"" coop experience out there, but that's not a reason to give this game a mediocre review. >:( I hate that type of review approach. I played all the coop games, and I would have enjoy the hell out of this one if I hadn't trusted the reviews. My bad. But the game is great! It starts in a tavern! The combat system works so well you can really see and understand everything that is going on, hitting feels good and you don't want to get hit either so difficulty is well balanced. Bringing a Troll down is always satisfying. Characters looks good, graphics are veeeery polished (glittering snow and it just feels cold!) I found the cinematic storytelling much more polished and less awkward than Mass Effect and Skyrim combined. We were 3 friends playing in LAN and it was 8 hours straight, forget to eat style of gaming event. I wouldn't pay 59$ for it  but not it's a very high value product IMHO. Not astoundingly great but just so so good, hits the right points. The UI is fast and simple, you very rarely get overencumbered, interaction between players is a lot of fun, you can really support one another in the heat of the action. The backgrounds are often breath taking honnestly, we just sat there admiring the view while smoking a joint. There is a lot of meat on that bone so for us it became a coop classic. So the morale is having a tough competition doesn't necessarly make a game bad. Lesson learned.			",260,46,13,24,24,0,10

												Only fun with friends, but you can't do that either thanks to the plethera of d-sync bugs that completely make the game unplayable with friends and it seems impossible to avoid. Once your save files get screwed up, non-host players will get stuck in empty rooms and or endless boss battles that never terminate. Even on LAN the game can't hold out. Truelly disappointing on every level seems I was actually having quiet a bit of fun with this one for a while. I can't beleive steam still allows full triple A retail games to have these kinds of issues. Quality control is becoming a serious issue.			",110,8,0,13,7,0,1

												8/10 - Great game, which I sadly cant compare to any LotR games, because this was my first. The storyline is interesting on its own and even more when you think about what is hapenning in the rest of the world (LotR trilogy storyline). The gameplay is fun and unlocked skill can make it even little variable. Combat wont change much since the start, but that isnt for bad. The only things which really *** experience are bugs. Can't speak for the singleplayer, but some parts of campaign in multiplayer can with constant disconnecting discourage players from finishing the rest of the game.			",373,81,13,49,33,5,64

												Don't buy it, it's really bad game. With only few types of enemies, each one similar to nother, with bad pace, poorly hit points systems (you must hit an enemy like 5 times before you are able to do  critical hit, but he hits you and if you dodge - you loose streak, if you parry - you lose streak, if you get hit - you know). Most enemies knock you prone - like 5 seconds out of game waiting to get up. A single troll (there are fights with three of them at once) can defeat a party simply by knocking them and never letting them get up. That's not fair.There are two things good bout this game: the setting (North of Middle Earth) and Rangers of the North (I like them, they are nice:) ).			",121,38,5,39,22,1,49

												The game itself is really fun, especially in co-op, but... The fact that getting through chapter 8 is an IMPOSSIBILITY, because the game (in a best-case-scenario) crashes, or (worst case) locks up ypur computer and crashes windows.A possible workaround (for AMD cards using 12.6 drivers) is possible, but any semi-recent card won´t support this driver fully, and it will most definately make all your other daily work/play suffer. I´ve also read that playing in windowed mode could help, but made no difference for me.Rollig back your VGA drivers for one game to work is not a solution.With that in mind this game gets an 0/10, a horrible example. Shame on you Snowblind studios.Don´t touch this game, even with a 10"" pole. And if you do, make sure this game gets the poopiest end of said stick.(edited out profanity)			",269,32,8,16,8,2,22

												  Where to start with this one? firstly it is worth mentioning I played through middle earth: shadow of mordor before playing this so I understood I would be taking a step back.    Turret sessions were somewhat fun with hordes of enemies charging you however there is a quite a few problems which would keep me from buying this game again.   First issue is the revive system, in theory its a pretty good system and the female elf wizard character does this very well when controlled by the pc however the dwarf is just useless, his only purpose is to be a damage sponge and even then he fails at that at constantly needing revived.  Trying to keep the rest revived is a pain and I would love to just let the dwarf die because his only function on some levels is to crouch and walk into a wall while I struggle to fight off enemies and revive the usefull member of the team.   Controls some time do not work in combat and even though a skill is ready to deploy it will not even though I'm mashing on the button for it.   The characters are all there but not the greatest representation of them and in combat the frusteration continues.   As in, why does a kick from an orc deal the same damage as a 9 foot tall boss bringing down his sword on you?   Combat usually is pethedic even compared to other hack and slash at the time and definitely of today.			",693,211,33,86,77,5,126

												This game is the best worst game that you have ever played in your life. It drags on and on and on. Which is normal for Lord of the Rings.

												It has some issues with online connectivity, has an always on voice chat in multiplayer, is a bit buggy, has some issues with getting the proper resolution and over all it is a less than perfect port. However, if you can see past these issues it is a very enjoyable and easy to pick up action RPG that should satisfy fans of the Lord of the Rings and/or action games. It is somewhat reminiscient of the classic ""Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"" LOTR movie tie-in games of the GameCube era, however it is significantly different in some respects (the player now has full control over the camera and there are now town areas like Bree in which players can buy and sell items and get repairs). The game is set up to work with an Xbox 360 controller with no configuration needed, so I recommend you use one for the optimal experience.			",368,58,12,37,26,2,38

												Definitely worth a try.I think the expectations have doomed War in the North. Since it's Lord of the Rings title, players and Middle-Earth fans alike anticipated something grand, a game that will finally maximize the potential of LotR in a video game. It didn't happen to the extent everyone expected. Yet it doesn't mean War in the North is an inferior product. Far from it.  You play as one of three available characters - a Ranger, Dwarven fighter and Elven mage. Each have three main skills at their disposal and a handful of minor ones. Even though the trio is a bit bland, they are likeable. The story runs simultanously to the Frodo's quest, which is a nice touch - your actions feel relevant as your party contribute to the greater cause.The gameplay features a lot of hacking, slashing, shooting and looting. You face the horde of goblins, orcs and trolls under the command of one evil Agandaur, who is neatly tailored as a villan. War in the North offers an abundance of loot - here I would like to mention that the equipment in this game is superbly designed. The details on weapons and armor are fantastic, the overall feel of the equipment you find or buy fits the world perfectly, which is a nod to the coherent Tolkien universe and at the same time a welcome break from all the overdone, tasteless and improper design in most of the modern RPGs (a sexy female warrior with armor covering only her breast and groin area? Yes, practical indeed). On your travels you will visit locations and meet characters well-known from the books and movies (Ian McKellen voices Gandalf).The game's length is reasonable, around 10 hours for a playthrough, and the replay value is here. War in the North is best enjoyed while playing with your frineds in a co-op mode. It's essantially the same campaign as the single player, but obviously more challanging as the opponents grow in strength with each additional player. Recommended. I approached War in the North without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality - it's not one of the best games you will ever play, but it's certainly enjoyable.

												Was pretty fun to play for one night, but not sure I'll come back to it. Nice visuals and combat moves. Fun simple combat and tag team system. Probably would be more fun as multiplayer. Levels became a bit repetitive with not much regard to plot progression (Oh here's another board with exploding goblins running in and I have to shoot them off with this giant crossbow). Everything was fairly linear. Inventory item building, repair and trading seemed needlessly complex and sort of there just to appeal to the Diablo fans.			",189,83,1,16,18,1,39

												There are times you want to play dungeon crawlers and you look to the online where you will rack and stack yourself at end game with specific builds, items, and do your research and reading.  There are other times you want the simple joy of killing a lot of creatures in a nicely themed area, with a mild bit of challenge, gear and leveling that is easily managed, and played with a friend or two.  This is a wonderful dungeon crawler to unwind to, and the kills are quite visceral (that awesome level of physics and gore that'd you'd expect when a goblin meets an axe wielded by a dwarf in combat).

												I knew it won't be good, i didn't expect much, but this game isn't just bad, it's so f....n stupid. It's not even a LoTR game. In the town a dwarf sells the shovels (What you can't buy, because you don't need it), and a hobbit sells the weapons and armors? What the hell? The human character is the archer, the elven is a .. mage?? huh? There is no logic in this. I hope WBs next LoTR game will be much better.			",505,96,16,42,31,5,75

												An hack & slash Action RPG set in Middle Earth that boasts a fun and visceral combat experience whilst also catering to loot collecting and gearing up that so many of us like. Bring a friend or battle the hordes of mordor online, as co-op makes this game truly shine at its best. Performance wise it can be abit iffy at times, but can certainly be looked past.Overall a great game that certainly will keep you occupied for a long time.			",222,24,3,36,11,0,8

												MOST UNFAIR REVIEW EVER!And the developper suffered from it. Sure there are ""better"" coop experience out there, but that's not a reason to give this game a mediocre review. >:( I hate that type of review approach. I played all the coop games, and I would have enjoy the hell out of this one if I hadn't trusted the reviews. My bad. But the game is great! It starts in a tavern! The combat system works so well you can really see and understand everything that is going on, hitting feels good and you don't want to get hit either so difficulty is well balanced. Bringing a Troll down is always satisfying. Characters looks good, graphics are veeeery polished (glittering snow and it just feels cold!) I found the cinematic storytelling much more polished and less awkward than Mass Effect and Skyrim combined. We were 3 friends playing in LAN and it was 8 hours straight, forget to eat style of gaming event. I wouldn't pay 59$ for it  but not it's a very high value product IMHO. Not astoundingly great but just so so good, hits the right points. The UI is fast and simple, you very rarely get overencumbered, interaction between players is a lot of fun, you can really support one another in the heat of the action. The backgrounds are often breath taking honnestly, we just sat there admiring the view while smoking a joint. There is a lot of meat on that bone so for us it became a coop classic. So the morale is having a tough competition doesn't necessarly make a game bad. Lesson learned.			",260,46,13,24,24,0,10

												This game proves that a game can be so remarkably there as a video game with nothing noteable for or against it. So completely mediocre in every single way that it becomes soul crushingly bad.

												Definitely worth a try.I think the expectations have doomed War in the North. Since it's Lord of the Rings title, players and Middle-Earth fans alike anticipated something grand, a game that will finally maximize the potential of LotR in a video game. It didn't happen to the extent everyone expected. Yet it doesn't mean War in the North is an inferior product. Far from it.  You play as one of three available characters - a Ranger, Dwarven fighter and Elven mage. Each have three main skills at their disposal and a handful of minor ones. Even though the trio is a bit bland, they are likeable. The story runs simultanously to the Frodo's quest, which is a nice touch - your actions feel relevant as your party contribute to the greater cause.The gameplay features a lot of hacking, slashing, shooting and looting. You face the horde of goblins, orcs and trolls under the command of one evil Agandaur, who is neatly tailored as a villan. War in the North offers an abundance of loot - here I would like to mention that the equipment in this game is superbly designed. The details on weapons and armor are fantastic, the overall feel of the equipment you find or buy fits the world perfectly, which is a nod to the coherent Tolkien universe and at the same time a welcome break from all the overdone, tasteless and improper design in most of the modern RPGs (a sexy female warrior with armor covering only her breast and groin area? Yes, practical indeed). On your travels you will visit locations and meet characters well-known from the books and movies (Ian McKellen voices Gandalf).The game's length is reasonable, around 10 hours for a playthrough, and the replay value is here. War in the North is best enjoyed while playing with your frineds in a co-op mode. It's essantially the same campaign as the single player, but obviously more challanging as the opponents grow in strength with each additional player. Recommended. I approached War in the North without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality - it's not one of the best games you will ever play, but it's certainly enjoyable.

Posted: August 22, 2014
												Experience has usually left me very cautious whenever I see a licensed videogame, particularly when it’s tied in to a film franchise. It seems that virtually every blockbuster in the past 20 years has had an awful accompanying game aimed at cashing in on the hype surrounding the name. I’ve usually felt differently about the Lord of the Rings games because they’ve been pretty good (the tie-ins on the original Xbox were actually pretty great) so I approached this one with rather less cynicism than I’d usually reserve.It’s immediately obvious that this isn’t a high quality, high budget title. The cast impersonators are the first clue and every member of the original cast that appears in the game has an actor that sounds not-quite like what we’re used to hearing. The crude visuals, basic soundtrack and the sense that they’ve hired one voice actor to cover every other NPC were a little disappointing, though not enough to be off-putting.So, yet another 3rd person hack ‘n’ slash, this one with the most basic of plots; “that guy is Sauron’s mate, let’s kill him”. Obviously, being a mate of Sauron he’s quite powerful and has many orcs between him and your party, so you’ve got to kill them off first. The plot is as simple as that. On the way you encounter some of the characters shown in the films, as well as some only mentioned in the books, (minor spoilers, though it’s not like the story here is that important!)  such as Gwaihir, Elladan and Elrohir, Radagast the Brown and Halbarad the Ranger.Levels are very simple, with three or four stages to each level and a peaceful base every few levels where you can return to repair, buy and sell items and turn in quests at occasional checkpoints. You won’t spend very long there though; the main part of the game is either chopping up orcs or running towards the next lot of orcs to chop up.Gameplay is very repetitive and, though the combat is very functional, it gets quite dull as you go from one stage to the next doing the same bloody thing over and over. Combat is quite a standard affair, with standard fast and heavy attacks melee attacks, a ranged attack and the options to block and dodge. The controls are functional and work well enough, but everything feels quite floaty and a little detached. Each character has unique abilities that can be unlocked and upgraded as the character levels up, most of which are pretty cool to execute. The problem is in how repetitive it becomes as you take on endless hordes of a very unvaried enemy. I often compare these types of games to God of War, but there’s a reason for that; in those games, there are dozens of various attack types and there’s a huge variety of enemy types, all of which require different tactics to combat. In this case, War in The North has 4 basic enemy types – a melee guy, a ranged guy, a sorcerer and a troll. Sure, there are technically more, with goblins, Uruk Hai and so on, but all they really are is the same thing with better stats – which doesn’t mean anything as they are only encountered later in the game when your own stats have also grown massively. This effectively means that you’re fighting the same group of things in a sequence of different rooms for the entire campaign, broken up by the occasional mediocre boss battle and combat is broken down to a sequence of dodge, attack, dodge, special attack for the entire campaign. Not exactly Ride to Hell, but hardly a prize winning game either.Visually the game plays it safe, using the same design aesthetic as in the films, although without any of the grand scenery or set pieces that I loved about the trilogy. The settings are familiar and just a little bland, but it does the job. It’s in the graphics that the game shows its limitations, especially in the resolution and framerate. This game looks like a last-gen console port and even running at 1080p it doesn’t look like it’s in HD. Framerate is similar, even though FRAPS showed it running at a solid 60fps it certainly didn’t look like anything approaching that, in fact it felt like 20. I don’t know why everything looked so poor, or why the framerate randomly dropped to 2fps for a few seconds at random, or why the last level is so glitched you have to reinstall 2 year old drivers for your GPU to run the sodding thing, but it’s very poor form and quite infuriating. That these issues haven’t been patched, despite the forums being flooded with various technical issues, is pretty disgraceful.War in the North is one of those licensed games that get a recommendation because it’s “good enough”. If, like me, you’re a fan of The Lord of the Rings, you’ll probably enjoy going toe-to-toe with a horde of orcs and just being in Middle Earth. The game almost loses my recommendation due to the technical issues and game breaking bugs and if you don’t want to♥♥♥♥♥♥about fixing it yourself then I’d advise you to steer well clear. If you’re fine with that, it’s a pretty decent distraction for a few hours.My score:6/10It’s a good enough game; quite repetitive, and pretty average combat, but it’s a good amount of fun carving through a mass of orcs.

												It has some issues with online connectivity, has an always on voice chat in multiplayer, is a bit buggy, has some issues with getting the proper resolution and over all it is a less than perfect port. However, if you can see past these issues it is a very enjoyable and easy to pick up action RPG that should satisfy fans of the Lord of the Rings and/or action games. It is somewhat reminiscient of the classic ""Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"" LOTR movie tie-in games of the GameCube era, however it is significantly different in some respects (the player now has full control over the camera and there are now town areas like Bree in which players can buy and sell items and get repairs). The game is set up to work with an Xbox 360 controller with no configuration needed, so I recommend you use one for the optimal experience.			",368,58,12,37,26,2,38

												   This is one of the CRASHIEST games I have ever played. The gameplay is not incredibly outstanding but its fun, until it CRASHES. The story is almost compleately unrelated to the movies or books (which I consider a good thing since most people have seen the movies or read the books) and is therefore mostly original yet still feels like lord of the rings, so its entertaining despite being brokeden up by regular CRASHES. The levels look like they might be fun to explore, at least once with each character, if I wasn't in a hurry to make it to the next save point before the inevitable CRASH. Its fun to walk around framiliar locations and talk to characters from the original story (books/movies) aften learning new things I didn't know before (that may or may not be canon), that is until... you guesed it: a CRASH.    Overall I am not dissapointed with my perchase, but I got it on sale for $4.99 or something and can not recomend it unless it is on sale (or they fix the crash issue).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Players looking for a fun role-playing game should definitely consider this.The combat is very hack-and-slashy, but I often find myself utilizing features such as blocks and interrupts which I hardly ever touch in other games. Large enemies such as trolls require me to use the combat roll to get out of the way, and I actually have to ration my health potions. The game does have some combat abilities (such as power hits that are on a cooldown), but I personally don't use them very much.The companion AI is very well done. I've noticed one companion position herself so that her spells benefit both me and the other AI, instead of just spamming her abilities off in a corner somewhere. The armor system in the game is relatively interesting. I find myself actually comparing stats on armor and looking for gems to boost my armor's base stats. I also have to be careful with my funds so I can afford good armor upgrades when I find them on shopkeepers.The game IS linear. At times, I have felt an almost on-rails feeling, but other times it's surprisingly open. The game has a lot of hidden chests and caches that encourage exploring every corner of the map. The items from these caches are typically very useful.The game has many side-quests that are typically optional. You may revisit quest hubs in the world to complete these side quests at your leisure.I'm not a fan of the Lord of the Rings, but even I got into the story. The dialogue has a very nice RPG feel to it, and the voice acting is incredible.			",123,11,0,13,20,0,11

Playing this multiplayer would probably be the smart thing to do. Often the AI will get lost in the level behind you and you'll find yourself fighting 1v10 against orcs which later in the game became nigh-impossible.			",147,21,1,10,5,3,31

Archetypes from the realm of middle earth and as a party you and your companions embark on a quest to aid the fight against evil in the form of an avatar of Sauron. This is a very engaging story and gameplay that requires commitment to roleplay, your character and your companions. You will be able to play for yourself or with 1 or 2 friends, when finding your way through hordes of goblins, orcs and trolls.Three words would describe why this game is great. Story, atmosphere and gameplay. The only thing that really concerns me is the inability to disable ingame voice chat. There is a workaround for it, but it should be implemented as an on/off option in game settings.PRLU SCORE: 7/10			",25,2,0,4,0,0,1

												If you get past the fact that the coding for this game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer is unstable (as well as the rest of the game) and the horrible attempt at a built in mic chat (that you can't turn off) it's pretty damn good. The textures in this game are really spectacular, the detail to everything from dust on your clothes, notched weapons, echo in the game chat while you're in a cave. The combat is simple but every kill feels rewarding. As you run through orcs and goblins drenched in their blood you can't help but to feel some adrenaline. The story, being set in Middle Earth, is just what you'd expect from the universe of Tolkien. The established locations like Bree and Imladris are nice to look at but the never before seen areas add to immense size of Middle Earth. If you get this game expect to be frustrated by the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor coding but know that you won't easily get bored.			",178,14,2,18,6,1,12

												I really liked this game, it was fun simple enough but very satisfying to play and take down hard enemies. I got this for $1 with the humble bundle and that was a steal. I would pay $10 for it, good content graphics are good for it's time and gameplay was awesome. With that being said, I give the biggest ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to IGN for always rating good games like this poorly. Well done IGN keep getting paid out of pocket to promote♥♥♥♥♥♥games such as Call of Duty 9, Ranting aside don't let metascores and especially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ign fool you, lots of poorly rated games are actually very enjoyable.

												Well where to begin here. Big LOTR Fan here which is why i got this title at some point. However the lore comes pretty short. The voices of the three heroes are terrible and so is the dialogue. Your Ranger is not dark and mysterious but a crybaby, your elf is the typical nice healing priest of WoW and your dwarf is lacking the typical attitude you would expect from him. Now the place where this story takes place is quite interesting because it is happening at the same time of the movies but you didnt really hear from the northern front at all. But this is the only positive story aspect. Besides that you meet some famous characters like the fellowship and many more. But again: Terrible voices.The combat evolves around basic Hack'n'Slash completed by mostly useless active abilities. It still feels good for quite some time and the combos are somewhat rewarding. Yet it gets dull especially when you want to complete all the difficulties. Speaking about difficulties. There were no other players around for me to play with so i soloed the content and by increasing the difficulty it got more easy with ""legendary"" being the easiest AND fastest playthrough. Now whats the most positive thing about this game? By far the lootvariety! You get weapons, shields and armour from all the different nations of middle earth, good and evil. You just want to find all the stuff there is and you want to find an orc shield to your orc sword just to look cool etc. BUT killing animations again are a bumper. Axe, sword or mace it doesnt matter you will have the same animation which can look a bit weird at times. If you have one or better two buddies to tag along I imagine this game to be a lot of fun but alone it gets rather boring. Still some LOTR fans might get satisfied by all the familiar places you visit and people to talk to.			",172,20,4,48,32,3,64

												Tolkien and Peter Jackson fans alike should enjoy this game.  The game characters bear a remarkable resemblance to Peter Jackson's film characters. My PC game however was prone to crashing and at one stage I lost my save game, although it was luckily early in the piece. I'll be ammending this review if it happens again as I'm now at L14.Crashes aside, I enjoyed the simple combat system - essentially mashing the mouse button(s) whilst maneuvering and choosing when to invoke special actions. It reminded me of the combat in the Batman game series. Plus you get to sit back and watch your avatar hack, slash and behead Orcs and Goblins in various interesting ways. I think there's an option to tone down the gore but seriously, hacking Orcs to bits is a major theme in the books and films. There were numerous cut-scenes which made it feel like the game was one big interactive movie. The background scenery and music was well done, as were the character voice-overs. Then there were the standard RPG features: quests, side quests, secret caches of weapons, equipment upgrades, buy/sell at vendors, NPC interactions, choices to make, skill trees and character builds etc. All the psychological stuff to keep one interested.I'm playing solo with 2 other AI characters and they do a pretty good job at staying alive, attacking enemies and at times reviving me. So hats off to the developers for not creating dumb AIs. These AIs handle their own skill tree and attribute upgrades plus they equip the best gear they find automatically.  Another special mention goes to the dialog with Gandalf (I think) where you ask the question all LoTR fans ponder: why not send in Frodo on the back of an eagle to begin with?  Play the game to find the answer :-)I've enjoyed this game so far, but it is with a certain fear that I will lose my save game.  Nevertheless for $10 AUD it has been well worth it. Until I lose my save, then I will be cursing.			",107,7,0,19,1,1,4

												This game is a very generic-feeling beat 'em up. I played through the game with a friend quite some time ago and we found ourselves trudging through the game for completion's sake more than anything. We stopped after one play through, unable to muster the gumption needed to play through the campaign a second time on new game +.The few characters you have to choose from are all rather boring archetypes. You gain new class abilities over time that let you perform special moves, but nothing here seems particularly inspired.There was also pretty severe bug on a couple of the levels that was causing the to become exceptionally bright, almost to the point of the screen being a blinding white color. And sometimes it would rapidly blink in and out of this mode. I'm not sure if it was some intense bloom effect bug, or what it was, but it nearly made those levels unplayable.The game was bland and over all boring. It was certainly not for me, so I cannot recommend it to others, however if beat 'em ups are your thing then perhaps you will still find something here worthwhile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've just been trying to power through it because I'm invested in my levelled character, but I can't anymore. Don't buy the game, even if it's cheap and on sale; you'll lose out on your time.

But it felt incredibly rushed towards the end. And don't let the map fool you over half of the game seems to be incomplete. It just straight ends. The most ultimate let down when you get all settled in and you just start getting your character built for the game to end.			",96,14,0,13,8,2,5

												When I recieved this game I was hecka excited. I had finished this game on my friend's Xbox 360 only months before and enjoyed playing it with him in Co-op mode. After finshing this game on my PC I realised how boring and repetitive the game really was. The game is not a free-roaming or exploring type. It restricts you to the very bone with it's story levels, which are the only things that you can actually do in this game. Sure, myself being a huge Tolkien fan should enjoy this game a lot, but the lore is barely touched on. There are refrencing to the movies and books but no huge give away of what the game/story is actually about to all new-comers. If your looking for a Middle-Earth game with heaps of lore and factual basings on Tolkien's work, please, please buy Shadow of Mordor. I did so on my Xbox One, and have to say, it's probably one of my favourite games of all time.			",20,0,0,1,3,0,0

												The game is good. Really good, and takes all the majestic setting of the Lord of the Rings book. Yes, book, ♥♥♥♥ the films. So, why not recommend it?SOLO gameplay is boring, and the game can shine only in co-op. CO-OP gameplay, though, has a really broken talk feature that you simply can't shut off. Were it good enough to understand your partners it would be a great thing to have, but it lags over a 10-years old codec and you can't really get anything out of it that isn't annoying. And they're not fixing it.I can't recommend this game on Steam, unless you are firm to play co-op without microphones. For everyone else, crack it and play on tunngle using skype or teamspeak to speak with your friends.-Wait, can I write thing like these? XD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The company should be paying you to play this unfinished, buggy, laggy, horrendous piece of garbage, and believe me, the amount they would need to pay you is substantial.

												Love the LOTR world. Gameplay is pretty good. But I am writing this review to say, there are serious bugs with the Steam title...BEWARE.And before I go further, Steam won't refund the money spent to purchase this title, because I went (just) over the two hour refund period. Thankfully, it was purchased during the big summer sale. But it does give me concern making any more Steam purchases. The main issue is that the game crashes and returns to the Windows (7 64-bit) desktop if any of the Equipment or Skills keyboard shortcuts are pressed. So if I want to spend my skill points and press the K key (or whatever it is), the game crashes and goes away completeyly. The game restarts fine, but nothing seems to fix the crash. I have even reset my Steam cache with steam://flushconfig without any success.So fun game, but beware. Try the other action keys before your two hours are up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It starts off very fun. It has decent combat and equipment systems and you will be able to do the first four or five hours without any bordom. But that is where it ends. It can`t hold up, mostly due to the fact all the characters, even your own party, are cardboard cutouts with absoulutly nothing interesting to say. Then you have the lack of side quests, or rather decent ones. Lastly there is the main story, which is okay but nothing execptional. I would say if your a lord of the rings fan, get this game when its on sale and see if you like it.			",66,8,0,15,9,0,8

												Story is re-tarded, dialogue is painful, nine tenths of the conversation is absolutely useless and wouldn't be in a game in any other setting.This is a game for passing fans of the Lord of the Rings movies who have no idea that there are books out there. If you've sene the movies more than once, nothing in this game will make any sense. If you've read the books more than once, you'll be shouting at Aragorn, Gandalf, Elrond, etc every every time they're on-screen because they make absolutely no attempt to make them anything like the characters in the book or the movie.This is a mediocre hack-and-slash that has the great fortune of being named ""Lord of the Rings."" Otherwise, it wouldn't have sold many copies.The fight mechanics are boring, the archery is clumsy, and the equipment treadmill is just tiring. Srsly? I'm going to go to Rivendell, and the elf at the smithy is going to charge me for repairs?Most of the loot you'll get in this game is arrows or money, both of which the game would have been much better off without. There is so much ammunition hidden in jars that it's just stupid to make me keep track of it at all. In the first three missions (probably four or five hours of game time), I've run out of arrows once.But really, there's not much point to ever firing an arrow. There's apparently a headshot mechanic, but in order to score a headshot, you still have to shoot a big orc in the head four or five times to reduce his HP.This game is a solid D. If it wasn't a Lord of the Rings game, it would be a D+. But it is, so it's absolutely bursting with references to lore and history that play absolutely no part in the story whatsoever. But you can't be certain what's going to be important or might trigger something later on, so you click through every single dialogue.What a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Do not bother.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												I got hold of this game in the one of the recent humblebundles. The game wasn't so bad in the beginning. Co-op is realy fun if you grab two friends and discover the world together. The item and skill/spell system is similar to many other RPGs nothing special  here.The quests are shallow and very easily completed (bring me A, find and rescue B, talk to C and tell her that i love her... bleh)Levels are tube-like and will not even alter in the slightest ways if you replay them.On easy/norm your two companions will almost everytime revive you from the ""dead"" if you fall,  making  it impossible to die ere. On heroic/legendary they will almost always die themselves, i'd recommend you to  play  with friends  here.Stil, the game seems technically unfinished for some reasons- You can't turn off the ingame voice manually, so when you're used  to play  with teamspeak, vent or skype you have to turn this  off instead of the ingame voice which btw has a  horrible delay- About half of the PC users experience heavy  graphic problems. Minor ones in level 2 and to a point unplayable ones in level 8. Either your game will shut down or sometimes you end up in blue screen. I only got past this level by drawing my bow, zooming in and look on the ground. This prevented me from seeing the graphic bugs all over  and  my game from shutting down every 15 seconds - this issue has been out there from the release of this game. It has not gotten  any updates so far and i doubt it will ever. That's a cruel statement of the developers. They don't even care.All in all i had a couple of great hours, but i was glad when i finally got my 46th achievement, closed the game, clicked on ""delete local content"" and will never play this  game again.

												Lord of the Rings: War of the North is an alright game. You have only 3 classes which you can switch through in game and level up each character. This game has many levels and you can play this game for hours and hours trying to get good weapons and leveling up your guy. The game just throws you hordes of enemies every level and it gets extremely repetitive and dull. Some cutscenes are terrible and laughable. Its not worth buying for 20$, not even 10$. AI for enemies are also bad but the graphics are acceptable.			",199,15,4,32,10,1,49

												The co-op element of this game cannot be emphasized enough:  this is inherently a co-op game.  I played single-player and so my comments are reflective of that experience.The game includes three characters:  a dwarven tank, and human ranger who can choose between melee and ranged DPS, and a support/ranged DPS mage.  The three characters have decidedly different roles in combat and the fundamentals of the combat system are good, but other design flaws quickly mask those positives.Gameplay is episodic, with small, linear maps broken up with portals back to town.  Each character has a small number of actions, making combat somewhat repetitive.  Town is a dull place with a few vendors, the interface for which is clumsy and inefficient.  Managing and building your character and gear is more tedious than rewarding.The main flaw in the game is that you are tighlty tied to a single character.  Rather than giving the player the power to smoothly transfer control between characters on-the-fly (which I would think would be a very easy, obvious feature they should have included), you must play as a specific character for the entirety of a level while the other two are controlled by AI.  You cannot even equip gear on a character other than the one you are currently controlling.I admit I did not spend a lot of time in this game, maybe it would have gotten better as the game progressed, but to be fair I quit playing the game because I did not enjoy it.

												As a casual Lord of the Rings fan, I found this game to be rather on the nose.  I'm going to list the good and the bad that I've encountered so far in a list of bullet points and then expand on them later so that it doesn't get too TL;DR.GOOD:*  Fun action gameplay*  Interestingly well done facial models based off the actors from the movies - (though not mocapped or anything)*  Decent amount of gameplay hoursBAD:*  Terrible console port*  No way to differentiate LAN from internet multiplayer (it does work with LAN, just doesn't give any network information)*  Painful 'story' attempting to garner interest from the fanboys*  Ugly, ugly graphics*  Unimmersive sound*  No way to toggle off voice chatThis game hurts to play.  It's an unpolished and lazy attempt to cash in on the success of the movie releases.  You play one of a party of 3 characters that spend the entire game one or two steps away from the ringbearers. One of the first areas is Bree, where you meet up with Aragorn who's waiting on Gandalf and Frodo.  After you finish the quest, they've made their way through the town.  We all know how the storyline of the novels runs and the constant ""Oh, you just missed the really cool characters but you helped them on their journey... I promise"" gets boring quickly.It is a poor console port.  The engine has not aged well, and it shows.  Despite the beautiful lands in LotR, the brown filter that is more commonly seen in FPSs makes the graphics look even worse than they actually are.  I am not someone that expects Crysis-like graphics in every video game, but this is painfully dated.  There is no way to change any networking settings (not that I expected them to be there) and this is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥on a PC release.  You can't specify whether to use LAN or WAN though it does appear to function on both.  There is no way to turn off the voice chat, and it is SO laggy.  Playing with my partner over LAN in the next room had a good 3000~ms latency on the VoiP.I love RPGs, I love hack n slashers, and I quite enjoy the LotR story.  I can put up with bad writing if the gameplay is fun, and vice versa.  I've got countless hours wasted in these sorts of games.  Unfortunately, there isn't much substance to hold any interest in this game whatsoever, and completely unimmersive.TL;DR.  Crap LotR action RPG that I'm glad I got in a Humble Bundle instead of paying full price.  Not even whacky co-op shenanigans could make this fun.			",477,148,7,83,32,5,71

												Gameplay itself is actually quite fun in co-op and the story is interesting (if not a little cliched), especially if you're a Tolkien fan. That said, there's several annoying bugs to be wary of. The game forces you to use Steam Voice in co-op, which is counter-intuitive in the likely scenario that you're already using a better form of voice communication. The game crashes frequently in graphically intensive situations, and this is a commonly reported issue for AMD card owners with post-HD5k era GPUs. The aggregate score of 66 seems fitting, as those looking for this type of game should enjoy it if they're willing to tolerate its issues. Get it when it's on sale.			",138,17,3,13,21,0,23

												Disappointing. By a long shot. Firstly, the graphics are awful and the environment is boring. The story is bad too and the voice actors are a letdown as well. American accents in Middle-Earth? Sounds completely out of character. The dialogs are ridiculous...whoever wrote the game shouldn't get a job ever again.The combat is quite fun but very repetitive. What I do like is the appearances of some of the little known creatures of Middle-Earth, e.g. Gwaihir and Radagast. The  upgradables are also fun.It is definitely not a good game and I cannot really recommend it unless you are into the Tolkien-Universe and even then...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was very appealing at first, although it is rather disapointing. Let's start with the good things. It has amazing graphics and kill 'mini cutscenes', and does have rather good combat. But, the voice acting is horrible! If you have scene the LOTR movies, the voice acting for Elrond is laughable. They even had the audacity to put really bad american voice actors in the game. LOTR is mainly british (based on the movies and the books) and yet they chose average sounding american voice actors for some roles. Also, the story is very bad, and isn't original at all, because you are directly connected to the fellowship. At least have a seperate storyline, but no, they have to come up with a completely unoriginal, boring storyline. Also, there is abosultely no character development, and I think that if it wasn't for the good gameplay, I would have quit this game. Don't waste your money buying this game. It ISN'T WORTH IT!

												Everything about this game screams mediocre.  I'll break each aspect of the game down below:Graphics - stuttering and muddy.  Everything is in dark earth tones for the most party and tends to becomes a black/brown blur.  Sound/music - For the most part this is the best part of the game, or at least the part that sucks the leastUI/Mechanics - The UI is horrible.  There's just no way to say it more clearly.  It is easily one of the worst parts of this game.  The levelling and talent trees are lackluster, the HUD during gameplay is incomprehensible, and the combat is sloppy.  Story - Yes, it's set in Middle-Earth, and they have gotten a lot of the names of people/places directly from the lore, but that doesn't make the story actually interesting.  Essentially, you are a small band of adventurers (a man, an elf and a dwarf, super original) that need to distract Sauron's forces from the ringbearer during the time of the LOTR trilogy.  Really, it's just a hack and slash-fest that is completely uninspired and boring.			",244,86,2,66,27,3,54

The combats are not fun at all, stay away even if it's cheap.The animations are poor, this is NOT shadow of mordor, not even close.Character's hair are made of cement, it is a very poor dungeon crawler and a click simulator... all you will do is click, a lot.There is 0 tactical value, you never need to think.

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a hack-and-slash game. That's... it.You control one of three characters with no personality or character development trying to chain as many finishers as possible, until you unlock Farin's Explosive Arrow and trivialize the game. Even the only vaguely challenging sections, which are the optional horde challenge maps. Along the way you will meet other fan-favorite characters such as the Fellowship, but then you will discover they have about as much relevance to you as this game does to Tolkein's legendarium. Sorry, Lord of the Rings fans.Your mission is to go kill the leader of Sauron's forces in the North, Agandaur. He is pathetically easy, but it's worth it (?) to see the CGI animation that probably ate up 70% of the budget for this game.The only way this game becomes decent is if you somehow game one, preferably two, friends into playing it with you. The time commitment shouldn't be that bad because the game is both easy and short. Playing with friends helps disguise some of the game's more egregious single-player faults, such as an incredibly limited inventory system, no ability to switch between characters on the fly (this requires you to completely reload the game), and the fact that some parts of the game are straight-up inaccessible without two or more players.Fortunately the game isn't super glitchy (there are some glitches but reloading usually fixes it) or unplayable, and you'll probably unlock 95% of the achievements without even trying.Sadly, War in the North failed to live up to any of its promise. It's not a HORRIBLE game by any means, but there are way better uses of your time.			",122,35,1,26,5,0,1

Even with the best CPU and/or graphics card in your system, there are parts of this game that will slowly gobble up your system resources like your fat uncle on Thanksgiving! CPU usage will max out in graphics-intense areas while GPU won't be utilized properly, you'll suffer from crashes, and nearly unplayable spots. It's really a shame the engine doesn't perform better, because the gameplay and writing are great.			",374,26,3,67,54,0,94

												Performance of the game:This game is a buggy mess.  I powered through a very bad bug in chapter 2 of the game that would have it randomly crash, took about 3 hours to pass a single section that should of took about 20 minutes, twice crashing seconds before triggering the saving in the game.  Most of the times it crashes it doesn't crash to desktop it blue screens my computer most of the time not giving a reason just something failed and the memory address of all “0”s and an x or 5 thrown in.

Yer, its a Good game... if you play on console or are in the 24% of people who are lucky enough not to suffer the graphical problems, but don't chance it at the price.

												Performance of the game:This game is a buggy mess.  I powered through a very bad bug in chapter 2 of the game that would have it randomly crash, took about 3 hours to pass a single section that should of took about 20 minutes, twice crashing seconds before triggering the saving in the game.  Most of the times it crashes it doesn't crash to desktop it blue screens my computer most of the time not giving a reason just something failed and the memory address of all “0”s and an x or 5 thrown in.  I have made it through chapter 7 with it crashing about every half hour and now in chapter 8 of the game I found another section that will crash every few minutes similar to chapter 2 of the game.  Now I have to quit.  The actual review of the game (based on when it is not crashing)one of the first things you get is a bird friend and you hit the 4 button to call for his aid.  Well the Elf character has a power that has you block and hit 4 (holding CTRL then hit 4).  even though the 4 icon has changed from the bird logo to a different logo, BOTH powers are used; the bird and area heal.  I wasted a lot of bird power trying to keep the other 2 friends alive.  Defense missions are the worst part, it goes fine until the enemy brings in the giant troll and he walk past you not caring that you are attacking him and then kills the thing you are protecting in 15 seconds.  I personally am more of a dodger power and like to dodge and not much blocking, I would of liked a double dodge (I only played the elf so I do not know if the other characters have a double dodge).  After facing a double sword enemy who is stabbing you so much that you can not dodge, I have learned to block against them just be for they attack and then attack them back.  Dialog was interesting even had a few points that you could try to tell some one that we are just passing through this very remote area to get to grandma's house (not exactly G ma’s house, but you are lieing about what you are doing so I thought it appropriate) and the NPC has non of that, but a very interesting choice to tell them.  Also there is a lot of repeat dialog choices that are represented as new choices.  Example: someone tells you of a castle; new option of the castle in dialog choices, npc just repeats the thing that brought up the new choice.  Combat was fun and interesting, slowly adding in new enemies over the 6 chapter's I played.  I would of loved to see how the ending turned out and if they kept adding new enemies through the end, but sadly the bugs and crashing my computer is enough to make me stop.			",161,36,1,20,21,3,20

												This game has quite a few primordial building blocks of a great game, but it loses it on the details. First, the game looks fairly decent. Graphics could be tuned up a bit (mainly with some textures), but overall, they aren't bad. Gameplay is a mixed bag. The characters move well enough, but there are some annoying collisions that will hang up your heroes, including places that ""heroes"" should be able to travel through (like stepping up a set of stone stairs from the side instead of moving around to the first step and stepping up that way - or trying to step down off a rock ledge a mere two feet off the ground below). Music is reminiscent of the movie and the sounds and mannerisms of the creatures in the game ring true. The game would be a fun 3-person co-op game, but I only played solo.. which is where some of the problems (and big ones), began to rear their heads.Your character gains XP in the game which allows them to level. This allows you to spend some points in typical RPG stats as well as putting points in skill trees, which allow you access to better killing moves. This is all fine and dandy except for the fact that if you ever switch out to one of the other characters, it resets your skills to default, meaning that you can't play a guy, switch over to another character for the next chapter and expect all of your choices to remain constant. On that point, the same goes for loot. You can share loot with the NPC allies, which they'll use on the mission you're on, but they will strangely have lost some or all of it when you switch over to them. If you opt to not give them anything, they are stuck ""helping"" you with starter weapons.And enemies and NPC A.I. isn't all that bright. I cursed so many times seeing my healer (whom I didn't want to play), rush into battle swinging her staff at a cave troll and getting two-shotted (of course). Then she cried out, ""I am dying!"" Yeah, no♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't get me started on the weirdly placed save spots either. Some are just so far apart that if you wipe, you have to repeat long and tedious chunks of the game.. which is a total buzzkill.I read up online that this game is huge too though, which is sad. Because the combat is pretty fun. There's enough hidden elements and fun gameplay that it kept me entertained. I just wish it was mechanically superior than what it is. I say no to this game. Perhaps a later incarnation will have these odd game mechanics worked out.			",269,46,5,60,31,6,34

												I came here to write a happy review but it will be short and angerd.I realy enjoyed this game, decent hack&slash, decent story, decent graphics. A game great for looting with your best buddys. You can play 3 different classes and races for that. Ranger, Chapion and Lore-master, all having their own skill trees, their own weapons (just the bows and staf), their own special armoring. A little variaton of enemies but passable. Not even a shalow ARPG but fun no matter. Just don't buy it at full price, wait for it to be below normal summ.I would recommend War in the North if only it had not crashed on my 2nd run trough it, at the very last chapter and guess what, it left me with no save files. That's right, it completely deleted my save game files. Afterwards I cheekt forums for answers and the game supposedly does that. When you might ask, when ever it feels like, so my hours spent enyoing War where completely wiped.So, great time with the game, but specifically one little crash made me unlike this avareg but decent work. Because the rights has been sold from SnowblindStudios the game will not be patched and save files will be lost(mark my words). I do not recommend it, let it sit in the cold depths of forgoteness.

												I've tried playing the game for about 2 hours.So far - bad controls. The camera angles are annoying, you seem to talk to much without doing anything meaningful.The action is either too easy or too hard - no magic middle ground.After 2 hours, I left the game - and didn't bother coming back.It just didn't have the fun element to it.

												LOTR:War in the North could be a fun and entertaining game but... there are several technical issues  (particularly when the game runs in systems with ATI graphic cards) that still after almost 3 years remain unsolved. After 15 hours of gameplay the game crashes repeatedly which makes it one of the most frustrating games i ve ever purchased. The game is action orientated with very very few RPG elements. Also if someone is going to play solo this game then he/she will be able to gear his  companions or assign skill and talent points during levelling only during checkpoints at the end of each chapter. Overall I wouldn't recommend the pc version of this game to anyone			",29,13,0,7,0,1,2

Lots of problems with freezing and crashing... many said it was due to the AMD drivers (the game publisher said also), but guess what... there are numerous others, with NVIDIA or other GPU and said the same thing.When I got to the end of the game, in the castle, the game completely crashed.So I decided to give my Intel GPU a run... with all the settings low, same thing... the game did not crash, but regular freezing was evident. This game is not optimised at all. Looking at the CPU cores, it only mastered one core...A big disappointment that I had to finish the game on my Intel GPU because the developers couldn't get it right... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you read the top reviews for this game, you'll notice the good review, but there is a GOOD reason for the low metascore. The amazing reviews ons team are most likely because the only people who will buy this game are already avid LOTR fans. I however, was not a fan beforehand and will deliver a serious review.Here's a complied list, and at the end of the list I'll let you be the judge of whether or not you wish to dive into this gameIs the story any good?Absolutely, as any RPG you have the freedom to partake in the story or to skip it and get into the action. Talking to the villagers of every town will get you side quests in which you can earn some intense gear.Is the combat any good?Personally, the combat is pretty repetetive, but it does allow for some customizing, much like dragon age.Is there customization?The customization is limited but it IS there, which is better than no customization. Note: You may only customize AFTER starting the game.Diversity?Yes, you're able to pick one of the three heros and go along with it, there's also multiplayer functions so you can bring two friends and each have their own hero.All of these things are good, so why is this a downvote?There is only one bad quality, but you must realize the depth of the how terrible it is to understand why it's a thumbs down.What is wrong with it?The game crashes OFTEN. This game was released on Nov. 1, 2011 which wasn't too long ago. Yet, the game runs like it was made in 2002, with how the graphics are I originally thought this game was made in 2006.My computer is really new, and it is capable of running Bioshock infinite on max settings, yet it cannot run LOTR War in the North for over an hour without crashing. What's more, is that it does not simply crash the game/window/application. It crashes the ENTIRE DESKTOP. THIS IS WHY THE GAME RECIEVED A LOW METASCORE, IT IS INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE. It is borderline unplayable, because up until the undead level, you don't really have any problems with crashing. but the second you get to the undead mobs, the game cannot control it's own software and seeminglye xplodes upon itself. And, because the undead levels are canon, you MUST pass through them. I was lucky because my computer was new, so I had a long grace period before it killed itself, but any run of the mill computer may not be able to handle it at all.All in all, this was a great game, if it wasn't so cancerous to it's own programming, I as a person who is not a die-hard fan of LOTR can honestly say this would have recieved an 85-95 score for what it brings to the table. However, an amazing game CANNOT HAVE A FOUNDATION MADE SUITABLE ONLY FOR GAMES 5 YEARS BEHIND ITS TIME.			",124,27,1,30,11,0,25

												If you get past the fact that the coding for this game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer is unstable (as well as the rest of the game) and the horrible attempt at a built in mic chat (that you can't turn off) it's pretty damn good. The textures in this game are really spectacular, the detail to everything from dust on your clothes, notched weapons, echo in the game chat while you're in a cave. The combat is simple but every kill feels rewarding. As you run through orcs and goblins drenched in their blood you can't help but to feel some adrenaline. The story, being set in Middle Earth, is just what you'd expect from the universe of Tolkien. The established locations like Bree and Imladris are nice to look at but the never before seen areas add to immense size of Middle Earth. If you get this game expect to be frustrated by the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor coding but know that you won't easily get bored.			",178,14,2,18,6,1,12

												Players looking for a fun role-playing game should definitely consider this.The combat is very hack-and-slashy, but I often find myself utilizing features such as blocks and interrupts which I hardly ever touch in other games. Large enemies such as trolls require me to use the combat roll to get out of the way, and I actually have to ration my health potions. The game does have some combat abilities (such as power hits that are on a cooldown), but I personally don't use them very much.The companion AI is very well done. I've noticed one companion position herself so that her spells benefit both me and the other AI, instead of just spamming her abilities off in a corner somewhere. The armor system in the game is relatively interesting. I find myself actually comparing stats on armor and looking for gems to boost my armor's base stats. I also have to be careful with my funds so I can afford good armor upgrades when I find them on shopkeepers.The game IS linear. At times, I have felt an almost on-rails feeling, but other times it's surprisingly open. The game has a lot of hidden chests and caches that encourage exploring every corner of the map. The items from these caches are typically very useful.The game has many side-quests that are typically optional. You may revisit quest hubs in the world to complete these side quests at your leisure.I'm not a fan of the Lord of the Rings, but even I got into the story. The dialogue has a very nice RPG feel to it, and the voice acting is incredible.			",123,11,0,13,20,0,11

												Really fun game.  I was really enjoying it, except the randomc rashing issues.  Then, in mission 8, the game just crashed, and there doesn't seem to be any way around it.  Good game, just completely ruined by bugs and crashes.			",18,1,0,7,0,0,2

												It's was very fun but when I went to replay it with a newer video card than I had from ~2011 the game ran horribly.Recent video drivers and/or GPUs (AMD/ATi) have made this game absurdly laggy as well as the final area of the game 100% unplayable.If you don't have a newer card, then you should be fine.Recommend at least 2 player, though.Only real complaint was that you need to NG+ and NG++ to get to higher difficulties and nothing changes other than relative level values of enemies and equipment, etc.			",403,66,2,42,9,0,22

												Me and my friend bought the game and started co-op a couple of days ago.There weren't any problems, we have played it around 3 hours, it was really good fun.Then, the next day, my friend tried to launch the game, BUT HE COULDN'T.Because he has Win8 on his pc and this causes several different problems, according to the forums, etc.I have some questions in my mind now.First, if this game isn't compatible with Win8, how come we played the game for 3 hours without any problems?Second, we always try to buy the original copies of the games on Steam instead of cracked ones from the Internet, and still we have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ technical issues with the games. Can't you just prepare a single update for all these problems?It seems, no. ",13,3,1,4,9,1,3

												The only issue with this game is that it was ripped from console, which isn't bad at all mind you. Just that you cannot at all. Disable the in-game mic feed if you are using other VOIP with your friends playing the game. Which means you are getting double feedback, which is a huge killer for any multiplayer content because let's face it... it's annoying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun as ♥♥♥♥ with a buddy, I don't know what half these people are saying, maybe because they don't have any friends to play with, if you have 3 people binge playing this game it's actually lit af, if you have some free time and have a friend or 2 along with some free time, I 100% recommend, the looting feels rewarding and the fighting doesn't really get boring, once you unlock the higher difficulties it becomes a pretty challanging game.

Play it with friends and explore a beutifull game mechanics and interesting characters. Sure it's not Fallout but it is a good game and you should try it.			",56,2,0,6,5,0,2

												Bite Size Review - Lord of the Rings: War in the NorthThe Good:+ The dialoge and lore that characters have and speak to you about+ You can play as one of three unique classes + Story is interesting+ Graphics are on the old side, but still look ok+ Lots of loot+ You get to meet several characters from the film and they actually have a good amount to say and it is interesting+ Gameplay is simple but can still hold upThe Bad:- This is kind of a dealbreaker, I have a modern PC (runs New Doom 2016 on Highest settings etc) and this game slows down and crashes more times than is acceptableThe Verdict:So I just finished playing this game, and I have to say it was fun. You get to see some new places and some familar ones from the movies. You also get to meet and actually have meaningful conversations with characters from the movies and they actually talk a decent amount, it was really interesting to talk to them and learn more about the LotR universe. So I would classify this game as an average action role playing game, with great lore. All good stuff.Unfortunatly this is where I must tell you that this game crashed on me probably every 30 - 40 minutes and slowdowns in certain areas for no reason I could figure out. I just got a new computer recently, it runs the new doom at max settings 60 fps - now granted, I did switch to an AMD graphics card this time around (not Nvidia) so this may have something to do with it, or it may be windows 10, I am not sure. I tried to fix the usual ways I tend to fix these issues with other older games like using compatability modes etc. this but was unsucessful, forcing me to restart the game and just try to force my way through the crashy bits. But yeah, with the technical problems I ran into... even with the fun I had with the game, I can not recommend it. If it did not have these technical issues I could definitely recommend the game though for the lore, I really enjoyed that part of this game a lot. But with it's tachnical issues I will say ""buyer beware"" and leave it at that.			",434,90,5,66,36,6,62

												I've played this game together with a friend. It took us around 15 hours to finish the missions. The game was incredibly enjoyable for as long as it lasted, but 15 minutes of gameplay is not worth the price. The dialogues are a bit stale, as are the faces of the characters. At a certain moment, two brothers come and help you, whose sprites are litterally the same. They're like clones O_o. The hack and slash element of the game and the challenges of defeating strong foes are VERY enjoyable, however. It'd be great if there was a seperate 'open world' part of this game, so that the content would last more than 15 hours. (we were offered to do exactly the same missions on a harder game mode, but that's just meh). If you are looking for a fantasy game that you can play together with 1 or 2 mates, I'd recommend it. Otherwise, it's not worth the cash.			",21,4,0,7,2,0,4

												I first bought this at Gamestop for my 360 to check it out and see if it was any good. I played previous SnowBlind games, but I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan at all. But what I played of the used copy convinced me to pay it forward so to speak. I went back to Gamestop and changed it in for a real copy and paid the exta money. I very much enjoyed the game when I played it on the 360. I thought the combat was fun as well as the archery. I don't play the mage class so I can't say anything about that. I enjoy open world games the best. Like The Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto. Fallout and what not. This game gives a slight feeling of open world but it does give you direction. And people will like that also. Not knowing what to do in a game is not fun.The difficulty seems fair. I'm not that great at video games, and found normal a fun, fair challenge.I will soon find out if the xbox 360 controller works for this game. The controller worked fine! Nice.So this is the 2nd time buying this game. Even though I played it twice on the 360. Warrior and Rouge class. Very fun.I played co op with my cousin on Xbox Live. I think we played through the whole game. But I can't remember for sure. Very fun game to play with a friend.It's fun co op or single player! I would give this game a try, It is not a masterpiece. The story pulled me in, even though I'm not a fan, and with the combination of great gameplay equals a great adventure!			",52,1,0,6,1,0,0

												I am kicking myself for leaving this unplayed in the back catalog for so long. Not the best story ever written, but does a better job than ""The Hobbit"" movies of telling a story related to the events in Lord of the Rings that does not feel shoe horned in and is consequential in and of itself. The combat is easy to pick up but rewards practice and skill with fun executions and bonuses for long hit streaks and good teamwork (specifically, you get and extra bonus for helping a team-mate finish an enemy off). Short version, a must play for Tolkien fans and a decent fun game for everyone else.Quick edit - now I am on my 2nd Legendary playthrough. The difficulty ramps up nicely, and now I am planning how I am going to upgrade my gear over the next several playthroughs. Yes it is still awesome every time I finish an orc and get painted black :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS REVIEW IS FOR ANYONE HOPING TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH FRIENDS:Simply put: The multiplayer is broken so bad to a state which makes it unplayable.  Here is what I can say with absolute certainty:1: There is no local multiplayer like there was on console. But don't bother buying multiple copies because2: The LAN feature is completley useless. This literally wont work and3: Playing online is extremely extremely volitaleHeres the thing. This game is fun, and youll disconnect once and say ""Hey thats ok lets just reconnect"" then you wont be able to so youll switch hosts but then your save will be desyncs and youll say ""ok well let me just play singleplayer to get our saves resynced then you can host"" and your friend will have to wait while you play the same part you just played. Then when your saves are resynced maybe JUST MAYBE switching hosts will get you reconnected. Hurrah! but then 15minutes later you drop the connection again.  This cycle will repeat itself over and over again until you finally get so sickly frustrated that you quit altogether and youll feel like crap because you spent so much time trying to adjust your firewall and port forward, reinstall and modify game files etc. Here's the bottom line:TRY ANY FIX YOU WANT: THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON TO THE CONNECTION INTEGRITY IN THIS GAMEDon't be fooled by any premonitions about this game. This game is NOT multiplayer, its single player. If you want to play it with friends, buy it on Online for Xbox 360If WB games responds to my support requests adequatley then I will change this review, but I doubt it because theyve got better things to do with my money than fix a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port of an older game			",54,4,0,2,3,0,7

												I thought it was porrly made. The combat mechanic is ok, and there's plenty of gore and dismemberment, and it's pretty for what there is, but it just doesn't deliver pretty much everywhere else. For example, there are a bajillion different armors which you can aquire, but each character only has like 3 armor skins. The same armor looks completely different on different characters. It glitched at the beginning of the final level and it was months before I could continue and beat the game. When I bought it days after release, it was $10 cheaper than most newly released games. I should've expected a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			",16,4,0,3,0,0,4

												The boring adventures of some random, soulless characters which somehow live at the same time as the Lord of the Rings storyline (which I enjoyed a lot). Useless gimmick: Somehow most of the cast of the main storyline know these guys already or at least meet them throughout the game even if there was no mentioning of it in any of the films (nor in the books I guess, but I never read them).It gets even better: The game is quite ugly for a game released in 2011 and has still quite a lot of performance problems in 2013 and if you follow the instructions of the brightness configuration wizard you end up with by far too dark settings. The characters' skill trees are pointless, the combat, especially the ranged, is unrewarding, the combo system is never explained at all, the world is one straight line with invisble walls every two meters from the track where you are supposed to walk and the inventory and shop handling is quite uncomfortable. Even if some of the conversations had an interesting core, they would have driven you to insane laughter before being able to notice, not only because you are constantly talking to giant, English-speaking eagles but because they are prolonged by endless amounts of pointless standard fantasy gibberish. Fun fact: The game even honors the player who servered the most limbs and broke the most destructible items - activities all too familiar to the heroes of Middleearth.The only reason I still played this mediocre game was the fact that I could play it with up to two friends in networked co-op (which is actually my favorite way to play games). After we took about an hour to disable the not-supposed-to-be-disabled, ultra-low-quality, always-on ingame voice chat through using Virtual Audio Cable, we had quite some problems getting into the game lobby at the same time. After trying all possible permutations of who is host and who connects when, we actually found a working setup. Only to notice that the net code is pretty weak and causes a lot of rubber banding and enemy lagging.The good part is, that we didn't pay a lot, because the game was only one of many parts of a Humble Bundle, that we had a lot to laugh about and were able to play in a mixed setup where some of us were playing with gamepads and one with keyboard and mouse.I would only seriously recommend this game to the console peasants for which it was obviously originally made. My recommendation for everyone else: Stay away from this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun. There is only one problem : it auto-activate your microphone on multiplayer. Seems nothin' to loners, but if you're already on skype, ts or mumble with some folks it is gonna be a serious issue. You can try and configure your steam's vocal options, but sometimes the game gonna decide to reset that, or to transmite EVEN IF your configuration doesn't allow it.I won't play it again, and I'm off to find the profound idiot who thought THIS was gonna be an awesome idea... Forcing vocal chat... You genius !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Iako igra kao sama nije jako loša i dosta je igriva, jednostavno je nemogu preporučiti jer je prepuna bugova i glitcheva zbog čega je niti nebudem završio već nakon 4 sata igranja (3 sata je bilo samo mućenja sa konekcijama), već ide na uninstall i zaboraviti što prije. Naime igru sam odlučio igrati sa frendom preko COOP-a ali osim prvog dana kad smo igrali recimo to bez problema (osim što se njemu krešala igra 2-3♥♥♥♥♥♥, već drugi dan se nismo mogli spojiti i nastaviti tamo gdje smo stali jer se save njemu coruptao (valjda). Ok skužili smo da on ovaj put mora biti host (o bože), ali svejedno nismo riješili problem sa nekim questovima koji se odbijaju maknuti makar su riješeni. Google nepomaže puno. Zapravo pomaže ako ideš googlat o igri prije nego što je kreneš igrati pa da skužiš neke cake, ali vjerovatno dok bi to čitao bi te odbilo od igre....u svakom slučaju smeće. DONT PLAY.

												Snowblind studios built it's name on console action RPG's. They haven't wandered from that path. They've left their mark on the gaming industry. Kudos to you Snowblind, this really is a nice gem. War in the North brings a 3 person co-op style of gameplay. The players have a choice between three different characters. Each with three skill trees and a multiple number of abilities. All three characters can either go melee or ranged during combat. Primarily there's two basic defensive moves, block and dodge. There's other abilities that can further defense. The games merits rely on the charming Tolkien lore which only enhances a unique and plausible storyline. Warner Brother's has really done a excellent job with expanding Tolkien's universe in various media outlets. Artwork is amazing, the plain fluid motion of the camera is flawless. Middle-Earth is painted with a darker brush, there's a gritty and grainy feel to the game. My only peeve with the game is that the two hardest difficulty settings aren't unlocked until completion of a play-through.Snowblind studios delivered easily a worthy pickup both on consoles and PC. 8/10			",242,34,20,22,24,4,35

												It would be quite a good game, if I could actually finish it.... The last map is unplayable on an i7-5930K, 64 Gigs of RAM and AMD R9 290X, running Windows7. It slows down to single digit fps, and eventually crash to the desktop. Even the earlier maps can produce this, but those can be circumvented with compatibility mode (W98 mode.... no comment...), and a bit of luck.nVidia users might not experience all this, and they may actually find themselves playing an enjoyable TPS hack-n-slash with coop mode and plenty of loot.

												Snowblind are known for putting out some great arpg's-Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. Champions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest, and Champions: Return to Arms are some of the best Diablo-style arpg's to have come out on any system. They helped made the PS2 one of the most memorable console's ever and copies of all three fetch anywhere from $20 to $150 on ebay. That's why it baffles me how they messed this one up. It's just not a good game. The main issue with it aside from the story not measuring up to the material that inspired it is the combat. If you're playing it single player prepare to face infuriating balance issues. You'll be yawning while button mashing as you overpower scores of enemies and then all of a sudden you'll have a cave troll or mini-boss constantly overwhelming your AI companions. When AI are able to reach you they'll be constantly knocked back by enemies. Added to the frustration will be gear. Good gear is rare and when you do get it nothing you get scales well. This isn't quite as bad early on but as the game progresses it ends up making it difficult to reach the end of the story by yourself. The story itself is weak. While some of the characters in this are in Tolkiens works and the films they're more like celebrity cameos in a bad 70's holiday special. The main characters in this lack any kind of personality or defining trait other than being generic representations of their assigned class. Dialogue is terrible with bad cliche's all throughout and cutscene's that act as filler to pad the games already short playtime. Performance and art-wise it performs just fine even on older systems. The art however while reminiscent of Lord of the Rings online's Middle Earth mixed with elements form the films feels looks just as generic as the characters personalities. The game is an on-rails grind fest through a series of uninteresting settings that evoke none of the ancient melancholy, ethereal beauty or ominous dread the novel and films do. To sum up this is a game from a company who once made some of the best arpg's around who seem to have forgotten how to do just that. I would not advise picking it up.			",123,12,4,28,4,2,10

												This game is very ""Meta"". You THINK you're playing a story of what happens in the North during LOTR's.. a story so pointless not even Tolkein bothered to address is in his epic novels.The REAL game is trying to get this game to start. It only REALLY works if you have the right graphics card, otherwise is a crashfest.The only fun way to ""Play"" is co-op. And that's only if your partner is fu*king hilarious. Like Me. At only about 10 hours long, I wouldn't recommend paying more than $5 for this. Well, I wouldn't recommend playing this at all.. unless you're German. They seem to love this game for some reason.

												It's weird when I don't like fantasy RPG's, because for the most part I really WANT to love them. And LOTR: WITN wants me to want to love it, but wanting only gets us so far now doesn't it?To start, I was immediately disappointed by the lack of local co-op. I had assumed that this version, despite being a port, kept the split screen co-op of the console version. I was, in fact, very wrong about this. So when I bought this and had a friend over that same day to play it together, instead I had to sit there awkwardly and submit to either playing solo while my friend sat around like a git or play LEGO Hobbit because it at least kept the basis of the game intact.And then there's the combat. As far as hacky slashy button mashy games go, it's not the worst around (lookin at you, Two Worlds). It's not good enough to be called good though. Most of the moves are quite slow and don't really feel like they connect all that well. It feels more like you're having a dramatic pool noodle fight with a bunch of people who aren't convinced you really hit them until you've bopped them on the head fifty more times, and even then the point is barely starting to sink in. I've heard of bullet sponges but most of the enemies here are steel sponges. I have the sneaking suspicion this is one of those games that only gets easier as you go, but after a few long and rather boring quests that I've had to solo I realized I had stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥But the visuals. Dear Gimli the visuals. This felt much more like a Fallout game than a game set in a magical fantasy universe. Many of the characters you interact with stare at you crosseyed like they're trying their damndest to figure out whether the awkward jagged lines on your face are poor polygons or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shadows. There are a couple hobbits naffing about in the various towns but at first glance I was a bit concerned that goblins were attacking. And the elves, supposedly the most fair race, look like they've been to Sylvester Stalone's house and got roped into re-enacting the fight scenes from ""Rocky"". It's all just a bit eerie to look at. In short, there are lots of collectibles, hidden goodies, etc. and I'm sure online multiplayer could be fun but sluggish combat and poor visuals lead to an ultimately dull experience.

There is a level about half way through which means you are unlikely to be able to complete the game. As sadly the game has serious graphical issues on this level that where never rectified by the development studio.  How a game was released in a state that could not be completed if you are running an AMD based graphics card I do not know.Avoid.			",108,16,0,12,5,0,22

												It's a game that seems unfinished. It has good action, but otherwise the menus are awkard, and it fails miserably on all RPG aspects; Even though you have a party of three, and you have the option to give the other characters of the party items that you find, you can not micro-manage these characters. Also when the other characters gain a level, you can't manage their stats or skills.Further more, the game has random crashes. I didn not get farther than episode 1, and the game crashed and there was no workaround. Seeing as I was bound to lose all of my progress, I decided to ultimately uninstall a poorly made game, that showed a lot of promise in the beginning.Good thing I got it on a bundle.

												I didn't expect to find a great or even good game here, but it's alright so far. The levels are straightforward, the graphics are ok, but lack personality, and the voice overs are also pretty good. The combat however is dull and boring. It isn't fluent and as a loremaster I get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked quite regularly. Most of the times my AI teammates are there in time to save me but other times we all just die because we were overwhelmed. There is an integrated RPG system where you can level up, collect gear and have multiple quests but it feels tacked on somehow. The skills aren't that powerful, there isn't that many gear to collect and having multiple quests seems pointless and mostly because of the one-way roads. The characters also lack any kind of personality so it's hard to feel connected with them at all.Unfortunately this game belongs in the bargain bin.[Rating: 69/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Has moderate stuttering caused by bad optimization/coding. Also horrible mouse acceleration that even is there when using a gamepad. What the acceleration does is makes your view move normally for a second then start spinning out of control wildly when you move the camera in a direction for more than one second. This means a no go on a otherwise barely passable game anyway. Very generic action game all you really do is mash attack. Get Shadows of Mordor instead.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Well I bought this game (like most games) on a %75 discount. I feel the game is well worth the money I played and I finished it in about a week. The game play is pretty good, as it follows the storyline for the books. But don't expect a LONG game (I completed Normal in 28 hours). You see, when you see the map, you see the layout of the entire Middle Earth. but you are only playing in about a few locations near and around Bree and the Shire and the Misty Mountain. Along with the game play, a couple of things to consider. Only you can equip and level yourself up. the AI does it automatically for your companions.The few annoying things are you can't walk through your companions, so if one of them is blocking the way, you have to wait for them to move or go around. This is actually annoying when you are in a fight with baddies all around you. You swing your sword and miss... Also, you have save points, which is good, but unfortunately, there is only one save slot for your game. You can't copy a slot, nor can you go back a few saves if you wanted to. But these are just technical woes, but it's still a fun game to play.There are 46 Achievements but there are a few that are secret, meaning it's not listed in your achievement list. Better off Googleing the rest to see what you need.I played the Ranger with a Two-Handed sword (great for the Barrow Down's level and easier to bust through.) Get lots of health potions and you should be good to go...I started on Normal, and when you finish your game, you restart from the beginning but you keep all your XP, Gold, and everything you bought. But, you are on the next difficulty level.There is one part of the game when you enter Carum Dum, it's heavy on the graphic at one stage and if you have a bad system to begin with, this will require patience to get through. But its a short travel.			",66,8,0,2,0,0,0

												Starts out fun, but gets old pretty fast. The levels are very linear and are just hack-n-slash your way through. The RPG elements make it a bit enjoyable, but overall, it's pretty okay. There's some weird elements too that I don't think were thought out very well, such as slicing off heads with a hammer. I wish I could give it a neutral instead of thumbs up or down.6 / 10.

												Got this on sale for $5 and it's mostly excellent.======the bad======You are basically the d-list team fighting evil while all the cool stuff from Lord of the Rings is happening elsewhere.Story is totally forgettable and non-canon as far as I know.At the last location of the game, it's like QA completely ran out of time to validate anything. The framerate throughout the beginning of this section is choppy as hell, 2 specific rooms have absolutely bonkers graphics glitches, and I crashed multiple times during this section of the game. At one point, I had finally defeated the first phase of the last boss after 3 attempts - and the game crashed; that was a ""ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME!?"" moment. The first 90% of the game was pretty much bug-free during my multiple playthroughs minus a few rare game lockups during load screens. It's like the QA / development team just didn't have enough time to fix all the bugs in this game. It's freakin' great and smooth and nice like 90% of the time, but the remaining 10% are like no QA tester ever looked at it.UPDATE: I can't really tell you why, but a recent playthrough in 1080p resolution didn't have nearly the amount of issues on the last map - no idea why though!Solo with AI companions - there's not a way to easily see their equipment. You can quit, select a different character, manage their equipment, and repeat to set everyone's equipment the way you want - but that's pretty tedious. I never found it necessary to micro AI companion equipment - they upgrade themselves with random pickups just fine - but it seems bizarre that there's no such feature.======the good======combat, progression, loot, finding secrets - all of these systems are great and totally satisfying.It really feels good to build up to an eviscerating strike on an enemy and then knock their head clean off, chop off an arm, or knock them down and skewer them for the finisher.Getting a good hit streak and just going berserk on stuff is awesome, too.The skill trees and stat point systems really provide a variety of playstyles and builds for each character, and all of them feel useful.Active dodging and blocking, well done enemy tells, hit reactions, and misc animations - man combat is satisfying in this game.---------------------------------Basically if you can get this for super cheap on sale, I'd highly recommend you pick it up and play with 2 other friends.

												The combat is a chore of repeated clicking. I felt like missing a block or a dodge punished the player entirely too much, both in damage and the amount of time the character remains knocked down.It's an alright game overall, but it came to a point where it was simply unwinnable. I'm not sure if it comes down to luck or if you have to have 3 players playing at one time to coordinate attacks, but I couldn't manage it on my own.While defending a particular gate, trolls will barge in and just break it while you're wailing on them. There's nothing you can do to keep them from attacking the gate, since your attacks won't stagger large enemies. At that point, I gave up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Starts out fun, but gets old pretty fast. The levels are very linear and are just hack-n-slash your way through. The RPG elements make it a bit enjoyable, but overall, it's pretty okay. There's some weird elements too that I don't think were thought out very well, such as slicing off heads with a hammer. I wish I could give it a neutral instead of thumbs up or down.6 / 10. Got old really quick.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the worst games I have ever attempted. I didn't get two hours into this thing. The linear play style and lack of any significant options show this game to be completely horrid. If I hadn't bought his as part of a HumbleBundle, I would feel like I got cheated out of paying more than the $1 that I paid for it. It's worth less than that. It's simply horrid.

												Got this on sale for $5 and it's mostly excellent.======the bad======You are basically the d-list team fighting evil while all the cool stuff from Lord of the Rings is happening elsewhere.Story is totally forgettable and non-canon as far as I know.At the last location of the game, it's like QA completely ran out of time to validate anything. The framerate throughout the beginning of this section is choppy as hell, 2 specific rooms have absolutely bonkers graphics glitches, and I crashed multiple times during this section of the game. At one point, I had finally defeated the first phase of the last boss after 3 attempts - and the game crashed; that was a ""ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME!?"" moment. The first 90% of the game was pretty much bug-free during my multiple playthroughs minus a few rare game lockups during load screens. It's like the QA / development team just didn't have enough time to fix all the bugs in this game. It's freakin' great and smooth and nice like 90% of the time, but the remaining 10% are like no QA tester ever looked at it.UPDATE: I can't really tell you why, but a recent playthrough in 1080p resolution didn't have nearly the amount of issues on the last map - no idea why though!Solo with AI companions - there's not a way to easily see their equipment. You can quit, select a different character, manage their equipment, and repeat to set everyone's equipment the way you want - but that's pretty tedious. I never found it necessary to micro AI companion equipment - they upgrade themselves with random pickups just fine - but it seems bizarre that there's no such feature.======the good======combat, progression, loot, finding secrets - all of these systems are great and totally satisfying.It really feels good to build up to an eviscerating strike on an enemy and then knock their head clean off, chop off an arm, or knock them down and skewer them for the finisher.Getting a good hit streak and just going berserk on stuff is awesome, too.The skill trees and stat point systems really provide a variety of playstyles and builds for each character, and all of them feel useful.Active dodging and blocking, well done enemy tells, hit reactions, and misc animations - man combat is satisfying in this game.---------------------------------Basically if you can get this for super cheap on sale, I'd highly recommend you pick it up and play with 2 other friends.

												Overall, this game was fun single player.  There is a multiplayer aspect to the game, which in my opinion, gives a game a much larger gamut of variety and fun.  Would there be more support for this product to resolve some game-breaking problems, I would revisit this review.  Unforunately, I must tell it how it is...The largest problems consisted of game saves sometimes  being overwritten (without consent or notifcation of any kind) when joining a friend's game and playing through the campaign as one of their three heroes.  Graphical errors due to lack of support on some common AMD graphics cards further complicated the ability to complete this game with people with these cards by kicking players/crashing.  No support is expected to continue for this game, so I must conclude the game is virtually broken upon download.			",161,25,10,48,4,4,19

												More like... SNORE in the North, amirite?  Less of an arpg and more of a level based series of combat vignettes hack-n-slash.  And while the combat is 'beefy' and smashing things in the face is fun the problem is there's little supporting that to keep things interesting.  Talents, quests, and loot are generic.  The levels are purely linear and recycle the same enemies ad nauseam.  It seems the game was mostly designed with couch co-op in mind which explains its fairly shallow single player experience.  Try it if you got it as bundle fodder but don't bother purchasing individually.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whenever I see a classic franchise turned into a game, I jump at the chance to get it. However, this game has made me question that policy, as it was disappointing in more than one aspect.For one, the gameplay was painfully repetitive. You hack at enemies with staggering melee chains to deplete their tediously large amounts of health, and eventually score a ""critical"" slow-motion kill, with all such finishers being seen in the first five minutes. This would be all well and good if not for the waves upon waves of the same enemies in every battle, and reskins of the same enemies in every area. Virtually every enemy melee attack is slow enough that dodge-rolling out of them becomes literally half the game. Spells deal slightly above-average damage, yet they're incumbent upon leveling, are very few, have cooldowns, and can only be cast through the non-configurable and inconvenient number row.The game is apparently intended almost exclusively for co-op, as your ally NPCs' AIs are complete crap. They focus in on one enemy and proceed to totally ignore everything else happening around them; This makes stealth impossible, and leaves the large bulk of the fighting solely to you. One of the only ways to heal is waiting for your mage ally to cast a protective field that very slowly regenerates health - this can be annoying if there are many enemies with high-power attacks chasing you, plus the field can apparently be broken by a strong melee area-attack, which quite a few enemies in each battle possess.Additionally, although it may at first seem nice to have a semi-instant revive system, your allies are very stupid about using it: They will both run up to you regardless of how many enemies are in your vicinity, and proceed to get themselves mob-murdered, plus the revive will stop mid-way whenever they are hit by an area-attack, or by practically any projectile - making dying in a fight with a troll, a boss, or a few archers essentially irrecoverable. And even though your allies can remain in a near-death state infinitely, waddling about on their knees at random (making finding them at times annoying), you cannot, and game-over in a manner of seconds.The equip system is also laughably level-based. You can fight three trolls and scores of enemies to retrieve a legendary bow, and in the very next area, find a cracked shortbow in a barrel with 2x better stats. On account of this, wasting hard-earned gold on buying anything other than health potions is a wasted investment, and it's basically pointless to slot elf-stones (item enhancements) until the end-game, when you've finally stopped switching out your entire armor every area. Your inventory is also constantly getting bogged down with what the game deems 'unessential items', which are literally that, and have no secret or quest purpose whatsoever beyond getting in the way of useful equipment.The story is perhaps the only compelling thing about the game, but interacts badly with the mainline LOTR plot. For instance, when your party asks why you can't be part of the Fellowship, Elrond explains that the members must be stealthy and not necessarily powerful - when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are basically the most badass warriors in the entire LOTR universe. The dialogue seems pretty forced as well, and can be difficult to follow unless you are versed in LOTR canon.Beating the game unlocks the next highest tier difficulty to play on, but the game has so little replay value that it's hardly worth it. War in the North lacks substance mostly because of its absence of variety and configurability, and I can't say I'd recommend it to any sincere LOTR fan.			",90,41,0,22,17,0,15

												War in the North is a fairly boring action rpg.  The story of the game is that your party, that consists of a ranger, elf, and dwarf, is on a journey to stop another evil baddie other than Sauron.  This journey takes place as Frodo and the fellowship are on their way to destroy the ring.  Because of this setting, you can feel the B-side nature of it.  You do see some of the fellowship in Rivendell but the conversations boil down to, ""Hey buddy, I'm doing this.  What are you doing?""  Oh yeah, they are talking eagles in this game.  TALKING EAGLES.Gameplay is a bit drab.  While I do enjoy the brawler genre, this game borders on Dynasty Warriors mindless and straight up boredom.  You have two main attacks, one standard and one strong.  You also have skills which are accessed through modifier triggers.  While useful, having those abilities limited by both a cooldown and power bar restricts you from using them all the time and only when it matters.  I had about 30 power potions left when I finished the game mainly due to me using them sparingly.  You have a block but it's useless.  It's hard to tell whether your character will actually block or take damage.  The only satisfying thing about the combat is that you get to decaptitate foes or sever their limbs for extra experience.Unless you are a LOTR nut, stay away.			",255,37,4,16,7,0,22

												The LOTR game we all wanted to see with all its blood and gore, War in the North delivers great storyline, awesome gameplay and marvelous landscapes. The world of J.R.R Tolkien is once again recreated in this game, inhabited with Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Wizards Orcs and mighty Eagles. Story takes place right in the beginning of Jackson franchise, while the fellowship do their business, 3 new heroes travel to North with a task to stop right hand command of Sauron Agandaur. Game is mix of hack and slash and RPG elements like levelling your character and equip him with various weapons and armor to make him better. The strong point of game is 3 player coop, while you can enjoy the game alone you can do it better with 2 other friends. I would recommend this game only to LOTR fans or if you like fantasy go and grab it. But be warned If you want to play coop the better way will be to have 2 other friends with you, because playing with random people will break all the fun.			",365,12,2,16,14,1,17

												The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is an Action RPG developed by Snowblind Studios in 2011 and released PC, PS3 and Xbox360. (Yes, this game is an obvious console port.)The story is based on the events taking place in the northern regions of Middle-earth in the background of the main story of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, more specifically in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy universe. Players can choose one of three heroes who will journey to different locations to help aid in the War. Their actions help the Fellowship in a way that is not seen in the films or books.The graphics for this game while a little dated still looks quite nice with varied and sometimes quite beautiful environments. Music and sound are appropriately ""Lord of the Rings'ish"" and voice work is competently done.Combat is nice and fluid, and looks brutal with decapitations and abundance of blood splashing everywhere although it looks comical and more then a little strange when a blunt weapon like a staff can decapitate an enemy as well as a sword or axe. Co-op with 2 other friends can be quite enjoyable.With all that being said, this game is very buggy. In fact the bug was so bad, that I actually cannot finish the game due to a game stopping bug that i encountered at ""Bargrisar"". After killing him, the game just doesn't allow me to continue and I am simply stuck. This is only one of the many game stopping bugs as I have seen forum posts of how others are also stuck in similiar situations in later parts of the game, with no way to continue the game other then to replay and hope it doesn't happen again.Another annoying bug is that there is no way to turn off the ingame voice chat. It is horribly implemented, and is alot more trouble then it is worth. The worst thing about all of these is that the developers have already abandoned this game and there will not be any more patches produced to address all these problems.Overall Rating: 1 / 10I cannot honestly recommend this game to anyone as I myself was not able to complete the game due to the game stopping bug I encountered after about 9 hours into the game.This could have been a fantastic co-op game and had it not been plagued by all these technical issues, I could have given it a 7.0.

												The LOTR game we all wanted to see with all its blood and gore, War in the North delivers great storyline, awesome gameplay and marvelous landscapes. The world of J.R.R Tolkien is once again recreated in this game, inhabited with Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Wizards Orcs and mighty Eagles. Story takes place right in the beginning of Jackson franchise, while the fellowship do their business, 3 new heroes travel to North with a task to stop right hand command of Sauron Agandaur. Game is mix of hack and slash and RPG elements like levelling your character and equip him with various weapons and armor to make him better. The strong point of game is 3 player coop, while you can enjoy the game alone you can do it better with 2 other friends. I would recommend this game only to LOTR fans or if you like fantasy go and grab it.

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a third person hack 'n' slash game that allows you to slip in to one of three roles. That of a dwarven bruiser's, a dunedain ranger's or a Elvish Lorekeeper's.Their story begins in Bree, where Aragorn instructs them on a mission to venture to the north in order to secure safety of the ringbearer's journey towards Bree. Not only is the story played in War in the North very canon with Tolkien's universe, it also lets you experience several characters that are famous in the story.Radagast, Aragorn, Arwen, Elrond, Bilbo and many more are to be met throughout your journey.You will experience what it actually means to slowly become a very important part of a story as you venture to make your own story in the north while the ring goes east.The gameplay itself is crisp and you will rarely ""slip"" or not hit your target that you intended to hit. There is a levelling system that makes it all the more appealing and your armor upgrades in time with you as you find it as well.This game is best played co-operational with either one or two friends, a maximum of three players is allowed and each of them has their unique role.I can recommend this game to as good as every Tolkien lover out there. But also to those who have not yet experienced a story of Tolkien.With that in mind, I can only say, buy this game if you want to have a lot of fun.I estimate a 3 day (72 hour) playtime of the game, excluding challenges.

												This is the worst piece of garbage co-op game I have played in a very long time. I play with people who are on the other side of the world and whenever this piece of turd freezes for a few seconds, I get desync'd and get disconnected from the host. Half of the time after I get disconnected I cannot rejoin the host and he has to restart his session to allow me back in.This turd also has a bad habit of corrupting save files after desync issues. You can get permanently stuck in some boss fights if you reconnect after a desync. The boss won't be there PLUS you can't progress the story. We managed to fix it once by loading on top of the corrupted save. The second time it happened, the same trick did not work and now I am stuck with a corrupt save which in turn keeps crashing my game right after I click start to try and get to the main menu.!@#@ % !%!#(%$ @^*)# $@ !@#$EDIT 1: Finally finished the game. I had to delete corrupted saves both locally and from the cloud save folder before my crash on start issue disappeared. That was quite TEDIOUS.			",1696,736,69,252,221,20,307

												My first refund!This is nothing special, just another quick cash grab to capitalize on the success of the movies. It's half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring, and wasn't even worth the discounted price.The animations are terrible, there's absolutely no physics, the customization options are a joke (you can pick from 5 hairstyles, eye colors, face presets, and beards), your character is CONSTANTLY running around with their weapon drawn, even when in a city, combat is shallow and unsatisfying, gameplay, on the whole, is just unimaginative, repetitive and not fun at all. I only bought this, because it was discounted, and because of the co-op option. And it did look kinda fun on the videos, but the second you start playing this crap, you realize that you made a mistake buying it. It's just not a good game.			",55,6,0,7,7,0,4

												Despite the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and the painfully linear gameplay, I thought the game had a nice plot and was extremely impressed by the lore. The gameplay mechanics are okay, though the AI's a tad bit over-powered at times. There is much desired in terms of combat tutorials. The voice acting was decent. Poor optimization as game crashes quite frequently, so much so you can get a steam achievement if there was one for game crashing. But, despite all the shortcomings, I seemed to like the game. However, 15 hours and 28 achievements later, my game suddenly goes Memento (anyone see the movie?) and my save game starts from ""barrow-downs"". Hours of grinding, 'gathering' and upgrading just [SAQUISHHH!!!... blub blub blub blub] down the toilet. I saw a couple of forum posts, which confirms that this issue does exist and the devs have shelved this a long time ago. Will I replay? Nah-uh, this is the end of the road for me.

												From the look of it, i want to like the game.Good lore, actually pretty decent likenesses to the Films Well-known characters,except a few (copyright issues, or some geek wanting to refute PJ's choices?).And if you string the cut scenes and the few RPG moments, you have the making of a good start to a RPG...And thats all the good things there are to say about this game...You can play 3 different characters, but its basically just 1.And just 1 save...It crashes 2 out of 3 times (even in single player) on a ""recommended"" system...About the controls, the best thing you can say its based on a classic awsd FPS,but in combat there is no control whatsoever to which target you will hit,and even the minor opponents will kill you in 3 hits, while you have to hit each 3-5 times plus a finishing move... (and thats on Normal difficulty)Plusses and minusses?+ lore friendly, and fits in with PJ's vision of LOTR- EVERYTHING ELSEScore: 1 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game for fans of the LOTR series. Storyline is very good but combat is pretty repeative. It's your basic hack and slash game put to a LOTR theme. It is obviously a good game, just get it on sale. 10/10			",108,12,1,9,3,1,5

												Are you looking for a blast from the past? Being capable of magic, but not walking through grass (i.e. invisible walls)? Having AI companions stand in door openings, and needing to face a very specific way so you can interact with an object? And finally, having your computer freeze completely and needing to manually power off your PC, like in the Windows XP days? Then look no further, this game is just for you!I really wanted to like this game because of the LOTR setting, but in the second chapter the game began crashing after playing for a bit. I tried running in administrator mode and assigning fewer CPU cores, but to no avail. Rolling back to ancient drivers? No thanks. Combined with the quite generic combat, the game may not be worth the time investment for troubleshooting.			",37,9,2,7,3,0,0

												Worst RPG experience ever.and one of the worst LOTR.A big disappointment for me1)Long boring♥♥♥♥♥QUESTS,with no meaning of traveling all these distance..It reminds more than an OLD style MMORPG than an rpg(coop too game).2)Long boring GAMEPLAY,with slow moves,and stupid animations,that cant focuses in 360 degrees.3)The MOBS,are stupid as ♥♥♥♥,going around without trying to avoid you.The bosses are also stupid AI,and the best is that you cant avoid all the attacks of them.4)The music has no place in the game at any point.5)The EFFECTS are ridiculous awful.6)The story it self sucks,a fictional♥♥♥♥♥♥that has no place in the universe of the LOTR or soever.7)The characters are fictional too,with no life to know or characteristics to remember..8)The player customization are♥♥♥♥♥♥few choices and lame changes.9)The inventory is nothing much special as the skill tree too.At the end,if you want to loose time from your life,go on,this is the perfect game for it,besides, 2659 USERS agrees with it.And the performance it's still sucky!Plus NO SOUND options for the VOIP4.5/10			",358,74,24,23,30,2,21

												I am a big fan of the lord of the rings and have thouroughly enjoyed every game i've played. LOTR Conquest has it's up's and down's. I purchased the game with my friend intending to play co-op, but after 10 minutes of play we cannot join each others game. This just completely ruined the game for us, but i continued by myself playing the single player mission. But of course that wouldn't work aswell. The game continues to crash and is just unplayable. 7/10 - Fun game to play (If playable)			",13,4,1,1,4,0,2

												*Hi, it seems like we have a licence for LOTR! Should we do something with it?-Sure! But what?*I don't know...- Nobody plays RTS anymore. Let's make an FPS!*That would be cool, but we can't make COD out of it, can we?-Yeah, that's probably true. ♥♥♥♥ it then. Let's make an RPG.*Right. But RPGs are complex, hard to make. It's a lot of work.-Meh, OK. Let's make a basic movement system. Some clicky combat. Some basic attributes and skills. And equipment here and there. Could it be any more simpler?*I don't think so. OK, we are gonna make an RPG then!I think it went something like this. It's absolutely uninspired. Unbelievably average in every way. Surprisingly boring. OK, maybe not surprisingly, I was out of big words, sorry.You have three boring characters to choose from and you can switch between them. From time to time they get an item which has some number a little bit higher then your current item. After clicking sufficient number of enemies to death you can put few points into attributes and choose from one of three skills and their passive upgrades.Add not too bad (but good either) graphics, average story and dull sound.It's not a bad game. But it definitely is not a good one. Why would you waste your money and more importantly your time with it if there are hundreds of better games. Just don't.			",315,71,4,104,21,1,66

												I suspect that the reason Snowblind Studios was folded into Monolith after this game's release is that Warner Bros. knew that the brand had lost all value. It's been mentioned before in more generous reviews and I'll say it again; if you're using an AMD processor then you're screwed because these mothereffers never issued a patch.Nor do I forgive the pathetic attempt at an original story which is actually just some cookie cutter clones of LotR legends peripherally embroiled in the same old story. Middle Earth is a vast world with vast history beyond that nasty ring business. How many times must it be told?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is more fun than what I thought it would be. My first though was a low budget single player MMORPG, I were wrong. The game handles and looks nice, and it keeps to the LOTR lore, so it does not take a thing that never even got mentioned or existed in the LOTR lore. Grab this game, get two friends, and play. If you love LOTR, buy it. If you don't really care or have watched the movies and thought ""Meh"" buy it anyhow, it is so fun, I don't really care about the lore, I care more about slicing orcs heads off! :3			",373,57,13,45,35,2,38

												PROS+ Three classes.+ If alone, the other classes are played by the AI.+ Character modification+ Lore-Master can learn to dual wield. So, staff + one hand weapon. Best part of the game for that character.+ Standard attack (medium to fast speed) and critical attack (slow speed)+ Every class can attack melee and far distance.CONS- The characters do not sound like the movies characters voice-wise (Aragorn, Frodo, Gandalf etc.).- Items are WAY overpriced.- Playing as the Lore-Master is pretty damn hard considering that her job entails her not to get hit hard, which always happens regardless.- Lore-Master main staff magic is a joke.- I feel that the Lore-Master's mana is way too low, considering that it should be her main attack :/ .- Cannot modify names.- No real character modification, or at least only a minimal possibility.- No way to bring up a map to see what you should do.- There doesn't seem to be a way to go back to where you were once you use a portal. At least, my friend and I did not find such a way to do so.- It seems the game is only between 12-20 hours according to many people.			",57,9,1,19,16,0,35

												Well at the start it was working fine, but lately it's been crashing CONSTANTLY. Maybe it's just because of the part of the game on in, I'm at the part where you have to explore the burrows and cave networks. For whatever reason this part is graphical intense, not sure if it's because of how many mobs are on the scream at one time, or if it has something to do with all the animations and special effects. I'm HOPING that once I clear this section of the game it'll stop crashing as much, but all I know is that it's very hard to play the game when it crashes every 20 minutes. I really can't say it's poorly optimized, I mean, the original game was on PS2 so it is an older game but as I said already it was running just fine at the very begining of the game.

Posted: September 9, 2015
												**TL;DR This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Dragon Age: Origins, which came out a year earlier. If you want this kind of experience, then go play that as a dual wielder. War In The North is a brand-riding money grab that's repetitve, boring, and has LoTR as it's one and only thing that anyone could possibly like this game. Srsly go read the wiki for the story, this game is not worth it.***The one thing this game has going for it is the fact that it takes place in the LoTR universe. The aesthetics and the graphcs are mediocre, the voice acting is actually pretty good, but the game play is pretty bad.The controls are unresponsive and wonky, the level design is not obvious, the enemies are repetitive and boring... I got to the part after the stream of sappers and was just too bored to continue. Oh look, I axed another one. Oh wait, I'm the archer because I'm an idiot and they make you buy arrows instead of giving them to you. Let's be the mage..... aaaaand she's a healer.What the means is that this game is CLEARLY MEANT TO BE PLAYED AS THE DWARF. If I have to spend my money on arrows (because you do not find enough to not buy them), then my equipment is going to be lacking. I'll let the AI control that. If you're going to play a healer for NPCs then you're either too lazy to play and just want the story or you're too lazy to read the summary on Wiki. Either way, letting the computer shoot unlimited arrows and toss heals at you is really the only way it makes sense to play this game. I know this because the dwarf wa the last class I played and it was the only way I could even tolerate this game. I fought the troll as the Ranger... which basically meant I watched my teammates do Up-Downs like it's pre-season football.Which really lends insight into this game. Why even have those other classes if they're so much less effective than the dwarf? Really, the entire game just seems like a brand-riding money grab to me. Even the death animations on the enemies are repetitive... The game really holds no new interesting thingsdo I fly in the face of Mostly Positive reviews? I don't really know, to be honest. This game is really just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dragon's Age: Origins, which came out a YEAR EARLIER.			",601,108,15,61,101,4,77

												The game itself is a lot of fun if you enjoy standard hack and slash games. However, it isn't without issues. Lots of issues. After struggling through crash after crash and disconnect after disconnect throughout the game, the last bit at Carn Dum is nigh unplayable, even after lowering all settings to minimum and switching to windowed mode. As I stated, the game itself is fun, but it's just so hard to recommend a game with such poor optimization.			",212,51,3,35,20,3,43

												**TL;DR This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Dragon Age: Origins, which came out a year earlier. If you want this kind of experience, then go play that as a dual wielder. War In The North is a brand-riding money grab that's repetitve, boring, and has LoTR as it's one and only thing that anyone could possibly like this game. Srsly go read the wiki for the story, this game is not worth it.***The one thing this game has going for it is the fact that it takes place in the LoTR universe. The aesthetics and the graphcs are mediocre, the voice acting is actually pretty good, but the game play is pretty bad.The controls are unresponsive and wonky, the level design is not obvious, the enemies are repetitive and boring... I got to the part after the stream of sappers and was just too bored to continue. Oh look, I axed another one. Oh wait, I'm the archer because I'm an idiot and they make you buy arrows instead of giving them to you. Let's be the mage..... aaaaand she's a healer.What the means is that this game is CLEARLY MEANT TO BE PLAYED AS THE DWARF. If I have to spend my money on arrows (because you do not find enough to not buy them), then my equipment is going to be lacking. I'll let the AI control that. If you're going to play a healer for NPCs then you're either too lazy to play and just want the story or you're too lazy to read the summary on Wiki. Either way, letting the computer shoot unlimited arrows and toss heals at you is really the only way it makes sense to play this game. I know this because the dwarf wa the last class I played and it was the only way I could even tolerate this game. I fought the troll as the Ranger... which basically meant I watched my teammates do Up-Downs like it's pre-season football.Which really lends insight into this game. Why even have those other classes if they're so much less effective than the dwarf? Really, the entire game just seems like a brand-riding money grab to me. Even the death animations on the enemies are repetitive... The game really holds no new interesting thingsdo I fly in the face of Mostly Positive reviews? I don't really know, to be honest. This game is really just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dragon's Age: Origins, which came out a YEAR EARLIER.			",601,108,15,61,101,4,77

												If you can connect to your co op partner, this is a great game! If you can't, and play single player, dull days lay ahead. This game feels rushed, and may be frustrating, as it stutters for me. But I reinstalled it recently because of fond memories I had playing co op with my brother. I am 60+/40-. Therefore I recommend it, just get it someone else as it is NOT worth $70. Have fun!-=[Doms]=- Sir Englishman15/10/2014			",348,61,15,26,35,5,47

												TLDR: No.0 stars.  0/0.  Terrible out of crap.  It may be a decent game, but me and my two buddies never got past the matchmaking screen because the game forces you to use a crappy version of steam chat (which, somehow, is even worse than steam chat).  And, yes, I know there is a ""workaround,"" but that's unacceptable.  It's a simple fix that whoever developed this game decided that they were too lazy to fix.Okay.  I'm done.			",33,11,1,15,4,0,6

												War in the North is an unexpected highlight. If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings, enjoyed the setting in Skyrim and especially if you are not afraid of some repetitive but challenging Hack'n'Slay action, you might find this game entertaining. I bought it for 5 EUROS and I have to say these are besides of the one I payed for Left4Dead2 the best invested 5 Euros since a long for a game. I enjoy a lot the graphics, especially the great 3d vision support, the music and the unique Lord of the Rings atmosphere. The fighting system starts poor, but gets better while playing and let you really take part in its evolution. Overall, you should give the game a chance as I am sure it will entertain you much longer than some AAA titles for 10 times more of the price. Btw, it has also a great Coop-Modus with some minor glitches. At the moment there are still some players, so you should hurry up, if you want to enjoy this feature. Overall I give it for 8/10 as I am already addicted, even with way too many weird glitches the game sometimes has. But what counts in the end is not if a game is full with different feature, but if it can entertain for quite some time and there War in the North makes far more right than it messe up: 8/10.

												Too repetitive game, gets boring after some hours. Also many bugs in co-op multiplayer like connection time out, funny glitches, etc. The game is also very bad at xp gaining, you only gain xp when giving enemies the final blow, xp is not shared when playing co op.The worst thing was the mic setup in co op multiplayer, you are forced to use steam mic, if you use skype or discord there will be echo, unless you use a fix (virtual mic for steam).EDIT; I was mistaken, there are some kind of shared xp through co op, and the final blows are bonus xp, still I never noticed any form of shared xp though, and the game is still boring in my opinion.

												Before you hit Buy (if you're one of the few who didn't get it as a Bundle), know all the drawbacks going in:-Clearly designed from the ground-up for console play.-Irritatingly clunky equipment system, featuring an annoying equipment degradation system that takes you out of the action pretty regularly for no reason.-Voice chat is set to ALWAYS ON NO MATTER WHAT, and multiplayer features generally integrate poorly (please wait for your friend to stop dicking around in his inventory before you can do anything!)-By the numbers plot, though certainly not the worst of the LOTR expanded universe games (still far better than The Third Age RPG).-Leveling trees are not balanced at all, with trap options aplenty.If you can withstand all that, there's an entertaining hack and slash game here. If you can't, well, the other games in the bundle were far better anyway.			",306,27,6,26,17,1,56

												I'll preface this by saying that my negative recommendation is conditional: if you strongly enjoy Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of the Rings, and your computer doesn't use an ATI video card, and the game is on sale, then you should buy it.  It will be worth your while to play through it at least once.This game gets some things right.  The story and voice work are good.  The art design feels a bit over-wrought and generic at times, but for the most part it does a good job of maintaining the feel of the Jackson films.  It's also clear that the developers were careful to ensure that the game's events do not contradict Tolkien's work.  These aspects of the game are all much-appreciated.Where the game fails for me is the actual ""game"" part of the game.  War in the North feels as though it was developed by people who have a general idea of what a hack-and-slash game is, but don't understand any of the nuances required to make a GOOD hack-and-slash game.For one, dodge-rolling: does it have invulnerability-frames, or does it not?  I'm honestly not sure because it seemed like even odds whether it would allow me to actually evade an attack.For another, stun-locking: it often feels as though every hit sustained by the player causes you to be staggered.  Scoring hits on enemies, however, rarely ever interrupts their actions.  Some late-game enemies combine flurry attacks and staggering in such a way that you can't really fight back.Hitboxes and hurtboxes: this game has some of the sloppiest hitboxes and hurtboxes I've seen (essentially, invisible regions in and around character models which determine whether or not attacks connect).  Even when playing as the game host, I frequently found myself taking damage from hammer strikes and sword strokes that very visibly missed my character model by several feet.Lack of impact: this one isn't as severe as the above problems, but the combat lacks any sense of weight when attacks connect.  When fighting enemies that don't stagger you every other hit, the only indication you have that you've been hit is a sudden reduction of your health bar.  It took me a moment to realize why it felt this way, and I eventually realized that the game doesn't have hit-frames (I think that's what they're called).  Dragon's Dogma (a significantly better polished hack-and-slash experience) demonstrates this pretty well: when an attack connects in DD, it's often accompanied by your character's animation hanging for an extra frame or two at the instant of impact.  It gives the impression of your weapon colliding with the enemy (or the enemy's weapon colliding with you!).If the gameplay exhibited the same high production values as the art design and voice work, then giving this a thumbs-up would be a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, War in the North's gameplay ends up being the worst thing about the game.			",124,4,0,14,4,0,6

												I would have not played much of this game without playing it cooperatively with a friend. Its not very good. Combat is stiff and floaty at the same time without having any depth and is only slightly better than MMO garbage. Not just that but you are near constantly in that combat and it feels quickly that you are just going through the motions to get to the next area to do the same things over and over. The RPG elements and UI are confusing at first but its not a huge issue but the UI is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Also me and my friend had some trouble with in game VOIP. The game constantly has VOIP transmiting between the players and its low quality and laggy. You cannot turn this off in game. Some googling and we figured it out (something to do with setting line in or whatever as recording device, idk google it noob) but that should have never been an issue.This game is an RPG and it suffers from the RPG garbage. I dont want to waste time talking to people in a town and helping them find their sweetrolls or whatever waste of time you get from quest givers. I just want to run in and hack some brothers up. The amount of dialogue in situations is exacerbated by the fact the combat isn't very good. So its waste time talking to a bird that drones on and on so you can go back to jamming two or 3 buttons and going through the motions.Developers should have learned from the original games that were directly based on the movies. The ones that were released on PS2, and I expect PC and Xbox aswell (they share the same names as the movies, Return of the King, Two Towers). That was years ago but they are still miles ahead of this game and were very fun. They were less RPG and more action hack and slash and fun as hell in splitscreen or solo. Those were probably the best LOTR games I have played thus far, the RTS games were okay but not that great. They were solid games I suppose. But this one. Awe hell no.Unless you really like LOTR or the lore or whatever the gameplay probably won't keep you for long. Friendly AI is crap and unless you have 3 players you will have an AI with you. To summarize, its a crappy RPG hack and slash with poor gameplay and uninteresting combat, poor graphics, uninspiring sound, and crappy RPG elements. Its just crap.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												The Lord of the Rings is among the greatest fantasy epics ever told, and after the success of the movie franchise a bevy of tie-ins products, side stories, and other media was created to expand the universe. Snowblind’s newest action title is set in the land of Middle Earth but does not follow the paths of Frodo, Aragorn, or Gandalf; instead it tells an entirely new story. The Lord of the Rings: War in the North acts as a side car to the main storyline, telling of the heroic deeds of three brave warriors whose actions directly impacted the success of the Fellowship. Grab your axe, sharpen your swords, and get ready to kill some orcs.The human ranger Eradan, dwarven warrior Farin, and elven spellcaster Andriel receive a perilous mission from Aragorn while staying at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. Sauron is after the Ring of Power, and an unknown force is amassing an army in the northern reaches of Middle Earth. Fearing this resistance will spell doom for Frodo as he ventures into Mordor, Aragorn asks the three warriors to investigate the northern regions and act as a distraction to keep Sauron’s looming eye away from the Hobbits. Though the mission is assuredly a death wish, the Ring must be destroyed, and the three willingly accept. As their adventure progresses, Eradan, Farin, and Andriel encounter and recruit the Great Eagles, journey to the elven city Rivendell, and discover Sauron’s henchman Agandaur to be the culprit. The story runs parallel to the story from the books, so you’ll frequently hear updates on the Fellowship’s progress to Mount Doom, which is pretty cool. Though not as epic as the main storyline, War in the North does offer intriguing morsels of narrative that fans of Lord of the Rings will surely enjoy. Ever wonder why Frodo didn’t just fly on the back of an Eagle to get to Mount Doom? Well, you can find out why in this game. War in the North does a great job capturing the feel of the movies (not the books) in terms of atmosphere: you’ll feel like you’re in Middle Earth, but you won’t feel a lot of tension. Agandaur is indeed evil, but there’s never a feeling of looming destruction like there was in the source narrative. Interesting segments will pique your curiosity but all too often you’ll feel like War in the North’s story is entirely inferior to the Tolkien-authored classic.Snowblind Studios is no stranger to the action RPG genre, having created PS2 greats such as Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath. War in the North plays similarly to these other titles. As you eviscerate countless orcs you’ll find better loot to equip and gain levels to grow stronger. Increasing in level allows you to advance further in a trio of skill trees which grant special powers such as firing multiple arrows at once, or healing spells restoring more life. The drive to find more loot and gain more levels is satisfying and acts as the main motive to keep playing. Seeing your character decked out in new armor and knowing a better helmet or sword could be around the corner can be addictive.Eradan is the most versatile of the three characters and can use a range of weapons and armors. Farin specializes in axes and hammers and is more of a tank class, while Andriel focuses on healing and support spells while using staves. Though there’s variety in the way each character handles, combat gets repetitive. Killing hordes of orcs is fun at first, but after the first ten waves of slaughter the game feels stale. The new abilities unlocked by leveling up only dampened the monotony for a short while. Even playing with two friends can feel boring at times, as you mindlessly mash the attack buttons, dodge roll from a troll’s club, and mash attack buttons again, occasionally calling for help or healing yourself.Some other gameplay weaknesses mar things further. If you fall in battle your allies can bring you back to your feet (sort of like Gears of War), but getting hit once while trying to revive an ally stops the process of healing altogether. This can make reviving others near impossible once they fall because you’ll be surrounded by enemies. The AI for your teammates is actually quite good, but the same can’t be said for enemies. Oftentimes they will just walk into your attacks, and only block attacks after getting hit a few times first. Enemies execute the same attack patterns throughout the game, so recognizing attacks becomes simple and dodging them is too easy. Also, the game has a handful of boss characters, like a massive troll, powerful sorcerers, and even a huge spider, but many of them implement the same attack strategy. Overall the gameplay is mixed: a good loot and leveling system are taken down heavily by bland, uninspired combat.Visually War in the North has some great looking game environments. The draw distances in certain locations (like the top of the Grey Mountains) are stunning, and the amount of detail that has gone into creating each environment is a big highlight. From the muddy and wet town of Bree to the great Dwarven city in the mountains, War in the North’s backgrounds is easy on the eyes. Characters look good as well but getting up close reveals some rough edges, particularly with hair. Beards and hairstyles move as if they’re one solid piece and don’t flow naturally. It’s a minor complaint (honestly, which game has ever gotten hair completely right?), but one you’ll assuredly notice. War in the North is also very brutal, with hacked-off limbs and blood flying everywhere. As you slice up foes your characters will be covered in blood, which is a nice touch. Snow sticks on your armor and clothes as you climb through the mountain stages, and it’s these fine touches that make the game’s visuals standout.War in the North can be played solo or with up to two other players taking control of your other party members. While playing solo you level up your entire team and can switch between them before each new mission, but playing with others requires each player to have their own save game and profile. What this means is if you’ve started a game and want a friend to join you in local split-screen co-op you’re out of luck, because that person will have to have a separate save game. This really cuts down on the co-op appeal as you can’t just pick up and play. Online multiplayer lets you join friends via Xbox Live, but you have to be close in level and story to join them, otherwise you won’t be able to save your content or progression. If you can get a group together though, playing with friends is easily the best option for the game. Having a human ally instead of a computer one is invaluable when a formidable gang of orcs, or worse yet a duo of trolls, show up . Unfortunately some bugs hamper the multiplayer experience, both offline and on. While playing splitscreen, I encountered enemies that stood still while we attacked them and freezing during load screens. While online the same issue with enemies arose, as well as enemies appearing from nowhere and considerable lag with some players. Strangely these problems only arise during multiplayer, as my experience through the game by myself went by flawlessly.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a game of ups and downs. The story is decent at times but fails to compare to the magnitude of the original books’ story. Leveling up and getting new gear is fun, but the combat becomes repetitive quickly. Multiplayer should be the definitive method of play, but requiring profiles for each player and a few gameplay bugs don’t help. I’d recommend War in the North for anyone who simply loves The Lord of the Rings, but if you’re searching for a co-op action title you might look elsewhere.Only On Sale ",1534,600,45,244,159,15,219

Product received for free
												A really fun and entertaining game; the AI is actually useful, the combat is smooth and flows from fight to fight, the storyline seems to be fairly well-written... I wouldn't know however because I can't play it for more than 2 minutes at a time due to constant crashes.This game would be an 8/20 at least, if it worked. It is fantastic, the menus are a little sticky and multiple clicks needed to wake the game up and selet items/upgrades and the levels last minutes at a time meaning large amounts of loading, however the game loads a lot behind the scenes, meaning you have an almost perpetual loading icon at the bottom middle of your screen.Still, none of this would be a deal breaker and I would totally recommend geting it because its positives hugely outweigh its negative qualities BUT... and this is a big but with one great big issue:Since Steam thinks it is okay to sell to you a broken, incompatible game that wont play due to constant crashes and people like me can't fix these issues because I am not tech savvy in the slightest, I cannot recommend it.It's games like this, released like this that are the reason I mostly play console games...

												I had some expectations about this game aside from the good reviews. I was expecting a game like  LOTR Return of the King Game (2003) which was great and had awesome visuals despite its old age. But this was made in 2011 I guess and from game mechanics to visuals everything is much worse. The combat is sooo clunky, it takes like 10 hit to kill one enemy. Animations are also so slow. Cutscenes and dialogues are unnecessarily long and boring. It feels like a work rather than a game. I just can't enjoy killing orc/goblin masses because they don't die and sword animations are awful. The environment and the story are somewhat uninteresting... In short the game that was made back in 2003 is much better. I am disappointed. I hope that the Shadow of Mordor is better, I will try it next.			",147,59,5,12,18,4,33

												This is utter dog wank! There is an pre-done ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little voice communication thing which makes skype look like it came from the year 3000 thus is completely unusable. So as you can imagine you will want to use TeamSpeek or, if you were born with a brain discord.Oh wait you can't mute the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing which means that you will need to alter your settings in steam but of course that wont work because steam's ability to make a push to talk key is coparable to Theon Grayjoy's ability to hump meaning you can't just turn off your mike. At this point if you are using TS then you will be able to simply tell steam you are using a different mic then tell everything you are using your origional mic but if you are using discord then you are ♥♥♥♥ed because it links with steam to see which mic you are using.I loved this game on console but it is not playable on PC unless you can deal with the utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ software which comes with it. Oh and amazingly there is no suggestion that a patch is planned in the future so don't waste your money.			",51,1,0,9,3,0,3

												Go elsewhere for your brawler/LOTR fix!I'm sure it's fun with a party, but with all the bla-bla-bla story, countless cutscenes just to get to the actual fighting, and not much meat to the combat (2 regular melee, 1 finisher, and a ranged option) just makes this game feel like it got bogged down in systems and not really testedfor fun early on. I'm sure the late game's more fun without worrying about energy or ammo and having lots of skills. But I'll never get there because it's not worth it.			",138,35,4,4,8,1,9

												Good game that really needs to be played in co-op mode to get the full fun factor.The game itself has a lot against it. The inventory management system is terrible. You cannot switch between the different characters as often as you should be able to. The game has quite a few bugs, which depending on your graphics card (up to date AMD's) can make the game unplayable on chapter 2 and 8 meaning you have to roll back your drivers to an old version. (12.6 if you needed to know)There's a limited number of different baddies to kill on each level. This game completely over uses the Troll sub boss.But...Once you get into a game with a friend or two you'll soon forgive all this for the sheer joy of beating the living daylights out of whatever it is that needs beating. Cutting an Orc's head off never gets old with the slow-mo kill cam. The loot is varied and interesting, you will constantly be after that next bit of gear to give you a slight edge.Replayability is good, once you've completed the game you can use the same character with the same stats / gear and play through on a harder difficulty, upgrading your gear once again. Even the static rewards get better on higher difficulties.The graphics are, in my opinion, superb. The voice acting is great. The story is fun in a Tolkein is probably turning in his grave way.If you want an online co-op hack and slash and dont have the time or inclination to throw yourself at Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2, then this is a must buy7/10			",107,16,1,45,2,0,10

												The word of Middle-Earth can be regarded as the archetypal high-fantasy setting. Thus, it lends itself very well to games of this type: hack-and-slash fests with some light RPG'ish elements (leveling up, learning skills and upgrading weapons). LotR:WitN goes beyond the known lore of Tolkien though: Snowblind Studio's have put a lot of work in a story that branches from the Ringbearer's one. Most of the time, this works quite nice: a lot of the scenes you'll visit are familiar (Barrow Dows, Mirkwood etc.) but are presented in a fresh way. The game actually offers quite a lot of background to the regular books, which is nice for those who haven't read 'The Silmarillion' etc. (me among them).As a game, LotR:WitN is quite pleasing: you select one of three characters and smash all sorts of foes to blubber. Each character has it's own strenghts and weaknesses and you can switch in between chapters. One mechanic that didn't work well for me was blocking: I finished the game without using it a single time (mostly playing as a dwarf). Still, I enjoyed it quite a lot for it's story and graphics. All in all I recommend this to those who like LotR and action-games, especially when you can get it at a sale.  ",181,70,8,61,22,2,44

I wasnt interested in playing any of the other games in my library so I picked this up.  I was fully engaged for the time that I played because the mechanics are fluid and easy to use.  It reminds me of God of War in a way.  You don't play God of War for the story for most part, you playing for the feeling and enjoyment you get out fo the locations and controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an easy tossup between 'hot garbage' and 'dumpster fire.' Hideously ugly UI and models, unresponsive and sluggish combat that feels wimpy and ineffectual, lazy sound design, atrocious voice acting... Avoid this trash.			",357,107,10,40,40,3,33

												Grafiklerinin mükemmeliği, savaş görselliği, görevler, hikaye hepsi birbirinden güzel. Oyunun başlarında elde ettiğimiz silahların paslı olması daha sonraları bulduklarımızın tasarımı ve kalitesi gerçekten insanı mest edip hayran bırakıyor. Oyunun tek eksi yanı bence dövüş sırasıda pek fazla taktik kullanmaya gereksinim duymaması. Paldır küldür giriyoruz adamlara dövüş animasyonları güzel olsada ilerleyen zamanlarda oda sıkmaya başlıyor.			",140,24,3,27,15,1,14

It does have some replay value as you can never unlock all your skill in one playthrough and it's almost mandatory you play co-op after the first two chapters, if not you'll need to be keen eye'd and quick with the button presses, plays like a dream with an xbox controller. 8.2/10			",198,24,2,17,7,0,8

												To all who reads this review, I have been playing this game and i must say it is amazing!This game allows co-op mode and can have really cool weapons & attacks even multiplayer!The designers of the game decided to make it a hack + slash game.the ""gore"" option can now be accessed through options. These were the good things however, some things can improve on this game. Here are the things:If you can access other locations such as Moria, Barad-du ( Just like in lotr the third age)If you can defeat some cool bosses such as Sauron, Balrog of morgoth, watcher in the water etcIf you can help one of the fellowships in a battle ( Such as helping Gandalf defeat the Balrog in moria)Get the armor and weapons of Agandour after completing the gameThat is all! I would recommend this game! Have a fun time playing fans! I wish you good luck, Middle Earth needs you!!! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an excellent game that exceeded my expectations. It's the first LOTR game that actually presents battle sequences in a realistic fashion. The action is also intense and enjoyable, with limbs flying and heads rolling, sometimes on a slow motion camera. The replay value is also pretty high, since you can keep levelling up as you replay the story. The settings are amazing, and there is a very faithful and rich representation of Rivendell in the story. As far as nostalgia goes, this game hits home as well. You meet characters such as Aragorn, Gandalf, Elrond, and Bilbo along the way. This makes the overall experience much more enjoyable for fans. Bottom line, you should get this game... It's totally worth the money. 10/10			",66,4,0,4,1,0,2

												More an action game with RPG elements than an action-RPG, this is nonetheless an enjoyable ride for fans of the LOTR movie trilogy. Gameplay is entirely centered around the action combat, which is relatively simple but satisfying. The skill tree provides a good sense of power progression and allows some customisation of each character. Aesthetically the game clearly follows the movies, but thanks to the story that intersects but doesn't otherwise follow the LOTR story, there are plenty of new locations to see and new events to play through. There are plenty of hat-tips to Tolkiens lore ( a few goof-ups too, but not too bad) and a decent amount of expositional dialogue. Unfortunately there is little depth to the characters in your party, so they will remain somewhat bland in spite of the 20-30 hours you will spend fighting at their sides.The single-save system is a bit of an annoyance, and so is the limited control and interaction with the AI controlled party members if you play this solo. Technically it was fairly solid otherwise, but the german voiceovers were sometimes assigned to the wrong scenes. An unfixed glitch (imho) is that you can't give shields or potions to your companions.Overall I'd recommend this game to people interested in a LOTR game, that do not mind to have a somewhat constrained visit to middle earth pesented through linear stories and levels and lots of action combat.

												As a Lord of the Rings fan I must say it's a good game. It has a good story about the North. You can explore several locations such as Mirkwood, Grey Mountains, Rivendell and meet with a wide range of enemies. If you can play with your friends in coop that will help a lot, because if you only solo, the game is sometimes quite challenging. However there are some bugs in the game, which can be frustrating. All in all I recommend it to everbody who would like to expand their knowledge about Lord of the Rings.			",125,12,6,14,10,0,17

												Its a fairly short game where you run around and kill things. I played through the game once in 12 hrs. If you love LOTRO lore then this game is really interesting. It may have replayability for some people becasue everytime you beat it you unlock a harder difficulty and there are 3 characters to play as. I play games mostly for the storyline, so I do not really have any desire to replay it. I got this game through a Humble Bundle, so I got a really good deal on it. I would wait until it is on sale to buy it becasue I do not hink it is worth $20, but it was fun and entertaining.			",231,178,10,101,37,4,54

												Reminds me a lot of the old LoTR: Return of the King game, but much more fun and much harder. Enemies get progressively harder and harder to kill. Less knockback as they get harder meaning you need to block more. Lots of dodging. And nothing beats getting knocked down by a troll which has thrown a rock at you from across a room. This game is flipping fun, and although short (finished it in about 12 hours), replayability is sweet. would recommend/10.			",253,25,0,33,39,0,28

												This game is a good game overall, I enjoy playing it, and  we are on our second run through. The pros:Great story, great voice acting, very pretty, not too hard for someone who's not a serious gamer, yet challenging enough to keep the hard cores entertained. The cons: linear. very much so,it's fairly short at 17 hours (that's with doing EVERYTHING! all lore dialogue, and sidequests) and there are a few...ok several...major bugs that a non-beta game just should not have. This game, when it comes to bugs, makes me wonder if Bethesda put it out there. Most, are not a problem. Some, are downright infuriating. example: treasure reward gives choice, you choose, but oh look, it gave you something else in the box....  This has happened three times to me. Very annoying.   the rest, graphics, some inventory, some porting issues.  If you do not have a friend to play with, you will miss out on ALOT. We have not had the chance to play with three people yet, but having a bot to jump on the resurrections is nice, face it, humans are slow on uptake in the heat of battle sometimes.   I wish I could give a mixed reccomendation of this game, I highly reccomend playing it with a friend, but if you are alone, it's not nearly as fun.  7/10			",138,10,2,14,22,1,28

												Good game that really needs to be played in co-op mode to get the full fun factor.The game itself has a lot against it. The inventory management system is terrible. You cannot switch between the different characters as often as you should be able to. The game has quite a few bugs, which depending on your graphics card (up to date AMD's) can make the game unplayable on chapter 2 and 8 meaning you have to roll back your drivers to an old version. (12.6 if you needed to know)There's a limited number of different baddies to kill on each level. This game completely over uses the Troll sub boss.But...Once you get into a game with a friend or two you'll soon forgive all this for the sheer joy of beating the living daylights out of whatever it is that needs beating. Cutting an Orc's head off never gets old with the slow-mo kill cam. The loot is varied and interesting, you will constantly be after that next bit of gear to give you a slight edge.Replayability is good, once you've completed the game you can use the same character with the same stats / gear and play through on a harder difficulty, upgrading your gear once again. Even the static rewards get better on higher difficulties.The graphics are, in my opinion, superb. The voice acting is great. The story is fun in a Tolkein is probably turning in his grave way.If you want an online co-op hack and slash and dont have the time or inclination to throw yourself at Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2, then this is a must buy7/10			",107,16,1,45,2,0,10

												Excellent game! The story follows an amazing parallel to told by Tolkien in his trilogy. Hack and slash elements and diversification between the characters makes cooperation teamwork required in the major difficulties of the game. It is a great experience for lovers of the history of the Lord of the Rings seeking an adventure in the universe told by Tolkien for a different point of view.			",55,3,3,5,2,0,5

												This is a brilliant game. i have always enjoyed anything to do with Lord Of The Rings and this also has some of the best graphics i have seen on a comupter game i have ever seen, especially if your computer can run all the settings at maximum capacity, so i would highly recommend playing this game and trying all the grapich settings at full power.

												This is a fantastic LAN game to play with up to two friends. The combat is fast and fun, but there are several issues with the game that make it fall short of what it could be.Buying and equipping items is confusing and tedious. There is no easy way to compare items against one another, so the player is stuck flipping back and forth between menus to determine which items are better.An even more troubling issue is the last stage, which is unbeatable. It's not hard, but the game has crashed in the same place on the last stage every time, despite any changes to computer, graphics settings or playstyle thrown at it. Some players have been able to beat the game, but many more are simply unable.That said, if it's cheap and you want to kill an afternoon, this is a fun way to do it — just plan on the story cutting short about thirty minutes from the ending.

												This game is amazing if you have a buddy, lover, spouse... to play with.  I truly can't think of a better co-op experience.  Is just plain fun.  Spent a couple of hours playing this game and my husband and I are like dumbfounded that the game is so much fun.  We bought the game on the Summer Sale not thinking it would be all that great with the low Metascore, but really ignore the score.  This is one game you don't want to pass if you are looking for a solid co-op fanstasy experience.			",83,10,0,16,6,0,1

												An enthralling game about one of the many untold stories set during Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring. A thorougly enjoyable experience that should definitely be part of any Lord of the Rings fans collection.I had a great time playing this game several times through, agonizing over which pieces of armour I should keep, having friendly chats with several members of the Fellowship, and significant others, while playing the game through each time with a different character, forcing me to rethink my battle strategies every time.The only downside I found in this game is how overpowered the crossbow was. I managed to defeat the final boss (who is supposed to be the hardest in the game) in under a minute on heroic difficulty.			",40,2,0,6,1,0,8

												This is a good game and is incredibly underrated because it was overshadowed by Skyrim which came out a few days after its release which is a shame considering its a fun action rpg that greatly resemble games like Dark Alliance or the Champions of Norrath series. So if you like Lord of the Rings and action rpgs you should probably give this game a try.			",155,9,0,24,7,1,45

												The game steps into an alternate route of the little guys of the Ring War, who had significantly changed the odds of the war. The fighting style is farely straight forward, yet it has a bit of a stretigic factor to it. Overall, I think Lord of the Rings: War in the North is worth a 7.5 out of 10 rating.			",19,0,0,1,0,0,1

												Pleasantly surprised by this one. Yes it's a corridor hanck 'n' slash game with RPG elements (you level up and can place points in a skill tree), but what makes this game worth playing is the co-op mode.Ignore the Bad PC Port tag, it runs perfectly with no game breaking bugs fine on mine and my partners rigs, one being an i7 920 and the other being an i7 3770. My partner's card is a GTX 570, mine being a GTX770. Both rigs run on Win7 64Bit.Graphically it beats vanilla Skyrim, and the level design is fairly good and varied, even though you're in a 'corridor'. Also, equipping new armour and weapons nearly always rewards you with a cool new look, as well as boosting your stats ! The voice acting is also good, and not being elitist about Tolkien's tales I actually enjoyed the (yes fairly unoriginal) story. Hell you even get to meet the main characters from the trilogy.If you and your partner, or a couple of mates want a good blast I'd recommend picking it up in a sale.			",40,5,0,8,5,0,3

												This game is a ton of fun, expecially when you play co-op through the capaign with friends, but there is one MAJOR downside. Aafter about 8.5 hours of gamplay (Chapter 4 Final Mission, and other places chapter 5 and later on) that glitches happen that ""Break the game"". What i mean by this is WiTN didnt detect that you completed a mission, even though you did, so it wont let you advance throughout the rest of the campaign. I gave this game a ""Yes"" rating because it is extemley fun and the story is also very good.			",92,2,6,11,8,0,1

The visuals are amazing and although the combat is brutal that is the only thing that after a while gets rather repetitive. With a storyline running alongside the lord of the rings trilogy it adds even more depth in the LOTR branch. With familiar faces and some pretty cool special moves I believe that this game is definatley worth the full price!			",91,16,0,18,7,0,6

												Rating: 8/10Extra Info: Kinda has a Dragon Age 1 feel to it, but with a faster pace to it.So I came into this game thinking that it would suck because it wasn't about the Fellowship, but it's actually pretty decent. Great way to pass time, pretty fun and it has some pretty good graphics as well. I recommend NOT playing on easy. It started me off on Normal, but I got stuck in the Barrow-Downs with NO heath or power potions and no way to get through to the next store or get back to the last town so I thought this game was SUPER hard, it's not really. You just have to stock up on supplies. Easy is just WAY too easy, still fun though and I'm looking forward to my next playthrough on a harder difficulty. Oh just a friendly tip, DON'T give NPCs items... EVER. They will be lost forever, sell anything you aren't using or change the character and give THAT player the items. Never NPCs though. You've been warned. lol.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game isn't bad, for the price. It is however highly repetative, it's basically just a giant fight from one section to another in a very linear path. There isn't a very strong story, or very existant for that matter and the voice over is terrible, aragorn sounds a little like a 12 year old girl. Also you play as basically a less funny, less effective man, dwarf and elf. Other than that the game is actually relatively enjoyable for the price just nothing to get blown away with.

												Oh my god, do not get this. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is quite fun, especially with friends or family or potential romance options for Half life 3 DLC: The buggering. Having played it with two other men (Oh yah baby), we all discovered, and this is remembering we all had pretty good pcs, that the game uses about 90-97% of your CPU when running. Which considering we were also running Skype and Steam in the background, is pushing it to the edge. Not to mention most other games use about... 10% CPU tops, making this a♥♥♥♥♥♥take. There is also no solution to this problem as the programmers who made the game were sacked the day after it was released. Classic. Also, if you are playing it with friends, be prepared for an absolute nightmare of a time with voice chat. It seems almost impossible to turn off the built in Steam Voice chat (which is free, but just awful), and use something else like Skype or Ventrillo. We spent about forty minutes just fannying around, trying to stop the voice chat coming on even when it was turned off! Get it for the PS3 or Xbox or something, just don't get it for your PC, it will eventually blue screen you.			",208,33,1,43,23,1,43

												This game is by far the most exiting lord of the rings game i have ever played. This story takes place during the time frodo makes his journey to mount doom to destroy the ring and while he and his companions are doing what they did in the movies or any other game, there are 3 new hero's who are taking on the armys on mordor by themselfs in the north. The main antagonist (Agandaur) is Sauron's right hand man who leads a army to take control of the north. So our hero's Eradan (Ranger class) Andriel (Elven Loremaster) and Farin (Champion class) go north to try and stop this menace before it gets out of control.For all of you perfectiest who like to get every achievement in games you will have to play this game more then once to do so, (well unless your a bad♥♥♥♥♥ So if you want my opinion buy this game			",56,6,0,7,8,0,4

												I would say get this game only if you wish to play CO-OP with some friends. Even then you and your friends will have to work through many bugs and setting error's to get the game just right for your enjoyment. And one very annoying setting was the fact that the Microphone is always on, when you play with others that are using headsets or have any microphone's setup on thier computers.The AI companions seem to have a nack for staying out of the combat leaving you more to hold the bag when it comes to Melee Combat. They would never equipt the better equipment that was presented to them, unless by some chance of fate they finally decide to equipt it, 15 levels later.This game did take a bit of time for me to go through all my loot and spend time matching armor sets to get better stat bonuses to have a better combat experience. But, you end up waisting a bit of time especially when you are gaming with friends. Aside from the various game crashes we had and disconnections while we each took turns hosting the game. We finally completed the game. Will we play it again any time soon... Unkown. But, we did manage to have fun all the way up to the end.I would still say unless you know others that are into this series, don't really bother getting the game.			",309,124,1,56,58,2,53

												If a slightly more than casual co-op hack 'n' slash set in Middle Earth sounds appealing, then you should buy LOTRTWITN.  (fun acronym, innit?)  If you want something deeper to play by yourself, then you will probably want to look elsewhere.War in the North is essentially Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance set in Tolkien's universe. By that, I mean you and your AI/co-op partners will hack, combo, loot and sever your way through several chapters of ... who cares.  While the setpieces are faithfully drawn from Peter Jackson's LotR films, the story itself is not that important. Heroes will triumph in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, and bad guys will deliver gutteral dialogue through the rugged steel spikes of their helmets. If nothing else can be said for the story, it at least gives the eagles an excuse for not simply flying Frodo to Mt. Doom to begin with. (not a specific spoiler, but yes -- there are eagles)Combat involves stringing combos together and landing stronger attacks when enemies are critical. In a way, that system reminds me of the original Witcher.  (tho very basic)  Leveling up gets you three attribute points and one to invest in skills.  Diabloesque ability trees allow you to play as you desire (to an extent), though melee combat remains relevant for every class. Further Diablo inspiration can be seen in the item ""sets"" you can combine for cumulative stat bonuses. All three classes have their own gameplay styles and the ability to discover hidden loot. The game is not a simple brawler: some areas and boss fights will require more than button-mashing and spamming skills. For tough foes that can knock you down, the dodge/roll ability is your friend.Presentation-wise, this game is behind the times. It runs on a souped-up version of a 2001 engine. While Snowblind has added some flourishes to remain relevant, it looks more like an early 360 era ('06) game than something released in 2011. The bland (but passable) visuals hold close enough to the film's art design. Just don't expect anything to write home about. We encountered a few frustrating glitches while playing, but they did not repeat. 360 controller support makes this a nice game to play from a couch, but the keyboard & mouse work fine for those used to already doing so.General sound design seems fine and supports my 5.1 system, but there seems to be an unresolved issue where the game has a permanently open mic in multiplayer. (so you hear quiet echoes if there's speaking in the room) The music ranges from fine to slightly distracting. I don't know whether it was a licensing issue or creative decision to forgo the musical scoring of the films, but it might have helped give the game a grander feel.Like many co-op titles, it's best played with friends to be experienced at its fullest potential.  If you have to fly solo, you may find this to be a disappointing experience. Either way, I'd say it's best purchased at sale price.			",216,32,4,17,10,1,15

This is a known problem in the game and many people experience this very same issue but cannot be resolved by the gamers, only by the devolpers. The game has been here for about 3 years, why the hell isn't this fixed yet?Apart from the game breaking crash in the end mission the game stays fun up untill that point. Its even more fun when you can play the campaign with friends in coop! For a cheap price its still a must buy.			",154,11,3,22,8,1,19

												It's great fun. If you're looking for serious depth, you really aren't going to find it here. But it's a fun romp through the Tolkien universe, with plenty of action and satisfying battles strewn liberally throughout the levels. There seems to always be something to do and somwhere to go, and while I can't comment on the length as I have yet to beat it, it does seem like one of those games where you get what you put into it. Play with friends if you can, though. The AI is okay, but doesn't open secret areas and is pretty useless in a fight except for picking you back up when you inevitably get skullcrushed by the swarm of goblins they let slip past them. Also, Dwarf. The Dwarf is hilarious to play. Little man, big beard, bigger axe, chopping off legs left and right; what's not to love? Lastly, on reports of glitchyness and general bugginess; I've had no problems whatsoever. No visual hiccups, no audio hiccups, nothing. Just smooth sailing. It runs smoothly at max settings on my machine, but your mileage may vary with this product. I've had a great experience, your experience may be less than great. At present, my personal recommendation would be to get this at retail price only if you have friends to group with. Otherwise, wait for a sale. It's built from the ground up as a co-op title, so you might as well play it as a co-op title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10. Recommended.Play as dwarf, ranger, or lore-master elf in the well-made LOTR world.Lotsa armor, lotsa weapons, lotsa loot everywhere.Each of the characters can find it's own hidden cache of great loot, each of the characters has different weapons to use and skills to use.Somewhat repetitive levels, (horn sounds and you can expect several waves of enemies in every level, beat __ waves to proceed), but very enjoyable finishing moves against every single enemy and also fights against trolls, where you really have to use rolling and your special abilities. You can customize your character's hair, eye and beard + color. But, it has one major down-side, anti-climax if you want.When you start last mission, Carn dúm, you've to walk through the fortress, which is gonna cause endless crashes and lags if you're using AMD GPU.Way to fix it? Downgrade your CCC to 12.6, or pull out your crossbow/bow/staff, aim down and walk through it, as I did. Once you go out from inner part of fortress to snowy part, it should be all good.

												It's not the best of games. The gameplay is rather clunky, the graphics are pretty average, and you have to mess around with the audio of your computer since you cannot mute the terrible in game mic. However, you can squeeze alot of fun from the gameplay and it is quite enjoyable with it's simple and easy to pick up combat system and RPG elements. Plus the fact you can play three player co-operation with your friends is the one redeemable feature.			",22,2,0,3,0,0,8

												Great action game with some fun RPG elements.I loved the ability to play 3 different types of characters, basically hunter, mage or warrior. The characters are available for play only at the beginning of chapters or main areas before you start. AI for characters you are not playing seemed really good even though there were several times they got lost in an area or couldn’t jump down into an area. The pathing needs to be fixed on AI characters for sure.Story and voice overs were great, I love all the Lord of the Rings stories and this game does an excellent job getting you engrossed into the story and wanting to learn more about the characters. I have never been a super Tolkien Lore master so I can’t tell you if it is true to all the original Tolkien Stories. The game is more about a small group that helps with activities outside of the main storyline with Frodo and company.Combat with Keyboard and mouse was very responsive and easy to play. Skills are minimal but helpful during battles, especially boss fights. Items and equipment can be found almost everywhere with special sets available and that can be worn for bonuses during game play.There are NPC's in every story area for purchasing equipment and repairing equipment. Also there are lighted areas before main story battles that allow you to Buy and sell equipment, also gives you the option to travel to previous locations if needed for quest turn ins.Large map can be used for fast travel by just selecting area, also contains fighting challenges for group to fight waves of enemies.Only down side of the game other than the AI pathing issues is that there is no manual saving, the game saves automatically at new areas or story starts. When you complete a battle or area you find a glowing point that allows you to proceed to next area and it performs a save. Even though the game didn’t allow manual saves, it saved game enough times that I never had to redo a lot when my party was defeated in battle, since it typically saves just before the major battle or area change.Overall I would highly recommend this game, especially now that it is within budget price.

												Not Lord of the Rings game you ve been waiting for. Levels are linear and focused on combat. Also you can play as elven mage and LotR purists might find it weird. But the premise that there were some conflicts up north in Middle Earth is interesting and also story, though not great, is not entirely stupid. The game overall is best experienced when playing coop with friends. Orcs need killing once again.			",203,56,9,27,27,2,24

												Fantastic action rpg game, never played that game before, so i will put down some pros and cons about LoTR.Pros:* Great graphics and concept,* Great voice acting and dialog,* Amazing combat style,* Companions leveling up along with player,* Each character has their own unique skills,* Online coop (up to 3 players),* Many achievements (some are very hard to earn).Cons:* No in game mic option to turn it off,* No companion health hud * Regardless what you chose from dialog outcome always will be the same (e.g. you decide to help later that npc will die anyway),* Since when ranger needs mana/energy to use his skill? And since when wizard have to waste mana/energy to use ranged shots from her's staff? That doesn't make any sense,* Incredible stupid AI (companions)* Impossible to soloing game after normal difficulty,* Impossible to complete Chapter 7 part 2 after normal difficulty if you are soloing (read last 2 sentence above).Score:  7/10.

There are new abilities often enough to keep it interesting and you do feel strong and sometimes great in a fight against normal enemies. Bigger ones can be a pain but rewarding once defeated.Got this on a whim for myself and a friend. With a co-op partner I believe it is entertaining and is interesting if you are a fan of the subject matter. If you can catch it on sale and often co-op then this is worth the sale price.

I wasnt interested in playing any of the other games in my library so I picked this up.  I was fully engaged for the time that I played because the mechanics are fluid and easy to use.

												Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a good game to play cooperative online. I had a lot of fun playing this with my brother. We played through the main game and loved it and it's not often that I can get a game to play coop with him. I thought the battle style was fun but somewhat repetative. There weren't a lot of useful skills for the class that I chose and I could have used more. The most useful combinations were the small attacks + large when the critical icon came up. Either way I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good coop game. Something to share items and gold which is a good coop atmosphere.Audio: 7/10 (Music in game can get repetative)Video: 8/10 (Fun and exciting graphics)Controls: 7/10 (Very few buttons, could have more combinations)Gameplay: 9/10 (Exciting gameplay but lacking a lot. Fun exp combinations but not much fun with skills.)			",428,121,8,51,29,4,35

												The 66/100 average of Metacritic is by no means doing justice for this game. The game being advertised as RPG might have fooled and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off some people since it's basically a hack n slash game.There's only so few games out there for people who want to get the co-op experience and this game nails it and manages to be extremely fun to play through with the bros. The voice acting just adds to the fun as it's so hilariously bad. The combat system is just... well, it's a hack n slash so no further explanation really needed. It does its job. The only major flaw is really the requirement of exactly 3 players to be able to fully enjoy the game as the AI player really isn't that fun to play with.I wouldn't really recommend the game with the price tag of 20 euros, but if you can find this game on sale and lack a game to play with your friends, you should definitely give this game a try. It might be short, but it's fun while it lasts and has somewhat good replay value as you can play through it 3 times by swapping roles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful game with some great voice acting - a must have for any fan of the works of Tolkien or fan of the Jackson movies.  The combat might feel clunky or slow to those who are used to the smoother combat of other games where the goal is to be flashy, but you get a handle on it after a while and it becomes satisfying to really feel the chunk of your axe, staff, sword or mace in an orc skull. It's not that the combat system is bad - not at all. It's just different and geared to feeling a little more realistic. The combat is also brutal - you regularly sever limbs and dismember your enemies (but there's a setting to turn off the gore for your kids).  My only real complaints are that the sidequests give few hints on how to complete some of them, some aren't very obvious as to what the point is, and it can take a bit of running around to figure certain things out. Additionally, you will find it frustrating to be unable to switch characters on the fly - the game seems a bit wonky about when it chooses to let you switch ingame.  Otherwise though, solid LotR action game.			",283,64,2,50,8,0,42

However AMD users should be wary as there are problems with the newer versions of AMD that makes the game crash often, especially in chapters 2 and 8. Chapter 2 was manageable for me but I kept crashing so much in chapter 8 that it made the game unplayable and it was the last chapter no less which really added to the frustration as you can imagine.

												While Lord of the Rings: War in the North does not bring anything new to the genre, it is still quite well executed and be sure to provide you with a dozen or so hours of entertainment. Specially so if you are a LotR fan. The story follows the battles that took place in the North of Middle Earth while the Fellowship of the Ring marched on South towards the destruction of Sauron and I found it to be quite well integrated.I did not play the multiplayer version of the game so I cannot comment on that but I found that the singleplayer experience was solid and relatively bug-free. Besides some graphical glitches on some snow levels (which I cannot say were not due to my hardware) and some rare ragdoll quirks, the game looked and behaved quite nicely.You have 3 characters at your disposal and I imagine that a playthrough with each character gives you a different perspective of the story (albeit with the same levels) so that might give you some replayability value. You also have some challenge levels that might keep you busy for a little while longer. Equipment is varied and scales well (do not bother giving equipment to your party though, they'll equip themselves).Pros:+ Truthfull to the Tolkien lore.+ Stable and entertaining single player.+ Good graphics.+ Above average skill trees and gameplay.+ Good voice acting and overall sound ambiance.+ Excellent controller support.Cons:- Some graphical glitches on snow levels.- Very linear, you won't be able to explore a lot.- While you get some gameplay variety at certain keypoints of the game, the time in between is almost pure button and skill spamming.

												Well I have to say this game sort of disappointed me. It may be the fact that all LOTR games invoke some kind of unreal expectation but nonetheless. The skills were very limited since you only have 3 abilities and various variations of them. The items thank god disginguished themselves when you equip them but offer little difference to the gameplay. Overall it was a good game but lacked that certain extra push to make it amazing. Still worth playing if you're a LOTR fan.			",59,3,1,7,4,0,1

												This game is a ton of fun, expecially when you play co-op through the capaign with friends, but there is one MAJOR downside. Aafter about 8.5 hours of gamplay (Chapter 4 Final Mission, and other places chapter 5 and later on) that glitches happen that ""Break the game"". What i mean by this is WiTN didnt detect that you completed a mission, even though you did, so it wont let you advance throughout the rest of the campaign. I gave this game a ""Yes"" rating because it is extemley fun and the story is also very good.			",92,2,6,11,8,0,1

												This game has a surprising low rating but I sort of can tell why: Repetative combat and a game-breaking bug. Its a really fun hack-and-slash RPG and the AI works pretty well but you can't really customise your team and its hard to tell how their spending their points. However, every mission is the same, just go from point A to point B and kill everything inbetween, but that's to be expects. Its impossible to finish the game though because it crashes before you can get to the end. I kept finding myself coming back to play it consistantly so it at least kept my interest, probably because I like LotR. I wouldn't pay full price for it though.			",89,12,1,14,5,0,21

												The 66/100 average of Metacritic is by no means doing justice for this game. The game being advertised as RPG might have fooled and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off some people since it's basically a hack n slash game.There's only so few games out there for people who want to get the co-op experience and this game nails it and manages to be extremely fun to play through with the bros. The voice acting just adds to the fun as it's so hilariously bad. The combat system is just... well, it's a hack n slash so no further explanation really needed. It does its job. The only major flaw is really the requirement of exactly 3 players to be able to fully enjoy the game as the AI player really isn't that fun to play with.I wouldn't really recommend the game with the price tag of 20 euros, but if you can find this game on sale and lack a game to play with your friends, you should definitely give this game a try. It might be short, but it's fun while it lasts and has somewhat good replay value as you can play through it 3 times by swapping roles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well I had high expectations for this title for a reason unknown (Maybe that game magazine article I read years ago got  me hyped).I'm not gonna lie I was into LOTR alot those times and I was playing all of the LOTR games too and this was the new game so why not play it?At first I kinda felt empty inside because this was surely not the game I was hoping to get.I didn't feel the characters and the story it didn't feel like a LOTR game to me I dunno.Maybe I was too hyped because of that damn article like:""Limbs fly with physics!PYHSICS!THAT'S THE♥♥♥♥♥♥NOTHING ELSE MATTERS!"".But I fell for that.Anyway for the game even though I felt kinda let downed on this it makes up good for the genre.Just not a good LOTR title.5,5/10			",308,63,1,34,25,4,56

												If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings, or you are looking for a fun co-op game to play with friends, look no further.Lord of the Rings: War in the North offers hours of fun especially as a multiplayer co-op game. The roles of the three characters you choose from are diverse and allow for each player to find their own rhythm and role in the gameplay. This is a typical third person action adventure RPG, offering the usual inventory micro management and looting.Don't expect the most polished game or top of the range graphics and mechanics, but if that doesn't bother you then this is a solid title. The controls are simple to pick up, and the gameplay is fun. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play with a wife or girlfriend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really meant to be played Co-op. I'm not usually someone who goes for second playthroughs, but I did on this one. The campaign itself is not too long, so that helps. Leveling up really makes you feel more powerful. Two main complaints are that the Siege of Nordinbad is a little imbalanced with too many enemies that can kill you with one hit. Also, I played with two human players and one AI. The AI was constantly getting killed and if you don't revive them, you can lose. This totally messes with any strategy you might have. Lastly, if you have an ATI/AMD card, the beginning of the last chapter does a number on your framerate. It sounds like more complaints than praise, but it really is a fun game that's easy to get into and a lot of fun to play. Pick it up on sale, its a no-brainer.			",166,17,0,28,8,0,25

												For anyone who is a fan of The Lord of the Rings and action/RPG romps, LotR: War in the North is surprisingly fun.  The story takes place during the events of the books, but focuses around a different set of conflicts and heroes that were briefly touched upon in them.  Gameplay is what you'd expect out of an action RPG; hacking and slashing galore, unlockable and upgradable skills, plenty of loot to collect, and three different characters you can rotate playing with in between missions.  Length-wise, it's a good ~15 hour campaign that includes the option for online co-op and a New Game Plus mode for replayability.As far as issues go, there's nothing gamebreaking, however it does lack a lot of polish in some areas.  The audio is nothing special, and the graphics are often muddy.  The writing and voice acting isn't really up to par with proper RPGs either, but it serves its purpose.  Artificial intelligence, at least on the default difficulty, is pretty poor as well.  As for the controls, keys are remappable, but a gamepad is highly recommended.Though it may lack polish, as a total package, it's made up for by being just plain fun.  If you have a weekend to kill and you can nab it for a good price, War in the North is a worthy play.			",315,130,10,40,40,5,24

												This game was most likely overlooked by everyone because of low publicity. However, what you will find inside is a fun Action-RPG in the vein of classic games like Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance. The combat is simple but meaty hack-slash-and-roll and you can play as a Ranger, Dwarf or an Elf. The story is original and runs simultaneously with the story from the books. You get to interact with a large number of characters from the books and it even the answers the age old question of ""Why didn't the eagles just carry the ring to Mount Doom?"" The boss fights are fun, if a little simple but rewards strategic attacking instead of mashing buttons.The main attraction of the game comes from playing online co-op with upto three people. Each character has abilities that compliment other characters. The A.I. is not bad by any means but you can't beat playing with actual people. After you finish the game, New game+ options open up which have chance to obtain more and more powerful weapons.7/10 game if played alone, 9/10 game if played with friends.			",344,38,7,19,11,1,22

												This game is a good game overall, I enjoy playing it, and  we are on our second run through. The pros:Great story, great voice acting, very pretty, not too hard for someone who's not a serious gamer, yet challenging enough to keep the hard cores entertained. The cons: linear. very much so,it's fairly short at 17 hours (that's with doing EVERYTHING! all lore dialogue, and sidequests) and there are a few...ok several...major bugs that a non-beta game just should not have. This game, when it comes to bugs, makes me wonder if Bethesda put it out there. Most, are not a problem. Some, are downright infuriating. example: treasure reward gives choice, you choose, but oh look, it gave you something else in the box....  This has happened three times to me. Very annoying.   the rest, graphics, some inventory, some porting issues.  If you do not have a friend to play with, you will miss out on ALOT. We have not had the chance to play with three people yet, but having a bot to jump on the resurrections is nice, face it, humans are slow on uptake in the heat of battle sometimes.   I wish I could give a mixed reccomendation of this game, I highly reccomend playing it with a friend, but if you are alone, it's not nearly as fun.  7/10			",138,10,2,14,22,1,28

												A very entertaining game. Hints of the older Lord of the Rings games, but much more polished. Combat is interesting, and the RPG elements remind me of older games like Gothic, except much more combat oriented.Great Lord of the Rings setting, good graphics and solid voicework. I haven't a chance to check out the multiplayer, but it exists!			",211,21,3,28,22,1,11

												Though this game is only 3years old, it looks older, if I am honest. HOWEVER if we ignore that it isn't on the high end of the graphical spectrum, this is quite an enjoyable game. The gameplay is mostly smooth, a bit chunky and jittery at times, otherwise, it is good. The story fits nicely with the rest of the series. It has certainly made me want to go back and watch the LotR trilogy again for the hundredth time. I also like that you are able to switch characters HOWEVER you are only able to do so at each check point or when you decide to exit the game. It is rather annoying that for the sinlge player you are unable to switch during gameplay, but it is just how it is.			",344,50,17,50,24,3,48

Simple and fun, LOTS OF FUN! also you can always join some random fellow adventurers through a public game search.Yes the game is not perfect (terrible on AMD cards) and has one or two glitches but otherwise a awesome game! me and friends thoroughly enjoyed it and agree we would make several more visits to Middle Earth to attempt Heroic and Legendary difficulty!

												So far it's been a pretty fun ARPG But the engine tries to mimic the unreal 3 enegines streaming capability and unfortunetly dosn't mimic it very well at all you may get sticky feeling streaming and it's bad at times my game crashed with black screen of death after 6hrs of continious play during this sticky streaming. One of them ctrl alt delete situations. While not a big deal really but annoying when you are in the heat of battle and having a good time and the game desides to break on you because it failed at streaming.  I enjoy the game regardless of this engine failure.  Little more cons to the game would have to be the character managment there is none other than the char you choose as your main when starting sp story there is options to give items to your ai buddies but soon as you goto a new zone you notice they some how managed to get them a new weapon & armor completly overwriting what you have gave them and no way of getting the item you gave them back so wasted loot. Another managment con would have to be way the game saves it dosn't seem to save the char changes done to other chars after you switch to them and then back to your main ai seems to be preset skill wise or something. char managment is 0/10 waste of time screwing with it worry about your main and screw the ai chars. Now with that said you can use the ai chars aswell not at anytime while playing certain check points offers the option otherwise you have to quit game and select the char. when you switch to this char you'll have to assign attribute points and skill points. I havn't been able get the settings to save but maybe due to how the auto save works more or less autosaves when the devs wanted it to which kinda sucks rpg games needs a manual save feature not just a check point here and there save. Else progress is esily lost.As for pros graphics are decent run well even on my 10 year old toaster all settings maxed and a smooth 60fps vsynced Some pretty cool weather effects when it's raining you can see water running down your armor and when you enter a building they are dry looking which adds some realism. Most of all you don't need a mod called real shelter like skyrim lmao I had throw that in there couldn't be helped....Combat is simple button spam with fun finishers I enjoy the decapitations and the blood splatters onto your armor and weapons. So far I'm still trying figure out who strider is as i never met him in the game yet a npc said my buddy strider was there lol some story elements have lost me entirly maybe related to other LOTR games which i will admit Ihave never played. ""shrugs"" Voice acting isn't cheesy sounds good so far.Not played co-op so i can't give a review of thatAnyways i'd say meta score is pretty accurate as I'd give a 6/10 I've played much better but I've also played far worse do i rec it sure it's a fun pass time has a few flaws but nothing I can't deal with. i don't recommend it for $20 not a $20 game $10 or less pick it up.

												Rating: 5/10This game is a buggy mess that screams out the word ""Budget"". From the very second you start the game, you're taken 5 years back from the release date by virtue of dated visuals and shoddy animation. And the animation in particular takes life away from the characters in the game - Who should be great since this is an LOTR game and great characterization is the least you can expect from it. The gameplay is nothing great either, you get the bog standard hack n' slash action with some pretty basic shooting. However what really makes this game score low are the bugs and the glitches. WB (Isn't that a big surprise?) has not cared about addressing all the technical issues this game has, especially for gamers who use hardware by AMD. You will literally not finish the game unless you use outdated drivers. So if you're an AMD user, do not buy this game. And if you're not, I still wouldn't recommend it at full price. Buy it at a discount.			",985,272,57,133,106,13,161

												The plot is good, the gameplay is good, the graphics are bad.Extreme caution though before you buy - the game can be extremely glitchy and crashy depending on environment, but many people have problems with it. If you'll be able to fix it from crashing, you won't be able to fix the giltches. The glitches that prevent you from simply enjoying the game, and also including the glitches that stop you from proceeding with the game.Also, it auto-saves to only 1 save. So you cannot go back or make your own saves - unless you manually quit out of the game and make backups of the freaking thing.So the game's context is good, but bloody annoying technically.

												With one playthrough under my belt I feel that I have a right to write a few words on this game. And, in all honesty, I enjoyed it greatly. It is very lore friendly, more so, than PJ's movies, it has amazing art style, the characters are vivid, even if not particularly deep, and it is nice that each has different, suitable to their race dialogue options. Story-wise the game is certainly passable, offering enough plot content to satify the RPG fans in most people, and surprisingly not single-minded, with detours and side stories which tie in to the main arc, but standing well on their own, too.As far as gameplay is concerned, it is good. Combat could have used more variation in available combos, because as is, it's just button mashing with occasional ""strike when the arrow shines for a crit hit"". I miss all the different combos from the old Return of the King games. Still, fighting hordes of enemies is fun, even more so, when you play with friends, as AI is wonky at best and in some sections you are definitely at a disadvantage (I look at you, mounted crossbow parts). There is a good variation, though, between characters. The dwarven champion is a heavy hitter, ranger is quick and slick DPS, loremaster is a support. All three work very well together and if you play with other humans, the slaughter you can do together is wonderful. Interestingly, each character has access to different kinds of secrets, with loremaster also being able to make potions for use of the team.All in all, I recommend the game to people enjoying the world created by JRR Tolkien and to people enjoying nice and simple hack'n'slash games. It is definitely worth buying at a discount, and a worthy item to consider buying without it, too.			",176,35,5,43,11,1,28

												The game itself is very enjoyable and atmospheric, even if it is railroaded into making you follow only one path from start to finish. They do a decent job with the lore as well, though there are a few minor errors such as the party not knowing what 'beast' they saw- and then in the next scene outright calling it a Nazgul attack as if they knew anyway. As I said; minor detail.The main problem with this game are the bugs. If you can somehow play this game and not have it bug out on you, enjoy it. I can't finish this game because of this. The latest bug that keeps happening is my graphics gets all pixellated (like static-television bad), and then the screen freezes with whatever I last saw (attacking, running, whatever). I can hear my character is still doing things; I can hit Escape and can hear menu choices highlight, but I only see whatever the screen froze on initially. It never updates again; I have to ALT+F4 and start over, only for it to happen all over again...It has been out for awhile. To have these and many other bugs still (many others have similar or other issues, and I've changed graphical settings and compatibility modes/etc to no avail), I'm not impressed. For this reason I do not recommend this game. I will change my review if they resolve these issues.			",56,31,0,26,4,0,5

												Bought this game due to Co-Op and it was pretty cheap. Best thing I've done. My wife was married to a game addict for over 20 years and this was the first game she tried with me. War in the North is a wonderful game for families, friends, etc. I haven't seen another game that was so easy to jump in, play together without any stress of level grinding, gear seeking etc. The game is simple to play, has all the aspects of RPG (gear, skills, stats, potions, etc), but it's made so simple for anyone to just pick up and go hack and slash.As other reviewers said, it's not the best out there, but it made my family have a great gaming night together, no other game brought us this close together. There are client crashes for sure (AMD and nVidia GPUs, Windows 7 and 10), the most annoying bug is the open mic in multiplayer. It was super annoying for us because we all sit together. Disabling microphone in Recording Devices in windows, took care of that. Other than that, we greatly enjoy the game and looking forward to a weekend when my family can play together again.

												I have ahicived all 4 difficulties on all 3 charachters, many long hours doing so, I can honestly say that War in the North is a wonderfull experieince. It certainly was shadowed by Skyrim's release in November, so it didn't get the recognition it deserves. Each combat method of Magic, Range, and Melee work expectionally well in various situations. The lack of feshed out charchter customization is made up with the sheer abundance of loot and rewards. You can certainly find a mirror (most likeley in resupply areas on the map like the rangers camp) to change your character's face and hair, but I think the sotry was meant to focus on the 3 protaganists rather tan the RPG element like skyrim or Dragon age. The over all story is quite well done, adressing what is going on in the North at the time when the fellowship is doing it's thing in the south (across all 3 books or movies) so you meet alot of the charachters such as Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo  and the gang along the way. Along with that, there are many beautifully done enviroments you play throuh, but you can feel boxed in at times, which is disspointing. It is not an 'open world RPG' it is like Dragon Age: Origins in a sense; you may go back to all the locations if you like, but once you start a new playthrough you cannot visit locations until you unlock them. The combat and skill trees are very fluid and well structured, but it can be repetitive at times. It's very satisfieing to see your enemies skull break open in slow motion. Their limbs also break off, ofcourse there is also tons of blood and gore, and settings to remove it. The combat style is based of of which charachter you choose, all of which have a range weapon. Magic for Elf (swords as well), axes and crossbows for Dwarf while the Human uses longsowrds, clasymores, and somewhat of a vanguard suit using sword/axe and shield. It is pretty mcuh what you'd expect them to use. Multiplayer works alright, but is best for friends. Multiplayer only works for 3 players with each player using one of the protaganists. In the game, there are 2 locations that use a wave-based setup. One in Ministirith, and the other in some undead elf area. Both areas are quite small and poorly executed. Overall I rate this game a solid 8.5/10  Interesting story (if you are familiar with the Trilogy Definetly worth a buy.			",73,7,0,9,2,0,3

												I found LotR: War in the North to be a fun game and kept me hooked on the story lines and I loved the dialogue throughout the game. That being said there were two major problems with this game. One, it was short to the point of being insulting, 16 hours! Come on. For that play time it should have been $15 on launch day. Two, the ending was so anticlimactic and sudden that it felt like a joke. On a side note I played the human ranger and obviously bows were his main weapon and source of damage. But you can only carry a maximum of 80 arrows and those go super fast and there isn't a stead source of refills so I found large chunks of the game I was unable to use my primary weapon....which I found idiotic.

												I really enjoyed this game even if the world wide rating is not high. Its mostly easy and relaxing action game (combat system is similar to Prince of Persia) with rpg elements and good action battles.  You can choose between three characters (Ranger, Dwarf and Elf), learn and use lots of perks, improve your armor and weapons. You can buy and sell items of course.  You can use some basics commands to your other characters during the battle (attack/retreat) The game has very good feeling of Lord of rings world, you can meet the LOTR movie characters and the enemies are also copy of movie version. I really can recommend this game, but dont expect long and hardcore game with free and large world. The game also offers multiplayer cooperation against enemies. My rating is 7/10.+ graphics+ story+ Lord of the Rings atmosphere+ action combats+ you can choose between three different characters+ multiplayer cooperation+ AI of your mates is not bad and they can help you (heal etc)- gameplay could be longer- should be less corridor game- you cannot switch between characters during the battles and real time game, only if you load the game from main menu- only a few side quests- very, very often you discover new and new equipments- maybe too easy, but if you finish the game, there is unlock of harder difficult- final battle was quite dissapointing to me			",44,6,4,8,7,0,6

												this game is a good and origanal depiction of lord of the rings and it really puts perspective to the war all over middle earth during the time of frodo's quest to mordor and mens struggle in these dark times.also it has gameplay effectively banishing most other lord of the rings games to the realms of shame it really gives a fan all the intake of lord of the rings atmosphere that they could ever want overall a great experience for me but one problem i have to adress is the length of the game, it is in my opinion, too short to really be effective but that is only minor because you can then play the game again on a higher differculty so i say once more that lord of the rings war in the north is a good game and i would recormmend it to any willing Lord of the rings fan.P.S sorry for the spelling mistakes I rushed this slightly.

												War in the North was that one game that I had heard nothing but mediocre things about. ""The AI is terrible,"" whined every reviewer, ""and the story is complete garbage, not to mention the clunky gameplay."" With words like these clouding my vision, my buddy and I decided to give it a whirl one day out of sheer boredom. Maybe it was my initially abysmal expectations, but I was thoroughly satisfied, and in some cases, completely blown away.Now, that's not to say that the reviewers were lying. The story is extremely silly, but that's not really the focus of the game. It only took us about an hour to realize that this is in no way a story-driven game. It's a pure hack-and-slash at it's finest, the likes of which I've never seen before. In this area, the game outshines just about every other RPG out there.This is one of the most fun action games there is... provided you have friends to play with, because the reviewers weren't kidding when they said the AI is absolutely awful. For instance, if you happen to get knocked down in combat, your the AI will focus 100% on making his way to save you. Great, right? Except for that massive troll about to wail on him with a giant hammer. We had very few kind words for our AI friend.The RPG elements are pretty simple, but again, that's because the focus is right where it should be: the combat. The difficulty spikes in satisfying ways, lulling you into complacency, then smacking you in the face with a horde of Uruk-hai.Beyond the standard gameplay, there are little touches here and there that make this game worthwhile. For one example, the in-game voice chat adds an echo effect to your voice when you enter a cave. Pretty neato, right? It's features like that, which, while being completely unnecessary to the core experience, add a sense of joy to the playing experience, and brought a smile to my face.In summary, if you have a friend or two to play with, and you're looking for a decent-length hack-and-slash with light RPG elements, this is the game for you.

												This game is really meant to be played Co-op. I'm not usually someone who goes for second playthroughs, but I did on this one. The campaign itself is not too long, so that helps. Leveling up really makes you feel more powerful. Two main complaints are that the Siege of Nordinbad is a little imbalanced with too many enemies that can kill you with one hit. Also, I played with two human players and one AI. The AI was constantly getting killed and if you don't revive them, you can lose. This totally messes with any strategy you might have. Lastly, if you have an ATI/AMD card, the beginning of the last chapter does a number on your framerate. It sounds like more complaints than praise, but it really is a fun game that's easy to get into and a lot of fun to play. Pick it up on sale, its a no-brainer.			",166,17,0,28,8,0,25

												I love this game so much, and I havent even played Multi-Player, even in single player this is a great experience. (I have low hours since i recently bought on pc, but I had it on my 360 for ages before hand and still enjoyed it immensely)Pros- -Graphics look amazing for a game thats been out as long as this.-Gameplay, some people say is a bit repetetive but I dont see that, there is a huge variety in enemies.-This game is heaven for looters, so much loot to find.-It offers character customisation, well this has been done before, it is a really nice touch to the game.-Feels like a genuine RPG experience, complete with questing, a great story, and of course; you start off in a tavern, what could be greater.-The soundtrack in this game is absolutely amazing, you will want to stay in a location for the music alone.Con- (literally only could think of 1)-Single Player A.I isnt the best, they arent absolutely stupid as they do level up by themselves and equip thier own equipment. But at times it feels like it was made with too much focus on human players all together.If you have the money buy this! ",123,34,0,19,10,1,10

(If that happens delete your most recent save and use the previous save to that one) You may also crash on start up.

												If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings, or you are looking for a fun co-op game to play with friends, look no further.Lord of the Rings: War in the North offers hours of fun especially as a multiplayer co-op game. The roles of the three characters you choose from are diverse and allow for each player to find their own rhythm and role in the gameplay. This is a typical third person action adventure RPG, offering the usual inventory micro management and looting.Don't expect the most polished game or top of the range graphics and mechanics, but if that doesn't bother you then this is a solid title. The controls are simple to pick up, and the gameplay is fun. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play with a wife or girlfriend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far it's been a pretty fun ARPG But the engine tries to mimic the unreal 3 enegines streaming capability and unfortunetly dosn't mimic it very well at all you may get sticky feeling streaming and it's bad at times my game crashed with black screen of death after 6hrs of continious play during this sticky streaming. One of them ctrl alt delete situations. While not a big deal really but annoying when you are in the heat of battle and having a good time and the game desides to break on you because it failed at streaming.  I enjoy the game regardless of this engine failure.  Little more cons to the game would have to be the character managment there is none other than the char you choose as your main when starting sp story there is options to give items to your ai buddies but soon as you goto a new zone you notice they some how managed to get them a new weapon & armor completly overwriting what you have gave them and no way of getting the item you gave them back so wasted loot. Another managment con would have to be way the game saves it dosn't seem to save the char changes done to other chars after you switch to them and then back to your main ai seems to be preset skill wise or something. char managment is 0/10 waste of time screwing with it worry about your main and screw the ai chars. Now with that said you can use the ai chars aswell not at anytime while playing certain check points offers the option otherwise you have to quit game and select the char. when you switch to this char you'll have to assign attribute points and skill points. I havn't been able get the settings to save but maybe due to how the auto save works more or less autosaves when the devs wanted it to which kinda sucks rpg games needs a manual save feature not just a check point here and there save. Else progress is esily lost.As for pros graphics are decent run well even on my 10 year old toaster all settings maxed and a smooth 60fps vsynced Some pretty cool weather effects when it's raining you can see water running down your armor and when you enter a building they are dry looking which adds some realism. Most of all you don't need a mod called real shelter like skyrim lmao I had throw that in there couldn't be helped....Combat is simple button spam with fun finishers I enjoy the decapitations and the blood splatters onto your armor and weapons. So far I'm still trying figure out who strider is as i never met him in the game yet a npc said my buddy strider was there lol some story elements have lost me entirly maybe related to other LOTR games which i will admit Ihave never played. ""shrugs"" Voice acting isn't cheesy sounds good so far.Not played co-op so i can't give a review of thatAnyways i'd say meta score is pretty accurate as I'd give a 6/10 I've played much better but I've also played far worse do i rec it sure it's a fun pass time has a few flaws but nothing I can't deal with. i don't recommend it for $20 not a $20 game $10 or less pick it up.

												I'll keep it short.I thoroughly enjoyed it, as an avid Tolkien fan, it was nice to see some of the places in Middle Earth explored a little more, Such as Sarn Ford, Fornost etc. I've compiled into a list things I enjoyed and didn't enjoy about the game.Positives: The world looks pretty good, and has captured I feel how the various places you visit would be, based on the description from the book.The combat is decent enough, I played as the Ranger and enjoyed rolling underneath trolls or around Orcs and slashing at them whilst they were exposed.Side quests are a bonus, as in any game as they give you extra things to do, and increase playtime. There are also two 'Survival' type bonus missions.Whilst the levels are Linear, I did feel like I was exploring Middle Earth, which is obviously a good thing.Co-Op, in any adventure game is great, and this can be really good fun with a friend or two.Things I didn't enjoy:Not much to pick at here really, and a few of these things won't apply to you guys anyway.The game felt difficult towards the end, I know it's supposed to be Co-Op, but I found it nigh on impossible doing it on Singleplayer, as both the AI companions ran in a straight line to revive me, straight into the path of that Troll guarding my body.A few of the locations don't feel 'Tolkienesque' to me, such as the Barrow Downs with 'Zombie' like creatures, but this can be overlooked. I felt the shop system a waste of time, as I was constantly finding good enough Gear to be getting on with, and had no need at all to buy any gear except for early in the game, even then I now realise it wasn't nessecary as I often found something better than what I'd just bought moments later in a chest.Conclusion:This review isn't to be taken too serious, a lot of the issues can be overlooked depending on your expectations, but I enjoyed it, and it's a nice little romp through Middle-Earth as you take a different path from the usual main characters during The war of the Ring, And I reccomend this be it to play Solo or Co-op.

												This game is vey much like Dark Souls, except with hordes instead of ridiculously hard enemies and the controls are much better. The story and some of the dynamics are quite interesting. The experience much like Borderlands, the more friends you play with the better the experience. Standard skill tree leveling system and each character has elaborate passive skills that can really help the team.			",55,2,3,4,3,0,3

												RPG set in middle earth with 3 main characters, a Dwarf Champion of Erebor, a Elvish Lore-Master (mage), and a Ranger.Story:This game acts as a companion of sorts to the movies, when you begin the game, Aragorn is briefing the trio in The Prancing Pony in Bree, sending them on a mission after they report a Nazgul attack. He sends them to attack orcs at a ruined city to distract a mystery dark lord who is a servent directly to you-know-who. You basically meet every character that could have been in the movies, like one of the eagle's that gandalf constantly summons, or the twin brothers, sons of Elrond. Like I said, pretty much every part of this is a companion to the movies, because you're literally just working behind the scenes and making things easier for Frodo and Aragorn and the gang. In fact the first mission is distracting the ""dark lord"" so Frodo has enough time to get away. Gameplay: The combat is bloody, and entertaining. I especially like how some enemies sort of ragdoll after they die, making your attacks seem forceful and strong. It reminds me of how the combat looks in the movies when that happens, though sometimes the orcs go through these short death scenes where they sway on their feet for a few seconds before dropping dead and hitting them has no effect and it looks terrible when that happenes, because you're swinging a 100 pound axe at a guy and he's just going through a basic death motion. The gameplay can get hard, especially with bosses who can incipacitate 2 players at once. Playing as different people will alter your gameplay a bit, the elvish mage tends to stay back from the fighting a bit and focus more on blasts of power as her melee attacks are low damage, the ranger can play either frontline fighter or stay back archer as his bow let's him fire a steady stream of arrows and his sword cuts through orcs like butter. The dwarf fights with massive, powerful attacks and his main ability (rage) let's him deal out even more damage, making him effictive for clearing a room. His high damage crossbow is good for picking off archers or thinning out the numbers before you run in axe swinging. Graphics:There's not much to say here, the blood effects look nice but overall it's mediocre at the worst to good at the best, usually hovering around pretty good with a bit of meh. It obviously looks pretty dated now but don't let that stop you.TL;DR:An exiting, fun RPG with distinct characters, a good backstory that makes you feel like your acomplishing something, and a fun combat experience. The price of $20 won't break your bank either. I would reccomend heavily that you understand at least the full story of the movies, if not some extra lore of the series to play this game(Just watch the movies), though that's like a given with most LOTR games. 8/10Postive: + Good Gameplay+ Good Story+ Even better if you understand the lore+ FunNegative:- Okay graphics- Get's less fun if you don't at all understand the lore.

												A third person hack and slash ARPG smothered in Lord of the Rings lore. This is a journey that runs parallel to the fellowship's quest, although your fight is in the northern parts of Middle Earth. There's plenty of loot, weapons, a few optional quests, gem slotting, skill upgrades, and stat increases as you level up and fight your way to Agandaur, Sauron's right hand in the North. I'm a big fan of ARPGs and this one is definitely good. My enjoyment was mostly due to my love for the setting, however. Bioware style dialogue pulls you into the story as you run into the eagles, tons of orcs, wicked men, undead, trolls, a couple of wizards, and even a dragon. This game seems a bit underrated, its gameplay is solid even though the 3 classes do, more or less, play in a similar style. Still ... it was very fun the whole way through, I strongly recommend it, but most especially if you love LOTR. Played solo.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game with RPG elements like loot, levelling, quests, skills, stat points, and other stuff. Story is ok, maybe about 10-15 hours to complete it, so it's not too short, especially if you take your time and explore the ares it puts you in; looking for loot and other secrets. Has a new game+ mode which is always nice for replay value. Has online 3 player co-op which looks fun. Combat is pretty sweet (I played as the Dwarf). It can get a little challenging at times, especially if youre relying on your companion's AI. The game throws multiple types of enemies at you, which are admittedly harder than some boss fights. Enjoyed playing it once, but not enough to play twice.7/10			",152,12,2,34,4,0,1
