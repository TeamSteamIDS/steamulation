Posted: March 12, 2014
												I bought this game for two simple reasons. I felt like brutally bashing up thugs whilst hearing the cigar-like-cancerous tone of voice that Rorschach has. I got more than I bargained for.I bought this game as a bundle for $4.74 USD (about $5.41 AUD after conversion). I was a little hesitant because a lot of reviewers have stated that this game is a very repetitive brawler. But to be fair I would say this game is no more repetitive than the brawling action in the critically acclaimed Batman Arkham City.I don't know why but I really like the atmosphere and main characters in Watchmen. It's like their strength isn't what defines them like Batman or Superman. It's more like they have strong political views on life that makes their characters seem interesting. I wish there were more games based on these types of superheros. Heck, there should be a game based on the Kick♥♥♥♥♥movies! That would be awesome! To play as Kick♥♥♥♥♥teaming up with Hit-Girl, or even better Jim Carey’s character … I'd buy that over a 4th Batman Arkham game any day!The Kapow game engine used to power Watchmen is quite robust in my opinion. It’s the type of engine where if it was given time to evolve like the Chrome engine, it could potentially turn out to be the next RenderWare engine in terms of popularity/revolutionary. That is to say it’s pretty obvious the engine is quite newly born and I totally commend the developers for that. Because unlike some, for me personally a game engine almost defines all characteristics of a game. There are some funny things that happen like AI characters pushing each other during cinematic sequences, but there are no bugs that will make your gameplay unfair! Hence why I would say robust. I don’t want to pick on Arkham City … but as an example, I remember going into detective mode following footprints that was supposed to lead me to someone … but that someone wasn’t there until I rebooted the game! And I didn’t know I had to reboot the game … because I thought I was stuck on a puzzle I had to figure out!Some of the things I noticed with the Kapow engine was the brick textures on the walls having something like parallax mapping (which sort of made up for the plain levels). I also noticed that as you walk on different surfaces on the ground it will play the appropriate sound effects, for example walking on a tilled floor vs wood floor then walking on a small area that has glass smashed or walking on a carpet rug. Whilst these technologies aren’t new, they were “noticeable” compared to AAA games.I want to make some clarifications on the repetitiveness of the game. I agree there is no way I cannot debate against the fact that Watchmen is repetitive. However what I can argue is that from the start till about 60% through the game it’s somewhat a learning experience. You don’t have all moves unlocked. This is done by finding tokens scattered throughout the linear type of maps. But from 60% on till the end I must say I was quite enjoying the game. Something kept me awake and made me want to play. But here’s the funny thing, I started replaying the game with Nite Owl (just to see if I was missing anything) … and I played through the first 2 chapters not even noticing anything repetitive (and only stopped because I had to go out). So I’ve come to the conclusion that there are games like Watchmen that make things obviously repetitive but at least whatever you’re repeating you’re aware and it feels good to do (subjective). And there are some games, like Arkham City where the repetition is subliminal … but whatever you’re repeating is just extremely annoying (also subjective). For me in Arkham City it was completing Riddler’s puzzles scattered all over the map which accounted for 70% of the overall gameplay in my eyes. For anyone to say that wasn’t repetitive … I dunno … you’ve got to check yourself before you wreck yourself!There are some reviewers that have also said Watchmen has no story. They must be blind (oh noes here comes the many thumbs down lol), because at the start of each chapter there are wonderful cinematic animation. Sometimes even unique. For instance you get a 1st person view from Nite Owl head butting some dude and the animation zooms in and out with a blurry effect and then you see the dude’s nose bleed. That was pretty cool. Some reviewers claim it as stop-motion animation.Throughout the game you also hear some lines spoken by Rorschach and Nite Owl. Altogether whilst the story isn’t deeply looked into as opposed to the movie Watchmen, it’s certainly not nothing.The fighting mechanics of the game is quite well done. I feel to an extent that it’s geared to the casual gamer. But if you take the time to learn all the moves and time blocks properly, you can end up doing some pretty cool variations. There are a few melee weapons. The most noticeable ones are bat-like objects to which you can swing at your opponent and knock them down (feels good). And then there is the knife which eerily makes your character do moves that are … for lack of a better word hack’n’slash compared to other melee weapons and even the base fighting mechanics.I think a lot of people are going to call me crazy, but I enjoyed this game much more than Arkham City. I reckon Part 2 should have been DLC and included in the first game. Each game is roughly 3 hours in length. So for 6 hours, there’s no mistake for the price I paid for it. If I had any suggestions for improvement, perhaps make better level designs … they were too basic and not messy enough. But that’s fine, because graphics is not really what makes a good game. Maybe even some props like crates to throw at enemies. I would also suggest for each chapter, add a new variation to common special attacks. The funny thing is this is what was done in the last chapter of Part 2 when beating up the dominatrixes and gimps. The added moves just made me lol … I mean Rorschach punching a woman like a boxing bag … just LOL. I guess he just don’t like them hoes :P But I have this feeling this was probably a deadline and budget problem imposed by Warner Bros. Rating this game against my database is very difficult, it would fall somewhere between 69 and 72 out of 100 … al la … in the vicinity of WrestleMania X8 for Gamecube (which I also quite enjoyed). Note: You’ll have to forgive me, if things read awkward. I actually began writing this review late November 2013. So it may seem convoluted and incomplete. It’s also a 2 in one review as I don’t consider Watchmen: The End Is Neigh - Part 2 a separate game even though physically it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you were looking for a game to help time pass, look no further. Watchmen (part 1) has a great combat system, good looking graphics and a short story.  I wouldn’t say this game is bad, nor lacking. I’d say it has interesting characters, an attractive plot that lacks closure and a fun combat that some dare say is better than the one you find in the Arkham series.  Combat is pretty engaging. You have waves of enemies to deal with and combos that feel fluid, that proves how bad♥♥♥♥♥your character is. The types of enemies are pretty basic. There are the regular thugs, punks who have the spirit but not the training of a fighter and there are the big guys, who actually deal some serious damage if you get hit. At some point you’ll fight with armored trained people. There will be moments when you’ll be surrounded and your health will drop fast, but there are useful combos and there is your partner.

You can choose between rorschach  and nite owl. Sadly, there is no co op, but you can play in split screens. The differences between them are big enough for you to consider replaying the game for the sake of seeing new moves. It’s not just the level design for your chosen character, but your character way of fighting that would engross you. Rorschach is brutal, violent,  he evades by pirouetting around the enemies. His finishers are merciless, his special ability is to use his rage by running through enemies, knocking them down, he’s a street fighter. Nite Owl is different, he uses some milder fighting techniques, but just as effective. His special ability is to make a flashbang that blinds temporarily those around him(except Rorschach) ; he’s Batman’s little brother.

The story is pretty intriguing. Rorschach and Nite Owl investigate something on a conspiracy level, but they won’t get to the end of it, the final conclusion they gain is that they’ve been played. Even though it’s called Part 1, the game is standalone, as Part 2 doesn’t continue this game story. Besides, the story is just in the cutscenes, the dialogue in the gameplay puts the emphasis on character development and sometimes it tries to do the same for the world.  The cutscenes are a pretty good break from beating down waves of thugs and it gives meaning to doing it.

Overall, this is a fun game that lasts for 4 hours and considering the low price, it’s something to pick up to spend time in a way you won’t regret it.			",318,41,7,39,16,2,26

												4.9 hours in aaaannnd, we've beaten this beatemup! I do recommend it, conditionally. It has its good points and bad but for the most part it delivers an entertaining few hours of smash and well, more smash. The Good: The moves are pretty smooth and easy to pull off. The story fits the mood of the comics/movie well. It's not bad if you get it on sale for 1-3 bucks. It's like a modern Double Dragon or Final Fight. The Bad: The graphics are dated. They do the job though, barely. No replayability really. Repetitive. You fight. It's a modern Final Fight. The combos are ok but you mainly end up doing the dodge/counteratttack move. The Ugly:Don't pay full price for it. It's short. I logged the 4.9 hours and I napped in between a couple of levels with the game open, lol.The options are abysmal. Need more playable characters. The gore looks cheesy.Bottom line is this. If you can get it on sale and enjoy a button mashing fight fest with a gritty undertone and slick moves then this game is for you. Just be aware going in about exactly what it is you are buying here. NOTE: If you use an XBOX 360 controller (wireless) be sure to change the setting to use the wired version. Otherwise you get a stuck camera angle and non-responsive controls. The wireless mapping is hosed. Anyway, just my opinion here but I didn't hate it, didn't love it, got it on sale and don't regret the time spent with it.  ",987,185,23,167,78,2,118

												If you like the Beat em up Genre and know Watchmen this is the game for you even if you dont know it its fun but also keep in mind that this game is small the combos are limited but enough to keep you entertained for few hours. You can choose between 2 characters to play each with different combos they can do. If this game is in sale its worth a buy if not then there are better games to play. I still give it thumbs up because even it was short i liked the combo system and also wanted to know how the story progresses. Still keep in mind its short only 6 Chapters you can beat in few hours with one character. ",334,53,8,34,8,1,22

												The biggest reason to recommend this title is how satisfying the combat feels. Hits are weighty, meaty, and pack plenty of ""oomph"". It really feels like you're smashing your fist into someone's face, and the added atmosphere provided by the Watchmen license only helps keep things intersting across the game's relatively short length.The combat system is based around a standard light/heavy attack dynamic, but with a few notable nuances. For one, in order to perform combos, you have to time your attacks properly, which in addition to preventing button mashing, creates strategy in deciding which combo is appropriate in which situation. For example, you might really want to use the High Damage combo all the time, but it takes long enough to pull off that you need to be more selective.Nite Owl and Rorschach also have entirely different combos and abilities that play into their characters. Rorschach's abilities are far more aggressive, and he can carry weapons and dodge, while Nite Owl is a bit more technical and defensive, and has a block. They both use the same combat system, but there is just enough difference to properly distinguish them.Recommended for fans of beat 'em ups and anyone into noir storytelling. If you like punching things, this is probably a safe bet.			",114,30,1,14,3,0,6

												This review is, as of now, exclusive to part 1.This game is great. I mean it. If it's not obvious already, I'm a huge fan of Watchmen, and having a game just adds to all the fun. Unlike normal brawlers, this game has relatively large maps for each chapter, interactive enviroments, immersion, some decent dialogue and is story driven. The combat can start to get a little repetitive, but if you take the time play around with the unique combos, you can scrape out a few extra hours of gameplay. The graphics are actaully rather pretty for a 2009 game and feels like i'm in the comic universe. The enemies don't really differ in terms of dialogue, fighting style, or basic class, though their designs fit each chapter rather nicely. If you ever have some spare cash lying around and would like 4-6  hours of comical/mature entertainment then I highly suggest you give this game a shot.			",38,1,0,5,3,0,0

												Fun game wanted to play a beat em up style game this was perfect loved it not very long but i enjoyed it well worth the  couple of pounds i payed for them both in the sale. I played as Rorschach but will play though again as Nite Owl Co-op would be fun as well. I have now played through as Nightowl he takes a slighty different route using his grapple so you get a different perspective of the game and he has a few different fighting abilities. The chapters are still the same but i did still enjoy it second time around as Nightowl.			",311,268,36,24,31,5,32

												Its a alright game, very repedative even for a beat'um up game. In only 3 hours im already half way done. The Campaign is super short and no multiplayer. You can play as either rorschach or night owl but its still the same thing except as night owl you might grapple up top to get to the switch(switches are very over used) or as rorschach night owl lifts up the door you slide under then pull yet another switch. The combat is pretty nice lots of bugs, im guessing its a bad PC port or coded bad. In the end I would not recomed this game unless its on sale.			",432,40,14,34,35,0,42

												Watchmen: The End is Nigh is the game based on the graphic novel and the movie of the same name but will you want to play it ?Watchmen The End is Nigh is a prequel to the movie where you get to play as either two characters, Nite Owl or Rorschach. The story is simple. A prison break happens and a villain by the name of Underboss escapes and it's up to you to catch him and bring him to justice. Gameplay is very simple beat em up style, you go through levels and beat up thugs. There is a mini game where you pick locks but it's really bad. Each character has his own special ability as well. Nite Owl has a taser suit which when charged up can inflict more damage on enemies if they touch you. Rorschach has a rage meter, when it gets full you do twice the damage and counter every attack without a press of a button. The fighting mechanics in this game are abysmal. The game get's boring very fast and nothing really changes pace cause every level is the same.The game looks mediocre at best, the textures are low resolution, the character models are awful, not to mention they are reused almost every level. The comic style cut scenes are very well done and probably the only good thing about this game.Audio in this game is horrible. The soundtrack is bad. There were many times when the audio would cut out and only come back minutes later. Overall the audio design isn't impressive at all.The game is overall pretty easy until the final boss battle where there is a massive difficulty spike, where the final boss can kill you in just a few hits and then it's back at the start. But after a few tries you get down what you're supposed to do and it's smooth sailing.Level design is straight forward. The level is a straight road and you follow it till the end. When you play as different characters you can access the different parts of the map cause sometimes you need to split up.The game is very short, it took me 3,5 hours to finish it. The game has a bit of replayability if you want to play it again after the first time. You can play as different characters and try to collect the collectibles which upgrade your health and special ability.The game doesn't have many glitches or stuff like that. The only problem is the very stupid AI partner the game gives you. Sometimes you need the partner to open certain doors and it takes forever for him to actually get to you cause sometimes he doesn't follow you into battle.Overall Watchmen: The End is Nigh is a bad adaptation of the movie and the novel. The game get's boring really fast. Get the game only if you're only a massive and I mean a massive fan of Watchmen or get this game on sale cause it's not worth it at full price. I give Watchmen: The End is Nigh a 3/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			",904,350,32,94,59,7,85

												In my campaign to give critically-panned games a chance of redemption, I've stumbled onto this little gem of a game. Despite the harsh reviews, Watchmen: The End is Nigh does manage to get some things right.Sometimes, you just want to play a short and mindlessly fun game. Watchmen offers both with its brief 3 hour campaign and rewarding button mashing.The game opens with an option of playing as either Rorschach or Nite Owl, each with his own unique attacks. This divergence, for those curious enough, does promote replayability. Your character will unlock new combos just frequently enough ensure combat stays fresh.For me, the most impressive aspect here is the aesthetics. They're not the best visuals to date, but they're still nice to look at. The environments are detailed and the combat animations are smooth. Overall, Watchmen is extremely easy on the eyes.If you've got the change to spare, Watchmen will provide you (and maybe a friend) a few hours of enjoyment.Grade: C+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												It always rains in this city.Today more than ever.It's full of filth and corruption.It's time to teach those scumbags a lesson.I put on my mask and take my gamepad.Today this city is gonna soak with blood.What can I say about this game...it's just a 3d beat'em up, there is nothing except brawls, u just run from one fight to another punching everything u stumble upon in the face. There is also a lockpicking minigame but it looks so out of place and would rather suit some stealth action. So on the pros side it's a bet'em up that can be played with your fellow bro in local co-op and on the cons side the game is very repetetive and has nothing to offer except simple fighting systems. I'm not even sure the DC/Watchmen fans would like it.			",847,206,23,113,65,9,110

Summary:Watchmen: The End is Nigh is an extremely linear, shallow beat-em up with a horrible story. The only good things about it are the decent fighting mechanics that offer a lot of different moves, the decent graphics and animations, and the great cutscenes that include comic book style graphics and voice acting. The short, six-level story revolves around one character named Underboss. There is one boss fight, with Underboss, that is incredibly boring and buggy. Other than that fight, you are stuck fighting waves of the same groups of enemies throughout the levels over and over again for the entire the game.The Good: The fighting mechanics. The combat mechanics are quite good. Each of the two playable characters have several generic fight moves, special moves and finishers. Also, one of the characters (Rorschach) can pickup and attack with several different melee weapons. The moves and abilities are unlockables and are found / unlocked as you progress through the game. You can also dodge enemy attacks. Awesome cutscenes. The cutscenes are in a comic book style and look amazing. There is also voice acting for every character in the cutscenes which sound great. Good graphics. The graphics are good for when it came it out and they are also still pretty good now. The animations are also very nice.The Bad: Literally the same exact same thing over and over. The entire game is fighting groups of enemies. As you progress through the levels basically all you do is encounter new groups one at a time. Two types of enemies. Excluding Underboss, there only two types of enemies. The normal enemy, and the heavy enemy (who has more health and is stronger than the norml one). Reaccurng, boring tasks. There are four 'tasks' to do: open doors, climb ladders, grapple (Night Owl) and climb poles (Rorschach). These are put into the levels a lot and are insanely boring. Linear levels. There is only ever one path to take  in the levels. There are occasionally seperate paths for Night Owl and Rorschach, but that's it. Few levels. There are only six levels, and they're fairly short. Horrible story. The entire story surrounds one character named Underboss, Also, there are very, very few characters in the whole story. I don't want to spoil anything too much, so I'll just leave it at I think the story sucks. The ♥♥♥♥♥iest character names. The name of the main enemy is Underboss. Another enemy is named Jimmy the Gimmick. Seriously... One boss fight.  The only boss fight is the one with Underboss. The fight is boring as hell and also quite bugging. When I played it he stopped twice for no reason and just stood there, and I couldn't damage him. ",855,266,23,115,100,14,123

												This review is for both Part 1 AND Part 2 of The Watchmen: The End is Nigh. The game spans about 6 hours, so don't let my playtime fool you. For whatever reason, this game is split into two parts with separate steam store pages.Gameplay:This game is a bit clunky at first, I will admit that. However, the clunkiness does not kill the game, and after a while you get the hang of it it actually becomes quite enjoyable. There have been some criticisms that the game is repetitive. At some points, yes it is. Very much so in fact. However, the story (especially in the first part) is good enough to keep the player wanting to move forward. There are a few glitches to contend with, but nothing game-breaking and nothing that makes it unfair for the player. The combat is fluid and well balanced, and once you learn how to chain together moves and heavy and light attacks it gets very cinematic at some points. The combat system in this game is great for what the game is. It is an arcade-style beat 'em up with comic book-like cinematics in between levels. You should NOT buy this game if you're wanting Batman-style combat, because while you can tell that this is in the same vein as those games, it pales in comparison to the combos and high-flying action of a Batman action sequence. One feature I quite enjoyed was the constant introduction of gameplay elements through pick-ups. I thought that was a really helpful way for me to keep myself interested and keep fighting through wave after wave of baddie. I wanted that next powerup. Unfortunately, at some points, the pick-ups that seemed to be right in your path suddenly move to something you have to find. At the end game I noticed that I was missing about three or four moves that I could have collected, but nothing in the game told me that I needed to go and look for them. There are also Nite Owl suit batteries and Rorschach cards that you can collect to expand the power-up meter. They're not necessary, and I completed the game without collecting very many of them. If you're a completionist however, good luck, because the level design at times is frustratingly confusing. There were so many parts in the game where I thought that I would find a power-up at the end of this long hallway and theres isn't anything at all. Quite annoying. The second part just gives you all of the moves you missed straight away so you don't have to worry about moving on without your full moveset. They just give it to you eventually. One thing I thought was odd was the tiny, subtle playstyle differences between Rorschach and Nite Owl. Rorschach is the ONLY one who is capable of picking up weapons and using them against enemies. Nite Owl, for whatever reason, doesn't like to pick up or keep weapons. I think that this makes it more fun, in some ways, to play as Rorschach because theres nothing like smashing a mace across a thugs face. I don't want to give the impression that Nite Owl is useless, however. He has equally awesome moves and I felt satisfied playing as him for the first part. If you're a Nite Owl fan, like I am, you will enjoy this game. If you're a Rorschach fan, you will also enjoy this game.Story:I personally enjoyed the story of the first part of Watchmen. If you know anything about the Watchmen universe, and how it differs from our own, you will also enjoy the story. I also enjoyed how Rorscach and Nite Owl converse with each other at numerous points along the journey. They bounce hard-to-grasp ideas off of each other, and each of them have their own opinions that they vigorously believe in. I thought that the conversations between the two main heroes definitely help to make the player think about the pretty complicated concepts that Watchmen like to tackle. The second parts story is lacking, and is very much so the weaker of the two.Visuals/Sound:This game is visually impressive for what it is. The environments are done well, and while there is a lot of reusing of materials in this game its not really botheresome. There are some really neat environments and it is fun to see how those environments change the player. An example of this is if its raining in the level, your character will have tiny little raindrops all over them. The visuals are done well and you can tell that effort was put into them. At no point did I feel disappointed by the visuals or art in this game. Mentioning art, the art direction in this game is excellent. It stays true to the Watchmen movie and really makes it feel almost like deleted scenes from the film. This made me enjoy it all the more.Overall:Overall this is not the greatest game to ever grace the steam store. However, if you're a Watchmen fan, like I am, you will really enjoy this game. Part 1 is a really solid arcade style beat 'em up and will keep the player entertained throughout. Part 2, however, feels kind of like an afterthought and because of this it really isn't very good compared to part 1. I found myself pushing to get through part 2 just to get it over with. Some people may even be satisfied with JUST buying part 1. You're not missing anything in part 2. I really enjoy this game and I think that if you can get a deal on it you should try it out too. On sale, this is a great value for your money. At the time of this review, the first part is 5 dollars, and I think that is a fair price for this game. Bundled together with part 2 it jumps the price up to 10 dollars. I wouldn't pay that for the second part. Get it on sale, and binge on some♥♥♥♥♥kicking Watchmen action.Final Score:Part 1: 7/10Part 2: 5/10			",238,38,8,21,28,1,12

												What a cool♥♥♥♥♥game! Simple brawler that allows you to mash buttons and succeed in progressing through the game but also offers a nice combination system for timing your hits. Theres a lot of variations in the moves you pull off depending on which weapons you are carrying (if any) and theres also some really cool finishing moves. The finishing moves are just flare that you watch after finishing off a fight but its super cool.Its aged nicely, the graphics are beautiful. =) Very fun cool game.			",361,36,10,32,8,1,9

												Pros: -Great art, both in comic-style cutscenes and in game rendering-Surprisingly good writing-Reverent towards the story it's based off of-Rorschach roars when you activate rage mode and would probably make a great dancer-Actually good celebrity voice acting-A fun, developed combat systemCons:-Gameplay wears thin after a while, can be repetitive -Very short, parts 1 & 2 can be beaten in 6 hours-Don't buy this game if you can't stand the sight of fat male gimpsI would recommend buying this game on sale, because while it is fun, you have to decide how much Rorschach roaring in a fit of rage is really worth to you.  I give it a 7/10.			",233,45,4,9,3,1,1

												First i saw this game on PS3. The demo was pretty good and publisher promised us fast-paced adventurous game, all we get is 2-3 hours of mindless button-smashing, cloned level areas and identical bad guys. Unlike other review sources, i did not like the voice overs. While J.Haley did really good job in playing his Rorschach character(as expected), everything else sucks big time. Narratives are dull and pointless. Sound is either out of sync or out of place. Also game is filled with glitches: you will definitely see passing through walls and objects during combo and final animations, bad guys stuck in shipping containers, horrible AI leaves many idle NPCs etc.Verdict: If you want to spend $3, buy some good used book on Amazon or rent a couple of  movies.

												When Rorschach and Night Owl are on watch, there is only one word the thugs will need to know: pain. Use Rorschach's brutal abilities and Night Owl's technological devices to find your way towards the lair of Underboss, but they must hurry, because the end is nigh and upon them. Fight in co-op or alone to reach your destination. And the cinematics are made out of comic book stripes. So yes, this is Watchmen. As it is meant to be.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

												Watchmen (2009)In an alternate 1985 where former superheroes exist, the murder of a colleague sends active vigilante Rorschach into his own sprawling investigation, uncovering something that could completely change the course of history as we know it.守護者（英語：Watchmen）是一部2009年超級英雄電影，由查克·史奈德執導，改編自1986年至1987年出版的限期系列（limited series）漫畫書《守護者》，作者為艾倫·摩爾（Alan Moore）與戴夫·吉伯斯（Dave Gibbons）。故事設定在架空的1985年，處於美國與蘇聯之間的冷戰時期。電影2007年九月在溫哥華進行拍攝，排定2009年3月6日全球於一般影院與IMAX戲院同步上映。如同導演前作《300壯士：斯巴達的逆襲》，本片同樣仿製原著漫畫的分鏡構圖，但並不全部場景皆用去背（chroma key）合成背景方式呈現。			",212,17,18,13,11,1,7

Story fits in pretty well with the Watchmen universe, as does the look and cutscenes.

The combat works but is just poor from a gameplay point of view.The graphics are pretty good however.

The brawler genre has done so much and come so far, has been absorbed into so many other genres and made a part of so many other games. And then Watchmen: The End is Nigh comes and reminds everyone that you can, in the 21st century, make a game that is just, solely a brawler. And it sucks. So much.			",1060,382,26,186,112,12,150

												Well , if you're comicbooks fan , you may be fooled by the title. i dont recommend this game for several reasons.-weak story , its like 2 mins story litraly.-i'm not gonna complain about the graphics because they're fair enough for the game's price.-gameplay is sort of limited , you have only like 2 moves thats it right punch , left punch ( woa ) -no puzzle can be mentiond in this game.-the plot , theres none , because theres almost no story.-so repetitive , so easy , you only punch people thats all , nothing more nothing less. And well its epsiode one too , so even after you finish it , you're bound to buy the next episode which is not going to be better than this one for sure.2/10 , weak game by all means. not recommending it either in full price or sale price.

												This game feels like complete shovelware.  Voice acting is fine, reminiscent of their movie counterparts but is limited to one-liners.  The short story is poorly narrated, played out through short comic panels.  There is little depth to combat amounting to rinse and repeat button mashing/combos through long fights due to excessive enemy health pools.  Enemies are basic not giving much challenge and are very limited in models with many of the same character often filling the screen and little over a half dozen models.For fans of the series we get another cop-out.  It seems like any new Watchmen content is completely contradictory, with Comedian shooting JFK in the movie opening and any events here being ignored in the Before Watchmen series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To start of, I'm a huge Watchmen fan and love Rorshach. But this game is a complete let down. If i didn't love the characters this much I wouldn't have finished it. Not that there is much to finish. This game barely has a story and the combat is mediocre at best.Compared to celenrated beat 'em up style games like the Batman franchise this is a laugh. It works but it's so boring and one dimensional. There is barely any depth to it and when you enter Rage mode (Rorshach) you can win any fight easily especially when you get the automatic counter ability. Buy it for the story? Maybe, on sale. But only if you absolutely want to see everything that has anything to do with watchmen. There is no other reason.The couple of hours I spent in this game where an subpar way to waste them. I do not recommend this game. If you really want to see what it is, watch a playthrough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Im a huge fan of the graphic novel, I liked the movie, but this game sucks pretty bad. It's short, the story is really lame, it can hardly be considered a pre-quel to the movie/comics since there's no connection whatsoever to the original events. The gameplay is simple, but it suffers from the camera problem of old games (you can get attacked from people that arent showing up on the screen and you dont get warned about it). Few combos, but the executions are really sweet.And the graphics are nice.But the biggest problem is: it is VERY REPETITIVE. Its like: fight, open door, fight, open door, fight. If you played Ghostrider for PS2, its exactly the same thing. The characters have some philosofical discussions through  the game, but its hardly any deep like the comics intended them to be. The voice over is pretty decent, tho.But all in all, this game is REALLY NOT WORTHY it. The repetition of the same things for 8 chapters makes it really boring and annoying. Just a very bad spin off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Watchmen feels like it was thrown together in a few weeks to coincide with the theatrical release; its an arcade brawler featuring uninspired level design, rather generic enemies, a ho-hum story, and a short 3-5 hour playthrough.  However, where the game excels (and should) is in the fighting engine and brutal finishing moves, from Rorschach in particular.  Beating up bad guys is extremely fun... and there is enough move variety to keep it interesting.  Nite Owl's fighting style is different enough to warrant a playthrough as each character.  The co-op mode is a joke as its on the same PC.  Definitely worth getting on-sale to burn through in a weekend.			",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

Steam had a WB Games sale and for $2.49, they had the Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Bundle on sale. This game is the prequel to the 2009 movie 'Watchmen'. It is great fun and is alot like the Batman: Arkham series. This game is great fun and follows the storyline of what happened before the Watchmen movie.Highly Recommended9/10Missing some minor graphics, but otherwise great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is kinda disappointment even though I payed only 2.50 for both this game and its sequel.I didn't expect much. I expected a subtle beat em up with limited controls, not too much of plot and a quick ending (since I read the reviews), but this game even manages to get UNDER these expectations. The controls are simply one thing: A ♥♥♥♥ing shame. You can't (always) use your mouse to change perspectives for some reason. When standing still, you can rotate, while running it has like a 50/50 chance to work or not to work. It's like the controls are totally randomized out of the inputs you give. Sometimes even attacking doesn't work and you hear some error-like sounds.Plus the game is bugged as ♥♥♥♥. When charging enemies it happened a few times, that I just popped out of the scenery and someow fell like 2km away down into nothingness. The bugs don't make it unplayable, but when you spend 5 minutes on a boss, and right before finishing him you pop into nowhere, thats ♥♥♥♥ing annoying!If you wanna play some beat em up for little money, go get prince of persia or anything else, just not this game.

												Unplayable with an XBox controller. The camera moves down to the floor, looking up at the character, there's no proper right analog control support it seems like. With a keyboard and mouse it's doable but still a complete farce. The game sometimes refuses to accept input, other times chooses targets that are too far from the player. This is a bad game.

												I heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Life seems harsh, and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says: ""Treatment is simple. The great game - Watchmen: The End is Nigh - is available on Steam. Go buy it. That should pick you up."" Man bursts into tears. ""But doctor..."" he says ""I did buy Watchmen: The End is Nigh. And it was shithouse. Also, you're fired."" Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game sees the controller, it just doesnt want to see any of the buttons it seems because the name of the controller xbox wireless is right there.

												Extremely too short but decently fun. It isn't much to work with as its really very sameish from begining to end. It isn't much but it is fun at least. The story is decent, the art style is pretty cool and Rorshach is fricken awesome! I like the partnership between them and the brawling is ok but it doesn't have much to it. I don't know why they bothered making this game into two parts... that seem liked a big mistake on their part. I think they hoped you'd play through it twice with both characters but that just ain't going to happen. A shame this didn't work out but at least I hope this helped them work out the kinks to make the awesome Arkym series. Still, worth the buck I paid for it, on to the next one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Watchmen Part 1 is not a particularly great game, but it is decent enought to get a pass for fans of Watchmen. This is basically a 3D version of an oldschool beat-em-up, which in and of itself makes it worth at least checking out, as there aren't many of those games being made these days. You get to play as Rorschach and Nite Owl and you go through a series of levels beating up bad guys. The combat is surprisingly decent and Rorschach's moves feel appropriately brutal (Never actually got around to playing as Nite Owl). As the game progresses, you learn new moves, which helps to keep things somewhat fresh. The visuals are actually pretty good, and the comic style cutscenes are nicely done (they did a decent job of making the artwork look like that of Dave Gibbons, who drew the original comic and was actually art director on this). The storyline certainly isn't on the same level as something Alan Moore would write, but it is pretty interesting and the characters get into a few interesting philosophical discussions (Len Wein, who wrote the script on this was the editor of the original comic book). You also get to see some characters who were only mentioned by name in the book, which is neat.Where this game really feels weak is that it starts to get repetitive. There's really only maybe two or three types of enemies in the entire game (although they have different skins on each level, in an attempt to create the illusion of variety). This hurts the game a great deal in my opinion, because it is basically non-stop fights, broken up with the occasional puzzle to solve. This game is only about three hours long, so it ended before the repetition got too boring, but it did start to wear down on me about halfway through and had the game had been longer I probably would have been more negative about it. Overall, this isn't too bad if you get it on sale. Don't expect the next Double Dragon, but it's passable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												first of all, this is not a single player game. some would call it a mindless buttonmashing beat-em' up. and thats exactly what it is. It is however a very beautiful such. Its true to the Zack Snyder movie adaptation and you can see Rorschach's brutal but precise fighting style, or you can play as Nite owl, who utilizes a more smoothe and round-reaching way of taking down criminals, cops and those in between. It will get pretty repetative after a while since the level design is fairly mirrored and there really is just two kinds of foes. Normal foot soldiers and big brawlers. It does however have nice comic book-styled cutscenes, and i would say it's one of the more story-driven game's, as opposed to actual gameplay. the mystery storyline is compelling and fun to try to figure out. If you like watchmen, either the original graphic novel or the movie adaptation, and have a friend in handy, It's a game worth picking up. However, if you are a lonely troll, then just don't dowload this game, leave your computer and get out and try to meet people. Because after all, there are few things as fun as to hunt down criminals (and other people who stands in your way) with a friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: I couldn’t stand to finish this human catastrophe of a game. It is just too bad. I gave it a try again after some weeks, realised, who awful this♥♥♥♥♥♥is, and abandoned it until the end is nigh for me. That said, just let me add, that “Watchmen: The end is nigh” is pretty much one of the most stupid things on steam. The whole thing is just bloody awful, the graphics are ugly, the levels are boring and repetitive, you fight pretty much the same guy cloned a thousand times, because all enemies look the same. Talking of the fights: The whole game is always and constant the same dull repetition: Run along some corridor, beat down some dudes through the same stupid, repetitive, boring combat system, continue to run, split up, run, fight, meet Rorschach/Night Owl again, run, fight, get bored as hell. The story is a joke. A simple, stupid, bad joke made from cynical WarnerBros. Which obviously only tried to make a fast buck out of the Watchmen franchise. This stupid, dull rubbish is NOT at all worth the name “Watchmen”. There is no deep story (until the point, where I finally gave up), pretty much all appearance of characters you know are nothing else then unmotivated, senseless fan service at most. Nothing of this pathetic piece of digital♥♥♥♥♥♥is in any way worth the name “Watchmen”. ♥♥♥♥ this game. And ♥♥♥♥ everyone who is responsible for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But the game is terribly short. I was able to go through the game in 3 hours. If you count that you can play as Rorschach or Nite Owl the play time can be up to 6 hours. As there are no achievements or collectibles you have no reason to play with the second character.It's only worth to buy in massive discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Watchmen: The end is nigh, is a Beat 'em up, action game, where you take control of either Nite Owl or Rorschach. It's a relatively small game, with 6 chapters that last about half an hour each (depending how fast you go) but it still has a good plot (which i won't reveal)Pros:- Decent graphics- Simple controls, nothing extreme like you'd expect on other beat em ups- Unique Characters- Enemies arent OP- Awesome double chinsCons:- If you play as Rorschach, Nite Owl's AI is completely useless, and merely distracts enemies for a while- LinearNotes:- Short game, which is bad for some, but others might like it. For the price, personally, i can't complain.- Playing as Nite Owl means your AI partner (Rorschach) actually helps fight the enemies- Batman Before Puberty Hit + What looks like the guy from CoD GhostsOverall, 8/10 score. Well worth the money, especially if on sale!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
