												Not only is Nation Red my favorite game, It offers a wealth of game play. From a brainless shooter game, to a hardcore tactical game, NR has it. Its a game that takes time to master, and as soon as you think you mastered it, theres more. From hours playing solo, to a epic coop game, the fun never ends. If you dont have this game, stop reading and go buy it now. If you have this game, what are you waiting for, go bloody the fences.ThxBier808(NRCE) Nation Red Coop Elite			",94,5,11,6,7,0,8

												I can't fault this game for support, the devs are on the Steam forums daily checking for problems or keeping us up-to-date with what new features/changes are coming with the upcoming patch. It is the best supported indie game I've seen on the Steam forums!The game is a top-down zombie shooter and fast-paced play but lots of fun too. I've put a lot of hours into this game and it never gets boring, the constant updates which include 4 player co-op, weapon upgrades, perk upgrades and new achievements. Keep the game fresh.

												Nation Red is a really amazing zombie shooter game in third person perspective.Pros:+ nice design, different maps / locations+ playable in singleplayer, coop, multiplayer+ different modes (e. g. defending a barricade, survival, king oft he hill, free play)+ convenient music, good sound+ different survivors with special abilities+ all options possible (graphic, audio and so on)+ selectable level of difficulty+ you can turn friendly fire on/off, collect exp together or alone+ a ton of zombies and massive growing waves + many different weapons which you get by killing the zombies+ health kits, short-term skills (also by killing zombies)+ levelsystem (you can choose an ability with every new level)+ players can resurrect teammates at any time + 140 achievements to hunt, leaderboards+ IT MAKES FUN!Cons:- no story (in Singleplayer you have missions, but no profound story)This game is for people who really enjoy using many different weapons, having action all the time, killing non stop zombies without thinking much and without a break. So hm I love the game. lol Original price: 8,99 €Summersale: 2,24 €			",224,60,10,20,8,0,13

												Nation Red is an addictive 'twin stick' (or keyboard and mouse) shooter with a zombie aesthetic. However, as realistic as the weapons and characters may lead you to believe, you'll soon be summoning clones with shotguns, calling down orbital lasers and splitting the Earth in two with a wide variety of power ups and perks fuelled by your killing spree.Nation Red has a wide variety of maps and modes for players to try, ranging from no-perks single player to a holdout mode with four players desperately defending an encampment of minigun weapon stations from an ever increasing horde. For what's more or less a one-man-band project, Nation Red has grown massively since its 2009 release and continues to do so even now, with new achievements, maps and perks being added at somewhat irregular, but extremely welcome, intervals.Average Game Length? Depending on skill, games can range from a few minutes to over an hour.A Bit Like? Crimsonland, Smash TVIs It Fun? The perks make this game beyond entertaining, and four-player modes add a chaotic atmosphere like few others!Worth The Price? £7.99 may seem a bit steep for those looking at the screenshots and video, however playing the game is completely different and provided you like other similar games, you will certainly get your money's worth.

												Nation Red is a good example of a simple gaming trope (top down arena shooter) well executed is all that’s really necessary to make a game fun and worth playing.Basically if the idea of wading through waves and waves of 2 legged creatures of various sizes and shapes with different offensive capabilities while you take down as many as you can in the process sounds enticing... well it is quite enticing.Lots of weapons and powerups to keep the action interesting and make you consider variables such as stopping power, depth of effect, range and reloading time to pick what suits your particular character class best. The perks system is very extensive and the variety of the combinations you can manage just serve to enhance the gameplay even further.The game excels both in single player and multiplayer and you can even play local co-op with up to 4 players as long as you got enough gamepads to accommodate them. I have to say if you are a fan of classic arcade shooter action this game is one of the best values in gaming in my view. For those with competitive juices the varied leaderboards and achievements will serve as an impulse to replay the game to see just how much further you can survive and better your personal best in the different game categories. If you like what you read so far just get it as soon as you can and enjoy it by yourself and with friends... repeatedly.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												Looking at the store page Nation Red looks cliché, yes, another zombie survival bloody shooter with nothing particulary new (or standout) in game design. It's a few years old & easy to overlook, but I am glad I tried it. It is reasonably priced & surprisingly looks & plays gruesomely well! Imagine a claustrophobic top-down arena, twin-stick shooter with a bit of a Left 4 Dead flavor to it. No story, just a smörgåsbord of Power-ups & Perks, to accompany the never-ending horde of thousands of mindless zombies to slaughter ""cooperatively"" with your friends .. this is Nation Red!It's simply addictive in its psychopathic repetition. This is accomplished by offering simple responsive controls, with unique classes that can be greatly modified with the perks, weapons & power-ups each  session. Then combine this with inherent co-op multiplayer mechanics in reviving dead players, covering each other & the like, and you have a lot of variables to change the outcome of the game. It might be the same map you have played 100 times already, but every session has randomness & feels unique to a degree.Difficulty is very scalable, but with an experienced group it can feel like it becomes a 'war of attrition' sometimes (as in they can go for a looong time!). Controls you will understand after a min or two of gameplay, but as you last longer you need to start working on your crowd control & aiming, plus using the right power-ups or weapons for the situation. If you want go all 'hardcore survival nutter' into it, you will also need to learn to work closely as a team! All this can take a bit of practice, but does keep you wanting to come back for more to see if you can survive longer!There are also an extensive list of achievements to challenge you - some really cool ones too, kudos to the devs for their creativity! Thankfully as well, the devs saw fit to let you Lock your favorite weapon so it doesn't get replaced by a new pickup you run over (Lifesaver!) - nothing worse than having your assault rifle replaced by a crowbar in the thick of taking down a boss! Something all new players should know about :). There are really no in-game annoyances at all, its all well balanced & easy to distiguish visually amongst all the blood & guts. Meaty Metal/Rock riffs keep the adrenaline pumping throughout! Soundtrack & effects complement the style of game perfectly.Solo mode offers a few more tailored challenges too in a series of missions. You can also play all the Multiplayer modes in Solo. Solo, I would argue, is harder than co-op but both have their merits. The pure Survival mode I found to be the toughest out of them all.Even though the game is over 5 years old, I was still able to find some online games without too much trouble. Even if you don't see any games hosted, you can start a public match yourself, & others can drop in and out whenever. This makes online mode a breeze to use & keeps you from waiting in dreaded lobbies. Nation Red reminds me of earlier times .. classic gaming days. Days when FPS weren't trying to be an action movies, when RTS (not MOBA) was popular & when 'simulation' in the game title actually meant the real deal. And most importantly, when shoot 'em ups were .. all about the survival & scores. Refreshing, addictive, simple & fun!Let the power-up gods grant me my Mini Gun, my Machette  & let's paint the Town Nation Red!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												This game initially seemed pretty bland and repetitive, but then I started messing around with the different modes, and I found myself having a lot of fun with Barricade mode, trying out the different perks. There's a lot of customization that can be done to change the way the game plays (via the perks you get when you level up), but none of it is permanent, so it's easy to experiment from game to game. The sheer carnage, especially once you're able to last for awhile, is really something. I've never tried the co-op, but I feel like I've certainly got my money's worth anyway.I haven't played this game for awhile, but I saw that it's on sale for $1.50, and felt like I'd throw in my two cents for a lesser-known, but fun game.

												Imagine Dawn of the Dead as directed by Michael Bay.Here you go.This is the dark and harrowing tale of the end, as the zombie hordes descend on a position held by one man and his minigun. Can he survive? Hell no! But he'll take down thousands of the undead ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with him. You'll laugh, you'll cry. This summer, DiezelPower will paint the town RED!Seriously, though, this is a horde shooter designed to be played with your friends, although it's still terrific in singleplayer. You simply have to hold out as long as you can against the oncoming zombie army. They never stop coming, but you level up and get better weapons from drops. Simple, but fun. It isn't uncommon to be dancing through the hordes with a flamethrower, as earthquakes, firestorms, explosive venom darts, and even the hand of God tears through the zombies around you. If that sounds like your idea of a good time, then buy this game right this instant. You can thank me later. ",170,12,4,31,24,0,39

												Red Nation is a great game if you have half an hour to an hour to kill in between doing something significant or if you just want to take a break. It's a simple game of point, shoot, powerup and repeat as you mow down hordes of zombines across some relatively generic levels. While the addition of things like 'boss zombies' changes things up a bit, overall the experience is fairly repetative. It's fairly mindless and at times, frantic, which I guess makes it a good game to play if you want to get your mind off of things and just let loose for awhile.			",90,4,1,6,0,0,0

												Here is a game i have had for quite some time and played it and then put it down due to other games i wanted to play more and well you know how it is i just forgot about it.I will be honest picked it up again due to it getting ""TRADING CARDS"" (very sad reason i know) and found that i really do like this game.Play this game in short bursts and it is really is fun to play and quite a challenge on some levels on your own (played it a little in co-op and i must admit i prefer to play it by myself as i found it more challenging this way and therefore for me it was a much more intense and enjoyable way to play the game).The graphics are ok and do their job adequately with the zombies shuffling around in true zombie fashion (except when they run at you for the kill as in 28 days later),the story is really not important (and there isnt really one to speak of-except kill the zombies sergeant to get to the next level of even harder zombies) and the music is quite cool and suits the game and the action thats going on,on screen (guitar riffs anyone).But its when you come to play that it gets quite addictive and thats where the fun lies (""I WANT TO BEAT THE NEXT WAVE AAARRRGGGHHH AND I WILL DO IT YOU ZOMBIE SCUM"").The survival mode is very challenging (and was my favorite part of the game to be honest) and even with the experience you build up (through out the course of the game) and use the perks you can choose from help a little but not much as the HORDE gets bigger and ""BIGGER"" (more play time i think to get better at this game needed).I really do like this sort of pick and play game style and will come back to it again just to see if i can get that liitle bit further in mission and survival mode's and thats where this games appeal is,""JUST ONE MORE GO I CAN DO IT,I WILL JUST HAVE ANOTHER 5 MINUTES"" (but it allways ends up being a couple of hours and not just another 5 minutes know what i mean AARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH).If you like this sort of game and are not yet sick of ""ZOMBIES"" then i would still say buy it but get it in a sale or bundle deal,if you dont then i understand as we have had a lot of zombie games of late and like they say ""TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING JUST ISNT GOOD FOR YOU"".

												Ah, zombies. We're all sick of them in games, aren't we? Nation Red is a game with a simple premise. You're one of four classes each with their own perks and you have to fight off the zombie horde! That's basically what this game boils down to, it's almost exclusively a horde mode. Even the ""Mission"" mode is just fighting off a series of hordes except the match changes after you hit a certain amount of kills.What makes Nation Red unique and rather fun is that it's very comparable to twin stick shooters/shmups. The zombies keep coming at you and your goal is to stay alive. Like most shmups, as you kill zombies there are weapon drops, perk drops, and you successively upgrade your character to help you defeat the horde of zombies.  There are a couple of maps and modes and the game is excellent fun solo, but when you have four people on your fireteam, that's where the game shines.This game is excellent for killing some time and the style (twin stick shooter) is a style I particularly enjoy. If you enjoy shmups, if you enjoy zombies, and if you enjoy testing yourself to reach a high score, Nation Red is an interesting twist on tried and true gameplay experiences. It's fast paced and has a couple of modes and maps to make you want to come back.As a caveat, I cannot really suggest it at its full $9.99 pricepoint, but if it hits a sale/bundle and the style of game is up your alley, you may find Nation Red is just your ticket. I'd also suggest playing with a controller, because, well, its a twin stick shooter and you're far more lethal with a controller in this kind of game than you are with a mouse and keyboard.

												This game quickly became one of my favorite 'zombie games' It's just so satisfying to play! Partly because of the the SOUND! The guns sound great and powerful. Combine that with a great and well fitting soundtrack and it gives you those 'f*ck yeah' moments.   The game has a brilliant perk system. Not only you have a huge collection to choose from, there are also different modes. With Auto Perk Mode, you can predefine the perks you want to use during play and let the game enable them automatically when you level up within a game. You can use Strategic Perk  Mode, to choose a perk yourself during play. And there's Random Perk Mode, wich gives you a random selection of perks to choose from. Besides perks there are also a lot of powerups you can pickup while killing zombies. These powerups last for a certain amount of seconds, while perks stay active until you die. You can choose between various profile classes, wich are different types of soldiers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Because this game came out years ago, the multiplayer isn't as active anymore. However, a feature I particularly like is the ability to start a multiplayer game solo and let other players join you. In this way there are MP games available to join on a regular basis. So you don't always have to arrange a MP session with other players first. If you are a little lucky, someone will join you. But it's still a good idea to look on the forums for co-op partners. If there isn't anyone available, there's also enough to do in various single player modes. It's still a blast to play on your own. Maybe you are doubting whether you should give this game a try after all those zombie games you've seen. Well yes, Nation Red is one of the older ones out there but still one of the finest in my opinion. If you like the genre, this game simply belongs in your collection. And you can always download the available demo and let that convince you.			",326,58,45,16,44,6,25

												Nation Red is a top down Zombie Shooter. And a good one!In several different Game Modes like Barricade (you need to hold a point, have some support from Sentry Guns or Soldiers) Survival (show them how long you can keep going) or the Classic endless mode. Every Game Mode offers you a different Challenge. On top of that, there are tons of different power ups you can pick up, that will drop randomly from your enemies. While you’re playing you gain Experience and Level up, with every Level up, you get access to a wide Range of skills you can choose from, to optimize your Character in a way you want to play the level/game. Through that, the game offers a wide range of variations to try out and experiment with. The game also offers a variety of boss monsters you encounter randomly throughout your current play trough. Which all have their own strength and weaknesses. You can change the difficulty at any given time. As stronger as you make your enemies, the more experience you will get from them. The game is quiet some years old, but is still looking alright in my opinion. I never had any lag issues or stutters in my whole playtime and not a single crash. The music pushes you and matches the action on the Screen. I really enjoyed my time with the game. Even though you “only” kill tons of zombies in every game mode (Isn’t that the reason why we play this? :)), through the wide range of power ups, skills and weapons, every play through offers are different experience. The game modes are fun, and require their own unique style to master them.  If you’re looking for a fast paced Zombie shooter, with tons of splatter and action, you came to the right place. I can totally recommend the game to everyone. Since you can change the difficult on the run, the game is never frustrating. If you die, you will know why and not because the game confronts your with unfair hard enemies. The game offers a challenge to veteran players, and is also a ton of fun for players, which are new to genre. You will steadily improve and feel the difference when you make your enemies stronger.Also, if you just want to relax, turn the volume up, make the zombies easier and splatter your way through their lines!

												Nation Red is a high octane top down zombie shooter that I personally have grown very fond of. Unlike many games, you can always jump right in and have a blast without the pressure of getting to a checkpoint or planning, etc. Tons of action and seemingly endless replay value are huge factors for this game. Although joining an online multiplayer game is kind of a hit or miss for the most part, if you have friends you can play online with...this shouldn't be an issue. If you're looking for a really fun zombie shooter with relentless waves to destroy, look no farther. I recommend this game to any fan of the genre or fast-paced games in general.

												There is a game on the Greenlight queue called Crimson Land. Nation Red is it's unofficial spiritual squeal, with its name being an obvious allusion to the 2002 top down shooter.Nation Red goes so far as borrowing the functionality of it's powerups from the older game, but what is doesn't borrow is it's scale or balance. Where as Crimsonland was incredibly well balanced, Nation Red seems to find it's levels too short, easy, or escort-y to be too much fun. It's certainly not a bad game, and is enjoyable for a casual play, but anyone who enjoys it should certainly do them selves a favour and seek out a copy of Crimsonland, and Greenlight vote it while you are at it.If you picked this title up when it first launched and did not enjoy it, it's worth a second look now as devs DiezelPower have done a commendable job of updating the game since launch.Plagiarism out of Ten			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this was among the first additions to my steam library. i bought it because it was new (back then) and it looked cool. turns out, it's a well thought out game made by a developer who takes pride in his work. i've got a lot more hours logged in this game than it would seem. and although i don't play Nation Red daily anymore, i do still spend a few hours a year playing it, i pick it up again every couple months.i recommend this game to fans of top-down, twin-stick shooters. as a wave-based, co-op, survival match, the difficulty gets as high as any i've seen. even though it seems like a very simple game, it requires a high degree of skill (and probably a case of OCD) to get to the higher waves. and the sky is the limit on waves, there is no end to the gameplay that i know of besides player death. there is good gameplay here for the casuals to the hardcore mouse-jockies. (although i usually play with an xbox 360 controller, myself).as you might imagine, it's not a super resource intensive game, so performance shouldn't be an issue for much of anybody with a desktop pc or decent laptop made in the last three or four years.the only thing i could ask for might be more colors on the screen. it seems to me the entire environment is just shades of brown and all the creatures are very close to being brown too, presumably because everything is dusty because they're in a desert but still, more colors would be welcome. at least, i think so but i could be wrong.another player described it well. to paraphrase, (the gameplay is) ""like a mathmatical equation, no accident.""

 Overview  Nation Red is a zombie themed top-down shooter that places you and up to four players in an arena-type environment. You’ll fight your way through endless hordes of the undead with an extensive arrangement of weapons and perks at your disposal. The game’s core mission is relatively simple: surviving. However, the means in which you go about that are yours to choose.You’re given the option to select between four different classes: The medic, the gunner, the sniper and the scout. Each class will have their own unique stats [speed, armor, healing, accuracy & reload] and weaponry preferences that provide limited bonuses. However, any class can use any weapon, but only two weapons per class will instill your class bonus, so be aware when deciding on your loadout. In my time playing I never really found the specialty weapons all that necessary, nor did some of the passive bonuses or base stats for each class really make too much sense. For example, the scout boosts a 10% accuracy bonus, while simultaneously being able to move at 20% quicker than any other classification, all the while dealing extra damage with a sawed-off shotgun and AK, however the combat medic has a reduced accuracy rating of only 80/100% while having a logically more accurate loadout [M4A1 Carbine//Glock 19]. What this devolves into is a class-based accuracy system rather than really any accuracy rating on the gun(s) themselves. Overall, I felt the bonuses to be a wash in general with the exception of the combat medic for the added healing attribute. Aside from that, picking one from the other felt more like a coin toss than anything else.The game itself is comprised of various game modes: a single player campaign, multiplayer and versus modes. Single player is a simple objective-based game mode that requires you to complete each level in order to advance to the next. The other game modes are comprised of: barricade [free play with destructible barricades & sentries], free play which is surviving as long as you can while earning XP and perk bonuses and survival mode, which gives you one gun and a goal of surviving as long as you can; there are no perks or bonuses in this mode. The final mode is standard King of the Hill game, which is a versus battle between 2-4 different players. I found most of the enjoyment was in either barricade or simply just playing free play and trying to beat our own personal best. There is no real game objective, so much of why you play with boil down to if the game is fun, you enjoy these types of games and/or if you’re achievement hunter, as this game as a plethora of achievements to earn, some painfully difficult.For those looking to play with friends, both the co-op and multiplayer functions work surprisingly well and lets players jump seamlessly in and out of a hosted game. That being said, the community is pretty extinct at this time, so make sure to bring friends. Pros   Large list weaponry/powerup/perk combination to cater to your play style. Multiplayer/co-op function perfectly - no issues hosting or joining hosted games. Decent replayability Cons   Character classes seem watered down. I didn't feel there was much of a variance between them all. The community is essentially nonexistent at this point in time.Overall, Nation Red is a fun, mindless shooter to spend some time blasting away zombies with friends or by yourself. While there isn't much for substance in the realm of longevity, the game combines several different modes and a cache of weapons and power-ups to make the experience stay fresh for longer. In the end, Nation Red might not hold your attention for long without friends or your own competitive edge, but when it does it is an enjoyable experience.			",640,213,19,74,88,12,80

												This game is very addictive casual zombie themed shooter-survival game. Basically you just need to try to stay alive as long as possible. To help you survive you have many perks to choose from that give you new skills, bonuses etc. and of course you have a great collection of weapons to choose from.You can play it single or multiplayer and you always find games to join so this game is really much alive and doing great and is great fun to play whetever you play it alone or with friends.Also if you are into achviements this game has a lot of em to achieve and a few of em are really rare if you like to collect those.

												I am sorry to write this negative review, but, honestly, i find this game very very boring, even though there are a lot of achievements, and i like collecting them. The fact is that to me the game feels pointless, just shoot enemies, no story mode, 2 or 3 game modes. That's all. The whole game. I have to say there are a lot of perks, which help the game not being too repetitive overall. Even though, there is no point in keeping shooting zombies, there is a global level, but it is completely useless, you have all unlocked by the first play. From there, the game won't change absolutely nothing. There is no sense in playing the game for me, i bought this expecting it to be at least a bit like ""Dead nation"", but now i just wish i hadn't bought it. Just pick this game if you like a lot killing zombies, possibly with a partner, but don't expect it to be more than this.			",90,18,0,5,6,0,13

												Definitely very good game, Top-Down it's not maybe my prefered genre, but I really enjoyed this game. I have just done 100% achievements! It was fun :)As achievement hunter I can recommend this game too, 'cheevos were challenging and innovative (achievements in this game = ideas of people who play it - you can suggest in steam discussion), but nothing what you wouldn't be able to do, especially when you have some hours behind you. I have finished all achievements in around ~50 hours, all without 3 cows, which means killing 500k, 750k & 1kk zombies and generally it was the most boring part of this game when I have finished everything else (killed ~330 000 when I was done with rest achievs.). Unfortunately Multiplayer will be dead till the end of this year, I had problems now with finding players, sometimes was lucky, mostly weekends evenings. The game is interesting as it gives you many weapons to use and lots of nice skills (in the end you will use ONLY ak47 or Jack Hammer and skills - PowerUp Hook & Snare, but it took me almost 25 hours to find out that those are most effective :P). Also many game types, all are the same generally and missions were most boring as you just must complete every mission 15 times, what forces you to play 15x 18 missions = boring!!!Conclusion: The game gave me most fun when I was doing those innovative achievements, first ~50hours.edit: 14-03-2017Dev added 3 achievements some months ago, well... he probably didn't try them himself as these are clearly SICK.- Ignition- Slow DeathNot sure if can recommend this game for achievement hunters anymore, you will need some hardcore help for those.

												This is a darn good wave defense game. Like Crimsonland but with graphics that are alright. Plenty of fun gameplay modes. I played probably 60 hours of offline play when I was laid up waiting for and recovering from surgery and this was one of the only games my 2011 mediocre Acer laptop would run on its nVidia mobile chip. Given how many of these kind of games I've played since that just miss the mark on the fun factor or something else important, I think it's worth remarking on how cool of a game Nation Red is. For the genre, a 10/10 title.			",426,61,7,83,21,0,63

Do not buy this for $10 (think about value versus price, this is a decent game but not for $10).

												This is an outstanding game that will give you many hours of fun. It may seem as a simple top down shooter, but it actually demands good tactical and strategic choices and can be quite challenging. There are loads of weapons to try out, and you have free choice of how you advance your character with special abilities. Selecting the right perks for your playing style will have a big impact on how far you can progress. There are several game modes and missions, including online and local coop, and while playing those, you can try to collect over 100 achievements for additional fun. Apart from the play value, the game is very well supported and the developer adds extra content and updates from time to time.Try this one out, even if you usually don't play this kind of games!

												pew pew pewpew pew pew pewThis game is all about the pew.It's a fun, top down shooter, that can get pretty intense when the screen is just covered with zombies and there are grenades and bombs and fire going off everywhere.  After playing it for a couple of hours, you really feel it in your eyes, I honestly think that this game could be called ""Nation Don't Blink"", because I felt that I never did whilst playing.The perk selection process is messy, but fun.  Picking random powers when you level in game by pressing space and then selecting from a set of choices.  Like the guns and weapons, some are good and some either aren't or at least don't seem to be.  And in the middle of a multi-player game, when the game doesn't pause for you to select your new perk, sometimes you just select anything and have no clue what it does.Speaking of which, multiplayer seems to be more enjoyable than single player, but this is the case for most games I guess.  Even though there is seemingly very little interaction between players, and it's more of a One for All and Everyman for Themselves kind of approach.  At least you can revive fallen allies.  Just be mindful if FF is turned on.  And in the mess of the screen, it is possible to get lost at times, especially if you take your eyes off your toon to try and find where your ally is incapacitated.All in all, it's a fun game that's great for the price and great for a bit of a break from other games.4/5  pew pew pew			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Normally when I think of zombies I think ""oh no they're going to bore me to death"". Seriously, zombies are the most played-out  garbage when it comes to videogames. There are so many and they move slowly and ZZzzzzz it's like zombie game developers give up before they wrote their first line of code.Nation Red however is one of the few legitimately great zombie games. It's an overhead arena shooter, the closest comparison would be Smash TV. Survival isn't just about gunning down the undead, it's also being able to clear paths to get those necessary powerups. Leveling up allows access to numerous special abilities. Some are plain in their functionality like better armor, while others add firepower (venomous darts, acts of God, random explosions), and still others help develop a player's ""build"" (stronger sentry guns, better stats at the cost of extraneous weapons). This is part of what makes this game so maddeningly addictive. As the game progresses the zombie hordes become stronger, their numbers become overwhelming, and death is eventually little more than a bad button press away. At this point the game becomes immensely satisfying. The mechanics aren't as tight as I would like. Melee in general is very iffy and accidentally picking up a crowbar or an axe is almost as bad as diving right into an explosion. Otherwise I don't have any complaints. Online play and a multitude of modes are also nice additions.Honestly the only reason I don't play this game all the time is because I still have 200+ other games on my Steam account to try. It's that darn good.Give Nation Red a shot sometime. This is one of those games that tends to drop to 90% off during Steam sales so you won't be hurting for the cash to afford it.

												Need to blow off your steam? Why not shoot some zombie scum to pieces? Yeah, I know - sounds pretty psychopathic, but keep in mind: It's fiction. And in this game's fiction you simply shred zombies to pieces. Simple as that. So what is ""Nation Red""?First of all: It's your quasi ""casual zombie massacre game"". Quasi casual because it offers the possibility to descend into Zombie County for 10-20 minutes and get back to work, family, whatsoever after. If you're looking for a longer shot you may try the challanges, so it works both for those who are taking a short time out as well as those who want to get some challenging progress.Second: It is a zombie massacre. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're looking for a thought-out plot (or a plot at all), you'll be disappointed *massively*. If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced and action-packed top-down shooter with zombies (a whole da*n lot of zombies), you're in for a gory treat.Graphics:The look is great. It's your typical scrapped, end of days atmosphere combined with your typical zombie settings, including the ""usual suspects"" as a cemetary and the obligatory gas station.The areas of the levels/maps are pretty limited, which of course intensifies the action.Keeping in mind that this game already has some years under its belt, the graphics are still ok (and what's important for me: working on my netbook), but not top-notch. However the atmosphere gets delivered perfectly.Sounds & Music:Give 'em hell - metal riffs, shots, explosions, gore & splatter - ""Nation Red"" delivers an absolutley convincing and genre complimentary sound design.Gameplay:The concept of ""Nation Red"" is simple, yet addictively entertaining: You'll be confronted with hordes of zombies and you'll gain experience points while shooting, chopping or stabbing through your undead enemies. Power-ups like ""Bullet Time"" or mines drop sporadically, alternate weapons and grenades offer some tactical variations.The game itself is being played via gamepad or with mouse and keyboard. Shooting, evading, switching weapons, grenades - you really don't need more than these. And, granted, you don't get more options than these. So summing up: Simple concept, simple and extremly easy to master controls.Bottom line:If you're looking for a diverting, entertaining zombie shooter with a ""casual"" touch (""casual"" not meant in the negative way), lots and lots of gory fun, fast-paced action with easy to grasp controls and a grand combination of metal music and booming sound fx, ""Nation Red"" is your game.

												Every so often I like to come back and play little of Nation Red. As a single player game, it's decent fun and offers a really solid challenge, though sometimes bordering on unfair. However, the random drops help to change things up a little, and you can lock onto a weapon when you find one you like (Steam Hammer, anyone?)It doesn't have a story, it doesn't really offer anything new after the first 5 minutes, and it doesn't have the greatest visuals or soundtrack... but what it does offer is pure, explosive fun.

												One of the most mindlessly fun games I have ever played.  Actually, it is not totally mindless, as you need to plan out your perks to maximize your experience.  But it has a great ""pick up and play"" aspect to it, as well as the ability to go into Barricade mode and see if you are in it for the long haul.  Give the demo a whirl if you have any doubts.I honestly can't say enough good things about this game, and to top it off, the dev is active in improving it and has a presence in the forum.  And that is 16 months after release!  Good on you, DiezelPower!			",225,38,8,32,8,2,23

												It's a small game that was released a while ago and doesn't seem to get much notice - but whenever I have a few free minutes, this is the game that I feel like playing. The developer clearly puts a lot of effort into it, a new update just came out that adjusted a lot of things. It's a top down shooter similar to Smash TV except you're fighting zombies. Powerups and weapons are combined with perks that you get on leveling up to help you chew through the horde. It's simple fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahh the joys of the zombie apocalypse.Get your guns and thumbs ready because hell is coming straight for you. I loved this game and even having completed all missions find that there is still much playability.Mastering the perks is also part of the fun, but don’t think that just because you can add and upgrade your abilities that it will save you from the onslaught of infected that are “coming right for you”!Rams, grenades, miniguns – these are just a few of the weapons that the zombies will wield against you, in return you do not have to worry about the bullets you waste as all guns are unlimited, that said reloading can be your undoing.I found that or such a straight forward game a lot of strategy was involved as there are movement penalties for going backwards, using heavier guns and the upgrade decisions will affect your game all the way through.Absolutely loved it – so when you get a copy feel free to invite me to a game.

												To sum this up is simple, it's a budget top down wave based zombie survival game with plenty of weapons and perks.It took me a little while to understand the perk system and in what modes to select what perks but after a few hours of trial and error i finally got the hang of it and wow, for the pennies i paid it has to be one of the most addictive games i own.There is plenty of time to practice in the single player mode but once you feel brave enough to step in the arena where up to 4 of you can slug it out against endless waves of the undead in free play mode, baricade and survival modes. each has their own qualities and it's merely down to preference to what you will enjoy most.There are 4 characters to select from though personally i stick with the basic solider class. nothing says awwww yeah than LMG fire everywere! Each character has strengths with certain weapons and has certain talents. The solider is an all rounder, loves the LMG but also specializes with the AA-12. The scout carries less health but manouvers a hell of alot quicker than the soldier and really does enjoy using the M107 or pistols. The other classes i have yet to try.The perk system itself is brilliant, once you work out exactly what you want from them you can use the Auto perk mode in the main menu to pre-select what perks you want with each level up so it allows the flow of your game to go undisturbed.!This game is totally worth it for the minimal cost and its a wonderful stress reliever! Trust me nothing sorts out a bad day quite like Nation Red!9/10			",162,9,19,5,25,0,13

												Fantastic game that I just can't get enough of. Good concept, well executed and good fun to boot - multiplayer is easily the most fun I've had in a while. Tons of power ups and weapons and you soon get a feel for the strategy you want to adopt, although you can approach the combat from a few different angles. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesomely fun and enjoyable. Blasting zombies has never been so addictive, and the online co-op makes it a good game to play with friends. Single player is great as well as you can challenge yourself to beat other's highscore with the leaderboard. If you like classic top-down arena shooter games like crimsonland, you will love this as well. This game is based on a similar perk and power up system as crimsonland. You have the option of choosing a perk each time you level up as you gun the zombies down. Another plus is that the support the game gets from its developer is amazing, as this game is still being updated by them with feedback from the community			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												One of the most addicting games I have ever played. Pure fun, both solo and in multiplayer.The hundreds of perks and the fact they appear in random, makes every game different, but still similar enough to develop a ""strategy"" of what to improve first. And I don't even really like top down shooters. Blessed be that ""Free Weekend"" when I had the chance to try it. Good game to buy with a couple of friends too.And great support, even after all this years, the developer still adds new content (all free, not a single DLC here), takes suggestion from players and even do ""contests"" like design a new weapon or perk.If there is one game that should be bought merely based on support, this would be it.

												Easily the best zombie shooter I ever played. You don't really need to understand anything about the mechanics to begin. Seriously, just press start and you're off. You're put in harms way straight away and things basically gets tougher and tougher untill you're overwhelmed by the zombie horde. That's exactly what you want from a zombie game. Still there's plenty of depth if that's your particular craving. There is a slew of builds you can experiment with and a ton of clever little achivements you can try as well to boot. Oh, and there's a multiplayer as well.Try it out. Blow off some steam. And some Zombie heads. ",29,4,1,15,1,0,7

B.P.R.#2 - Bullet Point Review for... Nation RedIn a NutshellNation Red is a twin-stick, top-down, third-person, hyphen-attracting, zombie-shooter by DiezelPower. In it you shoot zombies (a prerequisite), gather random weapons, level up and choose from an assortment of upgrade / perks, and try either to survive, kill enough zombies to clear the level, or be the last player standing depending on what mode you are playing. The game's aesthetic is gory and dirty and the gear you use tends toward the modern / future side of military armament without stepping more than a toe or two into science fiction's house. Let's get to it.  Zombies! Lots of them. Big ones, small ones, slow ones, quick ones, male, female, weaponized and weapon-wielding, ya got em! Each of the types has something other than their appearance to set them apart, and you'll find a fair mix of dangers spread throughout the crowd of undead. There's even the random boss intermixed in the horde and those fights can be tough while trying to keep the common dross at bay! Bosses drop better loot but can deal and take a lot more punishment. Bring a sammich and a lawn chair, this fight's gonna take some time. Level up your character on each run. When you die, your character resets but the game is built around that, and the leveling is so fast and options are so varied that it plays like an arcade game with a hint of permanence in the form of unlocks. Random loots! Yes, this game has em. Weapons, power-ups, exploding barrels, grenades, dynamite and more. Also... Random perks. Yes Crimsonland fans, Nation Red took this one whole cloth. Each time you level you get to pick a bonus from a handful of the 78 available in this game. This serves to change your character's abilities and maybe even your play style with each level up. Play to a specific plan (if you can) or tweak your toon all over the place. Go nuts. You'll be dead soon anyway. Play solo missions to advance the game variety or hunt in arcade modes like survival and even customize your perk load-out before playing. Play with a team in multiplayer; either local co-op or online. Choose one of 4 classes in multiplayer mode to fit the role you want to play. Got a favorite gun? Lock it in so that it doesn't get switched out for the next random drop you step on. You can carry two primaries so find the ones you like best and cling to them. Watch out for those invisible walls. The 'arenas' are much smaller than in a game such as Crimsonland. You might find yourself pedaling backwards, unloading slugs on the encroaching baddies, only to have your backside come up against an invisible wall. Things get crowded fast. Aim for the head. Unload the clip in panic-mode, or... If you DO get cornered, you have some tricks to try; grenades, kicks, axes, machetes, crowbars and the like. If those fail, jump/dash past the biters and get yourself some breathing room. ConclusionOn first blush, it looks like a modernized Crimsonland clone, and although there is something different here as well, that analogy doesn't far miss the mark. Like CL, this is a game that circles some well-trod terrain, but does it so smoothly that it feels worthwhile and satisfying. As I alluded to earlier, the arena feels much tighter than Crimsonland's, but that's a good thing. Close-quarters makes it possible to become overwhelmed much more quickly and with fewer monsters biting at your personal pieces.Nation Red is not a game where you level your character, crafting a killing machine to stand against the ages or even to stick around for future gaming sessions for that matter. In NR, you build for the moment, leveling up in the hope to live long enough just to level up again. You know that eventually you are going to fall, but in the meantime take as many of those undead mooks with you as you can. It's bragging rights in the halls of Valhalla. That's the ShMUp-blood flowing through this genre's veins. Go until you can't go any more, and have fun in the fire.The game retails for $10 and does go on sale occasionally. That said, 10 bucks is an honest price for this game and there is plenty of gameplay and enjoyment to be found here for the price of half a Jackson. If you like top-down, twin-stick shooters with satisfying, crunchy effects, pick up Nation Red. Those zombies ain't gonna shoot themselves.*Happy hunting,M13*(Well, some might. They aren't the sharpest crayons in the box...) ",160,25,0,17,4,0,12

Vous pouvez également jouer jusqu'à quatre, le jeu est excellent entre amis. Plusieurs arènes sont proposés ainsi que 4 personnages tous avec des capacités différentes.

												This is probably my favorite time waster. You can play for 5 minutes or for 2 hours (if you like the grind, it's not for everyone) and then be done. It controls smoothly and co-op is a blast.			",178,32,5,13,9,2,13

												Excellent game. Simple shooter, but quite subtle to handle, and more subtle again to master.Has a few years, but can be considered a ""big budget"" version of a domain public game.Excellent controls, speed, fun, good weapons, feedback, and the game actually rewards skills.RPG-like since you can choose among permanent perks that help you through. You die a lot, restart immediately to do better through training and leveling. Fun to replay so.Funtastic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nation Red is a 'last stand' game. Now, the missions act like a sort of tutorial, because they only last several minutes each and they're not that hard. But if you play co-op or survival, it means enemies will endlessly spawn until you die. Every once in a while enemies leave weapons behind; sometimes they're better, sometimes they're worse (depending on the weapon you're carrying at that very moment) and it never takes more than a few minutes before you die. There's a timer that stops when you die and afterwards your time gets posted to a leaderbord and you can give it another try. It's like virtual crack, it's ridiculous.

												I don't know what it is about Nation Red, but every time I start it up I end up having a lot more fun than I expected to. Extremely simple gameplay combined with a frenetic semi- (or not if you so choose) random leveling system make it a great game to pick up and play for short bursts either by yourself or with friends. $10 may seem a little steep for an obviously indie top-down zombie shooter (YAWN!) but it was one of the first and still manages to outplay any others that I've come across so far.

												If you don't own this game, shame on you.  It's the best twin-stick shooter on the market, bar none.  It has several game modes, with at least three of them being an ""endless"" mode variant.  It features many different weapons, each with varying damage, range, reload times, and clips.   You get infinite ammo, mega pickups, and hordes and hordes of zombies to murder brutally.In most modes, you get to choose ""perks"" for every score threshold you reach.  Perks range from simple things like increased Armor or faster Reloading, to some crazier things like setting zombies on fire for being near you and causing the Turbine pickup to nom zombies.There are perks that come in perk tiers to upgrade specific pickups - for example, the Fire Team perk upgrades the Ghost pickup so that your Ghost friend carries a shotgun instead of a pistol.  Get both Mirror Image and Fire Team, and you get two shotgun ghosts for the pickup.  Upgrade to Strike Team and Wild Bunch... and you get FOUR Auto-shotgun wielding Ghost friends to fight by you for a short time.This game will keep you on your toes the entire time you play.  Good luck reaching the top of the leaderboards - it's doable, but good luck.			",850,155,26,144,50,4,79

												One of the best games of 1943, im currently in my bunker in hiroshima japan, after the bombing i felt like many rays of chemo has hit me. And then i found my love, ""Nation Autis- .... Red""  it gave me the cancer i needed, the love i needed the POWER THE KNOWLEDGE THE MEANING OF LIFE. But one day this game gave me to much cancer this fatass named dominic had the power to cure cancer. But he was to greedy, he had to buy the DLC's for this game, it was on sale for 1 dollar. My senpai was killed instantly after jimmy neutron dropped the nuke on my country :(. I now need chemo 10/10 would buy you fat♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cuntszzzz			",35,0,0,2,1,0,0

												This was one of the first steam indie games that I bought, back when indie games started to really become a thing!The developers commitment to the community, how new achievements, game modes, weapons, etc. were released back in those days blew me away. SnowBrigade -- the developer -- kept in contact with us and a lot of requests on the forums went straight into the game.As for the gameplay itself, it's one of the few games I can play and really get into the zone, pure zen mode focused zombie slaughter with no distractions.

												A great game, especially considering it was developed by a one man team.  Would be considered a bargin-bin game by many; well then, this is one of the best bargin-bin games out there.  Fun gameplay.  Very grindy at times.  Avoiding the zombies and killing the ones close to you seems to be a solid strategy.			",534,183,7,51,62,7,90

NATION REDDefinitely a ultra awesome top-down zombie shooter! Frantic, non-stop zombie slaying action. The premise is simple: You'll be under constant attack in endless waves of bloodthirsty zombie hordes. You get dropped into an arena, you pick up weapons, start shooting the living sh*t out of them zombies suckerz.. and in the process you level up to get perks.Choose between ""single-player, local co-op & online co-op"" with 4 different modes to play: (free-play, barricade, survival & missions)Very nice graphics and blazing-fast performance because of the very low system requirements this game needs.So, it's a very simple concept, but it's unbelievably entertaining.

												Nation Red is an 'arcadey' top-down zombie shooter.Presentation; Story, well, there isn't any. Zombies are here, you shoot them. There are a handful of game modes, but they're all just small variations on shooting zombies. The UI is not great, but it doesn't get in the way too much, I do wish the camera control could be a bit smoother though.Gameplay; The gameplay feels pretty good. Running around, dodging zombies, and shooting to clear a path in front of you. There is a learning curve in every single match as both the quantity and danger of the zombies increases over time. The game is replayable in the sense that you can try using different weapons and different perks, or a different strategy altogether; but you've pretty much seen all the game has to offer after only a few matches. I do wish the arenas were bigger and more interesting.Visuals; The graphics are adequate, not great. You won't be looking too closely at the zombie textures while you're playing, but the special effects aren't particularly impressive either.Sounds; The music and sound effects both feel repetitive; While the gameplay itself is repetitive, some variation in sound would have been nice. No voice acting.In conclusion, not a bad game. I had fun playing it for a bit. After a few days I got tired of it, and I haven't been back since.			",843,293,32,127,114,14,175

												Despite all the praise Nation Red has received it sure felt clunky and mediocre at best. As far as I'm concerned, games like Zombie Shooter and Crimsonland have this beat even without arms and legs.+Sound effects are okay I suppose+Boss zombies are a nice addition (extra points for Resident Evil players as they're pastiches from that series...or so I hope)+Networking seems to work well and co-op is sort of fun for a moment...-...until you realize the enemy waves progress tediously slow and the game ends up being boringly repetitive thanks to the otherwise lackluster game mechanics-For a twinstick shooter the player moves very slowly, especially backwards, making the game feel oddly sluggish compared to most games of the genre-Hit detection is sub-par and zombies and enemy bullets that aren't even close seem to do substantial damage-Problems in the hit detection are made worse by the fact that there doesn't seem to be any sound or other effect that would indicate you got hit in the first place-Weapons are crippled by long reload times and none of them feel particularily rewarding to use. One could say they're balanced but they're also very boring-Surprisingly brown mushy zombies blend quite well into brown mushy backgrounds-Odd issues with music volume reseting to maximum every time the background track changes-The ""single player campaign"" is a joke in both content and difficulty except for one or two difficulty spikes			",75,10,0,13,2,0,11

												The idea if Nation Red is simple. Zombie massacre. You will be dropped on a smallmap with only on goal: Survive the waves of zombies this game throws at you.Weapons, grenades health and other fragging options are dropped by killed zombies and ammo is unlimited on the guns. Ammo is not your concern is this game. While the amount of zombies is lowwhen you start, the amount increases significally and even unlimited ammo will eventually be not enough.On top of your weaponry, there are several other options to help you. Those will become available when your xpincreases. This can be a restore of health, increased chance of certain drops and more. You will have to choose the option that suits you and the amount of zombies everytime. The zombie count will be enormous so surviving depends on the choices you make during the game.If you want massive zombie fragging then you should check this out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very fun zombie shooter game. I can't see why this isn't selling so well compared to the newer zombie games. It doesn't have the best graphics, or the best mechanics, but it's certainly deserving of a higher attention from more gamers. For the first few minutes I played it, I was enjoying myself and I just couldn't find anything wrong in this game. One of its features that I like the most is that it's an arcade game so there's no feeling down when you die because your score just resets and you can aim for a better one. I truly recommend this game to everyone. Games like this are underrated because they're not given the chance to shine. I paid a low price for this and I wish I had more money to gift some copies so that I'd have more friends to play with.			",194,23,6,11,14,0,6

												The idea if Nation Red is simple. Zombie massacre. You will be dropped on a smallmap with only on goal: Survive the waves of zombies this game throws at you.Weapons, grenades health and other fragging options are dropped by killed zombies and ammo is unlimited on the guns. Ammo is not your concern is this game. While the amount of zombies is lowwhen you start, the amount increases significally and even unlimited ammo will eventually be not enough.On top of your weaponry, there are several other options to help you. Those will become available when your xpincreases. This can be a restore of health, increased chance of certain drops and more. You will have to choose the option that suits you and the amount of zombies everytime. The zombie count will be enormous so surviving depends on the choices you make during the game.If you want massive zombie fragging then you should check this out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nation Red is one of the most fun and satisfying games I've played where you can instantly jump in and out a whim's notice.Seriously, the amount of weapons and upgrades you can obtain are extremely rewarding. Once you start become buffed up enough to reach later stages of the game it becomes a case of superhero vs. zombie horde; you're extremely powerful but the amount of zombies on screen and zombie bosses create an extremely frantic experience. Even more so in multiplayer, but at least there you can revive each other.			",823,300,26,81,66,10,105

												A very fun zombie shooter game. I can't see why this isn't selling so well compared to the newer zombie games. It doesn't have the best graphics, or the best mechanics, but it's certainly deserving of a higher attention from more gamers. For the first few minutes I played it, I was enjoying myself and I just couldn't find anything wrong in this game. One of its features that I like the most is that it's an arcade game so there's no feeling down when you die because your score just resets and you can aim for a better one. I truly recommend this game to everyone. Games like this are underrated because they're not given the chance to shine. I paid a low price for this and I wish I had more money to gift some copies so that I'd have more friends to play with.			",194,23,6,11,14,0,6

												Nation Red is a fun and surprisingly addicitive top-down arena shooter. The goal is simple: Kill as many zombies as you can while staying alive as long as possible. The gameplay is similar to that of Robotron/Smash TV and includes an extensive perk system to help make every playthrough a little different than the last. The pacing is fast, the weapon and powerup variety is impressive, and the music (while somewhat repetitive) fits the game perfectly. Online co-op is a blast and leaderboards will keep track of your best performances. Best of all, the devs have continued to support the game even 2+ years after its initial release, adding new maps/items and fixing bugs through various updates. Highly recommended.

												This is my digital stressball.If you want a fun arenashooter, with huge amount of weapons and perks, awesome music and lots of zombieslaying madness, this is the game for you.The gameplay is simple, yet complex. Kill zombies, pickup powerups and weapons, and dodge your way through the slaughter. Everytime you level you get to select 1 of 5 random perks, all of them good in their own way. You have to pick which of them fits your playstyle and synergizes best with the previous perks you picked. This adds alot of replayability.You start off with 1 meleeweapon and a pistol. When you kill zombies, they drop weapons and powerups. You can always carry 2 different weapons at any time, ranging from rocketlaunchers, ak47, dual berettas, flamethrowers, machetes, miniguns and much much more. Once you found a weapon you like, you can lock it, so you dont accidentaly replace it with a new one. You can also carry upto 15 grenades in addition to the 2 weapons. These grenades will come in handy, because the zombies comes at you faster and faster as you stay alive. How long can you live?This game should be in every steamcollection.			",86,4,2,10,4,0,12

The developer, DiezelPower, haven't abandoned this game and is updating it and adding new content (MORE DAKKA!) regularly after 2.5 years from release - that's another reason why you should get it.

												I can sum up my play experience in two words: Fun and Carnage. Shooting down legions of zombies with a wide variety of weapons and gaining all kinds of special perks along the way makes this game a blast to play everytime I launch it. Although the mission mode is quite dull, the Free Play and Barricade modes are highly entertaining to say the least. A big recommendation for this game to anyone who likes wave-based survival games.			",72,6,0,6,6,0,10

												One of the best top down zombie shooters there is. You can sink many hours into this game with friends and still come back for more. The gameplay is fast, the graphics are good and the controls are easy to learn. The perk system is broad anough to allow some variation in gameplay, and the level design is well thought out. A great zombie coop.			",131,14,1,9,20,2,30

												For a quick and dirty top down, wave based, survival mode shooter, this game is surprisingly fun. Unfortunately after a dozen hours the redundant gameplay mechanics and lack of susbstance start to show.  For a quick game of an hour or two once a month this game is a great addition to the library, but for a full fledged title it ranks much lower in my opinion. 6/10 Buy at your descretion.

												Co-op is the only fun way to play this game but it's a damn fun little twin stick arena shooter. It's frantic but simple at the same time. Weapons switch up so often that it makes up for the tedium of the gameplay. Good little game but only at minimum of 50% off. Don't pay more than 5$ for it. It's fun for what it is, but there isn't much here that sustains itself . It's a good little time waster, nothing more.			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												This is a great, no bull**** arcade shooter.  If you're old enough to remember a game called Smash TV and loved it, or like games that are similar, get this game.  There are a couple bugs here and there but the Coop this game provides is extremely addicting and rewarding.  Every round starts off the same - kill Zombies, earn experience and collect the various powerups and weapons they drop.  Every level you earn gives you the option to pick a new Perk.  Could be anything from reloading speed to melee dmg to weapon accuracy and many many more.  The idea is simple: survive for as many waves as you can, each wave increasing in size and difficulty, collecting powerups to increase your chances for maximum gibbage.   It has controller support but you may want to use your KB/M for this one.			",182,14,3,15,6,2,3

Your job, survive as long as you can. As you kill the zombies you'll earn experience and get to choose 'perks' as you level up. You can upgrade yourself with zombie seeking bombs that fire periodically, darts that fire out killing zombies, increase your reload speed, improve your fire rate and many more upgrades.Plenty of fun to be had experimenting with different perk/weapon combos to try and delay your inevitable death.

A standard round of this game goes as follows: Kill zombiesZombies drop weapons, supplies, and power upsYou pick these up to help kill more zombiesYou level up and choose a perk which helps you either (a) live longer or (b) kill more zombies.The neat thing about this game is you can play it on your own, with random people in multiplayer, with friends over the internet, or local co-op.

												It's a simple, Smash TV sort of game where you kill zombies and pick up powerups while viewing the experience from an isometric perspective. Simple, but effective. Similar to ZombieDriver in many ways, just that you're on foot.For the price, if this is your sort of thing and you don't already have a game in this style on your PC, it's probably not a bad pick-up. That said, there's little this game does that others of this style don't already do, and in a few cases, do better.Overall, worth it if you like old-school top-down arcade shooters and/or don't have many games of this type.

Be warned though as the mindless fun provided may extend that 10 minutes to a hour or more. ",424,68,5,71,85,2,150

												I really enjoyed this game.  It is a top down, arena gameplay: Team based combat.  The levels are basically a small square and you run, dodge, shoot, and collect powerups.  The upgrade system is fun, but does not carry over from level to level.The basic concept - I feel this game is like an Arcade game, explosive, small levels, shooting every direction like SMASH TV.  If this was an Arcade game with Four joysticks, I would totally play it at an Arcade, since at its core... that is what it is.The guns are fun, the combat is fun, but the levels are boring. If you got a buddy, this game would be twice as fun.  This game is worth the buy! ... You must like these types of top down shooters though.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Behind a deceptively simple premise hides one of the more engaging, in-depth, and downright addictive top-down/endless shooters I’ve ever played. Start game, click mouse, shoot zombies, last until you die. On paper this is what the game appears like but a well-rounded and extensive list of gameplay altering perks to choose from allows each player to cater their character to a very specific combat style. With every wave of enemies that passes you gain a little more of a specialty for dealing out damage, but of course the difficulty ramps up as well. A fast frenetic pace means that boredom never sets in as you’re either going to succeed until you find yourself neck-deep in enemies, or you’re going to fail in which case you can instantly try again; getting right back into the meat of the action while trying a completely different build of perks.Perhaps not the prettiest game but good enough for what it wants to do and very well optimized.  I’ve played it on several PC’s including an old clunker that didn’t even meet the minimum specs and it still ran fine. Needless to say on a modern gaming rig there’s no problems at all, even during the most hectic moments.A long list of achievements (for those that care) and a decent match-making service provide longevity beyond what the base game offers (which is already quite extensive). Add in its low entry price and a committed fan-base and you have a recipe for one of the best hidden gems I’ve managed to find in recent memory.			",384,94,4,67,21,0,40

												It's a top down zombie shooter, much more fast paced than other ones you may have played. Graphics are decent, animations are okay, and the gameplay is alright. I really wish it was more than just a survival mode. A campaign of sorts would have been nice and kept me interested. The leveling in game is okay but it's a little annoying having random perks pop up as you may not get the say, health restore when you actually need it. It could use more content to keep it interesting, but the developers have been kind enough to add free new modes and maps through patches. If you're really bored and need to kill 10 minutes, this can get the job done. I can't see anyone playing this for more than 40 minutes at a time though. 7.5/10			",508,104,12,60,23,7,29

												Unlike your traditional zombie shooter, Nation Red puts you in the boots of professional soldiers with military grade weapons and firepower well suited to the target-rich environment of an attacking zombie horde. It also takes it away from the horror genre and well into action. The top-down all-ways shooter mode works for what amounts to a fun way to burn a half hour with freinds.The game isn't without its faults. The lobby and settings UI are a bit clunky and we get periodic crashes, so I can't reccomend it without reservations, but we have fun playing in the net.			",47,7,1,4,16,0,20

												It's a simple, Smash TV sort of game where you kill zombies and pick up powerups while viewing the experience from an isometric perspective. Simple, but effective. Similar to ZombieDriver in many ways, just that you're on foot.For the price, if this is your sort of thing and you don't already have a game in this style on your PC, it's probably not a bad pick-up. That said, there's little this game does that others of this style don't already do, and in a few cases, do better.Overall, worth it if you like old-school top-down arcade shooters and/or don't have many games of this type.

												Nation Red is an arcade style top down shooter game that combines zombies, power-ups, and perks all into a high action, all thriller fun extravaganza in short bursts. Yes, the concept may seem repetitive at first thought (and it is), but the beauty and fun comes from actually participating in the craziness that takes place. The music is some kind of metal derivative, and I quickly muted it in the settings, as I can not stand it for very long. You will develop favoritism for certain weapons, and also predilection for perks that suit your play style or power factor. There are missions, but they are basically variations of the other game modes that may be played at your leisure without attachment to the game's horror plot. Surely, because of its nature, Nation Red may not be a game you spend consecutive hours playing, and may be best if picked up at short intervals and breaks. There are many statistics that the game keeps track of for you, including a leader board for comparative and competitive reasons. The developer's are very much involved with the gaming community via Steam, and update the game often. I find that playing for longer than one hour at a time, Nation Red gets repetitive too quickly, and as I've mentioned before, it is better enjoyed in shorter periods. The player's character seems to glide and slide around the maps, which is a bit of an imperfection. These movements do not look very well done. Each of the game modes feel and play different from each other, which adds to the already existing amount of replay ability. While there is fun to be had with Nation Red, it simply becomes too repetitive and dull too quickly. The longer you play, the less you will feel like playing, and when you do play, you will be playing it for less time. It is a coffee break style game, and most of your enjoyment will come from fifteen to thirty minutes playing sessions. Anything more than that will rapidly wear out the game, and your interest in it. There is really not much to it. Nation Red is a simple and basic experience.Nation Red is okay.			",1294,339,60,143,147,16,197

For the price, it's a crime not to support the Devs.			",551,133,16,52,133,2,229

												Basically you play as Gordon Ramsey and a guy comes into your resturant (Hells Kitchen) and he's an absolute big job so Gordo kicks off 1 at him but it turns out the man is a TIME WIZARD and casts Gordy far into the future to the planet Zog, fortunatley the ALIUMS there have the technology to send him back but that crap is expensive yo and those ALIUMS gots to get PAID. So Gordo is tasked with appeasing each council member so they'll send him back to his little restaurant where he shouts at people and SPEAKS LOUDLY AND SLOWLY.Each council member has a different twist that reflects and parodies different common tropes and clichés of the modern gaming industry. For example one stage sees you fighting zombies in an urban/industrial environment, whilst another would see you in a modern military shooter scenario complete with the wubwub soundtrack.Whatever your videogame tastes are, Gordon's Kitchen Massacre is a real crowd pleaser and cleverly parodies tired videogame clichés which is often genuinley funny, the authentic voice acting really brings the Gord to life and makes you feel as though you really are the chef from hell('s kitchen)11/10 would buy again, game of the year, every year.nah just kidding it's rubbish			",140,17,2,13,5,0,14

												2/5  Fun at stagesThis game is just a mindless zombie-shooter, funny to be played with friends in co-op. It's not a terrible game but it gets boring very easily in spite of different available modes. There is no story mode, you just pass levels by levels shooting every zombie surrounding you with different weapons and items. Fun for a 5-10 minutes break.My relationship with this game is: play it for 15mins, wait a week and replay it for 15mins, uninstall, wait a month to reinstall and start the loop again.

												Yet again, this is NOT a recommendation. More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.The game runs nicely, it's got enough gore to go around, but after about 5minutes of repeating the same steps:""Spray gun 360degrees, reload"" ... then rince and wash ...You get quite tired of the game, and will probably end up stressing to find the quit button so that you might end the game as soon as possible before it makes you as mindless as the zombies that you fight in this game.I like the concept of the game, after all, who can resist murdering mindless zombies that seemingly has no end to it. But i don't really feel that's there's more to do here than just spray spray spray. A decent story driven mode where you could team up with a few friends would make this game decent i think, atleast worth the amount of money that you sank into it to get it.Rating 7 of 100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's got the right moves (in fact it owes a lot to Crimsonland, the predecessor of this game, which made top-down massacres fun), but then it does some things wrong, like adopt the 'edgy' modern military aesthetic complete with the ♥♥♥♥ing awful color palette, motion blur, and the lack of gameplay challenge. There is difficulty, but only because the zombies with guns provide an incredible difficulty spike. Perks feel boring. The endless slaughter gets boring. Boring boring boring boring.

												I feel like if this came out on Early Access people would trash it for the way it presents itself. Tutorials have pop-ups telling how to shoot after you've killed 10 zombies already. I think I may have seen a typo at one point. That's not some huge earth-shattering deal, but presentation is everything, and I think this game gets a pass for it's amateurish look because it happens to be modestly fun. Most people don't give games that look like this the time of day, let alone 10 dollars out of their pocket.Modestly fun, mind.

												I played this game with my brother and was not impressed by it. Its just a few closed maps with a few basic modes attached. I loved the trailer however that is not the game. Its like robotron with zombies.  I suppose if you just want to mindlessly blast zombies then its great. I perfer killing floor myself. Bigger selection of maps and enemies and the weapons are better. Save your money for something better.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												Purchased due to the ++ feedback. Then tried it... not ++ to me. More of a neutral to negative.What makes a fun Z shooter?1. Loads and loads of bullet time2. Fast movement3. Large map area to run and gun4. Loads and loads of bullet time5. Power leveling6. Weapon purchases and perks that carry-over7. Did I already say loads and loads of bullet time?Unfortunately, Nation Red misses everything. You have to worry about, re-load time, weapon weight, weapon fire rate, area of combat restriction, speed and stamina. That's right... all of those.If I wanted all of these things to worry about I should have purchased Fallout instead.Be warned. This is not your typical ""Serious Sam"" shooter. If you wanted something as insane and enjoyable as that where you release your frustration and stress on hordes of Z's....  the old school ""Zombie Shooter"" is the game you should be looking for.

												Avoid the ♥♥♥♥ out of this. It's an inferior ripoff of an old 2D alien shooter game. But the playfields are small, the controller support is buggy, user interface was clearly never tested for usability or clarity. Character stats in selection screen are lies. Might hold true for multiplayer, but since you can't randomly join a game, there's no way to know.Bottom line: Flash has better zombie shmups. Free. They're less drab, less frustrating, and better playtested. Avoid this garbage.			",227,167,0,50,16,1,32

												Nation Red is a top-down arena-based shooter where you fight thousands of zombies and bosses.The game offers besides a battle through 18 quests several gameplay modes like survival, freeplay and more. You will have access to a huge array of weapons and perks. There are many statistics that the game keeps track of for you, including a leader board.Co-Op can be played in any of the game's modes up to 4 players. While there is fun to be had with Nation Red, it simply becomes too repetitive and boring too quickly.

												Nation Red is a perfect example of the epidemic on Steam.  Games that are 90 percent complete and just lacking one major part to be ""amazing"".   The problem is that one major part in this case is the UI.  The UI in nation red is painfully bad.  Trying to choose a game is rough, trying to play the game is fun, but then you have to pick perks, and that's yet again painfully bad. I've tried to use a steam controller, a regular controller and the keyboard and mouse, and none of the three seem to work.  Worse, combining the steam controller and the keyboard I found I could cheat, sadly this cheat didn't only help but hurt the player (as there's a limit to perks)   but I couldn't find an efficient way to buy the Wild Bunch perk with out buying 7 other perks at the same time!    WTF? The game itself came out in 2011, and was a twin stick shooter where you kill zombies.  The graphics are fantastic, (for the time) and the gameplay is mostly solid.  There's points where a little more work could have been done, to make it a little more playable, and a better tutorial (or a tutorial) could have helped. Diezel Power made this game in 2009.  I bought the game in 2009 and it was pretty good for the time, but now playing it again, I remember how bad the interface is.  And 7 years later, it hasn't been improved.   A shame, because this is a fun little game, but I can't recommend it since it's just painful to really play.  Even with the bad front end UI, if picking the perks in game wasn't such a pain, this would be a recommend, but god the perk system is just so dreadful, I just can't get over that, because it's a core part of the game.

												Not terrible by any means, but it doesn't really compete for my time. It's rough around the edges.  For one, you have to enable controller support -- something that the game should either detect or should be enabled by default.  For two, there's not much compelling content in the game.  It's a mindless top down shooter.  There are many other games out there that offer a more interesting and compelling experience both single and multiplayer.			",163,35,4,12,14,1,26

												The story mode takes less then 2 hours to complete as its 18 missions long, only 3 of which are challanging and one of those is because there are no directions. If you go to google and type ""nation red m"" it will auto fill with ""nation red mission 9"". Theres also a sound issue that someone reported on 3-27-201 where one sound loops over and over again. SnowBrigade, the developer responded to that thread, saying to rename some files and that should fix it. 6 years later that bug is still there. With the looping sound my options were to mute the game sound (which I did), or restart the game to make it go away. The problem is, the bug comes back rather fast. The game also does not close properly when exiting so I need to kill it in task manager. These seem like small issues to complain about but the game itself is small and short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably the most boring game I've gotten off Steam. I am always looking for decent co-op games to play with friends and was excited about getting a 4-player game going after buying the 4-pack. After playing this game for 10 minutes I knew I made a terrible mistake. I regret subjecting my friends to this cascade of awful.This game is nothing more than constant waves of zombies that are practically effortless to kill. I even cranked up the difficulty to max and had no problems. Powerups are pretty frequently dropped and the waves are fairly small. There's no need to be creative or work together, just keep shooting and you'll be fine. I thought the maps would be large and offer numerous hiding spaces and objectives. Nope. Just you in the middle of the screen and zombies coming at you. You play one map, you've played them all. I want my money back, honestly. This game shouldn't even be available for purchase. I'd be pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I had bought this game at full-price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is what you would call ""♥♥♥♥ing garbage"". The enemies do stupid damage and are fast as ♥♥♥♥, and the ""bosses"" have no real boss mechanics, they are just tanky as ♥♥♥♥ and do crazy damage. The only thing this game does right for it's genre is it gives you a cluster♥♥♥♥ of enemies every second. But that's not a good thing in this game because the health packet drops are so rare that you die extremely easily and extremely quickly even with all the defensive perks. This game was cheap but for how bad it is i'd say it should be free. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT'S TRASH.			",34,3,0,2,1,0,0

												Nation Red is an ultra fast infinite play arena-based shooter providing an exceptional close-quarter battlefield experience. Fight thousands of zombie mutants and their bosses in frantic bloody gameplay while earning close to 100 perks. Fight in Barricade, Survival or Free Play mode. Play On-Line in coop, in single player or in local coop! August 17, 1977 Scattered groups of zombies infiltrate remote Midwestern towns. Incapable of using tools or weapons, the invaders are resisted until they retreat back into the desert. Special elimination posses are set up to hunt down any of the surviving undead. Six weeks after the squads started their search-and-destroy mission, the last known zombie was shot and killed. Present-day Over thirty years had passed when a truck driver traveling down a desolate Arizona road plows into a wall of undead. Before the driver's phone signal went dead, he reported some were carrying guns... They're back and now they are hunting us.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												The game is too ""zoomed in"", you barely have space to move. It gets even bigger of a problem in local coop. (You can change the zoom level from zoomed in to extremely zoomed in. ) The edge of the map isn't clearly marked either, so you'll have an invisible wall there. The weapon drops are a bit confusing, as a lot of them look similar, so you have to hover over to see what they are. Fortunately you can lock a weapon to avoid replacing your well loved ones and you can have two weapns at the same time. The campaign mode feels very similar to survival mode, so it's kind of bland. It has an exp and perk system similar to Crimsonland. When a stronger zombie gets hit, they will bleed and tumble, so you won't see instantly whether you killed a zombie or not. So it's kind of a meh game, but it's cheap, bug free and doesn't have performance problems even on my 4 year old low-end machine. (AMD HD 3850)If you want a good survival top down shooter, get Crimsonland or Shadowgrounds.			",352,80,6,45,21,3,92

												Eh, not my cup of tea. As a twin stick shooter, it’s good. But I guess I’ve changed significantly in my tastes since buying it. If you like just mindlessly killing stuff with guns, and want to kill time, than it’s probably good. But there are also serious bugs.I like games with story, personally, and I like thinking, and beautiful art, and something that ultimately makes me feel good or like I’ve learned something or grown, or inspires me.  So for me this is just very blah. Also, and more significantly for those who do like this kind of thing, the key bindings are all messed up. The game literally will not detect like half of the keyboard, including the wasd keys. (they work fine everywhere else, I’m typing this without problem.) so that is a pretty serious issue. Maybe it was because I plugged in a game controller? But the game controller doesn’t work either. That's a pretty serious set of issues, for a game that is just about moving around and shooting things, to not be able to do that properly (I was able to work around it by using the arrow keys, which work for some reason, but that means any secondary action keys will be way out of the way and janky to re-learn, I’d probably need to re-bind them to the number pad or something.) In any case, Not fundamentally a poorly made game, mechanics-wise. I bet if you want to shoot zombies in a twin-stick shooter, this would be satisfying. But I find it super, super boring. And more importantly, for the people who do want a twin stick shooter, the controls don’t work. That’s unacceptable. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A twin stick shooter where you are sick in a 100ft x 100ft square fighting infinite, massive, and annoying zombies. After about 20 minutes this game gets old. There is no strategy to this game, no technique. You can't create a good spot to hold off enemy's strategically, set traps or do anything else interesting. Just run around in circles like an idiot blasting in almost any random direction (since there will be a zombie there) until you get eaten. If this game had actual real size levels, not tiny rooms with invisible walls, a completely reasonable amount of zombies (not a hundred on screen all of the time) it might be fun. As it is, if you want to just run around in a twin stick shooting random weapons at random zombies, this might be for you. I hated how small and boring it was.			",207,68,0,16,2,0,7

												If you've got time to kill, you've got time for a few rounds of Nation Red.  There is some pretty hot ammo-on-zombie action going on in this game at all times.  Lots of weapons and perks to choose from and a bunch of different maps to play on.  The maps are pretty much one big open space just with a little different scenery on each.  But the game gets some great support from the developers and always seems to be getting free content updates since release, which usually consist of new maps, weapons and perks.Oh yeah...and achievements.  Lots and lots of achievements to achieve.  Basically, if you enjoy zombies, fun and computers then Nation Red is awesome.  If you're a terrible person I could see where this might not interest you.

												I bought this game about three years ago, when I couldn't get enough of isometric zombie shooters across multiple platforms. I beat the game a while ago, but I still like to come back to it every now and then. Good selection of characters and weapon variety. In fact, I have to say my favorite part was being able to switch weapons from random weapon drops, like twin uzis, nail gun, or giant anti-material gun. Another neat feature was the ability to choose perks. This is achieved by leveling up in a match by killing zombies. Upon each level, a point is earned to unlock a perk. Some examples include faster weapon handling or enhancements to power ups that drop on the map. There are three possible selections per perk, and they are randomized. There's a multiplayer/co-op component too. Honestly, I didn't mess around with it much as there was hardly anyone playing, so I can't say whether the mode was good or not. However, the single player component was more than enough for me. All in all a good game, wouldn't mind a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just brilliant. It has so many game mode, options and tweaks you can do. If you like the concept of Killing Floor, you're going to LOVE this game. It mixed up with tons of perks to choose from, with a dozen of temp powerups and a heap of weapons. There's even a level up system outside the games themselves, on top of leveling up inside each match. There's nothing I don't like about this game, and that's pretty damn rare. 12/10			",277,48,3,42,27,0,21

												Manic and fast paced, Nation Red is one of the few games that is as fun to play solo as it is co-op. With numerous perks and a staggering array of weapons, it is possible to have several killer loadouts, depending on how you play.The sound effects are good, and I personally like the heavy metal loop track they have going, which is rare as I usually switch off music in games - this one adds to the frantic atmosphere of the game.Possibly the only fault I could notice is that in 4 player co-op, it can be hard to keep an eye on your character, especially if there are others of the same class as you. Colour coding might be nice, or probably I just need to pay more attention.Other than that, co-oop is a great play, often with you having to stand near your fallen buddy to revive them.The game is often on special, and I would recommend this game as a pick up, put down game that still remains entertaining long after you would expect.Get the four pack, give to some friends and you'll have an enjoyable weekend right there.

												Nation Red is a very addicting third person shooter! Playing this game on multiplayer has not gotten old to me since I purchased this.  There are tons of achievements, and the game does a pretty good job at keeping you up to date with the progress you're making on the achievements.  There are multiple game modes to choose from for different objectives.  The campaign will last you a good 3 - 5 hours simply because you have to do each level 6 times to get gold stars, and considering that there is 18 levels, you'll be doing 108 levels before the fulfillment of totally completely a campaign with come to you.Fighting hordes of zombies has never been so much fun. In my opinion, you should pass up Left for Dead, Killing Floor, Dead Rising, and Trapped Dead, and go straight for Nation Red, as it satisfied my zombie killing needs, and hopefully it will satisfy yours as well.

The luck and random draws of perks every level keep it exciting and make you change up your gameplay and strategy, but isn't an extreme win or die mechanic like Rogue(lite)-like games where you live or die by the RNG.

												 This game is fun for some mindless top-down zombie shooting. You are pretty much in a small arena and run around, killing zombies and picking up power-ups while levelling up and picking new perks. Some of the perks seem pointless but you are free to customise as you want. You control by aiming with the mouse and moving with WASD. There are some really nice features in the mechanics (you slow down down while backpedalling, stamina bar for diving rolls, weapons feel satisfying). There are some annoyances (if you have shared xp on you miss out on level ups until the host pauses the game, the power-up hook effectively gives one player the lions share of the power-ups, ridiculously slow movement with melee weapons, the brawler takes ridiculous amount of damage), but overall a fun little time waster between other games. There is no real persistent progress (which would have been nice) so after one or two games I am ready to move onto something else.  With the current low online population, I would only recommend this when it is on sale, however.			",56,12,1,13,4,1,21

												If you've got time to kill, you've got time for a few rounds of Nation Red.  There is some pretty hot ammo-on-zombie action going on in this game at all times.  Lots of weapons and perks to choose from and a bunch of different maps to play on.  The maps are pretty much one big open space just with a little different scenery on each.  But the game gets some great support from the developers and always seems to be getting free content updates since release, which usually consist of new maps, weapons and perks.Oh yeah...and achievements.  Lots and lots of achievements to achieve.  Basically, if you enjoy zombies, fun and computers then Nation Red is awesome.  If you're a terrible person I could see where this might not interest you.

												此游戏非常具有开发潜力，作为一个生化僵尸系列的爱好者，实在是不能错过的一款游戏    目前枪械太少，每把武器并没有各自的特色，其中的近战武器简直是鸡肋，没有高攻击力 只能靠技能来增加近战武器的攻击力    希望游戏制作团队能再接再厉，继续更新枪支以及模式			",63,4,0,7,2,0,10

												Nation Red is an extremely fun way to kill a few minutes.  The combination of perpetual zombie attacks and online high-scores give it an arcade-style feel; I frequently play simply to see if I can move up a few places in the rankings.  The wide variety of weapons and power-ups and the special abilities you can earn are fun and allow different playstyles you can experiment with.  Online co-op play is strong, so you and three friends can kill zombies together.  If I want to unwind for a few minutes without investing the time or effort into something more substantial, this is my go-to game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked Crimsonland, Raklem, or other 1 vs a horde shooters pick this one up. Good music, 3d graphics, and they still update it. The company that makes it gives great support too. I had an issue where I could no longer download the non steam version I paid for. They responded same day and gave me a choice of steam or non steam.   The next day I got comped a copy on steam.Even has class based online coop! Great time killer!			",599,134,13,110,49,4,86

												A respectable and fun top down zombie shooter. Reminds me of the old arcade style shoot n roll games.It can get a bit boring after a while but with friends it's a lot of fun and screaming at one another when something goes wrong and it does.Worth $10? Maybe. If you got the cash to burn then yes. Otherwise wishlist it and wait for a sale. But you'll get your money's worth either way. More fun coop so get the 4 player bundle with mates.

												Fun game, really simple, you get the idea almost immediately, it's a clasic shooter, with a bunch of different power ups, and game modes, limited in it's maps, giving the fact that there are only three of them, but whatever, it's good, it's fine, it's nice, and it's fun, it takes a while to set up because for whatever reason each change of in the video settings made the game crash, and behave rather... erratically. Even then the game runs very well, even while having things like the ""number of corpses"" setting on the highest level.Another thing that i love it's how the difficulty is implemented, you can change it anytime you want, harder difficulties give more, and agressive, enemies, while easier difficulties, give less, and agressive enemies. It's nice, reminds me of something like how Doom uses difficulty.Get it on a sale tho, it gets very cheap around those times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game, as one of the pinnacles of game design; simple enough for anybody to understand (point at the zombies and shoot), but with a massive amount of depth and replayability in the perk system (one game, you can decide to focus on building as many powerful sentry guns as possible, another you get all the damage increases you can get, etc.) Beyond that, the game just feels good to play; all the weapons feel like they have impact, explosions are satisfying, and the experience progression gives you the warm feeling inside that only watching numbers increase and occasionally receiving rewards can.

												Since the major 12-2010 update and the developer implementing 1-4 player persistent lobbies soon, this title has become the essence of simple zombie blasting fun.  With four game modes It may not have the most options, but what's here is focused and surprisingly refined.  I am a bit bias when it comes to zombie shooters and have, over the years, acquired many for both major consoles, PSP and PC.  This $10 title definitely ranks in the top tier of ""must haves"" (in my opinion) and shouldn't be missed.			",131,7,15,2,12,1,5

This game does it right.Really fun to play Local Multiplayer. The design is perfect for having some buddies backing you up. Try it!Dead Zombies drop pickups and weapons, which come in a vast variety and contribute a lot to the game.The Perks are what make this game so much fun: Level up and enhance yourself, enhance pickups or enhance abilities that keep auto-activating after certain time intervalls to destroy your foes.Every class has its own strengths(Targeting Accuracy is damage with projectile weapons btw) and is fun to play.

												Definitely my favourite top-down zombie game.It's like all those other games where you spin your mouse around, aiming in the direction you want, and then pushing the fire button. Just like all those...I just got out of an approximately 45 minute game where wave after harder wave keeps coming. We had four players and did alright.Speaking of - I had to create a game because I couldn't find any, but luckily three others showed up while playing. So it's not completely dead MP wise.Lots of powerups, lots of guns, different types of enemies. Lots of blood and giblets. I would say play with some friends and see how far you can make it. It's a play once-in-awhile-when-the-feeling-hits type of game. I'll end up playing it periodically when in the mood for a no-brainer.

												Ever liked any game about killing zombies or just want a game about shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥for some stress relief? Holy crap buy Nation Red. Nation Red is probably the most solid $10 game I've ever bought, try the demo and if you like any of that grab the game and tell me you have it because I never pass up a chance to play Nation Red with a friend. It's a massive amount of fun that does require a lot of clicking for a lot of people, but if that becomes a problem you can circumvent this wiht a controller which tobe honest, there's little reason you shouldn't have even if you are a PCGamer.The best way to describe Nation Red is if you combined Killing Floor with Alien Swarm.

												Buy this game and throw your money at the screen for any future DP games. The dedication of this team to keep their fanbase happy is beyond amazing; check out the forums you'll see for yourself how awesome this game's community is, and the game is great to boot.If you like old-school arcadey top-down shooters you'll love this. It takes everything one could love about the genre and makes it better. With continued support and an amazing team of people that worked on this game it's a definitive buy and I'd gladly show my support for any future games.			",424,77,5,58,17,1,23

												If you've got time to kill, you've got time for a few rounds of Nation Red.  There is some pretty hot ammo-on-zombie action going on in this game at all times.  Lots of weapons and perks to choose from and a bunch of different maps to play on.  The maps are pretty much one big open space just with a little different scenery on each.  But the game gets some great support from the developers and always seems to be getting free content updates since release, which usually consist of new maps, weapons and perks.Oh yeah...and achievements.  Lots and lots of achievements to achieve.  Basically, if you enjoy zombies, fun and computers then Nation Red is awesome.  If you're a terrible person I could see where this might not interest you.

												Very funny game! I bought it on sale just to have a few hours of fun, but now I am going to play it on and on. At the beginning it is very tough until you learn who to combine the perks and choose the best weapon to kill all this incoming freaks. Excluding the solo player missions you can't win. Wave for wave there are more Zombies, more bosses and you fight as long as you can to survive. Multiplayer with up to four players is awesome! Unfortunately it seems to dying, but one or two games are always open. Get it for 8,99 Euro or wait until it's on sale, but get it.			",107,60,2,13,7,1,3

												This is a great coffee break game. The variety of weapons, power-ups, and perks means there are various builds you can play with, persistant leaderboards give you a ladder to climb, and ongoing support from the developer means tweaks and new content are still being added. The only weaknessnes are the limited range of game modes, and that the differences between maps are largely cosmetic. Still, I keep coming back for more, and am happy I picked it up.

												As someone who normally can't get their head around the topdown view some games take, Nation Red is a modest exception. Do you like killing zombies? Do you like killing them so many different ways you could remake Green Eggs and Ham about your mayhem? This is the game for you, but be forewarned: you will most likely never play this game with other people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best game that i have bought for $3.40 on steam! The game is simple, pick up weapons, level up with perks and fight an increasingly larger mob of zombies. The weapons feel nice to use when melting zombie faces. The amount of depth in this game lies in the selection of the perks and class advantages. Add to that the satisfaction of getting better through player skill and about 80 steam achievements to aim for and you've got a perfect time killer game. The developer is always updating the game with new features and interacts with fans via the forums. For multiplayer, there is up to 4 player coop and three different game types. This game is my definition of a near perfect game. A++			",208,33,3,23,11,2,27

Since I played Nation Red, I have started to enjoy games like ... Flotilla ... Duke Nuk'em Forever ... and PSTW RPG ... I rate this game 5 stars out of 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is actually pretty fun. You get to shoot waves and waves of hoards with various types of guns mowing them down like it's all of your business. The game is super cheap during the holidays, im talking less then $2. There is 4 different types of characters in this game to level up. The game is worth a try and is fun with some friends. You also get to walk over dynomite, Land minds and other explosives to kill everything around you without diying yourself by the way did I mention upgrading turrets the further you get into the waves? I give this little fun game a 7.9/10			",125,8,2,9,4,2,6

I am so glad that i did now, as this is such a fun and addictive game. Playing on your own is enjoyable but in coop mode it is even better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basically, in a nutshell: Its Serious Sam - Top Down EditionI had a lot more fun with it than I was expecting. The fast paced gameplay keeps you entertained until you realize how long youve been playing. Definitely more fun with friends, but I had fun with it solo. Its a nice palate cleanser in between AAA, slow-paced games and something any friend would enjoy playing co-op when theyre over (assuming they have a soul). Im on the fence whether to recommend this for MSRP, though; get it on sale.My only complaint was the XP system; needing to stop every few seconds to try to remember the funny names of all your favorite upgrades really broke flow for me...until I found the auto-leveling system. Dont leave home without it, kids!			",416,113,6,48,72,4,78

												A highly enjoyable game.  Very addictive.  Nice selection of weapons and perks.  Pretty good graphics.  All in all a good game for the price.  It is also a game you can enjoy solo and if you want a quick game rather than getting drawn into something highly emersive and time consuming.  However it is easy to play this game for hours if you wanted too =)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's sorta like a dungeon crawler but you don't need to go anywhere, you're hiding behind things or dodging zombies. Also it packs in like an arcade with bonuses and weapons. This game would be great as a phone app. A lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great coffee break game. The variety of weapons, power-ups, and perks means there are various builds you can play with, persistant leaderboards give you a ladder to climb, and ongoing support from the developer means tweaks and new content are still being added. The only weaknessnes are the limited range of game modes, and that the differences between maps are largely cosmetic. Still, I keep coming back for more, and am happy I picked it up.

												Manic and fast paced, Nation Red is one of the few games that is as fun to play solo as it is co-op. With numerous perks and a staggering array of weapons, it is possible to have several killer loadouts, depending on how you play.The sound effects are good, and I personally like the heavy metal loop track they have going, which is rare as I usually switch off music in games - this one adds to the frantic atmosphere of the game.Possibly the only fault I could notice is that in 4 player co-op, it can be hard to keep an eye on your character, especially if there are others of the same class as you. Colour coding might be nice, or probably I just need to pay more attention.Other than that, co-oop is a great play, often with you having to stand near your fallen buddy to revive them.The game is often on special, and I would recommend this game as a pick up, put down game that still remains entertaining long after you would expect.Get the four pack, give to some friends and you'll have an enjoyable weekend right there.

												This is a good game, but not a great game. If you don't expect more than an arcadey good time, you'll be fine. On sale, this game is a very good deal, with friends, it's a great deal.There's not a lot you need to know about the game itself. It's a top-down shooter (isometric really) where you run around collecting weapons and perks, shooting as much as you can before you die. Like some other games (Crimsonland) you also level up to build your capabilities over the course of a game.The single player stuff is fun. The multiplayer is really what sets this game apart. You're still doing the same or similar stuff, but with a few other people, everything is amplified. It's more frantic, and that really makes this a better game.The menus and some game decisions are a bit odd, not very friendly, but not so bad as to ruin the game. But things like showing a button to go back, labelled ESC, that you can only operate with your mouse... what?Some perks and levelling upgrades aren't very useful, or don't make much sense, but there's enough here that it's worth a few hours. Much more if you get into the multiplayer.			",284,73,9,35,25,3,54

												This is like on of those games you get on your smartphone. Extremely cheap, and yet you find yourself borderline addicted to it. As with the same smartphone games, there isn't a ton of depth, but the gameplay is about as enjoyable as your AAA titles. Kill hoardes of zombies, collect guns, perks, and powerups (yes, there is a difference), use said perks and power ups to stack on top of damage and whatnot, and voila. Loads and loads and loads and (you get the point) fun.			",25,4,2,3,4,0,6
