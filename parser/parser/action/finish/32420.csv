												Ok, so im probably gonna be the only person to recommend this game, its a decent hack and slash for the jedi's and a slightly better shooter and if your a fan of both star wars or even just the cartoon this is based on then sure buy this, but when discounted. I did like the game but not enough to pay full price. Bottom line the game is fun and does have some replay value but dont bother if you just wanna add this to your star wars steam collection.

												I'm sure this will get uber-downvoted but I 'll say it anyway: This game is really not that bad. Once you get past the Games For Windows Live page (which I personally like for the easy gamerscore) and the often frustrating platforming, you get to a fun game that you and a friend can laugh at. It's somewhat akin to the LEGO games in the simple combat and vehicle sequences, but with less brick smashing and coin gathering and more droid slicing and derpy hats. It seems as though the game almost recognizes it's stupidity and embraces it, almost. The only technical error that I encountered was the inability to save my resolution and graphics settings, forcing me to reset them each time I launched the game.Overall I'd give this game a 6 out of 10. It succeeds at being what It's trying to be, it's a goofy cheesy clone wars game, but nothing more.			",189,21,0,11,20,3,10

												This is a decent game.  Everyone who is knocking it is too old. It's clearly designed for youth who are fans of the cartoon. My young daughter really enjoys playing co-op together. It's basically like playing through a story arc of the Clone Wars cartoon with most major characters at least making a cameo appearance. You play as a variety of characters throughout the game, both clones and jedi vs. the shows primary villians - especially lots and lots and lots and lots of droid soldiers. That's pretty much like the show though, so no surprise there. You don't go around killing people like in The Force Unleashed, only droids.Update: Beat the game on normal difficulty co-op with my younger daughter. Total time was about 11 hours, but we got less than half of the achievements, in game unlocks, etc. Overall, it's not that bad of a game. If you are an adult fan of the Clone Wars cartoon, I recommend setting the difficulty to Jedi from the start to increase the challenge somewhat. Being designed for youths, you immediately continue with an unlimited number of lives from the exact spot you died while playing (only lose some points for buying unlocks), so there isn't much to worry about like getting stuck later in the game.Additionally, we played co-op with X360 controllers, it's likely more comfortable playing this type of game that way than on a keyboard.

												I do recommend this game if the price is right, and if you play it as a two player game. I think I bought it for around â‚¬3, and I played it with my 10-year old daughter. I would say it was pretty fun during the approx. 4 hours of gameplay it took to complete it. Much better value for our money than if we would have rented a movie... It seems that this game has gotten mostly negative reviews, and even if I would have played it alone, or bought it at a higher price, it seems unfair to give it a negative review. It's not a great game, perhaps not even a good game, but it is not bad.It does not excel in any way, and we had some issue with the ""game for windows"" at first, but it was easily solved, and we both thought we had a fun time playing the game.

Most importantly they can play as Ahsoka!Controls are easy for her to use and she loves the style of the game. Its just like the cartoon. Very easy for her to navigate the screen and gameplay is simple. If your looking for something more complex then dont buy this. If your looking for a game for a child between 5-7 then this is ideal.

												It came with the Star Wars collection, so I tried it out. I like the animation, but the game play could be better. It is awkward to play with a keyboard so I recommend playing with a controller or just buy it on Xbox 360. It is longer than most Star Wars games I've played, but it gets repetitive. Shoot (clone), slash (Jedi), and repeat. I would buy it if you weren't looking for a challenge or perhaps for your kid. I wouldn't pay full price for it though. Wait for a sale or just try it out if you buy the Star Wars collection like I did.			",92,34,1,31,12,0,9

												Awful.Despite being a fan of the Star Wars franchise, I never got around to watching The Clone Wars. I certainly appreciate its art style, though, and this game is faithful to it. That's the only good thing about the game, and even then it's rather subjective â€“ some people might not enjoy its looks.The story is the same for every piece of Star Wars material, which is to say, disposable at best.As for characters... Anakin Skywalker's annoying padawan calling him ""Skyguy"" every five minutes during the dreadful cutscenes would be enough to put me off. But I persevered, as part of my quest to beat all of my Games For Windows Live titles before that system is shut down (possibly rendering them unplayable forever).Speaking of cutscenes, they are often glitched and abruptly interrupted for no reason.The gameplay is very, very dull. The combat is boring, especially when you're playing the role of Republic soldiers (in other words, the shooting sections). And even in the hardest difficulty setting, if you ""die"", you'll just respawn in the same area, without any limits. Perhaps most baffling, though, is the fact that you will face the same boss THREE times. He always uses the same attacks, and you'll always use the same method to beat him.There are occasional ""puzzles"" that were clearly designed with four-year old children in mind. On top of that, Master Yoda will always show up to tell you what to do next or how to play. Like a constant tutorial throughout the game.It also has some of the worst platforming sections I have ever gone through... and it has a lot of them. The controls are very imprecise, even when playing with a gamepad. Levels are poorly designed, and the fixed camera angles only makes matters worse. This means you'll be falling to your ""death"" more often than not when jumping around... but hey, at least there's that immediate respawn, right?			",884,103,61,74,67,12,144

												I do not recommend buying STAR WARS THE CLONE WARS especially the price of $20 for the game that i had problems with even before playing the game. When launching THE CLONE WARS steam gives u a key code to verify the game after clicking ok it says its launching but nothing happens you are just sitting in your library waiting for something to launch after doing some research i found out that i had to download windows market place and put a microsoft account in just to even launch the game. But thats not all the gameplay is terrible half the time u dont even know where u are swinging your lightsaber, the parkour jumping is frustrating and stupid and eventually it just feels like your doing the same thing over and over. I have 3.7 hours because i could not bring my self to finish the game u dont have to buy this game if your a fan of the show its not worth it better to just watch the TV show sadly.

												I cleared this game in 12 h. This game was so-so for me.There are two difficulties, Padawan & Master. I played padawan level, but sometimes it was difficult.If you like clone wars TV stories, and if you want to battle like that movies, this game is perhaps good for you.(especially for children)I am not children but I enjoyed it because I love star wars. You can play some of jedies and troopers. And battle syles were interesting. You can destroy many droids. But Sith vs jedi are only two times. And I recommend that you play this on game hardwere. It seems that this game has many troubles when you play on pc.I have problems(it was slow motions on Win 7 laptop). And it didn't work on Win 8, surface pro 2.I think it is better for you to buy xbox or some other game soft. If you have very strong pc specs, perhaps you don't have to worry. But if not, I think xbox, DS or other consoles are better than pc.Anyway, I like battle syles in this game. If you have some intrests, I recommend you to buy it when it's sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes is difficult choice when it comes to an enjoyable game. It has many fun aspects to the game i really enjoyed. When i played as one of the Jedi Knights, i had alot of fun swinging my lightsaber through droids on screen.  When i started playing as the Clone Troopers, i refreshed from the change in gameplay. These were some of the good aspects of the game, but they cannot compare to the troubling glitches or bugs that came with it. The fun of playing as Anakin Skywalker quickly disapeared when the jumping mechanics were shown. I found myself stuck on parts of the level for ages because the character would never land where you wanted them to. They would keep missing the ledge by the smallest fraction and i would be sent back to the start. That is the most frustrating glitch in the game and the most seen.Also worth mentioning, if you do not have a microsoft live account then you will not be able to save your progress in the levels.If you are a fan of the Clone Wars series you might enjoy the feeling of fun pace of the game. But for $19.99, maybe not.  When it is on sale you may get some fun out of it for a while but you may find your self not coming back to it again.To put it simply, if this wasn't titled ""Star Wars"", it wouldn't be in my Steam Library.

												Well this is just like Pacman/Super Maria in a Starwars suit. It is just 3rd person view and the camera doesnt follow at all. So if you want to walk forward you have te press left and jump over deep cliffs for no reason at. So this is a game only for the youngest of players among us. They will enjoy it that is for sure. It is about bunny hopping and constantly breaks in the game where the tutorial just annoys the crap out of you. The music is from the Starwars series Clone Wars. The game looks like it was directly taken from the famous and most beautifully made animation series of Starwars the Clone Wars. So that is good. Even the sounds are very impressive. Straight from the series and moveis. So if you don't mind jumping from spot to spot in this game and have the time or energy to ""learn"" the illogical controls then go for it. If not if you like logical first person controls or at least a camera just automatically follow you in 3rd person view just wait and save some precious money for the Battlefront 3 that will be coming soon to the gaming world.

												This is a platformer in which there is no penalty for death.  I played (and beat) the entire game, got platinum on all the challenges, found all the ""hidden"" artifacts, all in under 30 hours... Prolly woulda been finished sooner had I not fallen asleep with the game running.  The upgrades you can purchase at the shop run out by Mission #5 (there are 40 missions all with an average of 5 minute completion times), and none of the upgrades have a major impact on actual gameplay... that could be due to the fact the combat system is merely a mashing of the L and R mouse buttons.I got this game in a bundle and decided it was time to play... but guess what?  You need to watch the entire first season of The Clone Wars in order to get a bearing on what's going on, plot-wise.  The game takes place just after S01E22... so, set aside a few days for that little endeavor.Even on Hard mode, death is the most inconsequential thing in the game.  If a puzzle or boss is too tough for you, then merely keep at it... the game will never penalize you by making you start the level over, or by deducting points from your score.  The most that will happen is that you'll need to wait 2 seconds for a respawn and you -MIGHT- have to retrace 10 feet or so (super super rare to backtrack because of death... SUPER rare.)Basically, if you like video games and enjoy a challenge, then stay the hell away from this game.  On the other hand, if you hate consequence and have a need to mindlessly click for 40 levels just to see what Obi and Annie are up to, then buy this game!  ...just make sure you get it on sale, for goodness sake.

												This is unfortunately a weighty blotch on the reputation of the Star Wars gaming franchise.  What strikes me more than anything, given the fact this is an official Star Wars title, is how overwhelming 'budget' the entire experience feels.The sub-seven hours I spent with it became all the more wearisome as it went on, revealing more and more horrible design decisions and a blatant lack of any sort of meaningful playtesting.  I sincerely did try to enjoy this, although it was with a mighty sigh of relief I breathed when it was all over.Now a little disclaimer, I haven't actually watched any of the cartoon show, but from the clips I've seen the art style does seem quite faithful.  But what is puzzling is how poor the graphics are overall, given that the game is only half a decade old.I thankfully had no problem in getting the game to run, but to those still struggling, I implore you to not waste your time.The dialogue is suitably inane and suits the Saturday-morning-kids-cartoon feel that they were aiming for.  As you progress through each level the characters will jabber back and forth at one another.  However, combat is not paused during these exchanges, and to skip through these conversations, you press left-click.  To fire, you also press left-click.  And given that you have very little to do in the game beyond firing, odds are you will blaze your way right through these conversations, with broken audio fragments punctuating your battles in a very jarring staccato-beat.  Though as a small mercy I'm fairly sure none of the conversations would have turned around my enjoyment of this train wreck.The game is separated into 3 acts, each separated by a rather well done movietone-esque war news broadcast updating the viewer on the current events.  Between level cutscenes are not quite so well done by and large, and are overlong.  Thus the brevity of the 40-odd levels (some clock it at 3-4 mins to complete) means any sort of meaningful flow is brought right back down to earth constantly by the recurring cutscenes.The gameplay is fairly boring and repetitive, with the designers playing it safe with the generic action-adventure style of running, jumping between platforms, and blasting or slashing enemies as they rear their heads.  However the platforming sections are horrendously bugged, with the game completely misinterpreting the jump command altogether and plummeting you to your death ad nauseam.  Thankfully you jump between most characters in the game level to level, which stops it being a complete snore-fest, and the ones where you play as clones give you a welcome respite from the awful platforming.  However, even these sections are flawed as the camera angles chosen are woeful.  And countless times I was shot down by unseen enemies off screen but I wasn't able to return fire!Various other glitches abound, such as where you would get permanently stuck on scenery or the next area/cutscene would fail to trigger, forcing a level restart.  RPG elements are laughably token, with the majority adding nothing to gameplay whatsoever.  You can also do challenge missions to gain more upgrade points.  In these, you have to complete certain actions within a time limit such as killing a bunch of enemies in a certain way or collecting as many free-floating points as possible, and these pop up as you clear certain areas.  But after I completed a few and realised they were all just pointless busy-work, I skipped doing them altogether.  And even at that I still managed to buy all upgrades well before the game's end.Now I know, given the fact this is aimed at children, I can't expect a Dark Souls-like experience.  But the game is ridiculously easy, and dying in this game doesn't stop combat or respawn enemies, your partner keeps firing on and then you appear beside them, fully healed, a matter of seconds later.  I believe they must have decided to go this way when it was clear the jumping and camera angles would induce countless unnecessary player deathes and if they wanted people to finish they had to make the constant death less painful.  It also removed any sort of challenge and made me even less enthusiastic to play on.Now there are moments of sporadic genuine fun to be found but they are smothered under the weight of all the issues the game piles upon itself.  Do yourself a favour and pick up virtually any other Star Wars game available instead.			",544,223,1,97,16,0,72

You can only play this game if you install Microsoft Games for Windows Live and you can only save if you sign up for it.There is no warning or message that you need to do it, and I had to look through the forum to find out. If you do try to launch the game without doing so, the game will not launch.(I've only gotten to the mission where the player takes control of Kano, before a storm caused a blackout in my house)The game takes place between Season 1 and Season 2 (this game is no longer canon).You go through missions as different characters from the series with the second player being either CPU or a real person.The controls are simple on the Xbox controller, but if you choose to play on the keyboard, it's a bit difficult. Also for second player they will have to use the arrow keys and numpad.The camera angle sometimes messes me up on jumps that I should have made.I don't like to sign up for a 3rd party to play a game on Steam, but if you have Games for Windows Live and an account (I heard an Xbox live account works), and if you're a Star Wars fan, go for it, but wait for it to go on sale, because it definitely isn't worth 20 dollars.

												I would give this game a 5/10 but since there's not a ""meh"" option for Steam reviews I'll go with a recommendation.This game does have its flaws. Most folks will need to download and install Microsoft Games for Windows Live in order to play the game and there is an annoying bug where the game will start with Co-op turned on and you won't be able to progress until the other player character is moved.But once you get into the game, it evokes memories of the Playstation 2: Lord of the Rings the Two Towers and Return of the King games in that you control characters through a sort of gauntlet from one end of the map to the other, racking up kills as you go. The graphics are very close to the CGI animation of the Clone Wars TV Series and has all of the original actors. There are moments where you feel like you're watching an episode of the Clone Wars.That said there are some annoyingly frustrating sections where due to camera angles you end up missing jumps for small platforming areas and falling straight down a bottomless pit. The bugs mentioned above and this issue are the biggest obsticals for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite possibly the most painful platformer I have ever played. Republic Heroes holds true to the cartoon series and offers a decent story with all the major characters, but the controls are horrendous--and I mean that in the absolute worst way possible. The camera angles, aiming, direction controls all seem to work against where you want to actually go. On the bright side, you get to play a lot of different characters, but unfortunately they don't offer any unique moves; it's all the same gameplay, just a different face. Unfortunately, all the negatives completely overpower any positives this game has to offer. Stay away....stay very far away.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Republic Heroes is a fun arcade game when everything is working properly. The problem is that it's a rare occurence when everything works as it should. No camera control creates a terrible environment where you'll spend more time dying trying to figure out the angle to jump than what the actual mission length requires. Controls are somewhat awkward and combat generally becomes the same process. I didn't encounter too many bugs, but when they occured, it was horrible.On the bright side though, the game has a fun, typical Star Wars vibe and the plot is actually good. There's the ample amount of foreshadowing for what occurs later in the film series and the voice acting is the exact same as in the TV show Clone Wars.Overall, I wouldn't recommend that anybody purchase the game unless it's on sale. Even if you're a die hard Star Wars fan, the game will frustrate you more than the game itself is worth. Buy the game when it's on sale, no other time.			",106,4,0,17,10,0,34

												Gameplay : same as Lego Star Wars games but with a crazy camera, a lot of platforms and repetitive actions. In 3 words : try, die, repeat.AI : worst ever seen.Graphisms : in the style of The Clone Wars serie so it's ok.Story : same comment as graphisms but dialogues are realy flat and boring (maybe as the serie idk).Conclusion : if you like (Pina Colada ?) The Clone Wars era and want to play a good game about it, buy Lego Star Wars III : The Clone Wars. Same price, same style but funny and entertaining.PS : if you want to try it anyway, it's way better to play with a controler.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Casual solo/coop Star Wars platformer for children/parents+children. No more. No less. Most of the negative reviewers probably didn't expect this game (and its story) to be that obviously aimed for children and expected a little more, hence the negative reviews. Again, this is no Lego Star Wars which is ""officially for children"" but an adult can find fun in it too; this game doesn't aim for adults at all.With that said, if you try to have an open mind about it and realize it's not really meant for you, as a game it's not that bad as you'd expect. It's obviously designed to be played with controller instead of keyboard/mouse, for which the controls (and camera) are pretty clumsy. The gameplay reminds me very much of some Playstation 1 platformers (kind of like Jedi Power Battles) and feels a little outdated (although the graphics are decent), but slashing stuff with lightsaber should be enjoyable enough for kids. Despite the level design not being the greatest (sometimes it's not clear what to do or where to go) it plays pretty well. The game is hardly challenging and even on hard difficulty you'll find yourself just swooping through the levels. But again, if you're reading this, this game is probably not meant for you.I DO recommend it for parents/children (especially if they're Star-Wars-positive), it should be fun enough. Wait for some sale though, it's definitely not worth the full price. And get yourself a controller or two (it can be played either solo or by two players cooperating, which might be pretty fun), keyboard+mouse is playable but very clumsy. In contrary to some reviews, I had no problems at all getting it run on a modern system with Windows 8.1, just installed and played.I DO NOT recommend it to more serious gamers who are looking for challenge, deep story or an adequate game, you'll be disappointed. Also, if you're a serious gamer, GFWL can be annoying to you.			",47,13,1,6,4,0,2

												If you could control the camera, this would be a overall mediocre experience, with some decent child-tier humor that follows loosly the events of a okish show. Got this when the star wars collection was on sale for like $15, and if you get this during one of those mega sales, it is worth a quick look. Basic run down of gaemPros:>game runs>combat is simple, but fun to cut apart useless droids for a quick minute>game knows its pretty sillyCons:>camera seems to be stuck in 1995, hope you like them resident evil fixed angles during your 3rd person platforming>game is too simplistic at times, often feels repetative and boring. With the clone segments, game turns into contra on super easy, even if you max out difficulty in game. Overally pretty mediocre game, that is just slapped to pieces thanks to its camera and how it was clearly designed for controlers, yet was ported to pc. If you can pick it up super cheap go for it, but for $20 you could get some dank pepes instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only real problem I have with this game is the lack of being able to actually die. Usually I start games on the hard or medium difficulty because I like the challenge. Since there were only two I chose the former. I was expecting something somewhat hard. I beat 1 1/2 levels and couldnt continue. Not because it was hard but because the hardest difficulty was not hard enough. Checkpoints are too frequent and bosses health dont reset if you ""die"".			",61,7,0,5,4,0,5

												This game had one thing and ONLY one thing going for it. That was the fact that they brought in a writer and several voice actors from the Clone Wars cartoon. So the atmophere of the game is a flawless imitation of the Clone Wars cartoon. The characterization is dead on to fans of the show (including, true to the cartoon's form, the snarkiest Obi-Wan Kenobi ever to be seen in any fictional work). The story isn't brilliant per se, but it certainly feels like an odd playable episode of the television show, which allowed me to hate it less than it deserves to be hated.After a nice opening cutscene, it all goes downhill fast when you're given control for the first time, and you spend five minutes trying to find, learn, and understand the ludicrous controls. As you're learning you are assaulted with poor graphics, unexciting combat, bland levels, poor camera angles, and possibly the worst platforming I have seen in any game ever - certainly the worst in any 21st century game. Further, I started the game controlling both characters at once (multiplayer mode), which was incredibly ungainly, and the rest of the game was so bad that I assumed this was just part of the awfulness and slogged through the first hour of the game trying to play one character with each hand. It got so annoying eventually that I googled around and saw that oh, there was a single player option that the menus made absolutely no effort to direct me to.If you got this as part of the Star Wars package, you can safely skip it unless you're a Clone Wars superfan. If you're considering buying it by itself, save yourself a headache and don't.			",72,22,0,26,5,1,3

												All the reviews so far do not do this game the proper justice. This game is not just bad, it is Terribad. Capital T and all. This game is the kind of bad, that people on youtube make money off of for showing off. It is a freakshow of terribleness.The control scheme is awful and when mixed with the fixed camera angles, you have NO depth perception or sense of angles. Most of the time you are jumping off of cliffs in an attempt to do simple platform jumps. Using a controller fixes this issue only slightly. This is the first game i have touched that has went so far to make a tutorial, and forgot to teach you stuff. I had to look up how to beat the tutorial boss, because I did not understand that the game requires double jumping up to its tiny gun, to balance on it. Which i tried before I even looked it up. On a keyboard its REALLY hard to tell these things.Deaths in the game have LESS punishment then the Lego series. But your hud is designed for taking punishment. The design makes no sense. This game, in all of its areas is not for a small child as claimed. No, my friends, this is just really lazy craftmanship. No care or love went into this game at all. I have no clue HOW IN THE NINE LAYERS OF HELL they managed to make the game look so nicely crafted model wise. It's sad that its wasted on the bland environment. Nothing pretty to look at. Some cutscenes have ... decent-ish.. chit-chat. But as soon as the scene ends, your treated to the awful dialogue of the ingame banter. If you do dare touch this title, you will never want to hear the words ""Skyguy"" ever again, as it will only lead to memories of these horrible wretched moments. This game is one of the worst titles I have played in a very long time. I should have looked at the reviews before I threw my 5$ at this thing. I love bad games, but a lazy game on this scale is unforgiveable.			",186,39,2,38,27,0,34

												This game is plain bad, after installed the game does not even start with out installling an additional program not included in the instillation. the game wont even save unless you log into an Xbox account in which if your under aged you have to have a parents email to play a 3+ game. When logging in the xbox account it auto puts in a inccorect password for the xbox account if you have auto login enabled in which you can't even edit. In in general this game is pretty bad.Appart from the game its self being boring and like a game you see on phones, the artwork and design of robots are nice, the animations of slicing though half a driods body and the ablility to stun robots whith the force etc is just like out the episodes. The graphics are not too bad and look pleasing. The only problem is some textures are low resolution and from a game from 2009 to enable anti analysing it causes alot of lagg for not much effect.

The worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing thing to happen to me. Depressing as hell. I truly have a dark hatred for this game and its problems. If you want to ruin your life, buy this game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS GAME.

												I recently purchased the Star Wars Collection because it's on a pretty damn good sale. This is the second game I installed from the bundle (Star Wars: Dark Forces was the first). I used to play this game on PSP back when that was still a thing and my 7 year-old self loved the game endlessly although I was too dumb to even complete the first boss fight. So, I thought this would be a nice nostalgia trip to play. I was incorrect. At least I could get through the first boss fight this time. The gameplay is bearable when playing as the Jedi (Anakin/Ashoka) but the clone gameplay is dull and uncalled for.The controls are a bit... strange to say the least. Not their setup, which is also a tad strange, I mean the responsiveness if that's the right word. But the main problem with the PC version in my opinion, since I can never get the following thing working and it makes absolutely no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sense... WINDOWS LIVE. The games with Windows Live in my library are extremely annoying since I can't seem to actually make a Windows Live Xbox gamertag thing, which leads to not being able to save those games. The only mildly enjoyable thing (in my opinion) is the lightsaber combat which is enjoyable at best since it's physically impossible to lose. Don't buy this game, it's a waste of money.

												This game makes the entire lego star wars series by travellers tales look like a freakin work of art.SWTCW is quite possibly the most overused series in the entire star wars saga. This game puts new meaning to the phrase ""beating a dead horse"". This game is nothing but a pretty label on an empty box (with a pretty penny on the price tag).Repetitive, easy combat. No real penalty for death whatsoever make the combat seem like a walk in the park. No sweats broken, no tears shed, nothing ineresting at all, really. And to top it off, there are way too many missions. I mean really, WAY too many missions. The combat and platforming are uninteresting enough as it is, but with so many levels, it becomes monotonous as well.To add insult to injury, there is no creativity behind the level design. The levels are almost as boring and repetitive as the combat. After about ten minutes of gameplay, you have experienced all of the things this game has to offer. After then, it's just the same ten minutes, over and over. Seriously, if I wanted excitement, I'd be better off watching paint dry.Also, this game's platforming mechanics are an utter disgrace. You jump towards a ledge. You then either catch the ledge, or miss it. No real apperant reason much of the time.Additionally, the camera angles of this third-person ""action"" game are atrocious. Making the already unpredictable platforming nigh-impossible.Very dry and uninteresting voice-acting and storyline serve as yet another nail in the coffin of this game.Seriously, don't buy it. It's nothing but a scam for your precious money.1/10			",254,25,0,16,22,1,33

												Don't even think of playing this game on a keyboard!This will be one of the most frustrating things in your life.You'll die 10-20 times per level - 1-2 because of enemies' fire, and the rest of the times - because the game just changed the perspective to rapidly that you fell in the chasm or something.And when you play as clone trooper, you just cannot hit anything bacause of crappy aim.The game is designed for controllers and developers didn't bother themselves to optimize it for more conventional input devices on PC.Apart from that the game just isn't as fun as The Clone Wars series. It uses the same characters. but provides minimum backstory (in a Star Wars game!) and no character development.Also, it uses GFWL. This isn't an issue for me, but some people don't like it. And it is said that GFWL will be taken down on July 2014, that means no achievements any more.			",107,19,3,34,4,0,18

												Terrible. Controls are awful. It's like the Star Wars Lego games where it's sort of a blast-em up 3D platformer, but virtually unplayable playing by yourself with a mouse and keyboard, since the camera can't be rotated and your ""helper"" padawan keeps killing things that you're supposed to use in order to progress to the next area. If the controls aren't enough, Yoda keeps popping up on screen trying to give you hints about what to do, and he comes up every 30 seconds if you don't do it (like if your padawan keeps hindering you). If you thought the owl in Zelda was bad, he's got nothing on Yoda.On top of all this you need a Games For Windows Live account just to save your progress. Whoever was in charge of making this game was really short-sighted.			",90,10,2,14,9,1,21

												The art and graphics are amazing, looks really crisp and very exciting at first glance.

To be fair, I didnt try my gamepad controller, but most game systems still make an effort to produce good keyboard/mouses combination controls. This was not the case here. Literally no mouse contol options, the bindings are clumsy and frustrating to work with. Of course, Windows LIVE is alone would be a reason to give this game a negative review. I paid $10.....I should have been PAID $10 to try this piece of crap.			",184,33,2,58,53,4,77

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.But in all seriousness, it's just not that fun a game. It wants to be like one of the Lego games, but ends up being dull. That's if you can even get it set up.Pros: - Clone Wars themed, I guess- Republic Commando hats can be bought.Cons:-Pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥to set up, getting around GFWL-Not very fun-You can't save without a GFWL account			",38,3,0,4,1,0,3

												This blows chunks. Simply cannot get this to launch on a current Win 8.1 rig. It's the 80000003 error that so many other customers also seem to have, with no support or fix from Steam or Lucas available. Tried various tips from the forums, but no success.This is ridiculous, just save your money.			",1090,282,50,175,93,5,289

Terrible and to save your game you have to have an ADULT windows live account! and even when I could it was just terrible platforming and not-so over the top force powers like another great game I know STAR WARS THE CLONE WARS for the original Xbox and gamecube.

												Game crashes at start up and despite several solutions proposed in the forums, I've been unable to get it to work.  The original support page for the game is no longer active, and there doesn't appear to be anywhere to go for actual tech support.  For a $20 game, a much higher level of support is expected. Not recommended.			",164,35,10,23,17,1,21

												Worst game I've ever played in my life. Please don't buy this, it is unbelievably terrible in every single way.  I am astounded at how this game was even allowed to enter the market.  The controls are broken, it's nigh on impossible to gain any progress in the game due to the nightmarish controls and lack of any indication as to where you need to go next. The combat is appalling, the graphics are appalling, the sound effects are appalling, everything is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrible and utterly appalling,....  yes, that word again...APPALLING!!!!!If you buy this game, you'd better lube up yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and prepare to be bummed in the worst possible way.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS, EVEN IF YOU ARE A STAR WARS FAN!0/100 Don't do it.			",196,27,2,37,7,0,17

												Not going to slam this game its just not the best made or the most fun. The controls did me in. It also made me think of the Lego star wars game not bad but also not my cup of tea. my friends liked it .  There are better games out there. This one can leave you upset not really what you want when playing a game. it is somewhat easy to play if you get past the controls no depth so no real story or plot to keep up with. 4/10 i felt it was rushed if they had just put a little more TLC in it. $19.99 is way to much get it on sell if you have to buy it.

												Bad camera angles, lack of precision in gameplay, (namely jumping and attacking while controlling an enemy,) make this game almost unplayable.  What could have been a very laid back and fun game has turned into a pile of do-overs, as you pull out your hair trying to jump up a series of small stepping stones or hit the enemy you're aiming at. Did not bother continuing on past the second level.			",836,204,54,120,86,10,161
