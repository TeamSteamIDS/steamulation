												A serious sniping game. Lurking in the bush, finding a good position and placing one single, perfect shot, only to sneak away unseen and leaving not a trace. Like the shadow of a ghost in the jungle. Sniper: Ghost Warrior is just about as far from this ideal as it is possible to come.As a sniper, your primary tool lies simply in not being seen. This would typically entail you wanting to stay off roads, footpaths and other places where people usually travel. In S:GW, you can only dream of this. The area in which you can move is so narrow, you'd get claustrophobia if it weren't for the fact that it looks relatively pretty. The catch is, there are so many invisible walls, idiotically placed fences (which you cannot jump over, of course), stupid fishing nets across the creek (which you cannot cut, even though you're carrying a knife), columns that just happened to have fallen just so, etc. etc.The whole game is pretty much based on railroading of the highest order: You have to go there, to that exact rock shelf, before the victim decides to stroll out of his cabin. At one point, you are actually told to place a claymore on the path ""in case there's a chase"". (Three guesses what happens just after you take the shot ...)Sight adjustments though. At least they have that down, right? As if ... you're left relying on Kentucky Windage. Because the game is actually simulating wind. You even have a wind gauge that is visible in the scope, to help you place your shots properly. That would be handy, if it hadn't been for the fact that the wind is completely random. But they've solved that problem for you as well: You see, you have a tiny red circle travelling around the crosshairs, which tells you precisely where your bullet will hit. All so you don't have to worry about boring things like finding the range or elevation relative to your target. Because who would want that in a sniper game. Oh, and is that magic circle moving too fast for you? Don't worry, you can just press shift to go into bullet-time. /facepalmBut they do have bullet-drop, so they have at least modelled ballistics to some degree. Yay.So, you know where you'll hit before you fire your shots. Or so you would think. Well, you'll just have to hope that the chain-link fence through which you're shooting, is of the type that bullet's can actually penetrate. Because not everything is as it seems in this game. You can shoot through (some) walls, but not through all chain-link fences. You can jump up on a ledge only to meet an invisible wall 10 cm further in, etc. etc.With so many things about which to be annoyed, it seems almost banal to point out that the level design is hopelessly bad (e.g. the obvious railroading) and that the scenarios are completely unrealistic. For example: you're asked to sneak into the middle of a military installation carrying a weapon whose optimum range is >300m. Luckily, the AI is so moronic, it doesn't really matter: You can be lying on the other side of a river, taking out infantry in a village chock full of them, and they won't bat an eyelid when their friend mysteriously decides to start the siesta 8 hours prematurely. 2 meters away from them. The loud bang immediately following is obviously completely unrelated. But don't try to walk up-right behind an enemy instead of crouching like you've learned, because then they've suddenly got superman-hearing and flash-reflexes and you're dead before you even have time to jump.At some point in time, I think the developers realized that they weren't really working on the worlds greatest sniper game, because in the middle of the game you suddenly change roles and run around like a regular infantryman with an M16 or similar rifle. And if the game is lousy as a sniper game, it really sucks as a standard ""run & gun"". Everything is still just as fricking scripted: The enemies come running only once you walk through the gate (which is of course your only choice of route) and your allies faithfully wait for you to be a pointman and advance the battle. Meanwhile, they're busy, locked in an eternal gunfight with the AI, none of whom seem to be able to hit the broad side of a barn. So it is in fact an illusion that you have helpers in the grunt scenarios. In reality, you're just as alone there as you are in the forest. The only difference is you're playing an abysmal infantry game instead of a boring sniper game.Small blessings and everything, but I'm so glad I followed my gut feeling and didn't fork out for this game at full price, but waited for the infamous holiday sale. But even at todays low, low price, this game isn't worth it.			",295,133,13,43,15,1,24

												The game is definitely not recommended for the following reasons  - The game is buggy  - AI uses Aimbot + Wallhack up too unbearable form  - AI has more precise weapons over unlimited distances (kills you with a heavy machine gun across the map)  - Allied troops (AI) are absolutely useless. Not killing enemies and in 90% enemy totally ignoring them  - Hard difficulty is a joke because of the previously mentioned problems  - The story is common  - Possibilities movement are ridiculous (not climb the fence, jumping useless)  - Low animations and fight options are low  - Multiplayer plays about 20 people and feels like it's not finishedupdate (7th june 2016) : - unable to host games or join friend games.CZECH:Hru rozhodně nedoporučuji a to z následujících důvodů - hra je zabugovaná - AI používá Aimbot+Wallhack až v příliš nesnesitelné formě - AI má přesnější zbraně na neomezenou vzdálenost (zabije vás s těžkým kulometem přes celou mapu) - Spojenecké jednotky (AI) jsou naprosto k ničemu. Nic nezabijí a nepřátelé je v 90% naprosto ignorují - Hard obtížnost je vtip díky již zmíněným problémům - Příběh je obyčejný - Možnosti pohybu jsou směšné (nelze přelézt plot, skákání neužitečné) - Animace průměrné a možnosti souboje značně osekané - Multiplayer hraje asi 20 lidí a působí nedodělaně			",326,75,10,31,23,3,29

												The first Sniper experience is a very bad one. Make no mistake: the game looks decent and there's a lot of emphasis on the sniping action which feels a lot of fun. The features section of the game's store page highlights the importance of weather, wind and how the bullet trajectory / drop can be affected by them. It's all good but just not enough to result in a good game.Campaign is short and extremely difficult. While sniping is fun you are told exactly where to go and what to do. It is so heavily scripted that under no circumstances do you feel you should try it again. From time to time you are in the shoes of a soldier only allowed to handle rifles or SMGs. Fighting with these is very difficult. It has nothing to do with how these weapons work: the enemy can just easily spot you and shoot you down. This switching back and forth from the easy sniping and the very hard gunning sequences just makes the game unplayable.In addition to this, I was unable to find any games online. Not that after the horrible single player I wanted any. Sniper Ghost Warrior is an original game: its creators knew a lot of people liked sniping so they developed a game with that in mind. It was just not executed properly. If they had taken the time to refine the campaign and completely get rid of the non-sniper weapons this would have easily been on top of the list of my favourite games.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												""The most realistic sniping experience in a video game ever"" that is a big steaming pile of BS right in the beginning of the key features. So called sniping experience is: slow up time shoot AI, rinse and repeat.AI does not give a flying f***, if you shoot another one in its fov, it does not hear you shooting either. But dear god if you manage to get its attention, suddenly Übermensch, hitting you with every bullet from its assault rifle from vast distances as soon as you even pop your head up.Maps are tunnels and game does not even try to hide that, aka. invisible walls everywhere.Your ""sniping experience"" is every now and then stopped and you have to do some pure FPS missions, adding even more stink to this pile.The rant could go on and on..TL;DR If given for free then maybe, just maybe, worth it.

												A nice first attempt, but some seriously broken mechanics stop this game from being good. The sniper sections are fine, if a little monotonous. But the parts of this game that make me slam my head on the desk and give it a negative review are the assault sections.In these sections you are given an M4 rifle and tasked with killing a lot of enemies in close quarters. The recoil on the M4 is so high (way higher than a real 223 round would ever give), that it is basically trial and error killing the enemies, since the gun lacks a semi-automatic option. There are enough of these sections that, especially on the harder difficulties, completing the game can become something nightmarish requiring repeated attempts of the same gunfight.But the game is mainly focussed around the sniping experience, so I wish those assault sections didn't even exist. The sequel is much better and is a game that I would actually recommend, thankfully void of any annoying parts like that.			",130,10,1,16,5,1,9

ProsThe game features fairly decent sniping mechanics. It takes into account distance, bullet drop, momentum and wind which makes shooting a bit more engaging that just pointing the reticle at the enemy and firing. If all of this sound daunting to you, don't fret. The game does feature “aim assist” in the form of a dot that lets you know where to fire from.The story is not THAT bad (its not good though)ConsThe game is riddled with bugs and clipping issuesThe game suffers from some hit detection issue. Sometimes shooting straight at a guy will not register and if an enemy is being any type for foliage he will not get hit at all.The A.I is pretty stupid and seems to be activate when you look at them which is weird.The sound design is just bad. The voice acting is not that great, the enemies have the exact same dialogue from the beginning of the game to the end and the sound effects are pretty poor.. At several point in the game I have heard Soldier A and Soldier B having a conversation where both were saying the exact same lines.The game is very short. I finished the main campaign on Normal in three and half hour and the dlc campaign in about one hour. There is another challenge mode that I did not touch.Looking at the Pros and Cons it seems as though the game is not worth playing but I have found myself enjoying every moment of the game. It is campy, it is buggy and never rises above mediocre but it was just fun; Sneaking around sniping people, seeing your plan of attack succeed or even just hitting a guy while he is running were all very fulfilling. I recommend the game to people that can overlook some of its flaws and focus on the good that is in there (however little that is).			",780,139,51,71,29,7,85

												Besides the graphics, there's not much else whats good about the game. - Enemies shoot you with their normal guns from ""miles"" away with a perfect aiming. - The sniper gets a puls of over 120 from just walking a few meters while crouching.- The AI is stupid. If an enemy shoots at you, the others might hear it, but they don't think about checking why.- Some parts of the game are quite difficult. May it because you can only run on the scripted path, or just because there's no way of sneaking around the place. - Your in combat with a normal gun (no sniper) and your team mates just don't deal any damage. You have to kill almost every enemy on your own. - There are cars with mounted guns, but you can't use any of them. You have to stick with your crappy gun.- The sniper has quite a delay while shooting at enemys far away, which makes it almost impossible to shoot running players.- Very poor ending.- Playtime only about 7 hours. (no rush, many retrys due to bugs)- ....There are many more flaws, if i didn't get the game for less than 1 $, i wouldn't have bought / played it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm gonna be blunt this game is a mess even before you start the story the game menu is upside down for some unknown reason. The actual port runs fairly well on my PC which i would expect from an old game. The gameplay however is this games biggest problem it forces you down a select path with invisible walls so finding that good spot for sniping is impossible. It also has these bizzare assault rifle levels which i can only imagine they added as a filler because they are dreadful the assault rifle has so much recoil i might aswell just let them shoot me. The Ai must have super technogly because they can see you miles away even if your well hidden and boy oh boy if they see you well you might aswell just restart the checkpoint because the AI are far more accuracte than you and have super aim. The story is very poor aswell it never really gets started. An incredibly frustrating game avoid at all costs.			",145,8,9,7,8,4,5

												I only recommend you getting this game through a big discount or even better in a cheap bundle that has both sniper ghost warrior games if you want to try it.Now this game has beautiful graphics, nice textures and the forest is amazing as in all cry engine games and that's pretty much it. The story is boring, nothing interesting and I actually still don't know what happened exactly and throughout it they make you play with an assault and storm your way in and there is like three assaults and the aiming is horrible, too much unnecessary recoil  and not fun at all. The stealth factor of the game is very easy even on hard difficulty and the animation for when you get hit is soo annoying.Now the sniper aim is not that bad it is affected by your heart rate so you need to rest and hold your breath and the bullet itself is affected by wind and there is bullet drop.The multiplayer is abandoned, there is only one server that you find that has like 10 or 12 players playing and that's it, the Mp game play is nice but since the second one have the same thing with better graphics people are most likely to pick the newest one. So there isn't much to do in this game and the story is like 5 hours long.			",200,42,12,23,12,3,17

												Don't get fooled by the name. You actually are no sniper. Your enemies are. Even if they only use pistols or throwing knives, they somehow manage to hit you in long range; accurately. In fact you aren't even a ""Ghost Warrior"". This game originally was intended to be the sequel of Rambo: The Video Game. But ""Ghost Warrior"" simply sounded cooler, so they named it so.If you liked Call of Duty: Ghosts you will totally love this game. If not.. well.. don't do the same mistake I did. Even if it's on sale do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this game!But hey, it's a City Interactive game so what should you expect anyway?			",459,140,6,77,46,2,49

												The maps are linear and cramped (in a sniper game? really? yes, yes really). The sniping events are scripted up to the eyeballs until all fun is drained from them. Sniping itself is barebones-simple. Hiding and camouflaging (like a sniper is SUPPOSED to do?) is often downright impossible. Much of the time you'll just be soaking up enemy fire while you snipe no matter what you do. The regular soldier shooty sections in between sniper missions are horribly clunky and boring.TL;DR This piece of sh!t doesn't deserve to be called ""Sniper"" or any variation thereof.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior is a generic, no-name game with a few bugs.The entire concept of this game is that the one element that is only a portion of other games – the sniper mode – is the entire focus. The problem with focusing on one element of a game is that you need to do that element extremely well in order to be successful. While this game does do this well – the camera angles and feeling you get while sniping is very good.Sniper: Ghost Warrior puts you in the midst of a deadly conflict in South America. It’s your duty as an American soldier to assist the rebels in overthrowing the dictator of this fictional country. Combat locations are varied, from urban streets to the sweltering humid jungles. There’s no shortage of action, and like the locations, the gameplay is varied.There’s nothing terrible about this game, and there's also nothing terribly original either. There are some technical issues which keep it from ever being considered a classic. Some of the glitches you'll encounter include clipping graphics and control command errors. In some instances you can see through walls and other structures. Unfortunately it also appears the A.I. has this ability as they can pinpoint your location with uncanny accuracy once you’ve fired off a shot.A sniper’s life isn’t all sunshine and lollipops, so expect the unexpected, along with some frustrating elements you will have little control over.Despite the clipping, the graphics are well done, creating spacious environments such as the villages and jungle areas. There isn’t much story to concern you, just follow orders and keep yourself alive.Like Splinter Cell, there is a meter to determine your level of stealth in relation to the enemy's perception. It will indicate the degree the enemy is aware of your presence, so you’ll always have instant feedback on your progress making the stealth segments more exciting. Ghost Warrior is a bit like a basically excellent rough diamond, that no one wanted to polish any further. It's got good ideas and good visuals, but nowadays, that alone just isn't enough to be able to keep up with the competition.Overall 6/10.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												I have no idea whats going on in this game whatsoever.The story is rather odd to be honest.You're stuck somewhere in south America, trying to disrupt some general from doing some bad things. But before that you're rushed through a training mission that emphasizes how important stealth is in the game, then it immediately forgets all pretenses of stealth as it confusedly tries to rush you through an action campaign, which it feels like there was a rift going on here. Half the studio probably wanted to make the next Call of Duty game, and then the other half wanted to make something more like the Sniper Elite series.So you run through an earlier part of the mission with your buddy who has a weird callsign that you'll forget three seconds after hearing it, then you go through some combat and he gets taken back for his six o clock dental appointment on a boat, which you're glad he's gone because he's a terrible teammate anyways. Then you're supposed to escape using stealth, meanwhile you can't actually be stealthy. Like one area of the map where you're supposed to get from one end of the village to the other while being super sneaky, you climb through the tall grass, taking everything super slow, waiting for enemies to move, learning their pathing, generally being super good with your tactics. And then out of nowhere, ♥♥♥♥boy davey decides to shoot you with his gun because he somehow saw this elite trained sniper in his native environment... Yeah, GG on that one.But then because the game gets bored, they quickly drop you on an oil rig where you're supposed to be doing some fast paced actiony shooty shooty sections, all the while I'm sitting here thinking ""I bought Sniper game, but right now I'm not even carrying a sniper rifle at all!"" That section ends and then you get back to the mainland, 'whew, time to do more sniping!' but nah, one member of your squad (oh yeah, you pick up a few guys at one point and then they go break on tea time, really I don't know where they went, I just looked up at one moment and they left me) gets hit by a sniper bullet, and then you have to go through this terribly designed village in order to uh..... do a thing I guess? I have no idea what the main goal for this game is yet, and I feel/hope I'm most of the way through the game (Honestly I was just playing and sorta raged at a certain section of the game, I'll get to that later) But this village has very few paths, actually really just one path, there were only maybe multiple paths because I found a way to get around some invisible walls. And by this point the AI have somehow downloaded an aimbot.exe because they're outsniping the trained sniper. Also this particular section was frustrating because the amount of cover was minimal, the enemies were spread out far, (meaning that if you move your character half an inch to the side, like five of them now have an angle to shoot you from) and even with the lack of cover, there's no good way to work around it. A decent peeking system would have made this part much smoother without providing an unfair advantage to players. Not to mention moving around the tight corridors in the building nearby is nearly impossible when your character feels like a piece of clay with two wheels and a gun attached to him. After you've finished that area you go and try and kill some more guys that you quickly realize are nearly indistinguishable from the vegetation nearby (though somehow they instantly see you when you're climbing around in the brush, actively TRYING to be sneaky) and then for no reason whatsoever, the game teleports you to a lighthouse for you to shoot people from. (I should mention that I wanted to test out how amazingly easy it was for the AI to spot me, so I went prone at the top of this tower, just observing them, and then boom... one guy popped out of a truck and shot me just about immediately after his boots touched the ground....) At this point I don't know whether I'm playing as five different characters or not. Like how the hell did I randomly get to a lighthouse? Did I spirit hop into one of the other guys in the squad, and he's decided to get onto a lighthouse? Can't be because my player has the same voice! So what happened then? Am I secretly a member of the X-men that just teleports wherever he wants? Oh well, at least in this particular spot I have a sniper rifle... for the second time in the game.			",101,8,1,13,8,0,2

												The concept is appealling, the execution rather mediocre.The field of view is excessively narrow, and this hurts the quality of the gameplay during the non-sniping parts (which are several), the three difficulties do not differ from the AI quality as much as they differ from how inaccurate and clueless the enemy can be at the lowest difficutly, and how absurdly aware and accurate they are on the hardest.For a game from 2010 I would expect a better graphic department, especially being City Interactive an established game developer with several 3D titles on its record; however, even maxing out the settings the game looks poorly executed, with textures that, at times, seem to come straight out of 1999. The contrast between the good level design, the beautiful scenarios the Chrome Engine 4 creates and the poor texture quality generates a terrible outcome, that not even a breathtaking story and a great sound department can compensate.After having played for an hour it will appear clear how this game was developed with console players in mind, and eventually ported to PC; the result, as you may imagine, is quite atrocious for a first person shooter.In the end the gameplay experience is original, but the terrible execution doesn't make this a product worth your time.If you need ratings:Graphic: 6/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 4/10Longevity: 5/10Overall: 5/10			",493,133,26,43,32,5,51

The most realistic sniping experience in a video game ever, right down to managing your breathing for increased accuracy of sniper shots.First of all, there is nothing realistic in this game what so ever. If by ""managing your breathing"" you mean press one button to instantly stabilise your aim, then yes. Enjoy a fully realistic ballistic system that accounts for bullet trajectory, including bullet drop and environmental effects such as wind, fog & rain.This is not true. The ballistic system does not follow wind at all. It is literally just random no matter what weather. Pull off the perfect headshot and watch your bullet strike the enemy with pin-point accuracy in Bullet Cam mode. 4 types of sniping rifles: AS50, MSG90, SR25 & SVD DragunovWait, why would I want to destroy the immersion by taking me straight out of the game in a bullet cam? But why would I use 3 other sniper rifles when the automatic one comes with 300 bullets and you kill everyone in one hit anyway? A variety of mission types ranging from sniper vs. sniper elimination, real-time tactical assault and fixed machine gun combat.No, there is not a single mission where you fight other snipers. Maybe they are refering to the shotgunners that can hit you on 750 meter distances. There is one mission where you shoot one sniper, but never ""Snipers"".Yes, you did not read that wrong. They just used fixed machine gun combat as a selling point. Play as two separate characters: the sniper and the spotter.There is one mission where you have to look in your binoculars and click on a few soldiers in the correct order. Otherwise you fail instantly. And your sniper buddy can shoot through solid mountain and houses.			",363,50,5,26,28,3,38

												First few missions were enjoyable as a sniper and having to find and use concealment and clear the areas.  Then came the run and gun oil rig and breaking through some areas with a weapon that is useless.  For some unknown reason you are not allowed to have your sniper rifle in these areas.  As others have pointed out there are arbitrary walls and a narrow area to work in.  You can not go under some of the nets or over some fences for some silly reason.  In the beginning of the Alliance to save Rod my two comrades stuck in place standing in the first courtyard in front of the first building.  I never did find the Dag sniper rifle anywhere. Even with the small area to work in being a sniper is fun but the run and gun stuff should have been left our or let us have a decent rifle and the option to use our sniper rifle.As others have pointed out the KI is ridiculous.  They can spot and shot you from miles away with one shot  but you can empty a clip into one and he still fires at you.  They must have superaccurate automatic weapons unlike the piece of junk you have to run and gun with.At least is allows you to save instead of having a brain dead checkpoint system so you don't loose a lot of time if you  have to reload - unlike Ghost Warrior 2.I'm on the fence.  Parts are fun but I can't recommend it unless it's on sale real cheap. ",141,3,0,17,15,0,14

												I'm just going to list a few points to keep this brief;Enemies are stone deafYou may be a sniper, but even with assault rifles every single enemy is a better shot than youThere was less eratic wind in the movie 'Twister'Your assult rifle seems to work like a sniper rifle, need to be prone + fire single shots for them to hitSecondary pistol has the effective range of a wooden spoonTo complete ACT 1 you must eliminate a target and run to evac, however the game doesn't care if you kill target or notThe game features copious amounts of foaliageStealth is unecassry 90% of the time, in the event you must remain silent, it's just a matter of moving along an assigned path as the enemies are conviently looking the other direction ",735,295,17,88,84,8,120

												This game was a horrible experience.First of all the levels are extremely linear with invisible walls being placed absolutely everywhere which doesn't fit very well in this kind of game. The game's AI is also utter♥♥♥♥♥♥and is broken as hell. They will find you and they certainly WILL kill you. No matter how camouflaged you are hiding in a thick bush or behind a tree they will know your exact position. They will hit you and barely miss any shots at all.There is several sections in the game where you go all rambo in close quarters with assault rifles, shotguns, you name it. This game is definitely not a true sniper experience which it seemingly appears to be. It is in fact some kind of modern FPS action game in the disguise of something that could have been a great game.That was the singleplayer part, I have yet to try the multiplayer out but from what I know the levels are far more open-ended in MP and there's no AI, just normal players like yourself which sounds surprisingly pleasant. The multiplayer might be worth it but the singleplayer sure isn't.Judging by my experience of this game I would definitely not recommend this game to anyone looking for an actual sniper game.

												Rating of 7/10Well this same is probably worth waiting for it to be on sale. As much as the first game ""Art of Victory"" was a complete failure, this game get a second chance and trying to redeem itself. So let's start with the good.It was more fun to play this game than the first. The graphics and scenery are great. I had a Far Cry 3 feeling to it. It was interesting to play because you had an AI parter with you half the time, so it made for interesting moments. Most of the time you played as sniper, other times you were the tagger, and even forced to use a rifle as well. Which brings me to the bad stuff about this game.So you are a sniper so stealth is a big part of this game, and you are also camflauged. So what is the problem then?It's actually not so funny when you have a silenced sniper rifle, you shoot one enemy, and the rest of the enemies can, with pinpoint accuracy, shoot at you, even from a long distance. Though unlike the first game when you died almost instantly, you still lose health if you don't move. They somehow get alerted sometimes. AND then you will have an unsilenced sniper gun; you fire that and no one seems to be bothered by it. This is actually quite frustrating when there is one level you have to get through by stealth alone. You shoot one guy silenced, and everyone in the area is on alert. So if your foot is exposed, forget it, you are dead.The next thing which I consider pretty bad are the weapons. Not the weapons themselves mind you. I can say it was interesting to play where distance and wind are a factor to how your bullet will travel. There is on easier levels, a red dot on your scope to help you. You see. I am a Counter-Strike player and the only weapons that you use for zooming are scoped weapons. In this game, the cross hairs are so open that you are forced to use iron sights to shoot, and by doing so, you cannot see your target properly due to the visual of your gun being in the way. The takes out the presicion of aiming when you are trying to strafe and hell, even to try locking a position down.I was enjoying this game, but because of the issues I see here, I found myself rushing to finish the game fast, just to get it over and done with. The maps are good and unique, which is why I continued to play the game to completion. I won't discredit that.This game does have potential, but due to my observations on it, I am not even inclined to want to play multiplayer. Becasue I bought this in a bundle, I hope Sniper 2 proves to be much better than this game. We can only hope.If you try to compare it to the Sniper Elite games, they are similar, but not the same kind of games. I would suggest watching YouTube videos for this game, just to you know what you are in for.			",66,8,0,2,0,0,0

												   When I picked this one up, I was expecting a decent sniping game with some stealth and the occasional firefight mixed in. Those expectations were shot down, butchered, and had gasoline poured on them to make a lovely bonfire just to make sure nothing could be salvaged.    The game was quite enjoyable up until the oil rig, where you take over one of the members of the commando team in the first assault mission. The sniping mechanics might be good, but the assault rifle has so much kick you couldn't hit the broad side of a mountain half the time, much less a moving target shooting at you. I spent over an hour on the second assault mission just trying to clear the first part, pretty much having to save after every kill.   On the subject of accuracy, the enemy AIs have too much. you're sniping them from halfway across the map, and not only do they see you, they manage to accurately hit you half the time. With assault rifles and pistols. I know the game is supposed to have 'accurate ballistics', but I kind of expected it to be for BOTH SIDES, not just the player. To make matters worse, when you do have team mates, they tend to be very useless, when they actually move and not just stand around like statues. I was playing on meduim, and it felt more like extreme difficulty from other games.   Sufficed to say, this was a very badly done game. With the exception of the sniper rifle, pretty much every gun in the game sucks, and unless you play it on easy, expect some frustration. Even on easy, expect some frustration. Sufficed to say, I didn't get very far into the game, and I probably won't get much farther. This one quickly turned into a chore rather then a pleasure. If you feel the need to try Sniper: Ghost Warrior, get it when its on sale, cause it is not worth the full price.			",295,25,4,33,5,3,56

												Very good in terms of sniper physics, though I wish there was more of that and more Splinter Cell type stealth. I liked the silent throwing knife stuff and bullet-time headshots were very good. Also the way the bullet drops is realistic and how you have to predict where the enemy will be too. It is also affected by your heartbeat, which is really cool. There is a red-dot to show you where the bullet will hit. If they made a follow-up to this game it could be superb, just to focus more on sniping! The story was good, not great, not too predictable though. I also think the scenery and backgrounds do well to make you think, ""is that a soldier there?"", and this works well, keeping you on your toes and using your sniper well as a binocular. The action areas of this game are a bit tricky as some enemies are hard to spot but if you use the damage direction help then you'll be ok.But it's not bad, yes flawed, but for a first attempt it's very good going! It plays well, a little (and a lot) frustrating in parts, but something about it made me want to play more. Slow-motion headshots are very satisfying! Also the visibility to the enemy bar was helpful and a welcome addition. Other than the pixeling sun shadowing the visuals are very good.  ",313,18,14,20,6,2,27

												Well, the graphics of Sniper: Ghost Warrior are not the best and it can not compete with the latest games, but I think it is quite acceptable. Besides the graphics there are more cons to name, like the unbalanced AI or the ordinary story. Nevertheless, this game is a lot better than it's predecessor, Sniper Art of Victory. It focuses on sneaking through enemy held territory and sniping. This brings me to the main reason, why one would want to buy this game, the bullet/killcam. Seeing your bullet's fly is just awesome! If this is a good enough reason for you, buy this game. Personally, I recommend buying the bundle on sale!			",98,5,1,3,1,0,6

Assault missions are unbearable because assault weapons are unbearably inaccurate. Enemies do not take damage due to invisible barriers even though there is a clear line of sight behind cover.

												I really wanted to like this game, but no matter how hard I tried, in the end? I just couldn't.The game is a ton of fun and has variety to spice things up. Through most of the campaign you play as ""Tyler"" The sniper. You stealth through villages, slaughter hundreds of people via pistol or sniper rifle, and just be a general badass. However what I didn't see coming was that there are also several segments of the game where it turns into Call of Duty and you're taking oil rigs with an assault rifle as ""Conway"" a member of ""Delta"". It was an..interesting surprise but the mechanics in the game REALLY don't suit assault rifle gameplay.It runs decently on modern systems. Some graphical glitches unfortunately, ESPECIALLY if you're running multi-gpu. NOTE: Do not run this game with multi-GPU.The stealth system is basic. The graphics are...decent. Textures are horrible but character models and object models have their high-points. The sniping ""circle"" that indicates where your shot will land breaks occasionally, ESPECIALLY when you zoom further in with your scope. The main campaign is very short, about 5 hours. The DLC Campaign ""Unfinished Business"" will add about 3 hours to the game give or take (But is immensely frustruating due to an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoint system).The story is very uninteresting. I've finished both campaigns and I just remember bits and pieces of everything. I couldn't tell you who Tyler was employed with, why we were fighting who we were fighting or anything. I LOVE stories too, I buy games mostly for the stories! But this one is just pathetic.The characters are meh as well. Tyler is a regular individual, Conway is....a guy with a name...and O'Neil just has a voice actor that makes me want to remember him, but he was so underdeveloped I'll forget him in two days tops.The multiplayer is horrendous. Extreme server latency issues. Consistent fluctuating ping regardless of your internet connection. And all for what? A Call of Duty with nothing but snipers and silenced pistols? No thank you. (As well as broken server finding that stops you from hosting any server using any DLC weapons/maps due to the developer forgetting to include that information in the server list)All in all this game is not worth your time. There are MUCH better games out there, but if you have this one, no harm in giving it a try. It is drudgerous however, and your effort never pays off as the ending is likely the WORST part of this game. All 3 of them. (Yes, there are 3. The main campaign ending, the DLC ending, and then finding out you're not done and there's a ""Challenge"" mode that's 1 mission to end the entire game- which I never played because after 8 hours I grew SO sick of the game.)FInal Verdict is a 4/10. Sub-par, but not completely worthless.			",179,24,2,40,36,1,42

												Slowly belly-crawling through the underbrush, I scan the distance for signs of enemy troops. I come to a sudden stop; inexplicably, an invisible wall blocks my forward progress. I crawl to the edge of the brush, frantically run across an exposed trail, and into the foliage to the left of the path, figuring that a different route might be in order, but I'm stymied again as I find myself stuck on a rock that raises only six inches off the ground. Finally, I find a way past these obstacles in the brush and silently arrive at my GPS designated destination marker, but my objective won't clear. I give up. Defeated, I walk back up the hill, walk down the path, which triggers a voiceover, which enables the GPS marker, which spawns enemies on the path ahead of me that kill me. This is my experience with Sniper: Ghost Warrior in a nutshell. 6/10PresentationSniper is sandwiched between static menus and boring, grammatically challenged loading screens.7.5/10GraphicsThe vibrant, busy environments are striking with some great lighting, but awful character models and a shoddy framerate hurts the experience6.5/10SoundBoilerplate music and bad Latin American accents can't hide Nolan North slumming it in the jungle.5.5/10GameplayThe sniping mechanic is sound, but its undercut by terrible level design and unwieldy run and gun sequences.7/10Lasting AppealThe single player campaign will last about 12 hours, and multiplayer offers a decent variety of gametypes.

												It's fun, but not perfect. Many flaws, but mostly enjoyable. That's the TL;DR of all my thoughts on the game.I came into this expecting blandness, but I must say, the parts where you're sniping are VERY enjoyable. It feels very nice to control, and after getting a hang of it, it's really easy to headshot people. When it goes into the bullet cam, that feels great. If this game was entirely sniping, I'd give it a much higher rating.The problem is, you're not always sniping. There's parts where you must use an assault rifle, and it feels AWFUL. Horrible hit detection and hardly any damage, and the enemies basically have aimbots, while you can't even see them. It feels very tacked on, and the game suffers for it.There are quite a few glitches, from clipping issues, to my teammates falling off of a boat, to this random invincible aimbot guy that could kill me in less than a second from half a mile away. Most of these were quite hilarious, except for that aimbot guy.The story's not original in any sense, but I didn't expect much. It's a bit better than most of these macho military man game stories, though.But honestly, even with the glitches and the assault rifle parts, on the whole this is a quite enjoyable game. My playtime is how long it took me to beat single player on normal. I didn't bother trying multiplayer because I assume's that's dead.I will indeed recommend it. Play it if you want to have an enjoyable sniping experience, and are willing to overlook some flaws.Tip: If you manually save, it's like a savestate wherever you put it, and deaths will return you to it. So, you could savescum through the assault rifle parts, for instance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very,Very broken game. The shading in this makes me sick,the fact that its a ""stealth"" game is embarrassing. considering your character is basically god and barely takes any damage at all and deals out lots of it. Making the game boring and dumb as a large part of the game is just moving from A to B. Piled with a story with no depth at all, this game could've been great if it were more routes around doing things and more interactive with things such as side jobs and better stealth mechanics such as a grading of how the mission went and enemies doing more damage.

												For a game that's supposedly about sniping, you do way too little sniping. Most of the game is nothing but a generic military shooter. Also, any fun you could have with the sniping is hugely diminished by the fact that enemies seem to be able to spot you from hundreds of meters away and then shoot you with pinpoint accuracy, while you're struggling with the scope, the breathing, the gravity, and the wind.

If you don't mind taking your time in order to hide and sneak through each level so you can take out the enemy with them not able to find you, then this is the game for you.  Great graphics, mediocre storyline and great sniping gameplay.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												By far the worst fps I ever played and I played Duke Nukem ForeverPros+Sniping works well when there are no glitchesCons-Force you into CQC scenes with a m4 and the guns play like crap (Like the devs always give u a auto-shotgun every level like these since they knew these were crap)-Game glitched twice where stealth simply did not work at times. I had to glitch the game back by doing some exploits-Dumb and buggy Ai-Auto-fail section for stealth sections-Checkpoint system and the distance between two checkpoints were too long to pad out the gameDo not buy this game. They tried to copy the famous COD4 level in Chernoybl and they failed terribly. It took shear will to beat this game and I just quit halfway through the DLC mission because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t auto-fail sections.			",1076,352,24,162,103,8,189

												First part of the game is tolerable. Good idea for game, nice graphics and sneaking elements encouraged me to this game. Unfortunately enjoyment was not for long. Game has a lot of bugs and hypersensitive enemies with Annie Oakley accuracy like in previous City Interactive sniper game titled Sniper: Art of Victory based on Chrome Engine. Additionally in this game are missions without sniper rifle and of course enemies always know where you are before you see them. Shooting in this game from other weapon than sniper rifle is a nightmare, assault rifles and submachine guns have huge recoil that shooting someone is very difficult. I can't recommend this game, even previous budget City Interactive FPS game based on LichTech eXJupiter engine were much better and had better game mechanics. Sniper: Ghost Warrior unfortunately is step back.			",60,1,0,2,1,0,0

												This game can't decide what it wants to be - stealth sniper or straight-out FPS. This results in absurd situations. For example, in stealth levels, enemies will raise the alarm the moment they see you, but won't as long as they don't - EVEN IF you just shot the guy standing right next to them. For another example, the in-game radar doesn't show enemies until you look at them - a great logical idea. However, enemies show on your radar if you cross sufficiently close to them, even if you never directly looked at them. At other times, the radar won't register a enemy if you are looking at him through your scope - extremely weird for a game titled Sniper.There are 3 stances - standing, crouching and crawling. Ideally, you should be forced to choose between running from cover to cover or slowly crawling in the hopes of being undetected. In the game though, you just have to crawl always.Worst of all  are the controls. Totally unresponsive and the mouse sensitivity is way too high.And I would expect a stealth game to have a separate key for lying prone. Nope - you have to long-press the crouch key.Even CoD has separate keys for these stances.			",162,54,3,38,39,3,69

												A sub-standard FPS with horrible stealth mechanics. I was expecting a game about sniping from a distance and what I got was part-splinter cell, part-modern war and none of it good. I did more sniping in Saints Row IV, so if you want a game that actually let's you play as a sniper I recommend something in the Sniper Elite series, like V2.			",322,78,4,47,32,4,43

												I've played the first couple of missions and I'd say the Metacritic rating is accurate. When you start playing, you play as a marksman who has to stealthily kill enemies to get to where you need to go, that part of the gameplay is pretty well made. But, I am currently playing on a mission where stealth and ""sniping"" are nonexistant. The game has totally thrown those two core elements out of the window and replaced them will assault rifles that have rediculous recoil that is not appropriate (take this from someone who has shot the exact gun they are using in real life) and and have no selector switches to swap the firing modes which only compounds the other issue. There are also numerous bugs that are very obvious and it puzzles me how they made it to release.I got this game in a bundle for like $4 so I'm not all that mad, just very  very disappointed. Suffice it to say I will never buy another game from this developer.			",110,11,1,14,5,0,4

												So 6 years ago i got this game for the xbox 360, and i loved it. I saw that it were on sale so i bought it to play it once more. Things have changed.The game feels bad, just bad. The AI works in some wierd ways (Can't see you when you are 2 meters infront of them but will eagle eye you cross map). The movement is also really awkward, it feels like you are Jimmy from South park, you can't even walk up stairs without needing to jump. The sniping however is good, hiding in the bushes and picking off targets feels nice and rewarding. I would recommend this game if it weren't for one thing. Soldier play. Somehow the guys that made this thought it was a good idea to have levels where you play as a soldier with an assault rifle, it plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ You know those days in middleschool when your best friend was sick? The day wasn't hard or painfull, but just really really boring, right? It's like that, you just want it over. The only reason i can recommend it is if you really want to play some sniper games, but if you are looking for entertainment you have come to the wrong place. Plus the game only last 4 (painfully long) hours.I rate this 5 bacon strips out of 10NOTE: The Second strike DLC is actually kind of good.			",76,38,1,9,9,2,9

												Probably just one of a few games I don't recommend. Sure Graphics are nice... well that's pretty much it in my opinion. Mostly you'll have to move straight through, feels like playing COD at some point. The worst thing about it is that you don't have much choice where to snipe from. A lot of surroundings block your way specially if you move further to the edge of the map.Another thing I dislike is that you'll have a red dot on your scope that shows exactly where the bullet is going to hit.In order to remove it you most likely have to play on a insanely high difficulty which killed the game for me. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 might be better choice (never played it) otherwise Sniper Elite would be a good choice as well.Thanks for reading, feel free to write a comment ;^)*More Reviews soon.*			",64,1,3,11,3,0,1

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior is one of my favorite sniper games so far. Graphics:I really loved the graphics. I was particularly impressed by the way your vision goes when your eyes are submerged into water, but you are not swimming. Such details are missed by many game companies. As far as the greenery goes, true, it is not the easiest to see when you are hiding in some, but in my opinion, this only enchances the experience. Just like in real life, you cannot see through leaves. Shuffle a bit and you will get that hit no problem.Story:Story is not as deep as I would like it to be, but it is decent regardless. You are told what to do, and you do it. In some cases even, you tell other snipers what to do by scouting the area and marking enemies for them. The ending lacked some action and story line after the final enemy has been assassinated.General:Aiming is good, it depends from the distance, the wind, your pulse and I'm not sure what else. This does not make it difficult, because if you have time to focus for a few seconds and calm your pulse down, you will be able to see exactly where will the bullet land. This way you are able to get very satisfying head shots, shown by a bullet cam. The game has a very nice balance in difficulty, as well as keeping you interested as you continue to play on. Mission types change, story goes on, and most of all, you have to be VERY careful. Enemies are marked on your map only once you see them, but until then, there is really no telling where they could be, unless if you can hear them (walking, speaking to each other, using a mobile phone).Bugs/complaints:Here I would like to leave my opinion on some of the problems people complained about, and gave this game a bad recommendation:1. Invisible walls everywhere!Honestly, I haven't found a single invisible barrier, if they were there in the past, they are gone.2. Enemies kill you so easily!True, but is this a bad thing though? After all, we are talking about a stealth sniper game, not counter strike. You wouldn't feel very well either if there were 5 bullets inside of you.3. They are such good marksman!I found the skill of enemies aiming to be proportional to the distance they are from you. If they are really far, they will have trouble even seeing you. If we are talking close range, yes, they are good, but then again, probably a person who never held a gun would make that shot as well and at the end of the day, so are you.4. Game is so linear!You have an objective. That objective has its location. If you want to explore, you are very much welcome to do so, it is even encouraged through 'Secrets' you may obtain around on every mission. Very often you travel between camps and villages, up and down rivers, across the jungle, and you are free to explore all of that. However, if you feel like visiting France instead of doing your objective, unfortunately, this hasn't been added yet.The only thing I noticed being odd was the bridge part in mission ""A marksman at his best"". In this mission, you do not carry a sniper, but binoculars and pistol as you are helping other sniper. But then comes the part where you have to run away from the enemies. Eventually, you come up to a bridge with 4-5 enemies on it, and you are supposed to go off the side of the bridge and into the river. However, for some reason, sometimes they notice you instantly and just destroy you, without giving you chance to go into water. It can be frustrating, but you may also just kill them all and continue on, so it is not a game crasher.Overall:This game is extremely underrated for some reason. Metascore should be at around at least 80 in my opinion. I have very much enjoyed this game, and for the price it has, it is really a good bargain. It has my recommendation.EDIT1:I wrote this review when I finished the campaign, but the content doesn't end there! After you finish campaign, you can go for Challange button and start playing totally new missions! Trick here is that you are taken all indicators, including health, bullet count and the tiny red circle that shows you exactly where the bullet will land. You are left to play with only your skill. Great game!			",398,170,18,49,47,4,64

												Stealth sniping - sounds like a great game, doesn't it? Well, it could be, but the idea is so badly executed, that after 5 minutes of fun (training and start of first mission) it brings only frustration and disappointment.Enemy spotting, their accuracy and AI are horrible.They can see you hidden in tall grass, in bushes, behind trees, and yes, behind walls too.They can shoot you accurately, with every bullet from any distance (700m, using a pistol? no problem, they hit you every time)And once an enemy is alarmed, whole map knows where you are, must be telepathy, there's no other explanation.Good idea, terrible execution, terrible game.

												This game cannot get more infuriating if it tried. the M4 which is a low recoil gun has massive recoil and in order to do anything you have to drop it for any gun other than it. The Regular infantry fighting sucks due to the accuracy of the enemies being aimbot on medium difficulty and a kid with downs on easy. The Marksman Fighting isn't much better. You are dropped into a scenerio with little to no backstory of why you are there or why your even trying to ambushing this whole convoy of anywhere from 50-100 soldiers by yourself.(i never lived to find out how many exactly due to the aimbot qualities of medium difficulty) The Sniping on the whole is fun however with the design of the sniper rifle scope showing exactly where the round with hit, making it fun and easy. This however doesn't matter when the enemy can shoot you from the hip at the same distance. the only thing good is the sneaking to where you need to go missions. however this is also pointless due to your final ""kill shot"" ,no matter where placed on the target, will not kill them. which is lovingly announced by yourself saying ""the shot was not effective"" and then you are forced to watch the target you spend the last half hour stalking drive away. SOUNDS FUN RIGHT??? then this is the game for you, no me.... Love from Russia			",160,8,0,20,10,2,11

												I really loved this game, it's beautiful and the whole cinematic view when getting a headshot is beyond impressive and awesome, although..i have just gotten to the mission ""A Simple Rendevous"" and it was fairly easy..until there's a glitch with the Enemy's, you are supposed to get to cover..the glitch is you get shot while behind fully covering sand bags - (It's not realism as you may think it could be) so basically you get shot either by Enemy's who have some extreme power or air..no really air..you heal and then without a sound of bullets hitting you when there normally is you lose health from 100 descending to 60 then 40 etc.  Then come's a point where the helicopter finally arrives and...no, it doesn't help you out but rather prefers to just tell you to ""move your♥♥♥♥♥out of there"", by that moment ALL i mean ALL of the Enemy's throw grenades at you, casuing havoc and killing themselves and of course you because screw you realism. So my thought..Game was impressive, now it's all went down a sinkhole. Mission is impossible and i think the main reason the word ""Simple"" is in the missions name is because it's just trying to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because of the fact it's supposedly simple but it's not..so i'm done and quite frankly it's a shame but i won't probably play this game anymore..Did i mention that when you die from these annoying Enemy's you spawn right beside them..like straight in the middle of the fire-zone...Sniper v. 20 Enemy's armed with Assault Rifle's and unlimited Frags...uhm no thanks..

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior is an interesting little game. You could see what they were trying to do with it, but they didn't quite get there. To be fair, my first ever Sniper experience was slighty marred by the fact that the game isn't particularly compatible with win10 and the constant freezes, crashes and other little problems meant that my 14hr (twice as long as necessary) playthrough - from training to the end of unfinished business (dlc) - registered as about 25hrs on steam.  Pros: nice enough to look at on max settings;  the killcam never got tiring for me; it does mix up gameplay between sneaky sneaky and run and gun, with a couple of mounted shooting galleries thrown in for good measure.Cons: gameplay can get repetitive; sometimes (especially prone) the scenery is so in your face that you can't see anything beyond the foliage in front of your face, which ends in tears;  some of the shot/AI behaviour is truly laughable.TL:DR - fun little game, can get extremely annoying/frustrating at times and no end of problems if playing on anything beyond win7!Recommended only for patient people.

												It's obvious budget ware right from the beginning, fine.  It could have been an entertaining purely sniping focussed game but instead it switches early on from decent sniping game to regular first person shooter with terrible iron sights and atrocious combat.  When it finally switches back to the sniping character he can't even snipe properly anymore as whenever he pops up to shoot enemies halfway across the map instantly start sniping him with their rifles that by all rights shouldn't be anywhere near hitting him.  Those guys are the real snipers, zeroing in instantly on me using an AK from a mile away.			",1406,582,49,149,154,10,226

												Invisible walls: the gameThere's some fun to be had here, especially in multiplayer, but I can only recommend this one for a bargain price. The graphics are rather pretty and the game runs well on older PCs too but the actual game contained in the engine isn't that interesting. Level design is incredibly linear and punishes every urge to explore with plenty of invisible walls and telescope-vision enemies, that often spot you from a huge distance if you stray from the tiny path offered by the developers. The sniping itself is a lot of fun at times and adjustable to your comfort level, despite the AI but regular gunplay which unfortunately occurs too is a drag and discourages further playing. The story is of little help to keep you invested - even by the low standards of military shooters it's unengaging and keeps jumping back and forth between ""characters"" which I set in quotation marks because we never learn anything about the characters we are playing. I don't think I can even recall the name of the main character. Your main incentive as mr. soldier man is the voice in your head telling you to pop heads of south american baddies and after a while you kind of feel sympathy for the guys, since you, as the good guy, just show up with no authority, wreck their stuff and kill all their friends. It's somewhat feasible they might be the bad guys and it doesn't reach as far into the uncomfortable territory of the hyper-jingoistic splinter cell games but the story only has some shred of redeeming value if at the end it turns out you were part of a psychological experiment to determine how far you'd go if an authority figure tells you to.In conclusion, Sniper: Ghost Warrior isn't deep enough as a stealth game and not fluid enough as an fps, marred by restrictive level design and a tedious single player campaign, however the multiplayer can be incredibly fun if you're not confronted by expert players. There aren't that many maps and modes but I enjoyed it more than any other generic fps in recent memory. There's a lot of room for improvement and the game is not a trainwreck by any means, but still I can't recommend it, unless you love multiplayer and you can get it really cheap.

												This game is better than most general FPS's that include a sniper theme inside the actual game. Why? Because it's directly centered around the tactics and style protrayed by modern military sniper. This game displays a set of youth ranged ballistics and areodynamics, which does occasionally draw away from a true expierience. While it may feature bullet drop to some degree, that is the only true force that with be acting aginst where you hit your target. It fetures no windage, elevation change or temperature, etc. However, for the average person interested in this theme of military force, the game offers a great time. Still looking for a true sniper game though, but it's worth the buy if you are new to things like this. I highly recomend setting this on the ""Hard"" setting, as it gets rid of the red dot which allows for a much better expierience as a sniper.			",24,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Let me start by saying that this game is NOT AS BAD as many people make it out to be.  That said, it's not a great game either. This game has problems, many problems.  In most levels the enemies seem to have ESP on where you are and how you are traveling, in other levels you can almost walk right in front of them and they don't seem to notice.  When they do notice you they are scary deadly with their aim.  I played all the single player content plus the DLC, and yes, the hours I put into this game are correct.  The sniping can really be satisfying on many levels and I found myself playing levels over and over because it had really good sniping.  The graphics in other games that offer the same type of sniping is usually much better.  All in all I had fun with the game, except for some extremely frustrating levels, and I do recommend this game, just pick it up cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know if I can recommend it, but I cannot say I do not recommend it.The game played fine.I started the game up and it has never quit on me in 50 hours.I alt tabbed for a couple days straight and a bunch of hours.The game took approximately 8 hours or so to complete. I am not too sure as I did reload a part where there was an error.So it's around 8-10 hours.I had the difficulty to the hardest possible.I didn't like the feel of it, although, I beat it with ease.The enemy sees you and you're automatically hit. It's not that they see you, it's more that, it's programmed to see you. You have a few other team mates around and they can stand there and not get hit at all.So you're constantly behind cover and pop out and go back and forth waiting to recharge to 30 health each time. There's really no point in the health pack, it's like 100% health and 30% is nearly alike.One of the missions where you had to kill one of the person doesn't work. Even if you kill him, he's still free. (it's not supposed to allow you to kill him, yet, you can)The sound is... okay I suppose. Directional sound you can hear. I did have issues with text, intro and the ending being upside down. It didn't, however, detract from the game as it played out normally. The multiplayer is extremely few. If you want to play this game for that reason, there's just no point.You'll also get many 4v2 and no one switching over to make it even. This happens way too many times, like 8 times nearly in a row a couple of days ago. As if, why wouldn't they make the game even? They are winning so why?So the community is not good.. Not good at all. They just do not care at all about it and want the game to die even more when it comes to multiplayer. So I guess, let it die. (Also, me being a new player to this, every one of the people are easy to kill, but when it is 4v2, it's not much you can really do)The ending was.... lackluster. It wasn't special, it didn't do anything. It just... ended.I didn't play any of the DLCs, I didn't feel as though they were worth getting.I would recommend at least playing it if you get it in a bundle. The price, well, I suppose it is okay.There is some enjoyments you can get out of this game. To be honest, I was hoping the game ended sooner for me. The AI is horrible. You can kill people right near em and they will not notice. Like, blood will splatter all over them(not really, since the blood doesn't stick on em) and they will just do nothing. So I guess, just play it if you have it or it is extremely cheap. Though, I wouldn't get it just to pick this game from a bundle. So, in essence, do I really recommend it? ",239,56,2,52,22,1,33

												Pretty bad.  I haven't played the multiplayer, but the campaign story line is just terrible. You can run through it pretty quickly.  They throw in run and gun parts of the game with terrible M16 (I think?) rifles that can barely hit the broad side of a barn.  Most of the gameplay is spent in close quarters, which the opposite thing you'd expect from a SNIPING game.  You get 2 or 3 chances for really long range shots and most of the time it just doesn't work out very well.  Overall, this is probably one of the worst games I've played.			",69,4,0,4,6,0,7

Not so 💩First of all, Ghost Warrior is a massive improvement over Art of Victory (if you're clueless as to what that is, I envy you). You can tell a lot of effort was actually put in the development of this game and for a fistful of dollars it's worth getting. Still, it can be quite awful at times - while the first half of the campaing can be really fun, the rest is mostly terrible.PROS Nice graphics (especially when you inject some proper AA and AO) Intuitive controls Decent sniping mechanics A few interesting missions Three difficulty levels Quicksave and quickload Instant loading (well, I had it installed on SSDs in RAID0 :P) Reasonably good voice acting Multiplayer Good optimisation Steam achievementsCONS Your character's hearbeat hovers between 80-210 beats per second The FOV is too low The parts, when you're not sniping are rather lame Weak story and abrupt ending Second half of the game - Act III is especially sh*tty AI ranging from totally inept to Übermensch Weird issues with the introductory and credits videos on Windows 8/8.1/10 Incredibly worthless secrets (=few lines of text) ",183,29,9,16,5,1,11

												This game is alright if you can get it cheap but anymore than 5 pounds i wouldent bother nothing to special. Very good bullet cam animation and Good voice acting. The parts that let it down was the game was based around sniping but they put missions in the game where you had to do assualts on compounds etc with machine guns and the recoil was disgusting. The story has a good length to it but at times gets a bit repetive and almost to the point where you want to fall asleep and find yourself doing the same thing over and over again. The enviroments are pretty much the same in every level you are in the jungle taking out drug cartels and other mercenaries. 6/10			",190,17,4,9,6,0,3

												What the hell!I paid money for this! I started this game with high hopes for a good game of snipeing the crap out of people; but no no no if you make one noise the entire complex knows exactly where you are and what bush you are hideing in. As for the multiplayer. The matchmakeing is terrible. it drops you into games filled with the campers from other games. so everyone is just sitting there getting no action at all; and if you do move you get you brains blown out!While i accept i am bad at the whole camping thing i still think there should be servers for just noobs.Tech wise this game is unpolished and so raw Gorden Ramsey would complain. people talk and their mouths dont move. enemies keep dissapearing on me and leave me unable to finish the level as i have to kill them.That list can go on forever.So here is my revenge! a bad review. does it hurt? I hope it does....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For people who think this is realistic: It's not. The bullets fall so fast to the ground, it looks like you're fighting on the sun.

												A SIMPLE REVIEW: Only buy this game if you can get it for less than $5. No more. Best aspects are sniping, sneaking, and planning your shots/kills. While the sniping and sneaking are a lot of fun, the more ""action"" like parts are NOT! I recommend this only if you can grab it in a cheap bundle (I paid, mathematically speaking, less than $1 for this game). If you want more details, continue below.SNIPING/SNEAKING: A lot of fun, actually! Don't play this game on easy, just start it out on hard. You'll have a much more challenging and enjoyable experience. I had more than enough fun sneaking through the jungle and carefully picking my targets. Many enemies I had to leave behind in order to remain undetected. DO NOT PLAY THIS LIKE A RUN-AND-GUN! (as should be obvious) The mechanics of this game and your gear will not help you in the slightest and you will die easily. Which brings me, sadly, to the next part...NON-SNIPING PARTS: Due to the poor mechanics of this game and the overall design, the hardest, most annoying, and least fun parts were the ones where you have to use an assault rifle in a 3-man team. Recoil is terrible, accuracy is non-existant, and everyone else can take you out since they are shooting from all directions. Simply AWFUL! No other words needed to articulate this problem. Oh yeah, and the AI is either incredibly clueless or has the perception of a hawk, depending on your current status or location in a given mission. (sometimes the game just ""automatically"" made me detected even though I was never spotted and never raised an alert).I only recommend this game IF you buy it for less than $5. Otherwise, wait till the price drops. The sneaking and sniping through the jungle was a fun experience without a doubt and outweighs the terrible assault mechanics.			",37,0,0,2,1,0,0

												A decent sniper game with decent bullet ballistics and a decent bulletcam.Would overall be a decent game if not for some really annoying bugs & glitches. These bugs & glitches include but are not limited to; - The player not being able to stay still on stairs- The enemies seeing you when they are not supposed - The enemies not seeing you when they are supposed to.- Too many unnecessary cutscenes.-Too many unnecessary mission objectives that are just f**king annoying after a point.Some Cons of this game also are;- Very linear gameplay.- Gets really boring after the first 3-4 missions. (Again, linear gameplay)- The automatic rifles are just ridicilous. I have never seen worst. (You'll see what I mean if you play the game)- In hard difficulty, it feels like all your enemies are veteran snipers who were born with the ability of sniping. They have no problem shooting you with a pistol from 200m. I mean sure, the game should be hard but not unrealistically hard. You can make the AI smarter or increase Damage taken or increase wind speed and change environmental factors, but if you are being hit by a pistol bullet from 200m away and almost dying from that shot, then that just makes the game stupid and annoying... Not ""difficult"".In short, Sniper: Ghost Warrior is an extremely average game. There is nothing special about it that makes it stand out. If you like sniper games in general and if stupid bugs, glitches and unnecessary things don't bother you, then you can try this game.I'd give it a 4/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+ Graphics are good, but a bit glitchy.+ Good difficulty.+ Sniping is simple and works well.- Very generic.- Broken stealth mechanics.- Horrible AI.- Non-existent story with completely uninteresting characters. An ending also literally does not exist. You finally assassinate that one target you were supposed to kill, the screen turns black and the words ""THE END"" are slapped onto the screen, followed by credits rolling. That's it.- Too short. It took me about 4.5 hours to complete this game on the hardest difficulty.Sniper: Ghost Warrior is yet another CoD copycat. Think Modern Warfare's ""All Ghillied Up"" and ""One Shot, One Kill"" missions stretched into one terrible game. Don't even bother.38/100			",582,79,29,50,49,3,30

												At first I thought this wasn't such a bad game. Not as bad as people made it out to be at least. I usually play games with an open mind. I don't want people to tell me which games are great and which games are not. If I had listened to these people I would've missed out on some pretty cool games. So, I started playing Sniper Ghost Warrior. First impressions; graphics are solid, gameplay as well. It reminded me of Sniper Elite, but set in the jungle. That was the first level. After a few levels, the AI started to get indecisive; at times hardly noticing you, and other times seeing you pretty much instantly, even when in cover. So the stealth aspect just wasn't there anymore, which is a shame because sneaking around and shooting people in slowmotion looked and felt great. Later levels also introduced run-and-gun aspects which just didn't fit the game. It didn't feel right and it didn't play right and should've been removed altogether.Let's just hope SGW 2 improves on most (all?) fronts.[Rating: 61/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

I tried to fix to FOV with config but with no success. It seems like the developer's don't care either.

I don't know why people are having problems with this game, because they are improving it all the time and adding to it to make it better. The bugs in the game aren't annoying and they will get fixed. This game is becoming one of my favorite to play. I love it!! If you have played sniper elite before then you should be right at home with this game, it follows the bullet to the target like in sniper elite but 10 times better. If you feel like your a sniper in real life and love to do it in games then you cant go wrong in getting this game. Get it if you love sniping!!			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												Poľsky budgetovy odstrelovač v príjemnom vizuale, zaujímavým režimom balistiky a množstvom chýb vrátane retardovanej umelej inteligencie. Ak sa s týmto zmierite, tak si nakoniec zopár odstrelených hláv celkom užijete. Teda užijete s prihliadnutím na budgetovy produkt a zároveň prvú hru zo série, ktorá sa ale s každým ďalším dielom niekde posúva. Nejak autori svoje snaženie odštartovať museli. S každou chybou sa však učia vytvárať svoju nenapadnu sériu lepšie a koniec koncov, ani prvý Ghost Warrior na tom v rámci svojich možnosti nebol vôbec špatne.

												Alright, I’m here to answer some questions you may thinking to yourself. Is it worth buying it? Is this game fun?Beaware of some of it might be spoiler alert.Personally so far I think this is the best game CI Games have produced. As a sniper-enthusiast I look for pros and cons with this game. I have already in advance completed this game on the Xbox 360 a long time ago, and to be honest I felt more connected into the game, and more sort a say “Alive” on the PC version. Here are some reasons why.1. With a decent good computer specifications, you can get amazing sniper experience. The graphics are stunning. As you would expect from the CryEngine. But It’s not quite the same visual quality as the Crysis games. Some areas look really nice, but others less so. Here is a screenshot captured by me in-game: http://imgur.com/IEv5urm Cut-scenes graphics are a bit poor, huge improvement can be done there, example: http://imgur.com/EpkAOPSI achieved much better fps after careful tweaking (Tip: Put “Object Detail” on low for massive fps boost and next to no quality loss).2. Having a headphone on you with Surround Sound makes you feel more realistic. I have tested it with speakers (Surround Sound), and I didn’t get nearly the same experience.3. I would recommend you to play it with a Xbox 360 controller on the PC version - (If it’s possible). Sniper Ghost Warrior it’s actually a more of a console type of game when it comes to controllers. Kinda like GTA V, The Witcher 3, and the Call of Duty franchise. And I’m not saying it because I played the game first with a Xbox 360, but the whole movement with a mouse and keyboard makes it feel weird compared to a smoother version with a controller. Controls are ok, but feel a bit clunky and are unresponsive in some contexts.4. Something I wasn’t aware of when I first played this game on the 360 console. I bought all of the DLC’s on the PC version, and I recognized the DLC called: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2: Digital Extras.The Special Edition Includes SOUNDTRACK - An official Soundtrack from the game’s musical score. It’s a nice soundtrack and has a nice beat to it in a close danger situation or a sticky situation. Your heart starts to beat a bit more and you get a little bit of the adrenaline kick. I think that’s a huge deal when it comes to sniper games.Sidenote: I think that Michał Cielecki did a amazing job with the soundtracks. I really feel excited when I hear his soundtracks. I’m looking forward to see if he have any soundtracks to the Sniper Ghost Warrior 3. https://soundcloud.com/michal-cieleckiGenerally about the game:It’s a good non-AAA game that provides a stealth and sniping experience. Presentation and writing are a bit clichéd, but I was already expecting this. Otherwise, the story is not bad at all. Levels are very linear and heavily scripted. You are guided by your commander who stays at your side most of the time. This provides good immersion and manages to convey the sense of working as a team.Cons/Improvements:I’m not going to cover every specific detail about this game, but I’m going to cover some of it.The scripting is fairly basic and lacks some polish. There were various issues. My AI was a bit unreliable when we went stealth mode - Here is actually a great example that I captured: http://imgur.com/D3hmFA6 On the picture you can see we were inside the tunnels in Bosnia Sarajevo. My teammate (Maddox) alerted me to hide because there were troops coming towards us. For some weird reason Maddox didn’t do anything (obviously he glitched out). After of certain of time Maddox starts yelling “♥♥♥♥! Run!!” when the guards are right in front of him. I had to restart my mission, because we were basically ♥♥♥♥ed when they had 10 guards pointing at us and firing. Lucky for me the checkpoint was right outside the tunnel. So I wasn’t needed to process the whole scenery (Before we went inside the tunnel again).Sometimes when you got the order/mission from either your teammate or your commander to go backstabbing a guard. You could just literally run behind him and make a lot of footsteps without him recognize anything. Seems like these guards are partly death at some areas. They only recognized you if they saw you and if you shoot. Hearing running footsteps and other small details like reloading a gun was not intended apparently.Dialogue were cutting off sometimes when you reached checkpoints.A few times my character would confirm over radio that I had the target in my sight, but the target was no where to be seen on my screen. The checkpoint save system has the usual irritations associated with such a system. Checkpoints was not reloading correctly.If you run down some stairs you just start floating a little bit above it instead of actually running on top of it. Kinda annoying effect http://imgur.com/sEyedLj. I also don’t like on the scene ""Burning Bridges"" (Act 3 - Mission 2) when you have to run from the temple and your stamina ends so often/quickly. Just like this: http://imgur.com/enuIHwO. I can understand that in reality it’s heavy carrying a sniper rifle around, but it’s kinda silly how Anderson survived there. In my opinion City Interactive could twisted this situation with other solutions.The simulation of wind on bullets feels artificial because the wind speed is not effectively reflected in the environment - vegetation does not respond accordingly and there are no other indicators like the sound of wind or moving dust etc. The displayed distances seem to be fake - an ingame distance of 400 meters is actually closer to 200 meters. http://imgur.com/IEv5urmBackdraw: If you just realized Sniper Ghost Warrior recently, I think you are going to be a bit disappointed in this game. Reason being is this game was released on March 12, 2013 in North America, March 15, 2013 in Europe and March 19, 2013 in Australia. They used not a old game engine to develop this game. But the singleplayer content is a bit slim compared to other games that are released in 2016. The game will approximately last 5 hours ish of gameplay. If you don’t care about these details that happens every now and then, and you are more into the main storyline in this game, I would recommend it. Be sure to follow some recommendations above to make this game even more enjoyable and I had very modest expectations, and it satisfied them. Get it when on sale.Rating:From 1-10. (8)Cannot wait to review Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 when the game is set to be released worldwide 4 Apr, 2017. http://imgur.com/N5JydFkSGW3:  ",150,16,2,11,13,4,4

												First, two words...I really don't know what made me play this game in 2017. Probably out of boredom or stupidity...Also, I have no military expertise so excuse me if I make inaccurate assumptions.So... the game follows the adventures of a ninja-like sniper recon who can do pretty much everything. I don't know US Army/Navy/Marines/whatever very well, but I'm pretty sure they don't have this type of soldier in their ranks.I mean I understand I'm the hero of the story, but the game is set in real world. I imagine how those at HQ talk: ""We need to protect some Deltas. Send the sniper. We need to destroy some plantations on some f...king islands. Send the sniper. We need to an entire army in South America. Hell, what the..., send the sniper.""Oh, and some time the game feel the need to put you in one of the Delta guys... Then I realized why they need so much protection. From a team of three, two of them are immortal sponge bullets. The other one, of course, is the player. I couldn't rely on them because they, like me, have the accuracy of a blind bat. I mean, I could very well close my eyes and shoot - the result was the same.Problem is the game is scripted to play like this - those two drawing fire and I shooting the baddies. On one mission they decided ""F..k it, we stay here!"" and they didn't move on the map. Everyone shot at me. It was probably the longest mission in a game I ever played... and I play shooters since Wolfenstein 3D came out.It seems though this country in South America has the best soldiers in the world, at least regarding the accuracy. I never thought an AK-47 can hit me with almost all bullets fired from about 150-200 meters. I'd wish those Delta trained with these guys...Missions are designed by someone with a death wish or at least masochistic. At some point the chopper sent for extraction couldn't take me away because LZ was too hot. Of course, as in every war movie, there was another LZ where I was pointed to. ""Ok, buddy, we can't get you out now, but go to the second LZ which is deep inside enemy territory!"" WTF? Say again? Who the hell picked that spot? Oh, and I need to clear the LZ? Why the hell I can't clear the first one, right here, right now?So, this is what you should expect from it.No, just no.Sorry for my bad English.			",1176,500,35,134,93,7,181

												I have only played this game in ""single player mode"", but thus far I have enjoyed the game rather much.  I have had a couple of ""odd""  game freezes ""in game"" but nothing persistent.   The game  is ""forgiving"" so as long as you make a game save now and then then you can always load the game again,  and anyway if you gets ""killed"" then the game lets you start again by itself to try again.  A must however is to have a ""controller"" (or game pad) to play this game as it is the only right way to play the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The pros of this game are: Nice graphics for a 7 year old game, good sniper mechanics like sniper cam, hold you breath, wind directions and bullet drop. It has a lenghty singleplayer campaign and it has multiplayer. Now the cons are: It has graphical problems and unforgiving AI. Game's absurd difficulty in some areas particularly the enemy AI ""that ranges from mindless to so magical it can spot you instantly"" and also the game has a number of glitches, some of which can cause the player to die should they occur.At least it's better than the previous one but not by much. Anyway I'll give it 5/10, it's almost below average. (The previous one I gave a 3/10.)Here's my video to prove the game's supernatural AI:

												The name says it all. And if you haven't heard about the 'headshot' yet, well watch some videos. Sniper: Ghost Warrior can be seen as an average game but with a nice twist, as I said before I am profound of the 'killcam' where you will following the bullet and see in detail how you killed your opponent.I do advise the game if you are into sniping otherwise this will (obviously) be a huge dissappointment. And, ofcourse, if you like to see how your shot made it to its destination.What I do not advise is to buy this game in a different language then English. I first owned the game in German and it is completely out of sync which is very VERY annoying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sniper: Ghost Warrior is probably one of the worst games I've ever played. The leveldesign is linear, you don't have much freedom. The shooting mechanics are absolutely terrible. Pistols have no recoil, snipers have no recoil, rifles have extreme amounts of recoil. It feels weird. The difficulty is completely weird as well. Sometimes, it's extremely hard, sometimes, rushing through levels with your secondary just running and gunning everybody down is the easiest way to finish something. I only played the first act and this game did not even show me a single reason to play it further - because guess what - the story is unappealing as hell as well and therefore can't compensate for the poor gameplay which would've been the only hope for this game.

ter·ri·bleadjective- extremely or distressingly bad or serious.- extremely unpleasant or disagreeable.- used to emphasize the extent of something unpleasant or bad.That sums up this game pretty well.So I launch the game, video and menu background are grey as well as upside down. Reading up on the issue, it has been reported as a Windows 8 problem. Nothing has been done.Started the game. First mission. NPC buddy tells me ""You are good to go!"".2 seconds later I got shot at and killed as I was never good to go in the first place.Quitting the game works very well and is fast to execute.Steer clear of this trash.(Please note that I almost never write negative reviews, so this game is indeed terrible.)

I tried to fix to FOV with config but with no success. It seems like the developer's don't care either. Clearly this game should of never been released on PC, it's like releasing a car without a front windscreen.			",100,7,0,11,4,1,4

												I have only played this game in ""single player mode"", but thus far I have enjoyed the game rather much.  I have had a couple of ""odd""  game freezes ""in game"" but nothing persistent.   The game  is ""forgiving"" so as long as you make a game save now and then then you can always load the game again,  and anyway if you gets ""killed"" then the game lets you start again by itself to try again.  A must however is to have a ""controller"" (or game pad) to play this game as it is the only right way to play the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Same lines as sniper elite.  I would wait for a sale before picking this one up but sniping in it is really cool.

Sniper: Ghost Warrior is probably one of the worst games I've ever played. The leveldesign is linear, you don't have much freedom. The shooting mechanics are absolutely terrible. Pistols have no recoil, snipers have no recoil, rifles have extreme amounts of recoil. It feels weird. The difficulty is completely weird as well. Sometimes, it's extremely hard, sometimes, rushing through levels with your secondary just running and gunning everybody down is the easiest way to finish something. I only played the first act and this game did not even show me a single reason to play it further - because guess what - the story is unappealing as hell as well and therefore can't compensate for the poor gameplay which would've been the only hope for this game.

												Alright, I’m here to answer some questions you may thinking to yourself. Is it worth buying it? Is this game fun?Beaware of some of it might be spoiler alert.Personally so far I think this is the best game CI Games have produced. As a sniper-enthusiast I look for pros and cons with this game. I have already in advance completed this game on the Xbox 360 a long time ago, and to be honest I felt more connected into the game, and more sort a say “Alive” on the PC version. Here are some reasons why.1. With a decent good computer specifications, you can get amazing sniper experience. The graphics are stunning. As you would expect from the CryEngine. But It’s not quite the same visual quality as the Crysis games. Some areas look really nice, but others less so. Here is a screenshot captured by me in-game: http://imgur.com/IEv5urm Cut-scenes graphics are a bit poor, huge improvement can be done there, example: http://imgur.com/EpkAOPSI achieved much better fps after careful tweaking (Tip: Put “Object Detail” on low for massive fps boost and next to no quality loss).2. Having a headphone on you with Surround Sound makes you feel more realistic. I have tested it with speakers (Surround Sound), and I didn’t get nearly the same experience.3. I would recommend you to play it with a Xbox 360 controller on the PC version - (If it’s possible). Sniper Ghost Warrior it’s actually a more of a console type of game when it comes to controllers. Kinda like GTA V, The Witcher 3, and the Call of Duty franchise. And I’m not saying it because I played the game first with a Xbox 360, but the whole movement with a mouse and keyboard makes it feel weird compared to a smoother version with a controller. Controls are ok, but feel a bit clunky and are unresponsive in some contexts.4. Something I wasn’t aware of when I first played this game on the 360 console. I bought all of the DLC’s on the PC version, and I recognized the DLC called: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2: Digital Extras.The Special Edition Includes SOUNDTRACK - An official Soundtrack from the game’s musical score. It’s a nice soundtrack and has a nice beat to it in a close danger situation or a sticky situation. Your heart starts to beat a bit more and you get a little bit of the adrenaline kick. I think that’s a huge deal when it comes to sniper games.Sidenote: I think that Michał Cielecki did a amazing job with the soundtracks. I really feel excited when I hear his soundtracks. I’m looking forward to see if he have any soundtracks to the Sniper Ghost Warrior 3. https://soundcloud.com/michal-cieleckiGenerally about the game:It’s a good non-AAA game that provides a stealth and sniping experience. Presentation and writing are a bit clichéd, but I was already expecting this. Otherwise, the story is not bad at all. Levels are very linear and heavily scripted. You are guided by your commander who stays at your side most of the time. This provides good immersion and manages to convey the sense of working as a team.Cons/Improvements:I’m not going to cover every specific detail about this game, but I’m going to cover some of it.The scripting is fairly basic and lacks some polish. There were various issues. My AI was a bit unreliable when we went stealth mode - Here is actually a great example that I captured: http://imgur.com/D3hmFA6 On the picture you can see we were inside the tunnels in Bosnia Sarajevo. My teammate (Maddox) alerted me to hide because there were troops coming towards us. For some weird reason Maddox didn’t do anything (obviously he glitched out). After of certain of time Maddox starts yelling “♥♥♥♥! Run!!” when the guards are right in front of him. I had to restart my mission, because we were basically ♥♥♥♥ed when they had 10 guards pointing at us and firing. Lucky for me the checkpoint was right outside the tunnel. So I wasn’t needed to process the whole scenery (Before we went inside the tunnel again).Sometimes when you got the order/mission from either your teammate or your commander to go backstabbing a guard. You could just literally run behind him and make a lot of footsteps without him recognize anything. Seems like these guards are partly death at some areas. They only recognized you if they saw you and if you shoot. Hearing running footsteps and other small details like reloading a gun was not intended apparently.Dialogue were cutting off sometimes when you reached checkpoints.A few times my character would confirm over radio that I had the target in my sight, but the target was no where to be seen on my screen. The checkpoint save system has the usual irritations associated with such a system. Checkpoints was not reloading correctly.If you run down some stairs you just start floating a little bit above it instead of actually running on top of it. Kinda annoying effect http://imgur.com/sEyedLj. I also don’t like on the scene ""Burning Bridges"" (Act 3 - Mission 2) when you have to run from the temple and your stamina ends so often/quickly. Just like this: http://imgur.com/enuIHwO. I can understand that in reality it’s heavy carrying a sniper rifle around, but it’s kinda silly how Anderson survived there. In my opinion City Interactive could twisted this situation with other solutions.The simulation of wind on bullets feels artificial because the wind speed is not effectively reflected in the environment - vegetation does not respond accordingly and there are no other indicators like the sound of wind or moving dust etc. The displayed distances seem to be fake - an ingame distance of 400 meters is actually closer to 200 meters. http://imgur.com/IEv5urmBackdraw: If you just realized Sniper Ghost Warrior recently, I think you are going to be a bit disappointed in this game. Reason being is this game was released on March 12, 2013 in North America, March 15, 2013 in Europe and March 19, 2013 in Australia. They used not a old game engine to develop this game. But the singleplayer content is a bit slim compared to other games that are released in 2016. The game will approximately last 5 hours ish of gameplay. If you don’t care about these details that happens every now and then, and you are more into the main storyline in this game, I would recommend it. Be sure to follow some recommendations above to make this game even more enjoyable and I had very modest expectations, and it satisfied them. Get it when on sale.Rating:From 1-10.

												I love sniper games and have every one that I have been able to find and while this is not the worst that I have played, it is no where near the best either. It looks pretty good, but the monotonous voice acting of the sniper is annoying. Is he not the same guy that voiced the boring lead in Alpha Protocol? And as for the enemy AI, don't get me started! I have a sniper rifle, they have standard issue assault rifles, yet if I twitch they can spot and shoot me with unerring accuracy from 500 metres away. Not to mention the fact that they appear out of nowhere, without warning in a spot that was empty only a second previously!That said, I have just finished my third playthrough and, despite the games many flaws,(including my reward for completing it all being just ;THE END') there is still a great deal of satisfaction to be gained from whacking the bad guys from far away and following your bullet to target in slow motion.Would I recommend it? Cheap in a sale, why not? It's better and prettier than the original Sniper Elite anyway :)			",215,46,1,38,85,3,141

												This game was only average - 6/10 at best when it was released.  It hasn't aged well, and the things that were annoying about it 6 years ago are only magnified in this age.While a million miles better than CI Games previous effort at the genre - the woeful Sniper Art of Victory - it still falls short of a pleasant FPS experience.  The somewhat satisfying sniping elements are held back by an AI that doesn't know if it's on God mode or stormtrooper mode, while the infantry parts of the game are held back by the fundamentally broken assault rifles that the game gives those characters.AI can detect you seemingly for no reason as you are in cover, they can sometimes care if you kill their buddies 5 feet away and otherwise not.  At one point I took a break from a mission to shoot birds with an unsilanced rifle, then when I carried on realised there had been a 3 man patrol not 30 feet away that was still in ""oblivious"" mode.The feeling of achievement of pulling off a hit with your rifle, taking into account bullet drop due to gravity and wind direction is cheapend somewhat when your enemies can hit you with pinpoint precision using their assault rifles at the same distance.  These are the same assault rifles you will struggle to use, as the kick and spread is extreme to the point of uselessness.Manual saving is encouraged with this game, the chekpoints aren't always in places you would expect and can indeed just put you into a loop of spawn-die-spawn-die.At least CI Games paid for some proper voice talent this time round - but the story they are telling is very cliche.You'll have more fun with Sniper Elite 2 if you want to play a sniper game- I promise you.

												This is actually a better game than the hideously walled-in, super linear ride of SGW2. Crank the difficulty up and enjoy a pleasant, suspenseful game with some AI flaws that can be overlooked, considering the fact that it's been bundled to death and costs less than a tenner with no discounts.

												I hesitated for a veeery long time, due to all those negative reviews :I was looking for a game that would go into real sniper tactics, spirit, etc...And DAMN?  when i first played it, i realised it was the jewel we, realism afficionados, were looking for :In this game, no rush, nos ""CS:GO"" unrealistic BS : in this game, you actually have to THINK, and this is why so many kids are giving this sniper game a negative review !And for the graphics, they are really more than correct : The whole jungle seems to live, in CRYSIS, for exemple, there is almost no vegetation elements moving with wind, a feature which is excellent in SNIPER !If u wanna rush like a dummy and rush-knife 15 enemies, well...just go play CS, because here we got a real SNIPER game!Now buy it, you wont regret if you are looking for a realistic sniper adventure !

Oh no an alarm went off, mission failed,  oh no I walked to far to the right, MISSION FAILED.  As a gamer Id rather have fun and shoot everyone, but the devs dont allow it. There should be a steam category for ""NO FUN ALLOWED"", with this game at the top of the list. Rating: 0/10 Value: $0.00  (Biggest peev is the darth vader breathing that is on ALL THE TIME!)

												I know a lot of people say this game is bad and buggy and it's fairly old, but I would reccomend it. The graphics and bugs are pretty bad. More than half of the enemies start running against a wall half the time and won't stop unless you shoot them. Also, you can put your gun and arm through almost anything, including trees and buildings. But, the gameplay is really good. The game is a lot like Sniper Elite, including that you can slow everything down to control your breathing, and there's a red dot below the crosshair you have to aim for, and that it zooms in on a lot of kills. It's also not all sniping. There is a lot of missions where you'll have assault rifles and no snipers. But the point of the game is all about just killing enemies, it's about being stealth and then taking perfect shots while hidden. There's also a lot of cutscenes and story. It's not the best game ever, especially because of the bugs, but for 8 dollars, it's worth it.			",117,8,1,6,13,0,7

												I don't recommend this game as it feels like I am simply playing Call of Duty, it doesn't feel like a sniper-specific game. It forces you to change roles between a sniper and a random soldier with a loud machine gun. This game tries to promote a stealthy approach but contradicts itself when in the first mission your spotter pulls out a machine gun and begins to fire, giving away your position. Overall, the game gives off the feel of a cheap, quickly made fps with no skill involved in it.			",55,8,3,3,6,0,1

												I have just finished the main campaign and I really enjoyed the game. I thought the graphics were great for a slightly older game, it ran very smoothly and I also liked the audio that gave a constant feeling of tension (though it did get a bit repetitive).The sniping action was extremely satisfying - getting a headshot from 150m away and seeing the slowmo kill cam was truly gratifying and made me want to yell out ""HEADSHOT"" ala Unreal Tournament lol! I think I may have done that a few times :pOne aspect that i didn't like though was that you did not always play a sniper. Most of the time you were Razor 6-4, the sniper and that was great but sometimes you'd switch to playing the ground team Delta-3 who are using close quarters assault rifles and this is a very different style of gameplay which can be quite annoying. There were only 2 of these that I remember though and the rest of the game makes up for it.I bought this game in a bundle for around $1 but it is definitely worth more. Loved it. Looking forward to playing number 2.			",771,394,20,107,154,11,175

												Don't even bother with this. Just buy Ghost Warrior 2.So, let me sum up this game for you. Ignore my playtime by the way.1. The game UI is not even 1080p. It is probably rendered in like 1600x900 and then upscaled to match the 1920x1080 res, which makes it look blurry.2. The in-game lighting is simply bad. The screenshot in the store page simply don't show you how bad it is. Shadows are pitch black and the light of the sun makes surfaces look bright as hell. It makes for a really terrible image with all the vegetation shadows around.  3. Since I mentioned vegetation, the grass and trees clip into the player's hands and weapons. It breaks the already poor ""immersion"".4. Voice acting is comparable to 12 year old narrators for Youtube Nerf battles.5. Lip syncing is basically their jaw moving up and down when they talk with an extra 1 second delay.6. If you dare to miss a shot, the enemies will point their guns at you no matter how far or how well hidden you may be.7. No story at all. A poor female voice actor before a mission telling you who your target is, and a poor cutscene in the level with bad voice acting. There isn't even a proper game ending. 8. By the way the in-game V-sync does not work. You gotta force it with MSI Afterburner or your GPU's control software.			",98,7,2,5,5,0,5

												It looks promising in the beginning, with decent graphics and bullet camera for kills. But, after a while, you realize that, except when you have a sniper, the rest of the game reminds on weaker version of ""Call of duty"". Also the game is glitchy, freedom of sniping locations and hidings are limited, you don't have sniper all the time (that feels somehow lame), AI is 100% precise (I mean, it is ok to be challenging, but to never miss really ruins the mood). Overall, it had a potential, but I think it failed.			",633,182,20,104,58,6,121

												I was originally finding at least some fun in this game at the start, so my orinigal review, despite being more of a ""meh"" kind of situation, was going to be positive. That said, having finished the game in just over 4 hours and 30 minutes (Steam claims 6, but that's likely due to leaving the game running while doing other things away from my computer) and finding merit in the complaints of others, I think a negative mark would suffice.The AI can genuinely range from dumber than a sack of hammers to eagle-eyed geniouses, and they are indeed somehow more accurate with hipfire than the player can be while looking down the scope/iron sights of their rifle. While I somewhat appreciated the change of pace from sneeki breeki sniping to run-and-gun action, I'm left scratching my head as to why the latter was even added in a game that, if you were to go by the title alone, would/should be about sniping and stealth. And on that note, the sniping isn't even satisfying! How do you mess that up?I had hoped to go through the ""Unfinished Business"" storyline after completing this game, but now I'm not so sure it would be wise to do so, even with the supposed ""revamped AI."" All I can say is I'm glad I bought this on sale in a bundle, so now that I can honestly say I've played this, I can now move on to the (hopefully superior) sequel.			",96,12,6,20,11,1,13

												Mostly awful, glitchy, frustrating, uninspired game. The sniping parts can be fun, but some enemies spot you from a huge distance while you're in total stealth mode, and some of those enemies pretty much instakill you. The non-sniper parts are downright awful most of the time, with an iron sigt that blocks most of the view, and a muzzle flame that covers anything not already blocked by the sight - making it almost impossible to actually hit anything. Really cheap sound effects. Music is pretty decent, but looped very clumsily and reused ad nauseam.TL;DR: Do not waste your money on this!			",189,49,1,11,10,0,12

												Base gameplay isn't fun.  The AI is so basic that they snap to you and have nearly perfect accuracy while your dudes cannot hit anything and its surprising when they do manage to kill a guy. Besides that the controls for actually shooting suck and the recoil impulse on the assault rifles is terrible.The stealth mechanics suck. All it takes is getting spotted and the guy will instantly begin shooting you. It only manages to frustrate. This is a literal whole game of that stealth mission in any FPS game out there but worse.The actual sniping is sorta fun, but the game is so basic that sniping idiot scripted AI isn't much fun for very long. The maps are so small and everything is so scripted that you have no real input outside of doing what your supposed to or just failing. It dousn't feel like a real sniping game, just feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcade shooter made in eastern europe. The maps are so small and the stealth so lame that I often just ran into guys or got shot from a random direction and failed. Its just not fun.Its just really boring and I have no interest in playing it anymore. Gave it a chance because it looked cool, but its just a whole game of that sniper mission from COD4 except made made cheaper and based in the jungle.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

Yes.Thats right.17 minutes..26 hours; yes, not even a full half hour.This game is just terrible.The gameplay ,banal as it may be, is on par with some of those FPS games based off of movies that look like they were created by a bunch of dudes in a basement (sorry PR devs).The functionality and playability; however, is just deplorable. I played the actual game for ~5 minutes, once I found a way to get it to lauch properly. Let me regail you all with a story.            Once upon a time there was a man who had seen a game that looked good and was on sale. The man goes out and buys a Steam card to purchase said game, he even went and picked up a slightly better graphics card. He comes home to his wife and children, they are awaiting his return eagerly. He picks up his daughter and messes up his sons hair, then he kisses his wife. He was so excited to finally get a new game to play in his free time.            He goes onto the Steam store, and there he sees it. Sniper: Ghost Warrior. He adds it to his cart and checks out. He was amazed at the download speed, for surely a good FPS would not be such a blazing download. This was the first flag.The man, with hope still flowing out of his heart like the river Isen into Isengard, presses the ""Play"" button and waits.1 minute and the game had not loaded. He thought that it was just the game having that 1st boot-up speed.He was wrong.5 minutes in and the game still had not loaded. He began to wonder if the game was going to load at all.7 minutes in and the game had crashed. At this point the man was becoming upset, so he went to bed and left the game to be dealt with another day.Weeks and months pass without a second of the mans play time spent on this game, the game had become a shelf-sitter. One day, the man decided to try to play the game again. He pressed ""Play"" and the game actually booted! The man was ecstatic! The game for which he had been hyped for so long ago was finally working!!Thats when it happened. The game introduced the man into a well sculpted world, with enemies speaking in foreign tongues and sniper rifles with scrim all around them. It was, for a short time, beautiful. The man eagerly got into a firefight, and then the worst thing happened. The mechanics were broken; hit detection, scoped accuracy, sound suppression, stealth mechanics and everything about the game. As he was sniping the skrubs like a boss, the man was shot; much like what would happen if one man was trying to take on 100+ enemies. The game crashed.The man was furious that after so long, and so much hype, the game still would not function.The man later became very depressed; took up drinking and smoking. His wife later divorced him and took the children into her custody.The man lost his house and his job.All of this simply because this game is so broken. Made a man get divorced, lose his children, his house, and his dog.10/10 Manic Depression Simulator 2010.			",72,1,0,9,5,0,11

												This game presents to you an amazing, economic opportunity. If you'd like to save yourself $20 (!!!), simply punch yourself in the nads and/or slap your head repeatedly against a wall. Otherwise, you'd normally get the same experience by buying this game!			",93,55,1,4,2,0,6

												I hate when the AI glitches in spots that are supposed to be 100% stealth.  They see you and always kill you.  (stealth part at a bridge where you go into the water below.  They see you, they kill you.  It's a glitch, it's not supposed to work that way.  But everything, including restarting the level, does NOT fix the glitch.  You die.)  God mode is the only way to get past such glitches.  I've played the game a number of times (speed runs), and I've seen non-progress glitches happen at least twice.  One time, even restarting the level did not fix it.  Only God Mode saved the day.  It's a mediocre but okay game, but the glitches make it a ""not recommend"".  Worth playing for a few of the stealth missions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was originally finding at least some fun in this game at the start, so my orinigal review, despite being more of a ""meh"" kind of situation, was going to be positive. That said, having finished the game in just over 4 hours and 30 minutes (Steam claims 6, but that's likely due to leaving the game running while doing other things away from my computer) and finding merit in the complaints of others, I think a negative mark would suffice.The AI can genuinely range from dumber than a sack of hammers to eagle-eyed geniouses, and they are indeed somehow more accurate with hipfire than the player can be while looking down the scope/iron sights of their rifle. While I somewhat appreciated the change of pace from sneeki breeki sniping to run-and-gun action, I'm left scratching my head as to why the latter was even added in a game that, if you were to go by the title alone, would/should be about sniping and stealth. And on that note, the sniping isn't even satisfying! How do you mess that up?I had hoped to go through the ""Unfinished Business"" storyline after completing this game, but now I'm not so sure it would be wise to do so, even with the supposed ""revamped AI."" All I can say is I'm glad I bought this on sale in a bundle, so now that I can honestly say I've played this, I can now move on to the (hopefully superior) sequel.			",96,12,6,20,11,1,13

												Base gameplay isn't fun.  The AI is so basic that they snap to you and have nearly perfect accuracy while your dudes cannot hit anything and its surprising when they do manage to kill a guy. Besides that the controls for actually shooting suck and the recoil impulse on the assault rifles is terrible.The stealth mechanics suck. All it takes is getting spotted and the guy will instantly begin shooting you. It only manages to frustrate. This is a literal whole game of that stealth mission in any FPS game out there but worse.The actual sniping is sorta fun, but the game is so basic that sniping idiot scripted AI isn't much fun for very long. The maps are so small and everything is so scripted that you have no real input outside of doing what your supposed to or just failing. It dousn't feel like a real sniping game, just feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcade shooter made in eastern europe. The maps are so small and the stealth so lame that I often just ran into guys or got shot from a random direction and failed. Its just not fun.Its just really boring and I have no interest in playing it anymore. Gave it a chance because it looked cool, but its just a whole game of that sniper mission from COD4 except made made cheaper and based in the jungle.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												If this were a sniper sim focusing on realism this would be the best sim ever. But this is NOT a sniper sim is it now? This is a game, so I foolishly think a game has to be FUN as well as being whatever you wana call it, in this case realistic: You have to take wind direction into account when you aim... Realistic? yes but this ""realistic feature"" replaces the fun factor with un-necessary stress... I mean I just want to shoot pixels, not want to train to be a cold-blooded killer... where is the fun in that? Geez...Consider this one a neutral review.			",197,62,4,24,1,3,11

												One of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest games I've ever played.  Campaign is filled with tedious stealth sections and ""do exactly this or fail instantly"" events, teammate AI is practically nonexistent, enemies have perfect accuracy at any distance, and the weapons that aren't sniper rifles can barely hit anything.Story does nothing to compensate.  It's so unengaging that I didn't realise at first when it switched perspective to another soldier.  It's a pure excuse plot with nothing interesting or memorable.Sniper: Ghost Warrior is not fun to play.  It's not even good for a laugh.  It's just plain bad.  Avoid.			",1729,734,50,228,197,18,258

												TLDR:  Good game, good gameplay, decent challenge, runs solid with no performance issues.  At the time this came out, it was the first good sniper game in a long time.  It is worth picking up today on a discount if you are looking for a good shooter that allows you to be a little slower paced & strategic while scratching that sniper itch.The game is not about run & gun, and while occasionally you get spotted & have to ""OH SH*T"" your way out of things a bit with guns-a-blazing, the main method for maneuvering through this game is via the art of stealth.  It actually makes you TRY to act like a sniper.  You will benefit greatly from things like cover, and careful movements that reduce noise, while devising the optimal method by which to complete your mission.  And whether you choose to take out all your enemies one by one, or perhaps instead to move stealthily around them without killing a single one, you will find some challenge to it either way.Something this game gets absolutely right and does very well is the ballistics.  The manner in which your bullet trajectory will be altered once it is fired, and how things like wind, gravity, distance, and objects will affect the path of the bullet on the way to it's target, or the impact it makes once it hits.  One recommendation however, is that you should play the game on ""HARD"" mode.  The ""EASY"" & ""NORMAL"" modes are virtually the same, and they both provide an ""aim assist"" function that basically puts a little circle on the screen that tells you exactly where your bullet will hit regardless of conditions.  This is still fun to play as you get the ""thrll of the kill"" just the same, but it makes the game a little too easy.If you play in HARD mode, it will remove the ""aim-assist"" function, and you will have to calculate the trajectory of the bullet yourself by reading the wind speed & gauge the distance to your target, etc.  It is not really that hard to do, but it provides for a GREAT challenge, and REALLY elevates the excitement and interest in the game.  It's a fun feeling when you're really sweating it out over having to make this ONE shot on a high-value target really count, and missing could be the end of YOU instead.  But it's an AWESOME feeling when you put a bullet through that enemy sniper's scope at 1100 yards in high wind, and you did it all by your own calculations!The game has a decent storyline that isn't too shocking, but has a few plot twists here & there.  Enough at least to push the missions forward with a decent amount of variety, and without getting boring or repetitive.  You might not get heavily invested into any of the characters, but that's not really what you're here for anyway.  Even still there are a few moments of satisfaction when you see a few particular guys get what's coming to them.There are a few moments where the AI is a bit... let's see... I believe ""special"" is the PC term nowadays, right?  Ya, sometimes, the AI will have their comrade slump to the deck with a hole in his chest a mere 10 feet away and not notice it, but then other times you take out a guy 50 yards away from another and he'll see it happen & hit the alarm.  It's a bit annoying, but you'll eventually get the feel for it and shouldn't have much trouble if you play it smart & be patient.  There's ALWAYS a perfect opportunity.Not much happening in the multiplayer nowadays, but that's to be expected with this being such an old game.  It's still fun however if you can fire it up with a few buddies & take turns rag-dolling each other.Overall I'd have given this game an 8/10 when it first came out.  Nowadays there ARE better options, so I'd say 7/10 overall now.  Still, very much worth the buy when you can have it on the cheap nowadays with it always being on sale.ONE LAST WARNING:  You might be tempted to purchase ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2"" either along with or instead of this one.  I will say that while the second installment in the series is far better in the graphics department, it is TERRIBLE in the reliability department.  I suggest you read the reviews on all the bugs & issues with that game before making your purchase.			",714,74,45,65,47,6,84

												Think to many spoiled CoD babies reviewed this game thinking they could snipe like in cod lol. To enjoy this game you need patients and use the quck save button often.  You throw an alarm you are f**ked nuff said even on easy. Take your time and you will enjoy this game. I got it from a bundle so no money wasted it was worth every penny. I recommend this game if you like playing stealth games and sniping games that take patients. It's not really a fast paced shooter. Don't bother if you are afraid to fail on first 2nd or maybe even 3rd attempt at a situation. If you give up easily on games or have a short fuse, this is not for you. meta 55? No I'd give a meta 70 atleast.Edit I came accross this later on  here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper:_Ghost_Warrior I qoute it: ""gamers with extreme patience and a passion for sniper rifles might enjoy themselves."" So it pretty much backs my previous statment on patients is needed. I thought some parrts waa to easy but I'm a very very patient person thats willing to wait for a perfect shot. I actually wanted to enroll into military in my teen year to become a sniper but unfortunetly even I knew my eye sight would have probably never landed me as such so i never pursued it. This game lets me enjoy that dream even with 20/30 vision lol			",328,34,12,43,15,0,54

												The graphics are pretty decent and it's definitely cool making sniper kills, but somehow I feel like the title is misleading. There are a lot of awful close combat run-and-gun moments, and with the assault rifles having bad recoil which makes it hard to control. Additionally, the game is difficult with AI being able to detect you from far away. Story is very generic.			",859,168,54,73,40,5,93

												Mostly awful, glitchy, frustrating, uninspired game. The sniping parts can be fun, but some enemies spot you from a huge distance while you're in total stealth mode, and some of those enemies pretty much instakill you. The non-sniper parts are downright awful most of the time, with an iron sigt that blocks most of the view, and a muzzle flame that covers anything not already blocked by the sight - making it almost impossible to actually hit anything. Really cheap sound effects. Music is pretty decent, but looped very clumsily and reused ad nauseam.TL;DR: Do not waste your money on this!			",189,49,1,11,10,0,12

Yes.Thats right.17 minutes..26 hours; yes, not even a full half hour.This game is just terrible.The gameplay ,banal as it may be, is on par with some of those FPS games based off of movies that look like they were created by a bunch of dudes in a basement (sorry PR devs).The functionality and playability; however, is just deplorable. I played the actual game for ~5 minutes, once I found a way to get it to lauch properly. Let me regail you all with a story.            Once upon a time there was a man who had seen a game that looked good and was on sale. The man goes out and buys a Steam card to purchase said game, he even went and picked up a slightly better graphics card. He comes home to his wife and children, they are awaiting his return eagerly. He picks up his daughter and messes up his sons hair, then he kisses his wife. He was so excited to finally get a new game to play in his free time.            He goes onto the Steam store, and there he sees it. Sniper: Ghost Warrior. He adds it to his cart and checks out. He was amazed at the download speed, for surely a good FPS would not be such a blazing download. This was the first flag.The man, with hope still flowing out of his heart like the river Isen into Isengard, presses the ""Play"" button and waits.1 minute and the game had not loaded. He thought that it was just the game having that 1st boot-up speed.He was wrong.5 minutes in and the game still had not loaded. He began to wonder if the game was going to load at all.7 minutes in and the game had crashed. At this point the man was becoming upset, so he went to bed and left the game to be dealt with another day.Weeks and months pass without a second of the mans play time spent on this game, the game had become a shelf-sitter. One day, the man decided to try to play the game again. He pressed ""Play"" and the game actually booted! The man was ecstatic! The game for which he had been hyped for so long ago was finally working!!Thats when it happened. The game introduced the man into a well sculpted world, with enemies speaking in foreign tongues and sniper rifles with scrim all around them. It was, for a short time, beautiful. The man eagerly got into a firefight, and then the worst thing happened. The mechanics were broken; hit detection, scoped accuracy, sound suppression, stealth mechanics and everything about the game. As he was sniping the skrubs like a boss, the man was shot; much like what would happen if one man was trying to take on 100+ enemies. The game crashed.The man was furious that after so long, and so much hype, the game still would not function.The man later became very depressed; took up drinking and smoking. His wife later divorced him and took the children into her custody.The man lost his house and his job.All of this simply because this game is so broken. Made a man get divorced, lose his children, his house, and his dog.10/10 Manic Depression Simulator 2010.			",72,1,0,9,5,0,11

												One of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest games I've ever played.  Campaign is filled with tedious stealth sections and ""do exactly this or fail instantly"" events, teammate AI is practically nonexistent, enemies have perfect accuracy at any distance, and the weapons that aren't sniper rifles can barely hit anything.Story does nothing to compensate.  It's so unengaging that I didn't realise at first when it switched perspective to another soldier.  It's a pure excuse plot with nothing interesting or memorable.Sniper: Ghost Warrior is not fun to play.  It's not even good for a laugh.  It's just plain bad.  Avoid.			",1729,734,50,228,197,18,258

												While I can recommend Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 when it's on sale for less than few €, I can't really say the same about this.This isn't worth anything. Dude can hit you with assault rifles over 500m distance with no problems, your AI teammates are idiots, enemies can see you through foliage, have hive-mind AI and often get ""holy protection"" from invisible walls when you're shooting them.I don't usually write reviews on games that I played for less than 1 hour, but hot damn this game is bad I can't even force myself to ignore some of it's flaws hoping for some better stuff to come later in the gameplay.Don't buy it.

												1 I not a kind of a pro FPS game as much, and i'm not a real soldier, but I know that M4 in assault mission is not gonna hard to shoot like a marksman like this, you know, as a time I play Call of duty 4 or watch Medal of Honor and Battlefield from youtube that assault rifle is f**king easy to arm, fire and hit the target at no further than 100 meter, but why this game is so f**king hard to fire and hit, if I don't see the rifle model I must gonna think ""What Delta three using is a AK 74"" ( I'm not a soldier, but I watch alot of military tactical from youtube and this M4 is not like what M4 I know before).2 I just play a normal difficulty, but why the hell is the enemy (not the sniper) in this game is got a very f**king good eyes in the stealth mission before alert, if they have that good eyes at the time after alert is good, because is like they know we come, but why the hell do they got that godd*mn good f**king eyes before they alert, is makes no sense.3 Good to see the physics of the bullet, that the good one.

												Don't even buy it on sale. Total♥♥♥♥♥♥ When you're not playing a sniper that is literally invisible to enemies, you are playing as a soldier with an M4 that has a recoil out of this world. The enemy guerilla fighters are literally super human as they headshot you hipfiring an AK from 200 yards away as you're prone on top of a hill.It's one of those games where it is only challenging because of dumb gameplay mechanics.

												This game was best when it first came out. I have great memories of multiplayer matches in the first few days after release when no one realized yet that the radar shows you exactly where your enemies are.Let me explain. This game does a fantastic job at making you invisible with camouflage. Its the best I've ever seen in a game. You blend in with your environment like crazy and I had several occassions where a player in multiplayer would stand right in front of me (sitting in a bush) and still not see me. Thats what made these first few days so great. You would sit in your sniper spot on a big map and try to find other, super camouflaged snipers and try to shoot them. The matches were intense and interesting. Soon it became apparent that you have a radar that shows you where your enemies are. The dev said this is to prevent camping. For real? This is a sniper game!The singleplayer missions are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. A mix between bad stealth missions and just a tad too much narrative when it comes to the interesting sniper bits. The multiplayer would be insanely great if that damn radar was removed. Im serious. If you didn't know where your enemies are in multiplayer this would probably be my most played game. This isn't about wanting to be a camper or whatever. Get a few friends to play this game and agree with everyone to not use the radar (hang a piece of paper over it -  yes I know...) and you will see what I mean.I'm giving this a thumbs up because I haven't seen another sniper game yet that makes you blend in with your enviroment like this one does. However I wish the devs would have gone a different direction with the multiplayer. What a wasted oppurtunity!			",109,12,4,6,7,0,22

												TLDR:  Good game, good gameplay, decent challenge, runs solid with no performance issues.  At the time this came out, it was the first good sniper game in a long time.  It is worth picking up today on a discount if you are looking for a good shooter that allows you to be a little slower paced & strategic while scratching that sniper itch.The game is not about run & gun, and while occasionally you get spotted & have to ""OH SH*T"" your way out of things a bit with guns-a-blazing, the main method for maneuvering through this game is via the art of stealth.  It actually makes you TRY to act like a sniper.  You will benefit greatly from things like cover, and careful movements that reduce noise, while devising the optimal method by which to complete your mission.  And whether you choose to take out all your enemies one by one, or perhaps instead to move stealthily around them without killing a single one, you will find some challenge to it either way.Something this game gets absolutely right and does very well is the ballistics.  The manner in which your bullet trajectory will be altered once it is fired, and how things like wind, gravity, distance, and objects will affect the path of the bullet on the way to it's target, or the impact it makes once it hits.  One recommendation however, is that you should play the game on ""HARD"" mode.  The ""EASY"" & ""NORMAL"" modes are virtually the same, and they both provide an ""aim assist"" function that basically puts a little circle on the screen that tells you exactly where your bullet will hit regardless of conditions.  This is still fun to play as you get the ""thrll of the kill"" just the same, but it makes the game a little too easy.If you play in HARD mode, it will remove the ""aim-assist"" function, and you will have to calculate the trajectory of the bullet yourself by reading the wind speed & gauge the distance to your target, etc.  It is not really that hard to do, but it provides for a GREAT challenge, and REALLY elevates the excitement and interest in the game.  It's a fun feeling when you're really sweating it out over having to make this ONE shot on a high-value target really count, and missing could be the end of YOU instead.  But it's an AWESOME feeling when you put a bullet through that enemy sniper's scope at 1100 yards in high wind, and you did it all by your own calculations!The game has a decent storyline that isn't too shocking, but has a few plot twists here & there.  Enough at least to push the missions forward with a decent amount of variety, and without getting boring or repetitive.  You might not get heavily invested into any of the characters, but that's not really what you're here for anyway.  Even still there are a few moments of satisfaction when you see a few particular guys get what's coming to them.There are a few moments where the AI is a bit... let's see... I believe ""special"" is the PC term nowadays, right?  Ya, sometimes, the AI will have their comrade slump to the deck with a hole in his chest a mere 10 feet away and not notice it, but then other times you take out a guy 50 yards away from another and he'll see it happen & hit the alarm.  It's a bit annoying, but you'll eventually get the feel for it and shouldn't have much trouble if you play it smart & be patient.  There's ALWAYS a perfect opportunity.Not much happening in the multiplayer nowadays, but that's to be expected with this being such an old game.  It's still fun however if you can fire it up with a few buddies & take turns rag-dolling each other.Overall I'd have given this game an 8/10 when it first came out.  Nowadays there ARE better options, so I'd say 7/10 overall now.  Still, very much worth the buy when you can have it on the cheap nowadays with it always being on sale.ONE LAST WARNING:  You might be tempted to purchase ""Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2"" either along with or instead of this one.  I will say that while the second installment in the series is far better in the graphics department, it is TERRIBLE in the reliability department.  I suggest you read the reviews on all the bugs & issues with that game before making your purchase.			",714,74,45,65,47,6,84

												I might only have 14 minutes of gameplay, but that's all i need.I might not be the  best sniper whatsoever or the best at FPS, but this was just pain...I start out with EXTREMELY high sensitivity, and to fix that i had to manually lower my mice DPI. In-game sensitivity did little or nothing and only benefited the main screen.Going into the game, it was so weird for me to control the rifle. If i was dead still in like any other FPS, i would have very great accuracy, and even if i was sniping IRL and was dead still, i would barely flinch or move at all while aiming down with the rifle.If i was still - dead still it felt like it was a pain to aim the rile because i just kept moving even at a laying down position.AI is just, ugh.I shoot a person at the wrong time, i got 20 people with machineguns scoping me down and aimlocking me with perfect accuracy.If I misshoot one time, i'm dead and i'll have to restart AGAIN due to the 100% AI Accuracy with no Recoil / Flinching.After failing a couple times on the first episode, I wanted to go online, but even when it said there were matches nearby, i still couldn't connect. Its whatever thoughSo in conclusion, it was very hard for me to progress and play through this game as a casual FPS player. I know ragequitting at level 1 seems stupid but I could't go farther, it just got me to ragequit when i didn't know what to do.			",416,101,16,35,36,4,26

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior is a decent sniper game with nice graphics. However(!), it's hard to ignore all the bugs in the game such as you can't go up small stairs unless you run for it, weirdly placed invisible walls, enemies that ignore dead mates, but as soon as they see you, they can see and hit you 500m away even though you're hiding or moving away. I've also had a few enemies either spawn or teleport right infront of me. And sometimes when you clearly can hit someone you'll just hit some invisible stuff (this is mainly an issue when you're the gunner), but they can still hit you. That, and the 5 hours and 45 min it took me to complete the game on hard while doing the other single player achievements, shows why this game has a Metascore of only 55/100.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior is on the surface a first person stealth shooter with attractive graphics but it doesn't take long for the flaws to become readily apparent.  While the game does have servicable graphics, the campaign missions are short, terribly linear and scripted and feature some of the worst enemy AI I have ever encountered in the genre.  You can literally shoot one of two adjacent enemies, and the other will act as if nothing has happened.  The enemies in the vicinity show up on the mini map in red, making taking most of them out a trivial matter.  The stealth is also poorly implemented, with foliage being opaque to the player, meaning a single blade of grass can completely obscure your view.  Add to that audio that seems to pan all around you giving no indication of enemy whereabouts and you are left with a disaster of a game.  Avoid this title.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

												Graphics: 6.5/10Sound: 4/10Gameplay: 4/10Score: 4.87/10(Weighted average, G:3.5, S:1.5, GP:5)A mediocre shooter. Visually impressive in some ways, but there are many visual glitches in others. Story line is underwhelming. Sound bytes often get reused. Gameplay is fairly repetitive. The AI is ridiculously omniscient. Overall seems to follow Call of Duty in style, but ultimately cannot compete with standard shooters of today. Disappointing.			",150,32,0,16,12,1,6

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior is on the surface a first person stealth shooter with attractive graphics but it doesn't take long for the flaws to become readily apparent.  While the game does have servicable graphics, the campaign missions are short, terribly linear and scripted and feature some of the worst enemy AI I have ever encountered in the genre.  You can literally shoot one of two adjacent enemies, and the other will act as if nothing has happened.  The enemies in the vicinity show up on the mini map in red, making taking most of them out a trivial matter.  The stealth is also poorly implemented, with foliage being opaque to the player, meaning a single blade of grass can completely obscure your view.  Add to that audio that seems to pan all around you giving no indication of enemy whereabouts and you are left with a disaster of a game.  Avoid this title.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

												06-Jun-2016 : Finished main story + extrasEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :This could be a fun sniping game, but it is badly broken by bugs. Frame drops to 1 FPS everytime NPC open fire, scope crosshair missing vertical line and unable to display variable zoom, invisible text in menu, up-side-down video. This game is barely playable on my PC and the only way I'm able to finish it is by using certain ""method"".The story is corny and short. The gameplay is a mix between stealth using sniper rifle and action using assault rifle, so it's not pure sniper experience as I'm expected it to be.This game uses Chrome Engine and Call of Juarez series (which also uses the same engine) has the same problems (missing texture, frame drops, invisible menu, up-side-down video, etc). So I deduce that the problem is the engine itself, not the game coding. Fortunately I got this game really cheap and the Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 that came bundled with this game run perfectly fine. FYI, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 uses Cry Engine 3 and I recommend it instead this one.CONCLUSION :Not recommended.			",120,7,2,11,0,0,2

												So I have been wanting to do this for a long time but have only now just got round to it. I'm going to be as fair as possible to this utter pile of trash but as you can tell from my choice of words that still doesn't do much to improve the games standing in my favour. I have been running this game on windows 10 so I don't know why people can't do that but honestly you shouldn't worry about it. Sniper ghost warrior is in my opinion a failed attempt at trying to cash in on the love of sniping and  l33t 360 no scope demographic that were around in 2010. The AI is a joke, the stealth is in all honesty an afterthought which in a game called sniper ""GHOST"" warrior you would think should be critical and I have had no issue just running around with an AR shooting like I was playing COD and saying ♥♥♥♥ it to stealth and sniping. The only positives I can give is that sometimes the killcams bug out and the bodies ragdoll into the most stupid positions possible, that's probably not a plus from a technical standpoint but it made me laugh along with the games terrible voice acting.Do I recommend this game?  NO, not even as a sick joke.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I didn't feel I needed more room to move around to get the job done.Graphics quality isn't the best but it was liveable, no major bugs or game breaking glitches. All in all it was relaxing and fun for me.TBH, I got this on a steam sale for $1.99 for the gold edition 2 yrs ago (finally got around to playing it now Aug 2014) I really don't see what all the bad ratings and complaining are about at or around that price.

												Games controls are very clumsy.  Spawn point during the rendezvous with the chopper puts you with your back to the enemy and taking fire the moment you appear.  Simple things like going through a door are difficult.   Really didn't like this game.  Needs a lot of improvements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ghost Warrior is a fun fps offering recreational gaming, fine effects and a linear story which makes for a pleasant change from more intense gaming titles. If you like taking pot shots at things then GW could be for you (my preference is the throwing knives)!  :)			",75,6,0,2,12,0,18

												A surprisingly fun and challenging game from City Interactive.Unlike Call of Duty and other such arcade style shooters, you will actually have to be careful of what direction the wind is blowing as it can cause the bullet to go off course and instead hit a wall and thus alert the target.Thankfully you have a ghillie suit which allows you to stay hidden as long as you're hidden in the tall grass or behind a rock and is perfectly still.Do you have what it takes to be a Ghost Warrior and free the people of Isla Trueno from the aggressive and hostile rebel group that has taken over?

												One of my worst full price purchases ever, this game now hides minimized in my ""Horrible Mistakes"" section on Steam. Looking down a sniper scope and picking people off like that is OK. Everything else is awful: assault rifle/pistol combat, stealth, obnoxious enemy AI, understanding objectives, etc... you name it. I had a lot more fun and played Sniper Elite V2 for a lot longer than this even though it is the same basic concept. I can't believe this game got a sequel.3/10			",157,38,1,11,4,1,6

												The sniping sections are absolutely awesome in places. The parts where you are stripped of your sniper rifle & issued an assault rifle are MISERABLE.Overall, a fairly enjoyable single-player campaign though short at only 6hours or so on Hard.Worth it at around 5$ or below.

												The moment I started the game, my jaw dropped in awe. If there is one thing Sniper: Ghost Warrior should be remembered for, it'd be its lush, beautiful, tropical setting. Graphically, this game has it down pat. Sadly, the same cannot be said for anything else.The campaign takes you into the lives of a deadly marksman and a trained soldier who are hot on the trail of an elusive weapons dealer. The switches between two characters are the game's poor attempts to add variety.Ghost Warrior is already a subpar game with sporadic A.I. behavior and some nonsensical design choices. Unfortunately, it gets worse during the infantry missions. The gunplay is atrocious and regenerating health saps the excitement of combat.The game's saving grace is twofold. There are few games quite like Sniper. Despite its flaws, there's still fun to be had. And of course: its stealth missions. Nothing is more rewarding than sneaking past an entire platoon of soldiers or picking them off from afar.Grade: C-			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												The enemy has uncanny aim, and once the fit hits the shan, it can seem like they locate you too easily, but it's a solid game, with a good feel to the weapons.  I also like the fact that after you hit someone in a group, the other enemies don't instantly react... I hit the commander that was dressing down three troops, and by being ready to take out the troops, was able to shift aim to take them out- and the expressions on their face ranged from things are still fine (the first) to what's going on (the second) to someone's out there, I need to get my rifle up (the third).  You don't see that kind of detail often when sniping, so that was very welcome to see.  Still not sure that I would have paid full price for it, but at $7.50 it was a good deal.

												This game for me ran with more bugs than all the bugs types found in pokemon.  It freezes up, sound gets mega choppy, and while it does break off from sniping and do a mini cod take off, this game is not worth it.  The stealth was broken in many spots.I only recommend die hard sniper fans to buy this when it goes down to around $5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I read the reviews and as suggested, only bought the game when it was a Steam daily special for 5 USD. I played the game on normal difficulty and have to say that most of the reviews are misleading. This game is highly underrated. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It took me 9 hours to complete the single player game. The graphics are fantastic, but you will need a decent machine to play it on the higher settings. I did not experience any problems with AI over reacting. If you take your time, move slowly and stay hidden, you won't have any issues. If anything I must agree that the AI sometimes under reacts e.g. not getting a reaction from a guy when you have just taken down the guy standing next to him. There are many factors you have to consider when playing this game. Are you using a suppressor or will the AI hear your gun? Is the AI facing you when you make a dash across the path or road? Do you change position when your cover is blown? The quick save feature is very useful. I was caught a few times and after trying a different approach, managed to get through.I enjoyed the few missions where I had to use an assault rifle. It added a nice change to the game. The pistol and knife were useful in close quarters situations. I hardly used the grenades. I also enjoyed the mix of sniper rifles you get to play with. I loved the fact that you can shoot through small gaps in walls and fences as well as through vegetation.I have started the game again on hard difficulty, which has no assists and presents a whole new challenge. I can't wait!I would give the game a 10, but there were definitely a few issues with it. The game as a whole far outweighs the glitches and I highly recommend it to FPS gamers who enjoy the satisfaction of a successful sniper shot. It is definitely one of my favourites.

												How the heck can they call this game a sniper game?! The enemies have the same amount of prescision with their assault rifles as you do with a high powered sniper. The stealth is either ""get detected and fail the mission"" or ""screw  it guns blazing."" Swapping positions does not seem to help as once the enemies are alerted they can spot you out as if you are wearing bright orange. Ghost Warrior MY♥♥♥♥♥ The game doesn't even give you the option of trying to outsmart the AI. You either shoot them and they die, wash, rinse, and repeat. OR you shoot them and every enemie immediately zeros in to your position from 1000 yards out and kills you. If you want to play a sniper stealth game then DO NOT GET THIS GAME. IF you want to play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ call of duty with invisable walls and absolutely no strategy then this game is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The new FPS perspective works well, and often times the game feels like FarCry 2.  Interestingly enough, the newest Crytek Engine is being used for the next title.If you can get over the glitchy nature of the game, this is really worth a buy, certainly when it is only 5 bucks (I would NOT pay $20)			",480,150,19,94,19,4,38

												Trash trash trash. That's all this is.Graphics are about as generic as it gets when it comes to FPS games. Definitely not up to par with other games released at the same time. This is clearly visible in screenshots and videos. However, I've never really been one to harp on graphics, let's move on to game play.The idea behind this game seems to be, make it as easy as possible and hold the players hand. Follow this guy, get to this way point, kill this character. I might as well have been on rails the whole time. And if that wasn't easy enough, they make sniping a joke. Yeah, there's wind and bullet drop and blah blah blah, but we're going to give you a little circle that will tell you where the bullet goes so you don't have to think. Just move where we tell you and shoot who we tell you.The stealth system is just as bad. I sat outside a bush and an enemy patrol just walked on by. Not noticing me at all. The hardest part was when I had to kill a group across a bridge and one enemy ai apparently had super aimbot with instagib. Easy enough, just hang back and shoot him right? Wrong, I only had a pistol. So I had to just spam bullets at him until I ran out of ammo, run out and die to reload the check point just to do it again until I killed him.The ending is horrible. Very abrupt and anti-climactic. Shoot the guy, roll credits.If you're looking for something to kill time, this may be worth it if you can pick it up in a cheap bundle. Definitely would not recommend it for full price.			",258,27,5,28,25,2,19

												I'm a real big fan of being super stealthy and picking off enemies one by one without them knowing. This game allows you to do that to an extent. If there's a guy about 10 feets from you, and another guy 30 feet away, and you take out the guy who is 10 feet away from you, the guy from 30 feet away will not know. But that's if you're lucky enough to get him to fall silently. The game is fun all around, but really frustating at parts, and really test your stealth. I reccomend this to anyone who is super stealthy.			",167,17,1,17,21,0,16

												I think this game was a little boring. Maybe it just wasn't my type or so. It was okay I guess so if you love sniping maybe you should take a look.			",65,18,0,6,4,0,3

												I picked this game up in the Steam Christmas Sale 2012 for $2.50 and it turned out to be such a bargain.  The sniping is fun but the game is interupted by missions that don't call for a silent sniper approach; this element spoils what could be an immense sniper game.  Visuals are pretty nice but linear gameplay, COD style missions here and there and a lack of decent story mean this game is a sweet sale purchase but not worth full the full RRP.

												Fun little game for its kind. But it's not the graphics or the plot that make this game amazing. It's the satisfaction.The satisfaction of seeing your enemy lying dead after you shot him from 150 yards right in the head.THAT is what this is all about and I feel like a total Mad Skillz Sniper after doing the campaign a few times. The multiplayer tends to prove me wrong though.But five by five,this game is O.K in my book. It's not the best of it's kind,but nothing is perfect,you know?			",81,7,1,5,2,2,4

												This is an OK game aside from the fact that the AI is mostly tarded at times. Accuracy scoring seems to be a little wiggy as well. I achieved nearly 90% head shots during a mission with only two complete misses and my accuracy came out to 58%. Other times, when I didn't fare as well, my accuracy would be much higher. Like WTF man?Although I found this an entertaining game, I would have liked to have seen more detailed specific missions. Otherwise it begins to become a bit boring after awhile. The AI in some instances can make the game more than challenging and near downright impossible. Enemy assault rifles tend to have precison accuracy at great distances. Not to mention some enemy units will spot you even when hidden from complete view, while others will haphazardly meander around drooling and not so much lift a finger while you are in plain sight! Have not yet played multiplayer. I do recommend this game if you get it for a decent price. I got it as part of a bundle and think I definitely got a few dollars worth out of it and will still play it from time to timeLooking forward to playing Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. Hope they fixed the AI in the 2nd iteration.			",127,8,9,17,7,0,32

												Forgettable story.Broken game mechanics: random stealth mechanics with AIs able to spot you crawling in the night in the jungle 60m away but not able to feel danger when their allies drop dead near them, invisible walls, crawling not allowed on slight inclines...But, who cares as long as there's awesome sniping mechanics? Well, wind and gravity is taken into account which is a nice touch of realism. And surely, seeing your bullet travelling in slow-motion once in a while when doing a long distance headshot is pretty amusing and was the only thing that kept me playing until the end. But when most of the game relies on infiltrating bases with little options for long range shooting, it barely can be called a sniping game. The game even sometimes spawns ennemies 20m away from you when reaching a checkpoint because...? God knows.Don't get me started on the few but still too many missions you do as normal infantry with assault rifles. It was truly atrocious and had nothing to do in here. Don't waste your money on this game. I haven't tried the sniper elite franchise yet but it looks a far smarter bet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a botched piece of cr**. Move along, nothing to see. I'll go along with the other reviewers... the enemy will always hit you, even through foliage when you can't see them, at incredible distance, with plain assault rifle, when you are out of range even with your scoped weapon (enemy is not moving, still can't hit them when shooting center mass when prone and not moving). They probably did this to add ""challenge"" because as long as you remain undetected, you can't lose. The first few missions are walk in the park, as long as you remain undetected, but this game really fails in later missions when you are automatically detected. It's just a tedious reload-and-try-again-until-you-have-a-perfect-run style game. Skill is not much use because the enemy will hit you no matter what, even when you can't see them because of all the obstacles and foliage.Also, the game doesn't work well on Windows 8 at all, you have to delete a config file before you launch the game, every time, otherwise you get a black screen with audio. Oh, and the videos are black and white and upside down.I should have read the reviews before buying. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the games my brother bought, as most my friends know he uses my account instead of making his own.I tried this game barely made it past the first three missions before giving up, as its more a tactical stealth game & not a ""gun-ho shoot every feckker bettween u & the objective"" kinda game haha.My ninja skills are bad lets just leave it @ that... *cougth* Anyway my brother loved this game requires patience, cunning, reflexes & keen sight!, ""And knowing which button is 'crouch' b4 the bullets start flying thank you bro!, for telling me 'after' my 7th attempt at sneaking past a guard tower!....Anyway yes From what he's told me, This game is strongly reccomended to players into shooters or the metal gear games, my brother as soon as he finished this game went & looked up the sequel.So take what u will from that! :)Enjoy & have a good day!

												Picked this up for $5 on the Steam Holiday Sale. Was it worth it? For $5, I would say yes. Sniper: Ghost Warrior is an actioned filled sniper shooter that focuses on trying to provide realistic sniper combat as well as stealth. This game achieves at being fairly entertaining, enough so to keep me playing through the campaign. The storyline is decent, while predicatable at times. The level design was pretty good as a whole, and while the environments and scenery are quite beautiful, the game does feel very linear. That being said, most maps and missions do have some open areas and provide room to explore should you wish to do so. This game does have some major shortcomings nonetheless: it overall doesn't feel as polished as it could be, the voice acting is decent but the dialogue for enemies loops and isn't varied enough, the game has bugs and rendering issues, the AI is unbalanced, and I didn't find that the sniping realism was fully achieved. We'll see if the sequel improves upon this franchise.			",175,17,1,22,25,0,54

												This game has some merrit, because at the time of release it offered something that was pretty hard to come by. But in todays age of gaming, don't expect much of this title. It's not that it's bad (ok, it's bad, but not THAT bad), it's just that you feel so disconnected from the character and gameplay. It's kind of like playing Simon Says, but with a gun, and heads to blow up. The AI is outrageous and will have your finger hovering over Alt Ctrl and Del quite often just so you don't have to waste any more time quitting the game the proper way. I don't recommend this game to anybody who is looking for anything with depth or story, or innovating gameplay. But if you like headshots, then it's something to have in your library.

												6/10.  The sniper aspect is fun, but the linear progression forces you to use certain weapons at times; in some case you can just run through an area instead of facing the enemy to get the the target end point makming it too easy.The tense music at times helps with the atmosphere, but the game has major pathing problems: it forces you to take a certain route, which I discovered by accident and had to restart a level because I couldn't find the ""correct"" path.I never got tired of the slow-motion kill shots.It's short, overall easy where the only challenge was to overcome barrages of gunfire.

												This game (despite how many difficulties it may have) there are really two. Hard. And Harder. In standard ""easy"" difficulty, you have to use your stealth and limited weapons to take out your target, and continue moving. This difficulty gives you a floating red dot on precicely where the bullet will land when you fire. On the next difficulties. Your friend the dot, is gone. You then have to calculate, distance, bullet drop, wind, and breathing with every shot you take. Great concept and gameplay, though lacking on the graphics side, it still looks pretty realistic.

It doesn't mean anything to restart over and over again if you make a simple mistake or have to quit. Should be some set points. I don't recommend this to anyone for this reason.

												Visually this game surprised me. The graphics hold up pretty well. Enviroments look great. Despite reviews this game has flaws. The idea is to simulate gravity,wind, time of flight, and heartrate in long range shooting which does okay. Set up the perfect shot and you are rewared with a bullet cam view of the kil. I highly recommend playing on the hardest setting first time out for some challenge. CQB insingle player is flawed. A lot of objects to get caught up against. I found the single player ending very anti-climactic. Mutliplayer is fun when no one his hacking. This game has no anit-cheat support !!!  A lot of hackers in this game. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !! This game does have potential for a great sequel if they fix things. I recommend this game if you need a distraction that is low cost. Sniper Elite, though dated on the graphics, is a better game.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior gets a bad rap from most reviewers. Personally I steer clear from most of the generic realistic big name FPS titles so I am rating this based on it's own merits as a sniper. While probably devised using some random Tom Clancy name generator, it is actually a fun game. It does have it's flaws, occasional bugs (Nothing gamebreaking) and over sensitive AI but in essence it is a realistic, highly satisfying sniper/stealth simulator. Each perfectly aimed headshot is rewarding with a slow motion camera following the bullet until the evil generic mexican soldier falls to the ground with his hat flying off. The graphics give the illusion of a crysis competitor through fancy shaders and choppy shadows but are impressive for a much lower budget title. A fun campaign mode, as you can guess multiplayer is just a giant campfest waiting for someone to move. Don't pay more than $10 or $15 for it though if you value your money.			",312,80,23,34,24,5,48

												A quality Sniper experience. This game has a good balance of stealth and action with just enough story so as to enjoy the headshots in the game a bit more.  If you like sniping in COD, give this one a shot. It's a different kind of shooter, and it does well at being what it is; a sniping game.			",63,6,3,2,2,0,2

												What could be called an amazing concept and a fresh burst of air in the FPS market has turned into a badly designed Call-of-Duty rip-off.

Games Crysis-like maps with beautifull vies owe Chrome engine 4,  wich shows that Polish developers can create good games. What a pity that Ghost warrior has such small budget.

												For a sniper game. this game has very little sniping. Also Run and Gun missions? Riiiight. But srsly, this game is a bit more open than Ghost Warrior 2, but the gunplay is awful, the lack of indicator for the ""focus"" gimmick makes it unreliable, and the enemy AI are either really stupid or have x-ray vision. It was a nice effort, but skip it and play Ghost Warrior 2 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior wanted to be a good game. It's pretty enough, and the sniping system isn't bad at all.  But it seems like that's all the developers focused on.  The AI is terrible, as is trying to shoot with any weapon other than a sniper rifle.  The dialogue is no better, sounding like it was written by a high schooler who earned Ds in their language arts classes.  The HUD looks like it was discussed for a day, and squeezed out in the same amount of time.I think if the developers balanced their efforts equally across all aspects of the game, and hired consultants where they were needed, then it could have been a much better showing.  As it plays, it's not worth my time to try to finish it.			",119,47,0,7,8,3,11

But, for some reason, this game depicts soldiers as people that have difficulty walking up stairs, navigating terrain, and who exist in a world where the fire control selectors on every firearm in existance are broken.

												Singleplayer is repetitive and the missions are all the same, there are a really few weapons in the game (4 sniper rifles, a silenced pistol, some bugged throwing knives and three assault rifles), enemies are a group of retard or they have aimbot (it  depends). The main story is very boring. Graphics are bad optimized, physichs are unexistant and there is no sountrack.Multiplayer is worse than the singleplayer, If you want to survive, there are 6 steps:1 Spawn and try to not be killed by the spawncampers.2 Find a bush or something similar.3 Camp in it.4 Wait for someone to get out of his hiding spot.5 Shoot him with your sniper rifle.6 Never, never, neeeever leave your bush.Sorry, no pros for this game.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior (Ghost Sniper 1) is probably the best game I have played for the $10 I spent on the package (GS1, all DLCS, Ghost Sniper 2 w/ DLCS, and Sniper Art of Vistory which isn't really fun unless you like old games). I started playing Ghost Sniper 2 and was hooked after I beat that. I'm not sure why I didn't play part 1 first and the DLC, but playing part 1 really was the same feeling, graphics to me. Now Ghost Sniper 3 will be a completely new system, but these are a must if you like Sniper or COD games. I actually prefer 3rd person games, but after playing this I really like it better then Sniper Elite in someways. They both are a must.You can pick this trilogy with all DLCs up for $2 on Bundle Stars on a good sale. Yes, $2 and you will have weeks worth of fun with the GS1, Unfinished Business DLC (Second Strike is like a whole new game), Ghost Sniper 2. I will be purchasing Ghost Sniper 3 when its on sale and will review it compared to these. I've watched a bunch of videos on it and I like the new 3 ways to play system.			",338,96,4,13,13,1,24

												I kinda only have complains about this game:The graphics are not very good, even for the time when this game was released, the controls are kinda weird too, specially when your character is using an assault weapon instead of the sniper rifle, also there's no real consistency as to when the NPCs notice you when you're trying to sneak into camps, sometimes they do when you're actually hidden and sometimes you can pretty much walk past by then in plain sight when they should see you.You can't run very long unless you want your character to pretty much start having an asthma attack, same goes when you're trying to snipe, your character is breathing too hard and sometime you have to use the 'hold your breath' function to make a good shoot, I know this is supposed to give a realistic spin to the game play but it gets annoying after a while. The game does give you a chance to see special cutscenes when you make a clean headshot, but only for certain NPCs, not everytime you actually make the shot.Speaking of the NPCs, their conversations are always the same, always, there's never chance, and they sound weird because they were recorded by actors that are evidently spanish instead of latinamerican, which wouldn't be such a big deal if the game wasn't set in Latinamerican and the actor weren't so bad at changing their accent.But for all the complains I have, this game is kinda addictive, if only for the need of actually wanting to complete it more than anything else (there's no real story to follow), it helps that is relatively short, so if you have nothing better to play and you want to kill a couple of hours, you can try it.

												The A.I. is pretty buggy. The assault rifles in this game have way too much recoil and generally you have to use iron sights which is challenging. It is not challenging in a fun way. Having the A.I. do a 180 in half a second and shoot you through something that shouldn't be able to be shot through is just plain stupid. Overall I have enjoyed what I have played of this game. The developers probrobly spent 1/4 of the time coding the game as they did with the art of it. There isn't a lot of games like this, it is pretty unique. The stealth doesn't work great at times. Sometimes you will be hiding in some grass and the enemy will see you but sometimes you can be army crawling right in front of an enemy and they won't see you. You have to be able to tolerate the bugs if you want to play this game but if you can do that then you will enjoy a good amount of this game. 5/10 Try Sniper Elite 3			",150,4,1,2,4,1,6

I don't suggest itThe game is OK, but after a view hours of playing it is getting more and more boring. The look of the game is pretty normal, but the movement and the shooting is in my opinion just terrible. If you played this game before and you are sure you like it, go ahead buy it, but if you are not sure i don' suggest it.			",31,2,0,1,1,0,2

												An unfortunate let down. Begin advertised as a sniper game is a misnomer. This is an action shooter with nearly non existent stealth elements. Once you fire your first shot, every enemy in the entire area knows your EXACT location. Concealment only works UNTIL you fire a shot then it becomes almost useless. It also suffers from CoD style regenerating health.This is not Sniper Elite for the modern day, the ballistics are minimal at best making this no more than an average to below average shooter. If you want a Sniper based game, look elsewhere. If you want an arcade shooter with some stealth elements, its worth a look.			",133,17,3,15,36,2,27

												Totally aweful.  You're supposed to be a sniper, instead you end up a meatshield.  Not much sniping here.  Just another lousy FPS with even worse AI.  You're friends can be standing in front of you blazing away and not hitting anything.  Become visible 200 yards behind your friends and you are instantly the main target.  AI is just plain aweful.  Open site guns are junk.  You are lucky if you can hit anything with them, but yet the AI can pick you off at 1200 meters with a AK.  Pass this game up, it isn't worth the pixels it took to make it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Character movement in single player is horrible - no fluid movements whatsoever. Every attempt at moving, shooting, aiming, etc seems slow and cumbersome. Enemies seem to have excellent aim, whereas your guy takes about 8 days to get lined up, but by that time the sharpshooting enemy has torn you up. If you're looking for a good shooter, look elsewhere.			",34,2,3,4,2,1,2

												[THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS][THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS][THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS]Good Lord this game is awful. It was in some bundle so at least I didn't pay for it.This game had the opportunity to be some decent avg military shooter with a sniping twist. It had but it failed in so many aspects.I played this game few years after release and it seems that developer didn't fix anything after cash grab and they moved on to making the second and third part of this game.+decent gfx considering the Chrome engine (do not confuse with Chrome web browser)rare satisfying moments of action sniping like on good B action movie, silencer on rifle and quite *psst* *psst* in the junglestory told from perspective of few members of delta but.... see below-quasi jungle maps with narrow corridors, invisible walls everywherelinear as ♥♥♥♥mission driven by some horrible scripts - your AI squad can get stuck at the beginning of the levelstupid AI with wallhacks, aimbots and stare that could burn your soulanimation after killing a soldier is laughable, some poor ragdolls with sticks in♥♥♥♥♥and jointsslowmo camera after headshot is boring and pointless comparing to Sniper Elite V2after death enemy will drop full package of ammunition (WTF lazy dev)no presentation of sniper rifles in sniping game, no explanation how to use the mil dots in the scope and how each scope is calibrated - same fail as in Sniper Elite V2inconsistency during the mission (blowing up tree AA positions, no on gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥inconsistency between missions (magic change of main sniper rifle, full ammo)illogical story - this game should be called SNIPER: FAIL WARRIOR when you realised that entire team is making crucial mistakes during the mission - lame plot devicedid I mention the stupid AI? enemy will hit you with every bullet, during relocation between cover, under heavy suppression - Anarki in Q3 Arena on nightmare is jealous of their accsniping is not challenging, 95% of the time you do not need to compensate for wind or gravity, just place the cross on the head and pull the trigger - Sniper Elite V2 did a better job there - at least the action sniping is some funparts of the game where you go loud with few other deltas is simply the worst experience ever! - 1. instead of equipping with silencers and collimators we're getting basic M4 2. the M4 have some terrible rng vertical recoil and you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥trough the iron sight, throw to it the aimbot AI and the fact that they can pretty well merge with the background = you will have a bad dayin the end the story was generic, evil general bla bla, cocaine bla bla, plans for nuclear weapon bla bla and the last mission? Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. The developer was so lazy that after final assassination they just black out the screen in order to show you some credits, no extraction, no drama, no dinozaurs :/This game didn't passed any QA, the amount of BS and broken elements is shocking!!!

												For a sniper game, you do alot of playing as an assault rifle weilding military commando dude in amongst the stereotypical south American terrorist, drug lord dummies. The gun play is terrible and out dated, enemies have got God damn aim hacks, stealth is broken, and the attempt at a story is sad. Overall if you want to play a mindless action shooter, stick with Call Of Duty.4/10- Would not recommend.			",110,8,1,12,3,0,1

The Sniping mechanics are on spot, and if you play on a higher difficulty, you really do feel like a Sniper! You must calculate the wind, gravity pull, and the distance to target, making it one of the most realistic Sniping games I've ever played.ever			",150,3,1,9,8,0,14

Il gameplay punta al realismo con balistica dei proiettili differente per le varie armi, che nel complesso è abbastanza accurata...buono l'approccio steath. La campagna non è lunghissima ma con quello che costa è un titolo validissimo. 7/10 di norma 8.5/10 per chi ama cecchinare di sempre e vuole godersi tanti ma tanti bullet time!			",48,0,3,3,1,0,1

												one of the few games on Chrome 5 and it looks great. there are a few issues with the game design and a few aspects, and the story is pretty average for this type of game. It fits well into any military FPS operation based in a war torn jungle country. I had a great time playing through it, but wished that the grapple was used more freely and the maps were more open, there are a couple walls in places you wouldnt think, and certain things that you cant climb or step over. a little bit more QA in level design would have made this a GREAT game. I enjoyed it despite its faults its very minor faults.If you enjoy tactical sniper like experiences you will enjoy this. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a botched piece of cr**. Move along, nothing to see. I'll go along with the other reviewers... the enemy will always hit you, even through foliage when you can't see them, at incredible distance, with plain assault rifle, when you are out of range even with your scoped weapon (enemy is not moving, still can't hit them when shooting center mass when prone and not moving). They probably did this to add ""challenge"" because as long as you remain undetected, you can't lose. The first few missions are walk in the park, as long as you remain undetected, but this game really fails in later missions when you are automatically detected. It's just a tedious reload-and-try-again-until-you-have-a-perfect-run style game. Skill is not much use because the enemy will hit you no matter what, even when you can't see them because of all the obstacles and foliage.Also, the game doesn't work well on Windows 8 at all, you have to delete a config file before you launch the game, every time, otherwise you get a black screen with audio. Oh, and the videos are black and white and upside down.I should have read the reviews before buying. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a sniper game, you do alot of playing as an assault rifle weilding military commando dude in amongst the stereotypical south American terrorist, drug lord dummies. The gun play is terrible and out dated, enemies have got God damn aim hacks, stealth is broken, and the attempt at a story is sad. Overall if you want to play a mindless action shooter, stick with Call Of Duty.4/10- Would not recommend.			",110,8,1,12,3,0,1

												A Romp with a Rifle.Aside from the terrible sections where you're not given a sniper rifle, the game is satisfying. It's quite a joy getting some slow motion cameras as you leave blood floating in patches in mid air on a successful headshot. The stealth is flippant and a pain at times, though fairly well conceived. The environment has some serious issues, sharp changes in ground slopes mean you have to stand at times, and I had to reload twice after getting stuck between posts/pillars. Technical aspects aside the game is hilarious. After Act 2 or 3 plot is introduced, and boy is it funny.  The acting and staging is awful, and some of the set pieces and cut-scenes are unbelievable. Literally. Unbelievable. There's also a big surprise at the end..which I honestly never saw coming. But I won't spoil it here. It's just far too good to miss.			",172,80,4,42,27,3,38

												If you are the kind of guy that always gravitates towards sniper rifles in any and every game you get your hands on then Sniper: Ghost Warrior is for you. It is a sniper's paradise with a campaign finely crafted for epic long shots. You may not find yourself too deeply embroiled in the rather bland story or the so-so voice acting and writing but you will ache for the next moment that you get the chance to line up a bad guy in your scope. This effect is intensified by the harder levels of difficulty that add in things like windage and elevation and lack a helper diamond that lets you know where to aim. It goes from being a game to an art form and a true sniper will feel right at home. If you are not a born sniper then this game is a solid ""meh"" you will have fun but not as much. The multiplayer is more of an afterthought and as aforementioned the campaign is really just a sniper sandbox with some story thrown in. Also the bullet time function is cool but not Sniper Elite V2 quality.			",135,10,3,16,24,3,27

												This game has many negative reviews... Although the story is a typical shooter one, the game is as fun a as a Tactical First Person Shooter gets! I appreciate the work put into it! The Sniping mechanics are on spot, and if you play on a higher difficulty, you really do feel like a Sniper! You must calculate the wind, gravity pull, and the distance to target, making it one of the most realistic Sniping games I've ever played.ever			",150,3,1,9,8,0,14

												Character movement in single player is horrible - no fluid movements whatsoever. Every attempt at moving, shooting, aiming, etc seems slow and cumbersome. Enemies seem to have excellent aim, whereas your guy takes about 8 days to get lined up, but by that time the sharpshooting enemy has torn you up. If you're looking for a good shooter, look elsewhere.			",34,2,3,4,2,1,2

												Good: -Decent graphics (lush jungle, beach water, etc.)-First part is actual sniper stuff (sneak around, stealth, pick off enemies from distance)-Liked the bullet view from Sniper Art of Victory (camera focuses on bullet flight). Bad: Oh boy here we go.... Somewhere early in the game you get switched out to play an operator who has an M4 and you assault a rig in close quarters then assault a village/base on a beach. Here are the problems.-You are not playing as a sniper anymore.-Enemies hit you hard (25-30 per hit)-Even just  a little peek will get you hit-Enemies have pinpoint accuracy (No time to line up a shot)-You only have iron sights-The other weapons you can take from dead enemies only have iron sights too-The sniper you played earlier who is on a lighthouse isn't even helping you-Friendly AI in your team are just standing aroundIndividually, these points would not be a deal breaker for me. But if I only have iron sights and enemies have almost instantaneous reaction time and hit almost a third of your health, which is very limited, then the compounding of those are just too much.I wouldn't recommend this game because I was looking for a sniper game. But you're forced to play a level (probably more levels) where you're not a sniper and it's very, very, frustrating.			",74,8,1,15,6,0,22

												El juego graficamente es impactante en muchas de las misiones que se superan a lo largo del juego, el juego de armas y fisicas de estas mismas son buenas aunque podrian mejorarse. El gran punto en contra y por el cual encuentro este juego tan generalmente regular es su Inteligencia Artificial o ""IA"" en todos los oponentes que se encuentran a lo largo del juego.Mientras escribo este reporte ya he completado más de una hora de juego y sinceramente el juego aburre y se torna tonto, el juego se supone es la lucha de un ""Sniper"" contra todo un ejercito, sin embargo el factor sorpresa pasa a segundo plano cuando sin razon aparente todos los misianos estan disparandote. Espero que la experiencia de juego Multiplayer sea mucho mejor y asi poder sacarle el jugo a un juego que cuesta $15US.			",176,15,7,9,10,0,8

												What a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥The sniping is♥♥♥♥♥♥easy if you use the indicator of where your shot will line up, That said, the sniping feels♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. Most of ther time you don't feel like you've worked for your extremely accurate shots.The game forces you to use different players other than the sniper at points, and those points are abysmal. Assault rifles have recoil from here to hell and back, so you cant hit a damn thing on full auto. It negates the whole Sniper premise with these sections.The designers did a poor job of giving you any kind of freedom. There are invisible walls everywhere if you stray 3 feet off the intended path.It looks like they tried to put some COD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in here with a few poorly orchestrated set pieces and even a random ""cool guys don't look at explosions"" scene near the end.

												Forgettable story.Broken game mechanics: random stealth mechanics with AIs able to spot you crawling in the night in the jungle 60m away but not able to feel danger when their allies drop dead near them, invisible walls, crawling not allowed on slight inclines...But, who cares as long as there's awesome sniping mechanics? Well, wind and gravity is taken into account which is a nice touch of realism. And surely, seeing your bullet travelling in slow-motion once in a while when doing a long distance headshot is pretty amusing and was the only thing that kept me playing until the end. But when most of the game relies on infiltrating bases with little options for long range shooting, it barely can be called a sniping game. The game even sometimes spawns ennemies 20m away from you when reaching a checkpoint because...? God knows.Don't get me started on the few but still too many missions you do as normal infantry with assault rifles. It was truly atrocious and had nothing to do in here. Don't waste your money on this game. I haven't tried the sniper elite franchise yet but it looks a far smarter bet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- Sniper Ghost Warrior - After having completed this game, I believe it deserves a review. So here it is:Sniper Ghost Warrior is a Sniping FPS, made by City Interactive. You play as a small US Military unit, which consists of several members. The one you'll be playing in about 75% of the missions is Sergeant Tyler Wells, known as 'Razor Six Four.' He is the Sniper of his unit and in an unbelievable turn of events, you'll be doing most of the sniping in the game as this guy. The game has an interesting way of interpreting each squad member's role, as since you'll be doing most of the sniping as Sergeant Wells, you'll also get to play as the Spotter, O'Neil, in which you'll have to help out Wells in picking targets to snipe through your binoculars. You can also play as a couple members of a Ground Assault Team where most of the gunfighting is done, but I'll get to that in a minute.I'd like to keep this review simple by first covering the game itself, then the different gameplay aspects you'll be diving into throughout the campaign.First off, the game itself looks really pretty for a 2010 release. The foilage and jungles look lush and thick, and well rendered, and the buildings in the urban areas all look convincing and well modeled. The draw distance is very far (which I would expect from a game which focuses on shooting people at extreme range) and the lighting is impressive. On the other hand though, the character models look pretty bland and even look like plastic up-close. The enemies throughout the game literally have about four different models and the animation isn't great. Enemies won't do things such as take cover, instead preferring to stand in the open and shoot right at you, despite the range disadvantage, which leads me to another issue.The AI are either omnipotent or brain-dead. Sometimes they will be doing the sniping with bursts from their rifles, killing you very quickly and being able to see you from a country mile away, or they'll look about in horror having seen their pal collapse from a .45ACP to the head, even though you'll be standing right behind them as they panic. They never do anything other than shoot or throw grenades at you, and on missions where detection = failure, some may raise the alarm as they die - despite having nobody nearby to see or hear them die. They'll gladly stand still as you shoot them up, trying to return fire.One of the features of Sniper Ghost Warrior affect your ballistics, or in non-sniper jargon, how your rounds travel over a distance. You'll have to account for bullet drop and lead your targets, and ensure you keep your heartbeat at a low BPM to maintain optimal accuracy. You can use the Mil-Dots on your scope to ensure kills at longer ranges, or the chevrons on a PSO scope. The issue is however, most of the sniping isn't done at a long enough range to even need to adjust your shot. You'll be trying harder to stay undetected, and if you're like me, you'll be relying more on your sidearm to eliminate sentries and slip past. A feature which also bugged me was that on both the Easy and Medium difficulties, a little red circle will appear on your scope to tell you EXACTLY WHERE TO AIM, which pretty much renders most of what I've mentioned in this paragraph redundant. Having discovered that this circle is disabled in the Hardest difficulty, I immediately restarted and went for this option. Things were better then, and it was more enjoyable for sure, but with increasing the difficulty, another problem surfaced...Remember when I said the AI were sometimes omnipotent and could spot you anywhere? On Hard, you'll be utter screwed if luck isn't on your side, as you'll literally be one-dinked from No Mans Land by a kiddie conscript in his early twenties if you don't see him first. It's pure Rocket-Tag gameplay, and whoever gets the first shot in usually wins the fight. This wouldn't be an issue if the game was completely stealth. You'll have scripted events where you'll have to retreat under fire, and if the game rolls a 'Screw You' on the dice of fate, you'll die instantly and will have to try again, regardless of what you do otherwise. I remember on the chapter 'Steal From Under Their Noses', where as soon as you grab the intel, you'll be compromised, and forced to swim to safety. Two guards will spawn behind you after you start swimming, which will nine times out of ten, kill you while you're defenceless. I had to repeat this part countless times, before I managed to escape. I had a similar issue later in the game when I was playing as the Spotter, and only had a MK.23 (A .45ACP Handgun) with abysmal range to defend myself. I had to sneak past a bridge, but the guards seen me nearly every time and I was shredded. I couldn't fight back as my MK.23 just couldn't hit them at the range I was at.Now, referring back to the other characters, you'll be playing as the Ground Assault Team in some chapters. This is where the game often turns to mud. The gunplay is horrible and any weapon will have ridiculous recoil and shake more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dog. There is no stealth at all and you'll have to make do with only a few weapons to fight your way through. There are very few weapons in the game at all, with most of them being Sniper Rifles, naturally, so at these points you'll only have a few AR's and maybe a USAS-12 to hand to get by, all of which suck. You'll still have the never-missing AI blast you to bits though, and an occasional dose of 3 to 4 grenades being hurled at you at once. You play as these guys in more than one chapter too. The Spotter, O'Neil's missions are brief but rather lacklustre. Simply consisting of marking targets though a set of binoculars for the aforementioned Wells to snipe. (I suppose it's more realistic than the rest of the game). Chances are you'll be here for Wells' missions, which ARE the sniping aspect of the sniping game. Previous issues apply and you'll often be potshotting rookies from less than 100 metres away, nullifying the whole point of having a Sniper there in the first place. You'd be as well sending Solid Snake. You can pick up enemy weapons but they're as jerky and inaccurate as playing as the Ground Assault Team, once again ruining the purpose of being a Sniper to begin with.The story is pretty generic, with the US finding another dictator that doesn't like them much, a la Castro, so they send your team in to liquidate them.  You mess up, he gets away, big escapade, you rescue an Agent, they double-cross you, generic rebels save your♥♥♥♥♥(who you see ONCE and they are never seen nor heard from again). You find out they want to free their mates (VIVA LA REVOLUCION) who are being forced to work in a Uranium mine for the big bad. You go in, 'Murica style, blow their♥♥♥♥♥♥up, return to the original mission of assasinating the Head Gringo, do so...  AND THE GAME ENDS RIGHT THERE. RIGHT AFTER YOU TAKE THE FINAL SHOT. What. The. Hell. (It literally fades to black, 'THE END' appears, credits roll.) Well wasn't all that build up for nothing or what?!To put an end to this review, I'd have to say first that I got this game in a bundle. I may not have bought it otherwise but after having played it I would have to say that it isn't worth your time, unless you get it in a bundle yourself or get it very cheap. It wasn't a huge studio that made the game, fair enough, but I feel as though they make their own game pointless by giving you Assault Rifles at any time, and telling you where your bullet will land. It is, as I said, very pretty to look at, but not much to it. A 4-5 hour campaign at most and dead multiplayer. If sniping is your bag and you can't get enough of it, I recommend to get this and play it on the Hardest difficulty from the get-go. You'll still get absolutely mullered at the scripted events where stealth is not an option (more common they should be), but at least it'll provide a challenging experience. Aim high.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior makes a rough but sort of charming first impression. Using the Chrome 4 engine originally featured in Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood in 2009, Sniper bears a fair bit of resemblance to last year's video game western, except for, well, all those trees and bushes. While character models look rough around the edges, the environments appear expansive and lush. What's more striking is the sniping mechanic itself. While Sniper: Ghost Warrior isn't quite as excruciatingly prone to realism as, say, ARMA 2 or the original Operation: Flashpoint, it seems realistic. Shots from the titular sniper rifles in Ghost Warrior are subject to gravity and environmental effects from wind and the like, such that play is predicated less on twitch gunplay and more on setting up and taking the right shots at targets - at least at first.

												This game is very much underated! Apart from a few very minor gameplay issues that aen't even worth mentioning...this is a solid game! All those comments about the title screen being updside down are true, but the menus are all right side up so who really cares that the background artwork is upside down on a title or menu screen...not me! Gameplay is not affected so really...why waste your time trying to fix that stuff?? The difficulty levels offer just that..varied difficulties. I really enjoyed the DLC missions... especially The Last Hunt..with the minimal HUD and the more intuitive AI...I really had to play smart to avoid getting whacked! The fact you couldn't save game added to that more realistic level of play! not to worry though, there are checkpoints... so if you do get whacked (and you will) you don't have to go back to the start of the mission. Since there is no way to save game when playing this DLC mission (only applies to this bonus mission), you should set aside some time to play it through...it's not that long if you don't end up getting whacked too much. Overall, I thought this game was well worth the money (I got it on sale, and bundled as the Gold pack) and I am definitely going to play it again!			",109,63,0,0,5,0,14

												This is an OK game aside from the fact that the AI is mostly tarded at times. Accuracy scoring seems to be a little wiggy as well. I achieved nearly 90% head shots during a mission with only two complete misses and my accuracy came out to 58%. Other times, when I didn't fare as well, my accuracy would be much higher. Like WTF man?Although I found this an entertaining game, I would have liked to have seen more detailed specific missions. Otherwise it begins to become a bit boring after awhile. The AI in some instances can make the game more than challenging and near downright impossible. Enemy assault rifles tend to have precison accuracy at great distances. Not to mention some enemy units will spot you even when hidden from complete view, while others will haphazardly meander around drooling and not so much lift a finger while you are in plain sight! Have not yet played multiplayer. I do recommend this game if you get it for a decent price. I got it as part of a bundle and think I definitely got a few dollars worth out of it and will still play it from time to timeLooking forward to playing Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. Hope they fixed the AI in the 2nd iteration.			",127,8,9,17,7,0,32

												Visually this game surprised me. The graphics hold up pretty well. Enviroments look great. Despite reviews this game has flaws. The idea is to simulate gravity,wind, time of flight, and heartrate in long range shooting which does okay. Set up the perfect shot and you are rewared with a bullet cam view of the kil. I highly recommend playing on the hardest setting first time out for some challenge. CQB insingle player is flawed. A lot of objects to get caught up against. I found the single player ending very anti-climactic. Mutliplayer is fun when no one his hacking. This game has no anit-cheat support !!!  A lot of hackers in this game. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !! This game does have potential for a great sequel if they fix things. I recommend this game if you need a distraction that is low cost. Sniper Elite, though dated on the graphics, is a better game.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior gets a bad rap from most reviewers. Personally I steer clear from most of the generic realistic big name FPS titles so I am rating this based on it's own merits as a sniper. While probably devised using some random Tom Clancy name generator, it is actually a fun game. It does have it's flaws, occasional bugs (Nothing gamebreaking) and over sensitive AI but in essence it is a realistic, highly satisfying sniper/stealth simulator. Each perfectly aimed headshot is rewarding with a slow motion camera following the bullet until the evil generic mexican soldier falls to the ground with his hat flying off. The graphics give the illusion of a crysis competitor through fancy shaders and choppy shadows but are impressive for a much lower budget title. A fun campaign mode, as you can guess multiplayer is just a giant campfest waiting for someone to move. Don't pay more than $10 or $15 for it though if you value your money.			",312,80,23,34,24,5,48

												The enemy has uncanny aim, and once the fit hits the shan, it can seem like they locate you too easily, but it's a solid game, with a good feel to the weapons.  I also like the fact that after you hit someone in a group, the other enemies don't instantly react... I hit the commander that was dressing down three troops, and by being ready to take out the troops, was able to shift aim to take them out- and the expressions on their face ranged from things are still fine (the first) to what's going on (the second) to someone's out there, I need to get my rifle up (the third).  You don't see that kind of detail often when sniping, so that was very welcome to see.  Still not sure that I would have paid full price for it, but at $7.50 it was a good deal.

												Sniper: Ghost Warrior, in my opinion, is an underrated game. Sure it has it's issues, mainly the poor A.I. and lack of narrative however I've played worst before!PROS:+Decent gameplay+Chrome Engine 4, same engine used in Dead Island.+Fun missions.+Addictive sniping.+Playing as other soldiers on missions change the pace of the game.CONS:-Poor A.I.-Lack of narrative.-Enemies have X-Ray vision, and can snipe you with their assault rifles.-Lots of clipping issues. You can't crawl on higher ground which is unrealistic.-Missions requiring 100% stealth or alarm is triggered = failing!-Low replayability of the campaign once finished.OVERALL:I recommend this game if you love sniping games. Game ain't stellar but not ""crappy"" either! RATING:7.0 / 10			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

												sniping peoples head off was fun. the AI sure is dumb at times but you also dont want to be seen by them either. so being stealthy does pay off.the best thing is that you dont have this stupid regenerating health. you can carry only 5 syringes with you. there are medkits throughout the levels but you will not find them at every corner.bad things are the (as mentioned) AI. there were moment that i shot a guy near a otehr enemy soldier and they havent even noticed it. and if they do, they just stand around trying to spot you instead seeking cover. some do but not frequently. some missions they raise the alarm, that mostly leads to mission failure. and the story. kill bad guy before he can get hold of some mass destruction weapons...blah, blah, blah. never the less it was a fun game. certainly not for everyone if they expect a fast pasted shooter. because its not.  but for 8$, and i got the gold edition that cost the same price, that includes a SP DLC, it add over an additional hour of playtime.

												The moment I started the game, my jaw dropped in awe. If there is one thing Sniper: Ghost Warrior should be remembered for, it'd be its lush, beautiful, tropical setting. Graphically, this game has it down pat. Sadly, the same cannot be said for anything else.The campaign takes you into the lives of a deadly marksman and a trained soldier who are hot on the trail of an elusive weapons dealer. The switches between two characters are the game's poor attempts to add variety.Ghost Warrior is already a subpar game with sporadic A.I. behavior and some nonsensical design choices. Unfortunately, it gets worse during the infantry missions. The gunplay is atrocious and regenerating health saps the excitement of combat.The game's saving grace is twofold. There are few games quite like Sniper. Despite its flaws, there's still fun to be had. And of course: its stealth missions. Nothing is more rewarding than sneaking past an entire platoon of soldiers or picking them off from afar.Grade: C-			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												Decent FPS if you immerse yourself in the role of trying to be stealthy. If you just run and gun it can be quite disappointing. The enemy AI is really the weak point of the game. They can spot & shoot you from across the map and if you shoot one in a group, the others just seem clueless as to what is going on and just wait for you to shoot them too. Your rifle shots essentially go unheard; enemies don't enter a state of awareness after you shoot from distance. Your own squad immortally absorbs bullets and never die. The bullet-cam is a pretty cool feature and the game has respectable graphics. Good bargain bin shooter.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												I don't recommend this, unless you find it at a ridiculously low price. It is basicly too similar to other games, with no viable multiplayer, and some shortcomings. These include enemies engagement being scripted (you walk perfectly stealthed into a camp and everybody start shooting you) since the game does not seem to detect you entering in the enemy field of vision dynamically. Same thing with enemy detection on your side, sometimes you are standing right behing an enemy looking at him, and he doesn't show on your radar. Some other times they appear for no reason. This is not a horrible game, and it might be a fun few hours break if you can grab it at $3-5 but don't spend too much money on this as you will regret it.			",360,75,5,72,42,2,66

												What could be called an amazing concept and a fresh burst of air in the FPS market has turned into a badly designed Call-of-Duty rip-off. The developers have amazed me by creating a title so featureless, glitchy and boring. During a Steam season sale, i was able to pick this game up for $1. IMHO that is the max you should be paying for it. 1/5			",207,25,6,26,15,1,36

												Games controls are very clumsy.  Spawn point during the rendezvous with the chopper puts you with your back to the enemy and taking fire the moment you appear.  Simple things like going through a door are difficult.   Really didn't like this game.  Needs a lot of improvements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty linear in story mode. Basically a cooridor game. Interesting and playable all the way through. Some annoying plot changes/scenarios but believable all the same.			",214,63,25,24,19,0,11
