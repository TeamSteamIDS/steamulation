												Absolutely horrible controls! As a big on-rails shooter fan, I was vaguely looking forward to this, but it just plays so badly. Some interesting ideas, and it looks pretty good.I'd say one of the worst aspects, even if only a subtle one, is the player and the on-screen gameplay feel... kind of detatched, as if the player doesn't exist in the same world, almost as if it's simply a video in the back ground that you can vaguely interact with.All in all it's just kind of mediocre. I knew it was going to be bad after hearing the reviews of the xbox 360 version, but... it's not even 'so bad it's good', just really really bland. Avoid.			",326,65,4,39,33,2,34

												Sub par game? I really have to ask what kind of gamers are out there. I grew up playing panzer dragoon on the sega dreamcast. I been around gaming almost since it's infancy. Now a days it's about first person shooters anything else is subpar. What a shame. If you liked games like panzer dragoon or panzer dragoon orta you'll like Yar's Revenge. Rip off of original Yar's Reveng. Nothing to do with the original. Thank goodness. The original does not look this good nor play this well. To compare the both is like comparing a calculator to a ps vita. Problems-It's locked at 30fps. Go to ini and change to 60 fps.Not at 1080, same thing. Unluck in ini in the steam folder. Not full screen. You get the picture.Went to nvidia settings and set it at SLI 16x CSAA. Why? Because I could.....PCMR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's fun rail 3D rail shooter, with a bit of challenge. I read some of the negative reviews say either 'controller is bad' or 'just a typical rail shooter'.1: possibly cos they are using a typical PC gaming control setting to play this non-PC game making it difficult.2: they never played Panzer Dragoon, hence why they think its a House of the Dead clone.Though the control setting doesn't have the settings for game pad but its easy to learn after you know the buttons, not difficult.Been a long time since I played a game that is close to Panzer Dragoon since the last game in early 2000, and I love it, simple fun.

												This is a pretty good distraction to keep you busy for around an hour if you're into shooters, and a GREAT re-imagining of the original story to Yar's Revenge. This is a dual-analog on-rails shoot-em-up that's easy to pick up. The soundtrack is actually really good.Alas, I don't think this game is worth $10. Be sure to keep an eye on it during the Steam sales, though.			",314,22,14,17,6,2,7

												This is actually a fairly fun game. Honestly I only bought it because I owned an Atari 2600 as a kid and had Yar's Revenge for that system, and wanted to see what an update / sequel would possibly be like so many years later. It doesn't seem all that related to the original, actually. I mean the story is, very very vaguely, similar, but other than that -- different gameplay, different feel, different tone, different everything. The original was just a masterpiece. It'd be nice if this contained the original as a mini-game or something inside it, but nope, it doesn't. I guess they had the game license and wanted to use it for some slight popularity. And for me it worked. But most Steam gamers are younger than me and never even heard of Yar's Revenge, so I doubt this trick works on most people.Basically the game is a On-Rails Shooter. If ever played a game where you move along a path and have to shoot everything that appears in front of you, quickly, before it disappears, it's like that. Panzer Dragoon is a good analogy. If you *casually* enjoy that type of game, you might enjoy this. If you think that type of gameplay is stupid and boring, you won't enjoy this. If you are a die-hard fan of on-rails shooters and only look for the best examples in that genre, you also won't enjoy this. It's intended to be a time-waster. I'd say buy it on sale if you are even remotely curious about it, and if you read this review that's probably you. Two dollars (on sale) isn't a big risk. I played it for two hours, and had some fun with it. Two hours of fun for two dollars is an okay trade by me.			",578,198,8,108,47,1,107

												I like rail shooters. Yar's Revenge was an attempt to bring back an old Atari character as a rail shooter, and it just isn't successful. I can't put my finger on exactly why, but it's just not fun. It's not just a case of fondly remembering a genre as better than it actually was, because the Panzer Dragoon games are still a lot of fun. I can't recommend Yar's Revenge to anyone.

												The game looked good. Was looking for a game like this. Lots of nice visuals. I like the concept of the game.Would have been fun if the mouse controller did not over compensate my movements. If I tried to move quick, the target would slam from one side to the other. If I moved slow, I didn't get enough movement. I just did not feel I had control during the game. Not like in the menu. The game play controls with the mouse didn't feel right to me. If the game works with a game pad, I will give that a try, I don't remember seeing settings for that though. Some like the game, I don't recommend it, but that is do to my experience with it. To me, even the old StarFox on the SNES is better. The controls is real nice on that game.The intro looked good, though ran a little to fast for me to read what was being said. I would have to grab screen captures stills and read form those. Over all, not horrible, but I couldn't play well.extra:Just tried this with a control pad. The GameStop Afterglow PS3/PC controler. And it worked! And the game controled like a dream. For one time. On the first try, the mane gun fierd by pressing the right stick button. this I did not like. It was the only thing I did not like. Otherwise it played great! Better than expected. Then I met with a porb. I tried to configuer the controler with in steam, and the controler was no longet reconised by the game, as a frist player controler. With the right triger, it stared player two. And I could move player two, but I had no wepons for player two. So in short, this game has hidden functions for game pad control, not avalable in any settup within any options. This game seriously needs that!I feel this game would rock, if it was fixed with options to not only configuer the keybord controls, but also updare the game with the option to use a game pad, and alow configueration of the game pad as well. If this game is ever updated so the game pad can be fully used, I will not feel like I wasted my money on this game, and would fully suport giving this game a big thumbs up!			",26,19,2,0,2,0,1

												A great game that is disappointingly short. It has 6 missions that will take you from 1&1/2 to 2 hours. When it ended I was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that it was over so quickly because I was enjoying it so much. It really isn't even worth saying anything else because there is barely even a game here but I will end on a few things.You CANNOT play this with mouse because of really bad mouse acceleration so have a gamepad ready. It works flawlessly with my xbox 360 pad. The game wouldn't save my settings each time I relaunched it but setting the exe file in the game folder to run as admin seems to be what fixed it. The graphics are not great but are decent enough. The sounds and music are fine and the story in the cutscenes is a nice touch. It feels a lot like Starfox but with a much better framerate. SNES Starfox anyway. The game's biggest asset is its fun gameplay. I had a good time playing this even as short as it was.Sounds/Music- 7/10Graphics- 6/10Length- 2/10Gameplay- 8/106/10 - I would give it a solid 7.5 out of 10 but since it is so incredibly short get it only for $2.50 or less like I did. Closer to $1 would be more ideal for it being so short.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												   A decent little game that's can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get running.    The graphics and gameplay are decent. Story was interesting, though trying to follow some of the conversations during gameplay can be a little rough at times. Overall though, I found it to be decent.   Main complaint was the controls. Definetely easier with a keyboard then a controller, though would be nice if we could map things ourselves (options seem to indicate so, but I couldn't get it working). Also, getting the game started took some configuring, though in the end, I don't think any of the tweaks actually carried over.    Over all a decent game, though not worth it's full price with its issues. Would recommend it if you can get it on sale.			",295,25,4,33,5,3,56

												Reminds me of the types of shooting games you play at an arcade where you shoot what's on the screen but all the movement is handled for you.Not nearly enough build up with training of the tools available, confusing story, and is pretty boring after only a little while.  I'm sure the author had great intentions and great ideas but just did not convey them very well at all.  Save yourself the money and skip this.			",121,45,1,20,30,0,15

												Panzer Dragoon type dual-analog on-rails shooter. Colorful, animesque.I know nothing else similar on PC. So it's a rare gem.I have no idea about original Atari game. This game is enjoyable on its own.Arcade type gameplay means it can be finished in one take. Six levels will not take too long.Playable both on kb+mouse and on gamepad - I can't decide which one is better.On the downside, configuration is troublesome.			",145,38,5,12,1,0,6
