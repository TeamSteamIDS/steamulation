												This is a very nice mod that had a lot of problems establishing a strong community and therefore is generally ignored and poorly known. It is set on the North African front of WW2 and offers balanced combat, on the same engine of Unreal 2 from Red Orchestra. It implies the same mechanics and with the latest update is enjoying the addition of Steam achievments.If you have Red Orchestra feel free to download Mare Nostrum.			"

												If you like World War 2 first person shooter PVP simulations, this is a free good game to get as a mod of Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45.  This game is more on the realistic side of WW2 combat while still using the Battlefield 2 type of game style. You will be using authenically modeled weapons with iron sights. There are no bullet counters, no zoom function, hard to tell friend from foe and have friendly fire.  Has fatigue that limits movement , no healing. Tanks are modeled as close to real thing.  Some classes are Limited in number to a few, while plenty of soldiers with bolt action rifles.  Has artillery strikes called in by a radio located at major bases.You can play as infantry or tanker only.  Mare Nostrum is the North Africa, Italy and Crete battles. Has Italian and German vs English and American forces.  Mare Nostrum is a Mod of Red Orchestra, so you need to buy RO.Needs more people playing and more servers hosted.for more info:

												A great way for even more Red Orchestra content, this mod adds another whole set of maps for you to enjoy! Sadly there are almost never servers up for this mod making the game hard to enjoy, or even play for that matter without a large group of friends or at least a group of people organized enough to host a full server.

												I'm going to review this game again. Mare Nostrum is very interesting. It has good maps, visuals, infantry weapons, and tanks. What intrigues me most about this game is that it's a first person shooter set in the African front of WW2. You don't see very many games depicting this aspect of the war in a multiplayer setting. Unfortuanatley the game is dead. Which is sad since the reviews are mostly positive. Even though there is nobody to play multiplayer online I am always drawn back to this game to use ""practice mode"" where you can play against bots, and set their difficulty. On hardest difficulty you get a good challenge, and can play the game by yourself. There's not much I can say negative about this game besides dead multiplayer. Awesome free mod.			"

												This is a great mod from RO, it adds new guns and covers my second favorite part of the war: The African Invasion. So needless to say, new guns, new maps, interesting part of the war so why does no one play it? Well i can give credit to the other mod which actually still has one server open and full of players all the time. Over all there isn't anything wrong with this mod as i said, its just that no one plays it any more.			"

												Amazing mod for a fantatic game. Red Orchestra 1 is one of the fullest featured and undoubtedly the best multiplayer FPS of the last decade for me. The sequel, Ro2, is complete ♥♥♥♥, and a waste of money.Mare Nostrum is a game on that LONG, LONG, SAD list of games that are amazing fun to play and DESERVE to have hundreds or thousands of people playing at a time, but no one plays them. Darkest Hour is a Ro1 mod that still gets daily play and full servers.I wish this game has 1000's playing, because it is excellent, like 9/10 on a bad day.			"

												Which from this list were you planning on having to ♥♥♥♥♥-slap to death in a nightmarish zombie-like apocalypse? The game isn't even consistent with its difficulty curve; one minute you're fighting those brainless shadow scraps and then there's twenty ♥♥♥♥ing dudes with chainsaws and a god damn 50-foot tall lawnmower trying to ♥♥♥♥-rape your face in half. I don't even know why this ♥♥♥♥ is in the game, because it's not like those ♥♥♥♥ing dark chumps can steer; half the time that hulking metal pulverizer is just backing up into his crew because he missed slamming you into a wall. But ♥♥♥♥ you if you don't manage to dodge out of the way in time, because what's probably supposed to be a single hit from that thing ends up being twenty damage ticks that instantly kills you when your character gets stuck under it! Nice job again, developers. I never thought you'd make me scared of ♥♥♥♥ing farm equipment when I picked up this game. Actually, let's go back to that part about ♥♥♥♥ running away from you. Half the content in this game is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that gets extended for ♥♥♥♥ing ever because no one thought of a better way to handle it. Any time you have to take on more than two enemies at a time you better bet that you're going to have to do the same thing at least two more times. You liked that fight you just got out of? How about the same fight except three more times, ♥♥♥♥? It doesn't help when there are actually enemies whose only goal is to RUN AWAY FROM YOU. That's right, there's a super-fast-takes-no-♥♥♥♥ dirtbag of a mini-boss you encounter about eighty times, and all he does is zip around right outside your flashlight range and occasionally sneak up to ♥♥♥♥ on you then run away again. And you have to somehow focus your lightbeam on him until he runs out of shields, which takes ♥♥♥♥ing ages already. Oh yeah, and sometimes he's a part of bigger fights to, and sometimes, THERE'S MORE THAN ONE. At one point, you have to fight three of these guys at once, all zipping around with their ♥♥♥♥♥ out not even attacking you, and you have to kill them all. Then, when they're dead, you have to do THE SAME THING again, and then, after that, THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING THING AGAIN.			"

												Mare Nostril is a game about a horse's nose. Really there's not a lot to say about this one. You can sniff stuff and sometimes someone shoves a carrot or an apple or a sugar cube at you. I guess if you're a 12 year old you'll probably go nuts over this but otherwise I'd pass on this one, or at least wait for the sequel where you'll get to bite people. CHOMP.			"

												Great WW2 mod set in the African theater Its a beautiful mod, but sadly there are no players. Theres a lot of attention to detail on the maps and models.This game shines in vehicle combat.Theres a huge variety of light, medium  and heavy tanks for the allies and axis forces. I really like how it feels like your sitting inside the tank , you get to look through all the periscopes and you can raise the armoured hatch to get a better view ( but sacrifice protection) of the battle. The bots are really kooky so its not really worth playing by yourself. Theres only on server up as of December 20, 2015 and theres never been anyone on when ever I""ve checked. You can still find people playing Darkest Hour but everyone else has moved on to the New Red Orchestra or other games.Its their lose.God speed you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥9/10 Great Mod but needs players			"
