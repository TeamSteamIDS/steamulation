												Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flying game published by bitComposer Games.Set in World War 2 with linear storyline. It's not about military power of the Nazi, Red Army or even RAF. It's about a person who try to survive in the war that consumes many other. But of course, you will be joining the Allies in the war against the German. From the desert of Tobruk to the plains and forest of Europe, you fight for your survival.Air Conflicts: Secret Wars has good gameplay, it's just since the game is about a person, it doesn't have so many great battles and some of it are stealth mission. Still, it's a challenges, not a bad game for me. The graphics is quite good, the sounds are good and the music is kinda good. I still recommend this if you like arcade games.Rating 6/10			"

												Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade style flight game. This is not a simulator, flight controls are very simple. Missions consist of destroying ground targets, taking out rival aircraft, protecting allies and picking up supplies. I found all the missions to be quite similar after a few rounds. The planes are incredibly easy to control, so you can start divebombing and doing flybys of every tower in no time. The bombs and rockets are a little more difficult to use than the machine guns. I found myself having to loop around and try to hit targets multiple times.The cutscenes are voice overs over well drawn still frames. The graphics overall could have used some polish. This is definitely a budget game, in that most objects are quite blocky. The resolution settings do not go very high, so you will most likely be playing in a lower resolution than you are used to. The voice acting is not offensive but not great. I couldn't really tell the difference between the male characters.Don't mistake this for a flight sim. If you are looking for a cheap arcade flight game, you could do worse than Air Conflict. However, the dated graphics and repetitive gameplay will not keep your attention for long.Grade: C			"

												Plus: Great arcade flight simulator! Decent graphics and reasonably challenging gameplay make this a winner. Interesting storyline, and no noticable graphic or audio flaws. Fast load times. Level skip feature, on the off chance you cant get past a level.Minus: Simulation controls are nigh impossible to smoothly work with. Storyline is kind of wandering. Infantry and paratroopers are rediculously difficult to hit although you are required to at times.8/10 Overall: For what it is, its a pretty solid little plane game, with decent graphics and sound, and fun gameplay if you use the arcade control scheme with a controller.AMD Phenom II X6 1100T 3.3Ghz.6GB DDR22.5TB 7200RPM, 16MB, SATA II16MB/s Cable/N300 WifiXFX 2GB Radeon 6950Vizio 42"" 1080P 3D LED			"

												Fun arcadey flight sim. It's more of an XBL-arcade-tier indie title than a full-fledged flight sim, which is good because I'm terrible at flight sims. The planes seem kinda the same, the missions are uninspired, but if you want to fly around and blow stuff up, this does the trick.			"

Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is a mixed bag of things, but mostly an arcade sim with a decent (though hyperbolic) story wrapped around it. You play a female protagonist named DeeDee who, being a pilot smuggler gets caught up into World War II. And she serves with a man who personally flew and fought with her father in World War One. As the missions progress, the story unfolds through static cut scenes that have a pleasant cell shaded hand drawn look. Missions vary from stealthy strike missions to all out balls to the wall multi-plane dogfights. If you’re looking to play an IL-2 Sturmovik imitation, look elsewhere; this is strictly for the arcade fans. Difficulty can be toggled, but some missions are more difficult than they have any right to be. One particular mission toward the end involved destroying fleeing vehicles through the city of Berlin. Tall buildings made it difficult to get decent bombing runs or rocket attacks, and it took me over 50 tries to get it. (But at this point, being so close to the end I had to finish it!) Graphics are okay, serving the purpose. They look console-ish, and the voice acting is pretty much done by three people. One guy doing four different men’s voices with different accents is cheesy to the point of being hilarious. The music score, on the other hand, is polished and grandiose. It’s on par with a Stephen Spielberg Hollywood feature. I even looked during the end credits to find out who the composer was. Sadly, he was not credited. The game offers multiplayer, but servers were pretty scant. I did find one each time I logged on, and this is probably a testament to the game’s age. It was fun, but mostly consisted of aerial jousts with rockets being launched at each other. A lot of my kills were dumb luck. I won’t be in a hurry to play the original Air Conflicts or Air Conflicts: Vietnam, but if you have a few bucks left in your Steam Wallet during a Summer or Winter Steam sale, you could do worse. "

												Begins slowly and starts to pick up speed when the story progresses. Unfortunately this game also illustrates very well why action flight sims are a niche product: half-way through the game difficulty suddenly jumps a lot and every missions becomes a grinding bore. You destroy more planes than rambo kills people and you still fail missions. and those tight time limits... Good buy from a bundle anyways. Just dont pay full price on this!			"

												This is an arcade style flight sim with a focus on fun. The game looks great, damage models look nice and being it is an arcade game, the planes handle very easy. There are a number of different campaigns and a good variety of aircraft to fly. Going in for a bombing run and strafing enemy infantry as they scatter away from the tank you are about to destroy is very satisfying and looks great. If you want a fun flight sim without all the complexity and learning curve, and something you can just jump in and blow stuff up then this is perfect for you.I have played for almost 10 hours so far and I've only just started the last campaign. I did try out multiplayer briefly, but this game has a great length.Pros: - Game looks good.- Basic controls.- Multiple campaigns.- Good variety of aircraft.- Decent length.- Fun. Cons:- Not for you if you want an indepth flight simulator with complete realism.			"

												a suprising refresher.  There are better arcade air combat games out there, but not many. There's defintiely better air combat sims , so if you are looking for a sim style game go else where. This one does offer excellent arcade style air combat.The good: Fun easy to pick up game play. Tons of single player missions that vary in length.Nice mission variety. its got top secret jets in ww 2!  the bad Story seems implausible at times. The main character is a woman  (no offence ladies)  but durring WW2 I doubt there were any lady pilots seeing combat.Some of the missions seem a bit short. The aformentioned top secret jet planes are not unlocked till you are near the end of the game.Feels like a ""poor man's"" Blazing angels at times.    The graphics are good but not great for this kind of game. That said i'd give this game a 70% overall. it is a lot of fun especially if you like air plane games that are of the arcade variety like Blazing angels. BUT if you haven't played blazing angels 1 or 2 yet i'd recommend them first before you dive into this game. (I played blazing angels on xbox 360 but you can get both of them on steam as well).			"

												Air Conflicts: Secret War is a sequel of the original Air Conflicts from 2006. It is an arcade turn-and-burn WW2 flight game with some interesting story line rarely covered in WW2 games: the Balkan conflict, and how the resistance in Poland, Azerbaijan, and other eastern European countries fought the Nazi invasion. You play the daughter of a WW1 Ace, ""Deedee"" as you attempt to work your way out of Africa into Eastern Europe, attempting to work your way through the war, as sort of a mercenary / smuggler for hire of the Allied side, along with your mentor Tommy (who flew with your father) and Clive, the best mechanic / drunk. You start working for Flight Captain McIntyre of the RAF, but you'll end up helping a lot fo different factions on the Allied side, not all of whom are that friendly, as you attempt to survive WW2. The game has quite good graphics, and fully supports high resolution screens, as well as all sort of eye candy, from bump maps to high polygon models to post processing effects, and more. However, your windows need to use the regular DPI instead of any enlargement (125% or 150% under display) or you won't be able to run the config program as you can't see the buttons. Sound is quite good. The game play has variety of mission types, such as eliminate all enemies. Though it's the timed missions, as well as the ""plinking"" missions that are the most frustrating. As an example of timed mission, you have to destroy advancing German tanks within 2 minutes (or they'll fire upon the convoy and you'll fail the mission).  Another example is the ""plink the parachutes"" mission... German transports are bringing in paratroopers. You need to shoot down the paratroopers. Yes, you are here to shoot parachutes (WTF?!)  And you need to shoot dozens and dozens of them... until you killed at least 12% of those darn parachutes. There's another one where ""kill 70 soldiers on the ground with bombs or strafing"". YIKES. That parachute missions is the most hideous I've encountered so far, with the ""kill 70 soldiers on ground"" a close second. And I don't mean the objective, but the sheer frustration attempting to finish such. The parachute mission lasts 12 minutes, and you are barely informed of how you're doing. You simply keep shooting parachutes until you get a 'pass' or 'fail'. And yes, the paratroopers will scream as they fall from the sky. Same with ground soldiers you kill. On the other hand, there are some missions that are more... subtle, such as the ""smuggle"" missions where you are trying to stay undetected (with a stealth meter), or a rescue / recon mission about finding a signal (radio finder blips). There's also a mission or two where you simply pilot a captured Luftwaffe plane and fly over enemy territory for recon... and hopefully not get caught by air patrols. That can get tense. Depending on the aircraft you fly (and you fly a lot, from WW1 fighter to civilian transport, from fighters to fighter bombers, even a B-24... ) you get guns, bombs, and maybe rockets. The bombs and rockets are unlimited but takes time to regen. The guns are unlimited too, but won't fire if overheated.  If you can hit a plane with a rocket, you get insta-kill, but obviously that'll be quite difficult. Hit ground targets with bombs or rockets, but you need to be VERY precise... or you don't get the kill (and fail the objective). The bigger planes have additional turrets and tail guns, and those fire automatically. You can even take control fo the turrets and let AI fly for a while. Bombers may be able to drop salvos of bombs rather than one at a time. There are missions set in both WW1 and WW2. The story is told from POV of Dorothy ""Deedee"" Derbec, who fight in the various conflicts (that you play) in WW2, but also relive the missions talked about by friends of Deedee's father in WW1. As you complete missions, depending in kills and objective completion you gain 'stars', which you accumulate to add a point to your four attributes such as luck, leadership, armor, and damage, giving it a slight RPG flavor. This also controls what planes you can unlock, and there are more than a dozen planes from all sides: German, American, British, Russian, even a few jets and rocket powered planes, not to mention bombers, fighter bombers, and pure fighters. The locations are interesting, at least to those accustomed to regular WW2 games, as you do a lot of fighting in Eastern Europe (but that's understandable, the developers are from Slovakia), and they mixed in quite a bit of WW2 history (or at least, hypothetical history). The game has simplified landing... basically fly through a series of ""rings"" and you're considered ""landed"". Taking off is easy: full throttle and you'll take off. Controller is fully supported, and can be set to arcade or sim mode with different control schemes. There's also multiple difficulty levels to customize your game. There's also plenty of quick dogfight missions (random AI opponents) and plenty of multiplayer options. Enemy AI is not bad, as they do try to get on your tail and stay there. Overall, my impression of the game is positive, except for those painfully tedious ""plinking"" missions (i.e. kill paratroopers and kill 70 ground troops). I'm about 60% complete and I sincerely hope I don't run into more missions of that type. Once I got past the female narrator (female French accented English) the game is actually quite enjoyable. Enemy planes smoke and break apart convincingly, and at Rookie difficulty you generally do breeze through the missions (except for those tedious plinking missions). if you like the genre, arcade WW2 flight game, this game is quite good. Not a must play, but definitely something to try.			"

												Air Conflicts is an arcade version of a flight sim which means you can have loads of fun without having to learn a vast number of key bindings like you do with games like the digital combat sims such as The Warthog and Black Shark sims. It reminds me of a vastly improved version of Wings of War, which was a lot of fun to play with back in the mid 2000's. Compared to several other recently released flight sims it is rather dumbed down, but that said it's satisfyingly easy to play and has a reasonable number of varied missions to complete with decent graphics.If you're a hardened flight sim enthusiast this isn't for you, but if you just want to jump in and start blasting away without having to learn any key bindings then this is worth getting, though I'd recommend waiting till it's on sale, which I reckon won't be too  long as most of the reviews I've read weren't impressed with the game. Don't let that put you off though. Basically it's a budget arcade flyer. "

												Arcade flight combat game best suited to gamepads, not joysticks.The story is pretty boring and tends to drag on, told through pre and post mission briefings, narrated scenes with paintings and some in-game conversations (radio chatter).The campaign is alright and it does get better as you get further in.  The flight model/controls is highly simplified (designed for consoles) meaning you only turn up/down (pitch) and left/right. It is possible to roll the aircraft in 'simulation' mode but without rudder controls it is rather pointless.  Ammo also refills automatically.Shooting down lots of enemy planes and bombing lots of tanks, soldiers etc. is pretty fun. There's a bit of variety to missions but overall you still spend a lot of time shooting down planes and bombing vehicles. The AI for enemy planes, particularly for evasive manoeuvres is just awful though.Multiplayer is so laggy it's unplayable.6/10.			"

I played it a lot.Unfortunately all multi-player achievements are broken.If you only care for multi-player and do not mind the bugged achievements the game deserves a recommendation.But since I prefer single-player over multi-player, like a good story and care for achievements I can not recommend the game.

												Another drop in the bucket of air combat games. While the graphics are satisfactory, and good for persons with lower end computers (single-core, 512MB graphics card), the general game play is more arcade than simulation--this isn't a sit in your♥♥♥♥♥♥pit and sweat it out combat (even getting the♥♥♥♥♥♥pit view is hard, and flying the 'chase' default is a pain).  The combat experience leaves much to be desired in regards to realism--your ammo in unlimited, your 'damage' repairs over time, and your weapons have a very generous lead tolerance when it comes to targeting enemy aircraft. The plus side to the game is that it has a decent story-line to follow, that offers up different challenges to the player.If you are looking for a game that offers realism in terms of flight and fight--get DOS Box and download Aces Over Europe. Otherwise, this is just an annoying want-to-be. If you are looking for a fun arcade that offers a bit of eye-candy and a tad of challenge, go ahead, and have some fun with the game.			"

												This game looked good. I was in the mood for a good ww2 flight sim.  But it was terrible..  I crashed my plane into the ground, and it bounced back. And that was in simulator mode.  You don't have to aim, the game does that for you.  I don't understand, when they have the physics and graphics, why not add a realistic mode?  It could have been a good game, but instead it's completely worthless!			"

												A classic arcade shooter game but the planes feel like flying bricks and it has mouse and keyboard controls with auto aiming so the player doesn't even need to have the crosshairs on the target to hit.  If you want to play a flying shooter try War Thunder or World of Warplanes which are way better games.			"

												Not exactly a high quality AAA title, lacks very basic settings you should now expect from any PC game, resolution settings at the very least, but sadly, nothing, so you are forced to play in a square box at some pretty poor looking models. The game play itself is pretty solid, I assume this is very basic flight simulator stuff though, taking off and landing is very easy, it takes a lot for you to stall your plane. There is a wide selection of different planes to choose from at the start of your missions, each having their own different stats, strengths and weaknesses. I won't spoil too much, but one of the planes is so much better than any of the others so the large choice is kind of pointless once you work it out. There is an essence of customization when you reach certain goals, you will be granted experience points to improve your character (planes). I focused on agility and luck (which increases your critical shot chance), and this turned my plane into a little nippy bomber that could avoid pretty much any rockets! The main story took me about 8-9 hours to complete,  and it was quite an enjoyable play through. There is plenty of re-playability in the arcade mode, which is where I spent most of my time. I would recommend this game, however if you are playing this expecting a crisp AAA experience, you will be disappointed, if you go into this with the only expectation is that you are going to fly a plane and blow stuff up, you'll enjoy it. 7/10			"

												Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flight simulation set in a world war I + II scenario. During the 7 campaigns the player has to fly and fight through 49 missions. Before taking off, the player can choose between different aircrafts, each with different strengths and weaknesses.Within the missions the player gets different objectives like patrolling, sneaking, hit & run, bombing and escorting. Objectives are presented as dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player can upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes easier, have more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the game easier to control, while the second one gives more options to control the aircraft.Beside the campaign the game also features several multiplayer modes, local and via internet for up to four players.

												Fun Enteraining game reminds me of old 2d game Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe which is now abandonware and free to download at many site but here is one http://www.xtcabandonware.com/game/1386/secret-weapons-of-the-luftwaffeControls are simple with multi ways to control your aircraft with the use of Mouse/Keyboard Arcade mode, Joystick/Keyboard Simulator mode, Gamepad Arcade mode.I have started the game playing in Joystick/Gampad with Arcade mode because I do not own the proper Flight Joystick to play the game in Simulator mode without going nutts. I have not try yet but i doubt It will be enjoyable  playing in simulator mode with a Gamepad. The aircraft fly well and the story so far has been entertaining as you are a girl who's father was an Ace in WW2. Graphices are nice the terrain has detailed buildings, docks, ships, tanks, vehicals the usual things you would find in a arcade sim. Have not tryed the online mutiplayer yet I hope it is as enjoyable as the single player mode.The game and two more games of the same nature are on sale right now 75% of so you get Air Conflicts: Secret Wars, Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers & Air Conflicts: Vietnam all for $11 and some odd cents well worth it if you like these types of games.Not sure if they have coop support but if they do and anyone wants to be my wingman I would Love to give it a try just send me a msg/invite.Update. I have ust completed the Campain it was a blast the story telling was very good and missions well thought. There are alot of missions in the campain which is a good thing didn't want it to end to soon. After playing the game a while it really reminded me of a classic SNES game called Aces High or Wings 2 Aces High, I loved playing that game fighting the aces at the end and if your pilot died he stayed dead. You had 5 pilots each with there own unquie skills each one was skilled best for certain missions, strafing/bombing/air combat so on. This game has a few hard missions like shooting down a zillion guys parachuting out of bombers that mission took many trys to complete but it was fun. This game is a classic to me now. Well on to the next one ""Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers"", hope it is as enjoyable as ""Air Conflicts: Secret Wars""			"

												As a fan of Ace Combat 5 and Zero, I miss a good flight game now that Im playing more PC games. Air Conflcits fills that nice for a good old semi realistic flight game perfectly. Some people complain or have arguements against the intro picture at the start of new missions, but I think they add a charm that is compariable to the charm given by the Earth Defense Force Series. There is also stealth parts in missions, which a unique feature not seen in most flight games. However, the controls are a bit wonky for a gamepad, but once learned you can make some interesting dogfighting moves. All in all, worth the ten bucks if you have been itiching for a an arcade-simulation flight game for  a while			"

												A fresh foray into a genre I do not normally touch and one which I did not regret in the least. Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an accade flying game at its core and takes place primarly during WWII (with some flashbacks to WWI), throwing you into the cockpit of dozens of different airplanes during dangerous and daring missions. While this game is not a realistic flight simulator, it does not pretend to be. Instead, Air Conflicts offers a fun, exciting, and gripping story as you battle your way through the various missions. Give this game a look if you want to try out a flying game with more emphesis on story than on true flight simulation realism.			"

												Sort of a ""poor man's Ace Combat,"" this game can be quite fun. The core flight and combat mechanics are simple, but competently executed. This makes for gameplay that remains basically fun, even if it isn't all that varied.The game does indeed have some flaws. The voice acting is sometimes unconvincing, and every so often you'll catch an error where earlier text dialogue loads into the subtitle area. The stealth mission functionality is not as advertised - there's no ""detection zone"" displayed on your radar - and so certain stealth missions present a frustrating difficulty spike. There are little hints here and there of features that didn't quite get fully implemented, but still made it in somehow.But the game is remarkably fun, because even simplified, ""arcade-style"" air combat can offer lots of opportunities to try a mission in a slightly different way.No, this isn't a AAA title, but it can be highly enjoyable if you're willing to ""suspend your disbelief"" a bit and enjoy the ride.

												By far the weakest of the ""Air Conflicts"" series of games.  The campaign is highly repetitive and the AI is little match for a child let alone an experienced flight sim buff.  The graphics and aircraft damage are very well done, scenery looks quite nice.  The real selling factor on this is the multiplayer which can be quite a bit of fun.  Unfortunately, the community for it has dried up a bit with the release of subsequent titles, so you're better off buying those both for a better campaign and the larger online multiplayer community.  The game's not terrible, but I just can't recommend a purchase given the draw backs and easily available alternatives.			"

												Recommend or not recommend is such a polarizing review method. I played for a short time and buzzed through the first first levels. It was enjoyable enough but I found the story too thin for me and the game play bland. I became confused on the last level as to what I actually needed to do. While I am ""recommending"" this game I doubt I will ever pick it up again.That's me though, it still played well enough that it may turn out to be some one else's cup of tea.			"

												Make no mistake, this is NOT a simulation. It's Mario Kart with WWII airplanes; that being said, it's kinda fun. Doesn't take itself too brainnumbingly serious, like it's more recent successor.			"

												Pretty good arcade game with very impressive and long singleplayer campaign.And if you are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and spoiled child, you can easily change settings and resolution. Just go to installation folder of the game and hit Configure.exe (Full HD resolution is available too).			"

												Fantastic game, it's not perfect but still great. There's drawings, narration, solid storyline and very few frustrating moments.The planes are nice, the graphics are alright and you can gain level ups to boost certain stats and you can unlock planes with stars you earn from objectives. It is a bit limited though, as the stats barely made any difference and you don't have a choice as to which plane you're unlocking but in the end it didn't matter, it was a fun, solid game.I think the worst part of the game are the timed missions but on the hardest difficulty, I only had to retry them half a dozen times before nailing it.I even learned a thing or two from this game, apparently there was a few jet aircrafts during WW2.Also, the voice actors are absolutely incredible, loved every minute of it.

												Air Conflicts SW is the first chapter of this serie, but it is still a good game.Following the sad plot of a young girl, daughter of a decorated aviation man, you will travel all over africa and europe to accomplish the 50 missions of the WW2. The story speak about the memorable missions of the father of the protagonist throwing you inside an old fokker in vintage flashbacks, and then returning to '42 when instead you play as the daughter with modern airplanes.The plot is good enough to be credible and of course to make you combat against enemy units, shooting in this arcade game without any remorse about simulation. The entire brand of Air conflicts is arcade and I like it. Perhaps the graphic is a bit outdated, but the gameplay is still much funny and bombing and shooting will be a pleasure inside those infinite (but limited in boundaries) valleys.The only defect that i've found is a boring endurance mission, where a big number of airplanes flying from point A to B must be detroyed, followed by other waves. While this mechanic is deadly stupid to be coded in a game, it results almost impossible to take down heavy vehicles at light speed that can get out of the map to an entire sky region, without reacting to my attacks and proceeding to the destination. I've seen this kind of mission in other games (Ace combat) and I find it stupid to be inserted in 2017 games because they are unlucky and frustating. But a skip mission button can be pushed here for 3 times.Other less defects are the airplane that fly througth buildings without exploding, but it's just a convention to make credible trajectories in dynamic environment. At last the mission are quick and short, so they will fly one by one until the last.The good is all the rest: Good skyes, good manouver using mouse and keyboard, good explosion, alternate of missiles and bombs, and a good number of airplanes. Also mission offers a good variety.I hope you get it for a budget price and that you don't focus just on graphics, here it is just normal. Gameplay must be the rule!bye.Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7/10			"
