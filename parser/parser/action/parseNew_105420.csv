												Rating: 8.5/10Status: Awesome What is it Ms Splosion Man is a precision based platformer that will test you skills.The Good:+ 45+ Single player and Multiplayer levels+ Great variety in each level, you will splode off speed barrels, regular barrels, timed walls, moving platforms, ride rocket cards and zip on railings. The developers made sure that every level provides something fresh to test your platforming skills+ Great challenge, each level introducing new concepts and builds upon it through out the game. The first few levels are easy but as you move further along things become increasingly difficult+ Lots of good platforming puzzles in each level, good satisfaction when you figure out what you have to do. + Great artwork and graphics + Lots of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie references + Possibly one of the strangest endings in video game history. The Bad:- Multiplayer community is dead so you won't be able to play any of the multiplayer levels. Their is a mode however that lets you play with one controller however this is very frustrating and is not the way the levels were meant to be played, still it was nice of the developers to include it- The game can and will be frustrating at times, this isn't necessarily a bad point against the game per se but if your a gamer who gets frustrating easily, you may want to avoid this game. Conclusion:I loved this game and if you have the patience you will too. One of the best platforming games around.			"

												Amazingly Impressive.Playing this game reminded me of the days when I played Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, it's just as addicting, this game is packed to the brim with personality, it's goes from funny to downright hilarious, I couldn't help as Ms. 'Splosion Man quoted famous singers like Beyonce and Lady Gaga and then turned right around and referenced movies like Predator and Willy Wonka, and the ending is probably one of the most funny things of all time, the gameplay is your basic platformer, easy to grasp but difficult to master, and has a lot of content, there are 47 single player levels, tons of unlockables and secret levels, and then 50 multiplayer levels, and shoes to collect in every one of the single player and multiplayer levels, so there is a lot to keep you busy, and just when you think you've seen everything the levels can offer they through in a new twist to keep you on your toes, but with all these good things it does have its flaws, long load times are frequent, while Ms. 'Splosion man's one liners are funny by the hundredth time you hear them they begin to lose their charm, same goes for the soundtrack, and levels could use more variety, and it can be frustratingly difficult at times, where if your even a hair off, or a split second too late or too early it means an instant death, but thankfully they gave you an option to skip sections that are too hard for you, and checkpoints are generally well placed but there are several levels that have awful checkpoints, and one minor complaint is that when you hit certain enemies they slam onto the screen blocking your view of what's happening, I found it incredibly annoying, but even with these flaws I found myself falling into the just one more level trap time and time again, this truly is a great game, and if your looking for a fun platformer and don't mind some punishing difficulty look no further, however the easily frustrated should look elsewhere.

												Ms. Splosion Man is the sequel to Splosion Man, which can be found exclusively on the XBox Live Arcade. The story is such: Splosion Man was created by a team of scientists and gets loose, and after a lot of death and building damage, is finally captured by the scientists who created him. In celebration, the scientists accidentally create his gender-swapped clone, Ms. Splosion Man, who begins reaking the same havoc as Splosion Man.The gameplay is simple: It's a 2D platformer with long levels that can go in any direction. You 'splode. By sploding, you can kill enemies, achieve wall-jumps, activate traps, press buttons, and achieve super-jumps. The game has two types of death: certain items hurt you to no-sploding abilities, and then kill you, whereas some elements will kill you upon touch. Your score at the end of the level is mostly dependent on time.The gameplay is excellent. You have to complete a level in a certain way, but the game does reward you for exploration with a collectible in each level: shoes. Often, you can try a portion of a level multiple times, giving you a little bit of breathing room. Other times, your platforming has to be near-perfect, each jump timed or going through the level as fast as you can do it.Sometimes, the control is a little awkward, and a splosion won't work in the way you want it to. Combine that with some checkpoints being a bit infrequent, and you get irritated playing certain sections multiple times.You can spend points in the mall for in-game bonuses, such as music, concept art, backgrounds, etc. They don't affect gameplay, but they're cool to look at. Since the game is very fun, you might find it worth it.One of the key points to this game is it's humor. Splosion' Man has always been really funny regarding it's cutscenes, and this game isn't an exception. It's a great addition, especially since the cutscenes introduce new enemies, gameplay mechanics, and different worlds.My only big qualm about this game: I really, really wish this game didn't require Microsoft Game Center. It's DLC that's unneeded since it's on the Steam platform. It uses it for Challenges, updated through Microsoft, a feature I think isn't really needed.Some people have a concern about the game's gender stereotypes. Some people may take offense to the valley-girl, pink, always shoe-craving, girl-power song-singing, pink, make-up and bow-wielding main character. I think the game is using this satirically, some people saying that it's the fact that this character is so inhuman that it's poking fun at it's laughable portrayal of female characters in video games. Others say that even by doing this, it's still encouraging the ""girl"" character stereotype.Either way you feel about this, this game is really solid. It's a good addition to a Steam library, and I would reccomend it to people who like singleplayer platformer adventures. If you want a multiplayer adventure, I'd reccomend using Xbox for ease. 9/10.			"

												I don't know what kind of drugs you need to consume in order to make a game like this, but seriously, I want an OVERDOSE of that.I haven't had that much fun with a game in a long time. If you like 2D (or 2.5D) platformers and you like the DK-syle, this is the game for you. And the multiplayer only increases the crazyness. If you don't enjoy this game with friends you're either not human or cathartic.Positive things:+ Colorful and friendly visuals+ Very dynamic levels, where some obstacles can come without time to think but not as mercyless as games like BIT.TRIP RUNNER. Here reflexes are rewarded.+ Ms. Splosion Man dances ALL THE TIME. Because swag.+ 100 levels (50 Single Player, 50 Multiplayer).+ The amount of stupidity, nosense and overdose results needed to develop this gem.+ Achievements are cool, because OCD.+ Very basic controls that allow you to do everything.Negative things:- Although controls are smooth, the game somehow looks slow to respond to your movement. It's like Ms. Splosion's butt weights a lot or something.- I've experienced some issues with the leaderboards, where my marks took some minutes to upload. Otherwise it always takes 5-10 seconds.- ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAVE THIS GAME. SERIOUSLY DUDES, WHAT THE HELL, I'M SURE ALL OF YOU HAVE GAMES FROM YOUR STEAM LIBRARY WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHERE DID THEY COME FROM, AND SOME OF THEM ARE PURE GARBAGE. PICK THIS GAME NOW AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT.Final mark: Drugs/10 I would recommend this game to every person alive.			"

												This game really took me by surprise. I wasn’t expecting the quality of gameplay it delivered. The character alone is hilarious to control as she runs around spouting lyrics to popular songs and having random and wacky conversations with herself,the player and often enemies.Most the levels in the game are well designed with a nice flow that can get difficult or somewhat stay mellow as you progress through it. You’ll feel rewarded as you accomplish task and or pull off combo chains properly. And there are levels that are straight out ball busters and will troll you till you get it down pat with trial and error. Almost forgot the levels can be dynamic and change in mechanics as you go.The game at times can feel like you’re playing a Super Meat Boy with lengthy levels, then other times it feels like I Wanna Be The Guy due to the traps and tricky level design which the user could possibly not react to or evade without knowledge of, aka trial and error. But you know that is a nice part of the game, wouldn’t be fun if it was hold your hand FEZ mode easy. Not to mention the game has outstanding music, some tracks that will make you laugh out of your mind and will make you feel ready to kick some butt.One thing I personally like about the game is the insane over the top humor, the boss battles are unique and by far one of the best parts of the game. I don’t want to give away any spoilers but four words Mike Tyson Punch-Out, lol. On the other hand there are a few cons I think I should mention about the game as well. 1: hard to see where you are or how you are positioned with all of the explosion effects/smoke. There is a part of the game where you hop on flying cars and I swear the smoke effects they used there need to be removed completely. 2: You sometimes have no idea how many times you exploded leaving you to fall to your death because there is no real meter on the screen that shows it, I see what they were going for with the no hud display but the character(s) are too small to see the weathered effects on their body most the time.There are some other issues but none that are as big as the two I mentioned here, but hey I give this game a recommendation and say those who like platformers should try it out. Don’t be deterred by its name (which is poking fun at ms.pacman). Like Jesus said in the bible Luke 24: 16-48 “Tho shall not judge a game by its name, but by its kickass gameplay.”-Jesus			"

												Awesome game now past level 2I'm about seven levels in now and feel safe to say that the rest of the game is just as good as the first level we were only able to sample before the fix.Good game for speed running and there was a lot of thought put into the design and original catchy music.The challenge balance is the best part. Not so old school difficult as to chase people away but not as 'clean' as other modern day platformers. I'd compare the difficulty to a version of Donkey Kong Country with more frequent checkpoints added so obstical gauntlets are not as painstaking to have to repeat. The game play itself requires only one button aside from the joystick and takes advantage of richochette and repel.I'm pretty sure that first level, however, had already proved this game to be a highly competent platformer with some pretty intense eye candy moments - it was just a matter of this recent patch getting us into the second level or having to wait for a quad core pc that could've overcompensated for the porting/optimizing mishap.So anyone previously on the fence - I highly recommend! The turd is out of the pool and it has been thouroughly cleaned now!Price Recommended: $10			"

												This is a tough, but fun platformer. Its funny, and enjoyable. You can play a few minutes each day and be done with it. There's no need to play for hours at a time.You can replay levels, there's a multiplayer option, which I haven't tried. There's separate endings for single and multiplayer.It does use GFWL, I hope it gets patched out before GFWL is shut down in July.I purchased it for a bit over $2 and have it on the XBOX 360 as well *won it in a McDonald's promo.*It's not as hard as Super Meat Boy, but it is hard. It has checkpoints in the game though.If you like hard platformer games and have a wicked sense of humor, its worth buying. "

												The first thing I should note about Ms. Splosion Man is if you're turned off by the aesthetic stop reading. Because that's the most notable part of the game.I personally dislike the aesthetic of the game and find it annoying. But getting beyond that you have yourself a very entertaining sidescroller that focuses on building momentum via propelling yourself with explosions. The game introduces it's systems gradually and it includes a Mario 3-esque overworld. The game also has an extremely good soundtrack that remixes 80's music, and the pause menu music IS just 80s music.Ms Splosion Man is great for speedrunners or casual enthusiasts to sidescrollers. It also keeps a decent length and is challenging to boot. Bare in mind it's not for everyone and unless you're curious I'd recommend watching a video of the gameplay before purchasing.NOTE: While the game did at one point have Games for Windows Live, the developers graciously patched it out. I highly recommend you buy this game since the PC port is the best version of this game now.			"

												This is a review of the multiplayer mode of this game, which stands alone from the single player mode.Wow, what a game. Crazy, crazy, difficult, but a great game. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys multiplayer platformers. It is insanely difficult, almost to the point of rage-quitting several times, but my wife and I played through every single level and made it all the way to the end. Beating this game in multiplayer mode will stand as one of the greater achievements I've had in gaming. Good: Fun, great controls, true multiplayer(not just the single player mode with two people), and amazing platforming. Also, the game has a good sense of humor.Bad: While the controls are great, they occasionally fail. Several times, we went through bombs that were supposed to launch us up. Rare, but enough to notice.Final rating: 8/10Best platformer out there except for Rayman Origins and Legends.  "

												A phenomenal (and challenging) platformer that requires concentration, memorization and good reflexes. Ms. Splosion Man's defining trait is its signature splosion mechanic (essentially an offensive triple jump) that is used to both navigate picturesque levels and wreak havoc on them. While its gameplay is reminiscent of other 2D platformers, MSM's pronounced verticality and frequent shifting of camera angles really stand out (and might cause motion sickness to some players). Soundrack, which was thought up as a spoof of pop music, is excellent and it compliments the main character's whimsical persona. The game also has a co-operative muliplayer mode (both online and local) with its own set of levels and a different ending. Strongly recommended to those who like challenging platformers such as Super Meat Boy or They Bleed Pixels.			"

												Colorful 2.5D platformer with simple controls, but very hard to master despite moving and jumping being all you do.  The levels are pretty challenging and very dependent on your timing and reflexes.  There's a couple of challenging/frustrating areas throughout the three worlds, but nothing that I thought was too unforgiving.  There is a lot of replay value in this for those who are interested in beating their old times, and the feature to race against yourself or others on the leaderboard through their silhouette is pretty interesting.The protagonist's endlessly repeated one-liners and sometimes cringe-worthy dialogue can get a bit tedious, and it certainly doesn't help in certain areas where you are constantly going back and trying to figure out how to platform through the section.  Not much of a ""story"" really happening, but the ending is pretty entertaining and I'm sure a real treat for those who might have played the original Splosion Man.Overall, the game is worth checking out and runs well on PC.  Thankfully the game was patched a while back removing the GFWL integration, and even better - my save file was converted as well!			"

												The original Splosion Man on XBox 360 was quite literally...a blast. It was a somewhat masochistic platformer with a great gimmick of blowing yourself up to complete progressively difficult platforming challenges and its only real fault was that  the creativity sorta ran out by the game's midpoint.At first glance, and even first play, Ms. Splosion Man can look and feel an awful lot like a reskin and rehash of the first game, but Ms. Pink and Sassy brings her own bit of originality to the formula that helps keep the concept flowing and interesting all the way to the end. While the original game focused almost entirely on platforming, Ms. Splosion Man dashes in a fun bit of puzzle solving, twitch reaction focused speed sections, and fun boss encounters to keep things moving along at a nice pace without ever fizzling out. The stages are much more varied this time around and their scope much larger, which makes hunting down those elusive shoes and secret exits much more fulfilling since the paths to reach them are often fraught with much more danger than a stage's normal path. All that said, Ms. Splosion Man is still a fairly difficult game, and checkpoints in stages can sometimes be a little too far apart, so if you're averse to not always having a love-love relationship with your games, you may wanna pass. But if you're up for a bright, upbeat, and endlessly endearing bit of hardcore platforming, Ms. Splosion Man's got something that'll keep you nice and charged up.			"

												This game caught me by surprise. No really. I had a blast playing this for hours on end, and it's such a unique expperience. If you ever liked the original Splosion Man, this will give you more of what you like and more. It features a scaling challenge, unique level puzzles and platforming, nd blends them near perfectly. It also has optional stages which really push you to your limit. I know I had a blast with them, and figureing them out. The game throws just enough challenge at you to make you think, but not enough to frustrate you. Every time you die, you'll never blame the game for being unfair. That's the kind of challenge I personally relish.Plotwise, you're an explosive woman finding an explosive guy. Not really that deep, but it's not like you're playing a visual novel anyway, so the story isn't much of an issue. I like it because it's nice and simple, and never impedes your game. It's got a similar whimsy to your average Mario game, and I use that as a compliment. Graphically, it's pretty cool. Nice and colorful, but it can contrast with darker themes later in the game. The game certainly has varity, I'll tell you that much. Musically, it's surprisingly top notch. I expected dubstep or some kind of garbage for hipsters, but the OST is as divrse as the rest of th game. From 50's love serenades to high beat, blood pumping rock chords, and the classic theme with a more pop twist, the game runs the gamut of tunes. My personal favorite is ""Oh Mandy"". So what's the verdict? This game is fantastic. Buy it on sale if you can, but it's still worth the 10 bucks.			"

												A game like Ms. Spllosion Man could drive someone insane. Is that a negative? I think not. From the moment you hear the pop based soundtrack you know you're in for a fun, feminine good time. The game is best described as a very hard puzzle-platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy, except with explosions instead of meat. While on the difficult side, Ms. Splosion Man, voiced by the fantastic anime dub voice actress Monica Rial (Stocking (Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt) and Tsubaki (Soul Eater), edges you on with her manic pop-culture references and pop lyrics from the '80's to today. One complaint I can think of is that sometimes the puzzles become a huge trial-by-error and can cause frustration that leads to four-letter-fury. Bottom line play this game if you are up for a challenge and to let loose and have silly fun.			"

												It's a decent platformer, but I've played too many decent platformers to bother with one that doesn't have something unique to bring to the table. In this case the attempt at something unique seems to be unsubtle commentary about sexism in video games, but it doesn't really work, and with credit to Richard Cobbett of RPS, ""down that path goes most bad game parody – joking about how crap something is, and then straight-up doing the crap thing instead of the trickier task of finding some way to subvert it.""

												First off, do not let the super gurly atmoshpere and pop culture references fool you.  This game is not for casual platformer fans and gamers that rage easily.  Ms. Splosion Man is a super fast paced precision platformer with some puzzle elements along the way.  If you are someone who enjoyed the Donkey Kong or Bit Trip Runner series, then this game will be right up your alley!   The only suggestion that I will give is that you mute the girls voice before playing, it can get old after a while.

												If you love games like Donkey Kong Country or Rayman Origins/Legends, then Ms. Splosion man is worth your time!Pros:- Can be very challenging and somewhat rewarding when you get things going- Puzzle elements are fun- Lots of levelsCons:- Sometimes it feels like you've died a bit cheaply- End game doesn't really offer anything new apart from challenging levels - could've offered something like upgrade able abilities or more techniques to solve puzzles- Secret exits are cool, but it's annoying you have to go back through the same level where you found the exit to continue onGame can drag a little bit towards the end, but it's a good platformer!

												With its rocket pace, dynamite visuals and an explosive twist on standard platforming fare, Ms. Splosion Man entertains at an incendiary level, and the rapid-fire comedy that comes from its volatile protagonist is the totally neat treat. To put it simply, Ms. Splosion Man is the bomb.			"

												Ms. Sploision Man is a fun experience with a good pacing. By the later levels, the game relies heavily on memorization and repetition due to traps and pitfalls that are incredibly unlikely to forsee, so the annoyance can tick up very strongly as it goes on.It remains a fun game, however, and completing the more difficult levels produces a strong sense of accomplishment, rather than relief. It's a fine line, but one that keeps you starting up the next level to get frustrated all over again.			"

												A fun, colorful, challenging, puzzle jumping game that controls well. Instead of jumping, your character doesn't jump, she explodes and it propels her in the air the distance of a jump. All this because she ate bean burritos at taco bell before the game. The main colors could have been something other than pink though. Hopefully later in the game you get to explode next to a barrel of tnt that is next to a bus mixed full of jews, mexicans, dallas cowboys fans, pittsburg steelers fans, and challenged inner city kids. If only my prayers to God would be answered.Fun enough for a once through if you like platform action games, with heavy emphasis on platforming. 7.5/10			"

They are varied enough to not be boring, and the difficulty is just right (not Super Meat Boy hard, but hard enough).If you grew up playing Super Mario Bros. and have a hard time finding decent modern platforming games, you should give this one a try.8/10.

												I really enjoy platforming games but I'm afraid that I can't recommend this one.The game has a nice comedic art style, sound effects and music, but that can lose its charm when you have to redo an area 20 times in a row. The game can be more frustrating than fun in areas where you have to do millisecond perfect timing or you die and have to redo a lot.If you die enough times without progressing than the game does allow you to skip forward to the next checkpoint, so I've been having more fun with the game ever since deciding to use that function whenever I get too annoyed.The only reason I've played this game for so many hours is because I try not to uninstall games until after I've finished their singleplayer. Ultimately, I regret a lot of the time I spent on this game.If you're into speed running than this game has some nice features and difficulty for you, but for people that just want a fun platformer, definitely don't get this game.

												This felt like a really annoying sequel to Splosion Man (which I've played on the 360). Frankly, I found the ""feminization"" of the player character (the titular ""Ms. Splosion Man"") to be absurdly sexist in the most casual manner possible -- making cheap jokes (which are really just visual gags, as it's a wordless game, so maybe I should cut them some slack). I just found the whole ""slap pink on it and toss in some horrific stereotypes about teenage girls etc"" to be really grating.I got it for something like $2.50, so it wasn't like I got horribly ripped off. The original is just... less obnoxious? Meh. Perhaps I'm just becoming old and jaded. I just found it really irksome.If you really have a platformer itch that needs scratching, get Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams. That game is easily amongst the best platformers I have ever played. I play with a controller, so I'm not sure how convenient the keyboard setup is.TL;DR -- competent, but the original didn't grate at my nerves with (likely unintentional) casual sexism and annoying cutscenes. Get Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams if you want a light-ish platformer that's fun to pick up and play whenever.			"

												Not as enjoyable as the first for a few reasons. 1) The bosses were disappointing and boring. 2) There were several maps that had trails of dead-end explosions that were simply trial and error to discover the right path which is never fun in a platformer. 3) Many of the levels simply dragged on for far too long with little to show for novelty or uniqueness. 4) There were multiple points in each level that simply felt like placeholders to make each area longer. Points in its favor were most notably the soundtracks to the second world and when using Mandy as well as the use of cars.Overall, the game was pretty lackluster but worth a few dollars.			"

												A crappy difficult platformer jumping game developed by two people.Game can be explained by one word: ""difficult"".At the begining of the game (intro), the developer actually tries to head on against the Unreal engine.Well, you have miserably failed.This game ""IS"" developed for female players in mind. This game is so difficult, all the female players will rage quit this game and won't touch your ""xbox"" or PC again.The ""xbox"" is in double quotation marks because this game was initially released for the xbox.The game is totally trial and error based, so you are going to die and learn what lies ahead, then  respawn from a check point, to repeat what you just did 20 seconds ago in a loop until you could get to the end point of a level.The worst of all is that the QTE has no indication, you will just have to figure it by yourself.Although I said QTE, it is either barrels or switches that require precisely timed button press.If I were you, I won't look at this crappy game. Go play something else.Save your time, save your mentality.			"

												It's a good precision platformer, but I just feel the visuals are too bland. Yeah, initially they look nice, but after 13 levels of playing in the exact same-looking environment, it gets old. Controls are simple and fair, but the gameplay itself can be pretty challenging. Not one for casual gamers, that's for sure. The only issue I have is that the game has endless amounts of loading screens, as you jump from one section of the menu to the next. Also, the menu navigation isn't great, probably because they just did a direct port without adding mouse support for the PC.Ultimately, I stopped playing because of that and the existence of GFWL. Devs say they are gonna get the game Steam-integrated, so I shall resume playing this once that is done.			"

												Splosion Man was a game about turning scientists into steaks, Ms Splosion Man is a game about turning scientists into steaks while singing Beyoncé lyrics.Also there's a song about donuts, so pretty much a perfect game.10/10			"

												This game is absolutely wonderful. Really great if you've played Splosion Man prior. The final boss fell kinda flat but even then it was all silly and wonderful. A must get title. I hope we get a splosion jr game in the future!			"
