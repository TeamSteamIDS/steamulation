												In 1997, John Romero of Ion Storm Dallas approached the producer of System Shock, Warren Spector, said ""Make the game of your dreams. No limits"" and the end result was the creation of Ion Storm Austin and their first game; Deus Ex.Deus Ex is a First-Person Shooter/Role Playing Game with a heavy emphasis on stealth and thinking carefully about your surroundings. The game provides you, from start to finish, with a number of ways to solve every single problem put in front of you. The level design is open ended enough for any method of completion.The game is inspired by Looking Glass Studio's System Shock and Thief and as a result, the freedom you have to approach and complete your objectives is simply staggering. You are given a huge world to explore, some tools you might want to use to complete your objectives and let loose upon your environment. Careful exploration is needed to uncover all of the hidden gadgets, secret tunnels and small story elements.The only time you will ever receive a Game Over is if you die. There are no penalties for doing things your way and the game dynamically changes as you play. People in the game may think differently of you if you don't do what they expect of you and may effect certain things as you progress through the story.Speaking of Story, the story of Deus Ex is one of a heavily political and conspiratorial nature. You play as JC Denton, an agent on his first day with the UNATCO, an organization that deals with the growing rise of foreign and domestic terrorism in the early 21st century. It does not take long however for JC to discover that he is merely a pawn in a huge political game that leans far beyond his own understanding.He will have to travel far and wide to gather the help he needs from unsuspecting allies. Hong Kong, Paris, New York City and various US locations will be visited, all of which have a fitting Tech-noir feel and stellar music to match. One listen of the music for Hong Kong and you'll never forget it.Being an Role-Playing Game as well as a shooter, Deus Ex allows you to customize your character to your preference. The game features a skill system that will allow you to improve JC in a number of fields. Like big guns? Master the Heavy Weapons skill and go in with the GEP Gun blowing people and locked doors to bits. Want to silently infiltrate every location with skill and precision? Master Computers and Lockpicking to open doors, hack security machines, ATM machines for money (if you don't find any bank account details lying around) and read e-mails for clues about the environment you're in.Another notable part of Deus Ex are its unforgettable characters. Every major character in the game has a well rounded personality with their own expectations of you. What you do in the world or tell them can affect how they treat you which might be crucial in your immediate future.There are boss battles in the game but some may be avoided entirely by learning information from other characters. If you do walk into a boss fight, you even have the choice of running right out the door behind them and not bother engaging them at all! When was the last time a game let you do that? Things might even happen to that character later on if you don't fight them.With all the above praise, Deus Ex is not without its small faults however. Some of the levels are huge and empty of detail, forcing long walks if you want to get anywhere specific in a short amount of time. The large empty levels also make the game feel a little devoid of life in some places. A lot of areas that look as if they should be full of people, are completely empty except for maybe two or three characters at once.With every conspiracy theory under the sun under the microscope in Deus Ex, you must learn to question everything and trust no one.  You may even find that things that this game was talking about in the Year 2000 are happening right now or have a very real possibility to happen at some point during our lifetimes; wealth and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor across the globe, omnipresent electronic surveillance, technical augmentations that can enhance the human race beyond what nature intended and much more.It's a roller-coaster ride of a game that everyone simply has to play to experience at least once. Your favourite game was probably inspired by this piece of art so do yourself a favour, set next weekend aside and play this game already. You will never leave the house without your tin-foil hat again!			"

												Deus Ex is one of the Greatest Games i've ever played. And I remember when space invaders came out!You are doing yourself a terrible disservice by not trying out this game, even though by todays standards the graphaics may lack.. but the substance, and the depth and ambiance is there.Dont let my lack of play time on steam fool you. I still have my original ISO and its installed on my laptop.I purchased this game just in case.. and also so i could write a review of this game.I can honestly say I will never; not be able to run this game. Even if it means keeping a relic of a pc around 50 years from now just so i can fire this game up on occasion and play it, I will do just that.Cheers. "

												If Steam was Deus Ex...- I could write this review through the front door, guns blazing.- I could write this review descending through the rafters of the roof.- I could write this review while snaking around through air vents.- I could write this review while picking off targets at a distance.- I could write this review while slinking around, performing non-lethal takedowns.- I could write this review while wiring the security systems to turn on my enemies.I had to go this far back in time to get a game that really understands what choice, flexibility, and options are in a video game... what a shame.

												Where it all began. Can't believe that this was released on Windows 2000, 15 years ago! Still to this day we are gifted with excellent mods for it, currently Caustic Creative are developing a wonderful overhaul mod named Deus Ex: Revision (be sure  to check it out!).This was one of my first childhood games, I can still remember certain stealth patterns to the levels. Really good to revisit from time to time and like I mentioned, mods really revitalise an old classic. JC Denton the badass! The question is, which ending did you choose?For those wondering, the storyline of the Deus Ex series is as follows;2027 – Human Revolution2029 – Mankind Divided2052 – Deus Ex2072 – Invisible WarSo the events of the original come AFTER the events of Human Revolution.

												Deus Ex has to be one of -the- best RPGs I've ever played. The 30-something-hour story is quite interesting and spans many different locations filled to the brim with things to discover and areas to explore. The dialogue does have its quirky moments where the recordings feel so off, but it does not impact the overall experience in any significant way. If anything, the corny lines and the questionable delivery of said lines only add to it. The music in this game just kicks ♥♥♥ and fits the mood perfectly. Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is most definitely worth your time and money. I don't care how much or little you're planning  to pay for it. Just get it, ok? :)			"

												What can I say about Deus Ex, it has some of the best story telling in any game ever, and you definitely won't find another game that gives you as many options to complete it the way you want to, it has a perfect mix of RPG elements, stealth, combat, plot twists, has A TON of alternate story lines, and a lot of really fun augmentations, basically you haven't played a good RPG until you've played this.Do not let the Unreal Engine 1 graphics scare you, also know that it has some wonky AI at times, and some really hilarious voice acting, but fear not, there is still more details in this game then several modern games today combined. Kinda sad really that in the 11 years since, nobody has managed to come close to its artistry, forget matching or surpassing this gem.			"

												FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, INSTALL A MAP PATCH BEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME! The GOTY Edition has older editions of the maps due to an archiving error at Ion Storm. There is an unofficial patch to restore the maps to the correct versions which fixes many things. Without it, many pathways are missing, bugs unfixed, and an entire ending looks like crap.http://www.dxm.be/navigator.php5?lang=en&content=202Deus Ex was a pioneer in the action RPG genre. It manages to tell a great story without ever forcing the story in the way of gameplay. There's a few unoficial patches that let you run this game better on modern PC's. There's a lot of good mods for this game, which is really good.GAMEPLAY:Deus Ex's gameplay has aged a bit, although it's still very fun. Most notably, the game has a level of interactivity that has rarely been reached even by modern titles. The game isn't very linear, it more or less just nudges you in the right direction. The first few missions are kind of slow, so don't quit before you complete them. Pretty much all of the maps are large and expansive and have tons of items, enemies, and unique NPC's scattered around. There's a huge level of interactivity in the game world, which was a big selling point when this game came out. You have a variety of skills in the game that you can upgrade. You gain skill points by completing objectives or discovering hidden areas. You can also get ""augmentations"" to give your character new and unique abilities. Some people say that the shooting gameplay has aged - if that applies to you, remember to upgrade your weapon skills. It makes a huge difference.(You may want to install Shifter or Biomod to improve the gameplay, although I prefer the original.)PRESENTATION:The graphics weren't paticularly amazing for the time (they weren't bad, either), but it manages to use what they had to create a wonderful atmosphere. They depict many run-down decrepit buildings littered with homeless, sick people to show a country on the edge of collapse. The music is great and really adds to the atmosphere. Every location has it's own unique soundtrack that fits great and adapts to what you are currently doing. This game has full voice acting along with tons of unique characters, so the voice acting quality will vary. All main characters will have at least decent voice acting.(If you want to augment your graphics even further, install the D3D10 renderer and New Vision)STORY: (Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything):Deus Ex takes place in a cyberpunk vision of the world where high-tech prosthetics and transhuman augmentations are commonplace. You are introduced to a memorable cast of characters. A great thing they do with their characters is that they take care in reminding you that they are still human beings and not just targets or objectives. It's all about uncovering ancient secrets and it's pretty cool in this aspect.Its story was great for the time - and even today it is rarely equaled in the philosophical depth it has. The gameplay was revolutionary, blending shooting and RPG elements. In summary, I'd definitely recommend this - it's a truly classic game.			"

												First of all, don't let the Steam game hours fool you. I am a 6 year veteran of the multiplayer of this game, and have completed (and replayed without completing) the single player multiple times. It was in early 2000 (2001-2002? Maybe later?) that I began playing this game. We had a 'Sold Out' retail copy of the game, it was rare to find the game elsewhere. I had multiple go's at the single player, somehow managed to complete it in my youth with the help of my father, and got curious about the multiplayer feature... in fact that was the most memorable thing for me, and I'm sure many people have already reviewed the story of the game, so instead I will share my long time multiplayer experiences with the game. Maybe someone will actually read through it and consider trying to host servers for this game, or bring friends in to start another population, who knows? Maybe even one of my many forgotten friends from Deus Ex back in the day will see this and remember me.I don't remember what player name I used starting out, I frankly don't think I even used a custom name... I just went under the many ""player"" variations. (Player5483, etc. It randomizes IIRC) Of course, I wasn't a good player, being a slow typer, younger with less reflexes (I had to be like, 5-6 years old or a little older at the time.) I was there to experience GODZ, Deja Vu's attacks on 0 aug servers, the move to MTL and Nepthy's (or whatever its name was)... everything. It wasn't until I went on Nobody's (That was his name) maps, an edit of Silo with a Stargate type of mutator active (I had no understanding of UnrealScript or mutators/mods in my younger age), that I got an actual username.There was a bar after teleporting, in which a Bartender NPC (said nothing, performed no functions) resided, standing still and blank. I decided that to better suit the atmosphere that I would bartend... getting my official username ""Bartender"". In that time I had played many modded servers for the pure sake of fun instead of competition, was even involved in a machinima recording with a great friend of mine back then, who I no longer have contact with. That same friend eventually got involved with a clan named DXC (Deus Ex Council, I think it was?), and I wanted to be a part of it with him. It was then that he said that they're looking for people who are ""good"" at the game. It frustrated me at the time, that he said I was not good enough to be in the same clan as he was. At the same time, that was what drove me to compete and practice, to eventually surpass him.After he had turned me away from the DXC thing, I joined up with RTK, otherwise known as Ready To Kill, a 0 augs (augmentation) clan focused on competition. It was there that I made many friends (Karkian, Maverick/Mustang, Killing Machine, Jima, and others), who taught me the tricks of 0 augs combat, being the tricks of movement to throw off the hitboxes, where to aim with an assault rifle/shotgun, leading and predicting player movement with a sniper rifle, and most of all... it gave me my headstart in to gaming. I've had good and bad days, I've went off on people who just clearly outclassed me that day, I've pulled off feats that people accused me of ""hax"" purely because I worked hard to develop that reflex/skill. I've seen players like Clix who just clearly dominate 0 augs who I could only wish that I'd be able to hold my own against. I've seen the mappers and modders make both fun maps and great fighting maps, which amazed me as a kid growing up... practicing my skills in this game for quite a few years.I did end up beating my close friend on most occurrances of him fighting me, he had left DXC by that time and made his own clan. I had been promoted multiple times for showings of skill, and it was a wild ride in the multiplayer world of Deus Ex for both of us. It was around 2005 family issues arrived (parents got divorced, was not doing well in elementary school due to issues back then... somewhat involving this game heheh), and I was not able to play as often. I had dropped out without much of a goodbye, got addicted to Runescape later, and dropped back in around 2008 just to find out that my favorite clan was dropping out of Deus Ex, and I couldn't find my friend anymore. It was then that I gave up Deus Ex, because the disc was undergoing major wear and tear, and the game had taken its toll on me in immense rage having warped my mind (I practiced on that game a LOT, and as a kid I had not developed the anger management skills to understand a loss in a videogame doesn't equate to any real life value loss).It is now 2014, the Gamespy servers for this game are shut down, effectively putting the final nail in Deus Ex's coffin, which was already becoming a dish only served cold. There are those among what remains of the Deus Ex Multiplayer (DXMP) community that are trying to host master servers to replace Gamespy, so that servers can be hosted once again. Do I think Deus Ex's multiplayer could return strong today? I don't know what to think, most people had started leaving Deus Ex after 2005... and all the servers on the master servers I've tried are empty. The good servers with interesting mutators/maps, whether RPG, botkilling or 0 augs/full augs... are gone. I'm afraid that DXMP is forever dead... and may it rest in peace as the biggest influence in my young gaming days. I only regret that now I have the technical interest to learn how to mod with UnrealScript and the unreal engine for Deus Ex and other games, to be too late to contribute anything before it croaked.In a nutshell, that's my 5-6 years history with this game in its multiplayer form, but since Gamespy's shut down its servers, multiplayer probably won't matter to all but the persistent. So, what about the single player? The single player back then was very good, it was a system in FPS that was new and different from how FPS's worked at the time. Now? I think people can still get something interesting from it, even in its age... but you might want to get some mods to tweak the graphics. I couldn't play Deus Ex any other way than how it was made to be honest, but some people can't stand looking at low poly counts. The story is cliche, but how it is all executed... I felt involved in something bigger than I could imagine, and I found that exciting. I don't know how active the modding community is, but I have heard of singleplayer big name mods coming out for this game... and I feel you should give this game a try if you like single player. I hope that one day multiplayer will make a comeback, but I think that it has finally ran its course.			"

NOTE: Since GameSpy was shut down, to continue multiplayer and to be able to see the servers, visit www.deusexnetwork.com with instructions on how to change the masterserver address.Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is a masterpiece. If you didn't play it yet - you definetly should.An exceptional mix of FPS / RPG / Stealth / Adventure. Took me 62 hours to get the whole 3 endings and still didn't get enough of it.You get to play as UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) agent J.C. Denton. Not a simple agent, but an augmented bionic man. Find out betrayal, carefully choose who your friends and enemies are and, finally, decide the fate of the world.The game gives you freedom in everything. You don't get a Game Over except you get killed, throw yourself from a building, drink booze or do drugs till you overdose, or smoke cigarettes till you get cancer. Overwise it doesn't care what path you choose as long as you can survive the consequences. And there are choices to be made every instance. Use lockpicks to open a door or find a key for it, look for computer login info or use your computer skills to hack it, find acces codes for door keypads or use multitools to disable them, jump on your enemies and slaughter them the way you like it, or look for alternative ways, tunnels, air ventilation systems, etc, and avoid unnecessary kills. It's very rewarding also. A lot of augumentations to choose from, a big variety of weapons, ammo, tools, enemies, locations, etc, which will increasingly keep you interested in going through this cyberpunk conspiracy story.Proclaim yourself God, be part of The Illuminati, or plunge the world into another Dark Age. The choice is yours.			"

Warning: This review isn't augmented, but it wears sunglasses at night. It was written for the Steam Awards category ""Test of Time"" of which it was nominated for by this guy. You can blame its length entirely on that fact, and not on the fact that I'm too lazy to write a proper review for one of my favorite, if not favorite game. You've been warned.Deus Ex is perhaps the greatest video game ever made. And no, that isn't hyperbole, it really is that good. Deus Ex was one of the first games to have it all, from the graphics, which were beyond and above others of its time perhaps outside of No One Lives Forever (another fantastic game of ye olde), to the carefully crafted story and its branches -- allowing the player to make choices for themselves which aren't always clearcut ""good or bad"" as you'd have in other games, and have real consequences, as well as slow-but-steady, thoughtful gameplay that allowed you to truly feel in control as you decided how to act, lethally or unlethally, stealthily or in-your-face. Something that to this date, lots of games fail to do, even if they're privy enough to try it in the first place.Deus Ex holds up as a bastion of great design, a game that can be played many times, in different ways, and you'll likely still find out something you didn't know about it. It's a game so nostalgic that you can feel the nostalgia playing it for the first time. And then the second, and the third. It just keeps going. Playing Deus Ex isn't just playing a video game, it's committing to an illuminati ritual you'll be doing for the rest of your life, replaying every inch of the Statue of Liberty and the streets of Hong Kong until you're ready to do it again. Oh and it kinda sorta predicted 9/11, so there's that.If there's anything you can do is thank Ion Storm & John Romero for this masterpiece -- you could say in the end he did make us his wench. And do yourself a favor and pick up Deus Ex & Shifter Mod to treat yourself to a true blast from the past, just one more playthrough at a time.			"

Intelligent & challenging // Recommended for those looking to experience a classic+ Absolutely tons of customization options; with such variety, few people can really boast that they have played the same game twice+ Narrative is both mature and showcases an impressive amount of depth+ Augmentations, also, offer great freedom in character tailoring; some are arguably more useful than others, but overall the sense of freedom inherent in this mechanic does well to complement the same freedom found throughout the rest of the game+ Modular damage; limbs and body parts experience damage separately, and this translates competently to gameplay (eg. taking too much damage in a leg will result in poor movement)+ The player is offered spectacular freedom in how level objectives and advancement are to be handled+ Level design is applaudable; everything flows well from one area to another, and layouts are generally sensible+ Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic; sets the mood, doesn't necessarily distract, and stays with you when the game is off+ Dialogue and writing is absolutely superb; this is easily one of the better aspects of the game, and it presents well even today- Speed/compatibility issue; this may not affect everyone, but there is an issue with compatibility on modern machines which causes overall gamespeed to increase drastically (there is a workaround, but it's something of a hassle to fix)- Visuals and animations really show their age; these don't hold up well today, but it's not bad enough to detract from the overall experience- Voice-acting, though it can be quite good, is a mostly underwhelming effort; some voice actors go as far as to be terribleLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												This game is like a box of your favorite cereal: you might have accidentally left it open in the cabinet and forgot about it for  a couple of weeks, but after you pour another bowl of it, it still tastes great.I say that because this game is outdated, cripplingly so in certain regards.  The enemy guard AI has a field of view that can be equated to holding two paper towel rolls up to your eyes.  If they spot you, you can trolley out of sight, and they won't come investigate.  The AI doesn't noticeably improve as you progress further into the game (it's especially jarring because the guards you come across look like menacing and dangerous, but it's like they forgot their prescription glasses at home), and instead the game relies on subsidizing the amount of cheese tactics you can perform (by the end of the game, some of the enemies can only be taken out by a soft spot on their back using the cattle prod).  The controls are beyond archaic, and I don't think they even made sense back when they were conceived in 1999 (you use the + button on the number pad to quicksave).  The resolution does not appear to surpass 480p without getting yourself one of the many mods this game has to make it playable in the days of DirectX12.  The general quality of the game (from a presentation perspective) is so bad it's legendary.How's the actual meat of the game?  Well, the story is serviceable.  It's beautifuly timeless due to its themes of how far are we willing to give the government control over our lives to protect us from terrorism, and whether or not the government might get carried away in abusing their power.  This game was released before 9/11 and world paranoid about terrorism, but not so early before that society was wildly different.  There really isn't a lot of character development; a character starts and ends the game acting similarly (you could argue the protagonist, JC Denton, gets development, but he could act wildly depending on your actions).  With that said, the people you meet along the journey become good guys or bad guys solely depending on your opinion of them (for example, is Paul Denton justified in wanting to treat being a UNATCO agent like a day on the police force, or is he just being a blind hippy by not wanting to kill some ♥♥♥♥ing ragheads (or this game's French equivalent, the NSF).Gameplay wise, the primitive AI doesn't really lend itself to any tense gameplay you might see in other stealth games like the Arkham games, Metal Gear Solid, or successors like Dishonored.  The stealth approach is just as valid as the loud approach, and it's not impossible to adjust depending on your supply reserves (save your cattle prods, kids).  You get skill points by doing objectives.  They improve your general skills (though they're not impossible to use without the said skills).  Don't put skill points in Swimming.  This game carves out its niche with its use of the nano augmentations.  As you progress through the story, you'll get the choice to augment yourself by choosing one of the two options you're given (e.g. you can choose to augment your feet to move quicker, or to move quietly).The game really shines through with its level designs.  If you dedicate the time to explore the levels, you start to realize that there is no one way to approach a situation, and there are areas you could easily miss which houses a ton of augment upgrades, supplies, or even some weapon modifications.  You might want to invade a park through the front door, being caught immediately and blasted down, or you could survey the park, and find a back door that's loosely guarded, and housing your true objective much sooner.  Which objective is best?  Well, you get to your target either way, and that's all that matters.  The first path to the objective might not be the best route for you if you want to want to pick people off, but somebody who wants to toss a tear gas grenade in and then take down the group would already be stroking their boner at the opportunity.This is why I recommend Deus Ex.  Nonlinear stealth is tough to pull of meaningfully (looking at you Metal Gear Solid V).  This game blends together talking with civilians to learn how to get your best edge, to watching your step so that you don't get caught by the bad guys.  You can try to bypass an electronic grid by using a multitool, or by just looking for a route to bypass the grid.  It's a game where the only reason your choice matters is for what you had to do to do it.Final Words: ""A bomb's a bad choice for close-range combat.""			"

												Whoa, what a game. Here's a review from someone who's NEVER played the game before a week ago, and I have to say it's still worthy of all the praise it gets from the long-time fans around here.In short:Good+ Biggest plus is the story, still relevant maybe even more so today.+ Took me over 30 hours to beat on Normal difficulty and only 1 ending.+ Gameplay. Surpringly smooth platforming and stealth mechanics. Feels good to change playstyles.+ Best level design in a single player FPS I might have ever seen. Lots of places to explore and secrets to find for an FPS, even by todays standard.+ Figuring out certain problems actually requires you to use your brain instead of quest arrows pointing the way you have to go and telling you exactly what you have to do.+ Completing objectives the way you want to feels AWESOME. You really feel satisfied after completing a mission.+ Even though the graphics have aged, the voice-acting and sound-effects are still great! (explosions are LOUD) A bit quirky and stereotypical at times, but still endearing and engaging. It really grew on me after a while.Not-So-Good:- Controls might be too complex if you're not used to old single player games with lots of buttons and menus. I got used to it though.- Certain sections might be frustrating. Be prepared to die a lot to find out exactly what to do or what path to take for optimal survival.- The graphics haven't aged great and you need to get used to it before you start to see all the details like what grates you can or can't open, which buttons to push etc. etc.- Personally not a fan of some of the RPG-elements. You shoot guns as if you're drunk with parkinsons in the early game.- You might want to play through it in one go because of the crazy storyline, but the game is LONG so you're forced to take your time with this game. Might actually be a good thing though! Expect it to be far easier after your first playthrough though.So basically Deus Ex is a fantastic game for any one who enjoys single-player, story-driven games and can overlook some of the elements that haven't aged well. There is enough action for any FPS lover so I recommend it to any one who has enjoyed games like Half-Life 2 or the more recent Fallout games. So put this game on your wishlist and buy it ASAP! This truly is one of the classics every video game fanatic should have played at least once!			"

												Deus Ex, the one and only. Its basic concept rooted back to the System Shock titles, but, the way I see it, Deus Ex is more refined, and have a ton of originality on its own.When I just finished it again recently, I wrote a big, sky-high praise to this game, for being so cool, that it is still unmatched, even with all new Deus Ex games, Ken Levine stuff and so on. This text is more clear-viewed edition - however, it is still far from usual pro/contra weighted review.Mostly, my admiration about the first Deus Ex is based on the passion to cyberpunk background in general. As, for some reasons, the most of the modern games bearing this tag, are not really worth that -punk suffix, which itself is too hyped at moment, with cadavers like diesel-punk, or even worse, blues-punk or something. Now, I don't really want to dive deeper in all that, but I'll state it like this: while the original Deus Ex is certainly a cyberpunk story, the newer additions - aren't. They're close, sure. We have basic ""hi tech, low life"" scenery all around - but the bottom line behind it, the feelings those newer installations are calling upon - are not of the -punk world. Or maybe it is corporations point of view on the cyberpunk world, and not its dweller's, which is more close to mine.There are still producing some games with that original CyberP fleur - like Shadowrun games, for instance. But, again, in case of the first Deus Ex, the result is more refined and pure, especially in the aftertaste.Now, with all those quasi-philosophy intro words said, let's settle the main question - is the game worth playing?With all those passed years - and visuals were not top-notch even in the year 2000, so now, after more than 15 years, they surely can take away many possible players. But that can be dealt with - at some degree, at least. Check DeusEx graphics fixes in the web, there are some good tweaks about it. However, even with enhanced graphics, there's still a big question of gameplay adaptability - or how else would you call a problem of modern players physically and especially mentally unable to play old games. The mechanics were different then. The level of expectations - from players to game designers, and vise versa - was much different as well.So, the simple answer of ""should you play it now"" is - ""yes, you can try it, but no guarantee"". One thing that is certain, however, is that ""youtube playthrough"" will not give you even the quarter of it's real depth and coolness. Deus Ex is all about multiplexity of choices. Not some scripted ""morale choice"", which happens from time to time, with pre-programmed consequences. Now, I'm talking about open-world freedom of what to do, in the given circumstances.And that's where I'm back on the philosophy railings again. All those freedom of choices, isn't just about ""kill or be killed"", as it goes with 90% of videogames around. The choices you're gonna make if you'll start Deus Ex - are off the usual borders of ""good"" and ""bad"". They're beyond Kant's dogma or some ""golden rules"" - all that is not working in the post-industrial and post-human world that we see in the Deus Ex.So, there it goes - the legend of the game design, released when the average part of today-players was not yet ready to play. It is the monument, one of the pillars gamedesign are based upon now - just like Doom or Diablo. Sadly, but unlike those titles, there are still no good enough projects that surpassed it's glory, with newer and better technology and overall greatness.So, mark is 10/10, but is it recommended? Only for the most strong-willed species around. No crutches included.			"

												Pretty much objectively one of the best games of all time. Nearly every aspect of this game has aged very well. The plot is engaging and intelligent. The gameplay allows you to approach nearly any situation in nearly any way you wish and the levels are so damn big and well designed that you will often find all sorts of alternate ways to do things each time you play. For that matter there are so many little things and side missions you can find in the game that it is almost always worth exploring everywhere that you can. Not to mention that the game WILL reward you for exploring. Building a character is so much fun and there are so many things that you can specialize in and it will change the way you play the game in very significant ways. The story is very malleable and you can pretty much do anything you want and rather then giving you a ""MISSION FAILED"" thing when you kill a story important character the game will mold to your actions. The Music is awesome and really captures the atmosphere of the game.Pretty much the only two things I could imagine somebody objecting to would be the graphics and voice acting. Which sure, I mean the graphics ARE pretty ugly but if such an old game having bad graphics bothers you so much then you can easily download some graphics mods to make the game much more paletable for you. (As a side note this game has a pretty decent modding community you should check out.)And while the voice acting can be pretty bad it (thankfully) is the funny kind of bad so you shouldnt be bothered too much by it.

												For me, the best game ever made.Origionally played a pirate copy when it was first released back in 2000 just for something to do one night. I've then gone on to purchase the game maybe 3-4 times. Completed the game so many times with every ending possible and I even have the soundtrack to the game on my phone. I can't remember the last game ive actually wanted to complete recently let alone several times. The story line is absolutely fantastic, something games developers just dont seem to spend time on these days *cough* Destiny *cough* ...but also, the sheer volume in detail, there are so many hidden extras...like the Majestic 12 base hidden in the sewers in NYC. Modern games would have shipped that as DLC and it took me 3-4 play throughs to discover it.One of the first games to offer a non linear play through, it gave you options on different ways to storm a building and even tested your morality by giving you the choice to kill or spare. I remember being amazed by being told off by your in game boss for going in the girls toilets for a quick sniff around, who would bother to code little things in like that these days?Graphics are terrible now I admit, but pick yourself up a HD pack along with a copy of xpadder for joypad use and you'll quickly discover just how much you've been ripped off the last time you spunked 40-50 bucks on the latest console game.

												Possibly the best PC game of all time.Even 16 years after this game's release, we have not seen any game that even comes close to Deus Ex. There's no game that indulges into subjects like human nature, government, religion, technology, and ethics. No other game has the replayability this one has, with multiple playstyles, pathways, and secrets.You would expect games to have advanced from this and learned from it, but as time goes on it seems like a relic from a bygone age, a time when player choice mattered, story mattered, theme mattered, instead of profit margin being king. EDIT:For those Linux/Mac users hesitant to pick up this game I have good news: It works perfectly on Wine. I've been running it on my Mac for a few months now and haven't had any crashes.EDIT 2: Updating this review for the 'cheevo. This game should win the ""Test of Time award"", hands-down the best game ever. Remember, every time it's mentioned someone reinstalls.There is no reason why anyone should not play this game.			"

												tl;dr Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you're even slightly interested. Absolutely incredible game. Timeless level design and story, GOAT imo Overview Deus Ex is a classic FPS/RPG from the year 2000, but it manages to offer more player choice and better level design than most games today. The story also manages to stay compelling and creates a sense of tension as you uncover a massive international conspiracy.  Gameplay tl;dr for gameplay: loads of choice and neat weapons plus the signature augmentation system, offers a lot of replayability even if the gunplay and melee are weak by modern standardsDeus Ex plays like traditional stealth games from the late 90s with RPG and FPS elements. It has some odd controls that may take some getting used to for those of you more used to modern games, but keys are fully rebindable. Deus Ex offers a massive range of weapons and tools to help you through levels, from tranquilizer crossbows and 10mm pistols to sawed-off shotguns, snipers and an energy sword. If you wish, you can finish the game without killing any enemies and silently strike from the shadows with your trusty baton or riot prod, or you may choose to assault your enemies with shotguns and rocket launchers. Deus Ex is all about choice. The signature feature of Deus Ex is the Augmentation system. Throughout the game, you find canisters that, when installed with a medical bot, give you a choice of a new power. This may be an invisibility cloak, health regeneration, stronger melee attacks, ballistic protection, etc. These drain bioelectric power, which may be refilled with biocells or a repair bot. You can also find augmentation upgrade canisters that let you upgrade your existing augs (less energy consumption, new perks, etc). Health is also an important system, as each body part has its own health bar. For example, if you lose all health on your legs, you lose your legs and crawl around until you heal them with a medkit or Regen aug. Lose all health in your chest or head, however, and you will die. Deus Ex also has a skilled system. Each major gameplay function has a skill associated with it that has four ranks (Untrained, Trained, Advanced, and Master). Each rank increases your proficiency in that area. You automatically start with Trained Pistol skill from the outset. Upgrading your skill in a weapon skill (Low-Tech, Pistols, Rifles, Heavy) increases your damage and accuracy with that weapon type with each rank you take and in the case of Heavy lets you move faster with said weapon equipped. Upgrading your Electronics or Lockpick skills decreases the number of multitools or lockpicks required to hack defense systems (cameras, laser grids) or open doors. Computer skill controls how much time you have to hack a computer terminal and access emails, security controls, etc. The list goes on and on. Weapon mods exist in Deus Ex, too. Silencers obviously make weapons quieter and more effective for stealth purposes, laser sights negate the need to line up a shot for max accuracy, scopes let you fire accurately from a distance, recoil and accuracy mods affect those traits respectively, clip mods add ammo to your magazine, etc. etc. etc. Beware of adding a scope and a laser sight to a weapon, however, because having a scope installed negates the laser sight's accuracy bonus for whatever reason. This does not apply to sniper rifles, however. Almost every weapon has multiple ammo types. For example, the minicrossbow has lethal darts, tranquilizers, and flare darts. The assault rifle has an underbarrel grenade launcher, the shotguns have buckshot rounds for organic targets and Sabot rounds for armor-piercing (security bots, etc), and so on. As far as actual combat goes, the gunplay and melee gameplay are very weak and unsatisfying overall thanks to iffy hitboxes and unsatisfying animations, but that's more of a limitation of the time the game was made at. Again, the combat is defined by augmentations and creative combinations. Overall, the gameplay holds up to modern standards in terms of creativity with items and the unique augmentation system, but the gunplay and melee combat is weak thanks to it being a very old game. Loads of choice and replayability offered by the augmentation system, weapons, and skills.  Story  For a fifteen-year-old game, Deus Ex has an amazing globetrotting story revolving around conspiracies in a world ravaged by a plague. Deus Ex contains many exotic locations and memorable characters to assist you (or fight you) along the way. I would rather not spoil too much of the story or locations, but I will say that your choices do matter and some will come into play later in the game than you would expect. I don't know what else to say about it without spoiling, but it's a crazy story with plenty of twists and turns along the way.  Design I feel like Ion Storm got the 2050s cyberpunk aesthetic right. It mixes the current world at the time with their vision of the future. Plenty of neon lights, futuristic weapon designs and armor, hologram communications, etc. Even though this game is 15 years old, it manages to be immersive with its very natural-feeling level design. The excellent visual mods New Vision and HDTP also do wonders and I would highly recommend them. But back to the level design; it's quite amazing how much work went into the levels. Each hub area or level is tailored for any playstyle you could have. They made it feasible to complete the game with perfect stealth and no kills, melee only, full-on combat, or just hacking security systems to mow down enemies with turrets at your disposal. This adds even more to the replayability, knowing that the game will never force you into any particular playstyle.  Conclusion As someone who played Deus Ex for the first time this year and just finished it, I feel that Deus Ex is a masterpiece. It gets everything right where it counts, and its only real weakness in my opinion is the dated combat. The level design and player freedom combined with the story more than make up for it, though. I strongly believe today, as I write this, that Deus Ex is the best game ever made, hands down. I love Ocarina of Time, Half-Life 2, all the usual suspects, but this is really a special game that every RPG/stealth/FPS fan owes it to themself to play. I got it in the 2014 autumn sale for $1.74 USD, and it's absolutely incredible value. Even at the current full price of $6.99 it's well worth it. I'd rate Deus Ex a 10/10. Masterful, timeless game. The only thing that could make this game better would be a from the ground up remake with modern visuals, mechanics, etc. You owe it to yourself to play this game if you're even slightly interested in Deus Ex.

												Year 2000, Microsoft release a videogame for windows, named Deus Ex... And now, 14 years later, im making this review. The review of one of the best games i´ve ever had the chance to play, and personally, the summit of videogames.Deus Ex has a cyberpunk hue, which is a subgenre of SCI-FI in a near future (specifically in the 2052) such as Blade Runner, Matrix o The Sprawl Trilogy of William Gibson. Also is an acction videogame stapled with Rpg mechanics, adventure and Simulation. With all these traits, Deus Ex gives you the chance of make profit of your own skills, there are a lot of ways to achieve your goal during a quest. Despite of the fact that there are 4 genres of videogames taking part in this game (rpg-fps-adventure-simulation) the gameplay is just hilarious, and all this because these 4 elements are so well coordinated that you get over the prejudice of having ""gameplay issues due to the quantity of the genres"", just attending the story and the characters.In addition to this, as we accomplish goals we will be rewarded with ""skill points"", these are used to enhance our skills in different ways, moreover we can improve our weapons with a wide variety of ""Weapon modifications"".We assume the role of Denton. J.C. Denton is an special agent under the orders of U.N.A.T.C.O. (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) with nanotech-augmentations. As we fathom into the world of Deus Ex, we will discover that the society has been splitted by the differences between ""augmens"" and people who cannot pay them, the illnesses and the expensive heals, and of course, between goverment and people. As the plot unfolds, JC will face organizations like Illuminati, Templars or Hong-Kong Tryads.And what about the OST? Well if they Succeeded with a 4stylegenres-mixture in the videogame...why not mix musical genres too? Its just amazing how this music complement the game with a gorgeous melody made with Techno, Jazz and Classical music. Just check it on your own here.Personally, and as i said in the top of this review, for me this game is the Pinacle, the summit of videogames. I still playing this game, and yet i keep finding new resources to achieve my goals in the game, just amazing..And sorry if i made any mistake, i just woke up and i had to write this. :mortis:			"

												And I wondered why people praised this game so much, well, now I know why.My first Deus Ex game was Human Revolution and it became one of my favorite games. With that said I never got to play the original Deus Ex until now and I can finally say my life is complete.How can a game from 2000 be so advanced for its time? The presentation, the narrative, the characters. the enviroment, the music, all the little details. All of this makes Deus Ex not only a great game but a masterpiece.And I almost forgot about the gameplay... I would say that it is the most important and the most refined aspect from the game, it's what it makes Deus Ex. Sneaking behind a guard and knocking him down silently, finding new paths through the ventilation vents, upgrading yourself and using augmentations, all of it is worth it.Before I considered DXHR to be one of my favorite games(and I still do) but now that I've played the original I can see how HR turned out so great.THE CONSPIRACY IS REAL!

Warren Spector truly captured the Cyberpunk genre perfectly along with a good concept of asking ""What if all the conspiracies are true?"" it's the most immersive FPS/RPG hybrid you'll ever play. Do I recommend? Steam why the hell would ask such a dumb question?			"

												Just the fact that I'm writing a review is evidence of how good this game was, as I rarely bother with reviews. This game was worth it, however.Old, blocky graphics usually deter me from even considering a game since I'm a very visual type person, but the plotline and heavy, detailed dialogue made me quickly take back any complaints. As a person whose first Deus Ex game was Human Revolution (played in 2015, no less), the original game still managed to make me feel nostalgic. I even grew FOND of all those low resolution textures about halfway through the game.Game of the year, and for good reason. Where Deus Ex lacks in visuals, it provides in storytelling, character interaction, variety, the freedom of choice, loads of the unexpected, and a rad as hell soundtrack. Not to mention how thorough the developers were with filling in just about every single voice line and detail they could no matter what kind of tricks you tried to pull in the game. Simply amazing, and the very opposite of linear. Play through the game 10 times, you'll keep finding secrets and surprises.Get it. Play it. You won't regret it, even 16 years after its release.And remember, stick with the prod!			"

												I should be mad at Deus Ex for lying to me.  The game showed me the incredible potential video games had, to combine genres and transcend the genre, and promised me that the best was yet to come.  Well, it wasn't.  Deus Ex was the best, and the future is still trying to love up to that promise.  Sure, a few games here and there come close (VtM - Bloodlines, Human Revolution) but they never quite reached that little extra, that little dose of genius and obsession, that elevated Deus Ex to one of the greatest games of all time.

												82 hours...sheesh! (and counting,imma atleast have 1000 hours by end of year)So,let me explain a few thing before we dwelve into the review,mmkay?This game is an elderly piece,espically since it came out start of second millenia (in gaming years anything 5+ years is elderly).So you will expect issues if you're not used to millenia age game (i.e right mouse button is use instead of ""e"" or etc.).Easily fixable in keyboard and mouse settings,so your modern age controls are there :).Although,this is clunky and glitchy on modern systems (download New Vision mod instead of Revision ((TRUST ME)) ).So how's the game?Damn good! The story is rough to get into from the first mission,the introduction will confuse you,but you will understand everything by fourth mission.JC Denton has no emotion,but that's the player,he's suppost to represent YOU! It dosesn't break immersion as you (suprising for a anicent game).Summary of the plot?You're JC Denton,or whatever you picked your name as,but you will be always called JC Denton.JC is a starter for  U.N.A.T.C.O (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition Operations) based in Liberty Island.JC is an nano-augmented agent,the prototype per say for the new generation of augmentations,your brother Paul is also augmented like you.You can see the diffrence between generations,as Agent Navarre and Agent Hermann are mechanically augmented (you will meet them in UNATCO Headquaters).So what is UNATCO's job? Their job is to protect and distribute the vaccine Ambrosia,manufactured by VersaLife,due to a massive plague,known as ""Grey Death"".Thing is,a domestic terrorist group known as ""N.S.F"" (National Secessionist Federation,they want to seced from the Union) keep stealing the shipments.As the best duo for the job,you and your brother are signed to deal with these missing shipments,but something seems off about your brother.As you get deeper to the roots about the NSF,your brother uncovers a massive conspiracy involving an secret society called ""Majestic 12"" who is possibly behind the dystopia that has ravashed the world and even the ""Grey Death"".Gameplay?Gameplay is an FPS/RPG hybrid with an optional stealth mechanics (IMO,stealth for advanced players).You have your skills and augmentations,now you can't get every skill mastered and every augmentation available,you have to decide on the skills and augmentations you want for your playthrough (I.E skills:Lockpicking,Electronics;Augs:Regeneration,Cloak).So it makes it very interesting on how you choose,and makes multiple playthroughs possible by learning about diffrent augmentations to use.As for the maps,they look small,but in turn they are very big when it calls for the little nooks and crannies that are in the map,play again to find that recoil upgrade!Graphics? The game looks old,still up to date?*sigh*The game runs on a modified Unreal Engine 1 engine.Of course it looks dated,but the New Vision mod helps by adding new textures to certain things that needs visual upgrades (avoiding the Revision mod).I've gotten past everything by focusing more on gameplay and story.Worth it?Oh yes,definetly! This game is worth multiple playthroughs,due to being so big and complex! I'm on my whatever number playthrough.Absolutley worth the very cheap purchase!Multiplayer? Mods?Gamespy shut down the multiplayer back in 2014,but a community-made patch has fixed this and it is better than ever!As for mods,there is mod support,but I have no clue on the current state of that,only ones I know that were popular was Nameless Mod and Malkovian.So don't expect and total skyrim-esque mods.Cujo's 5 Step Rating™?Story- 5/5(Top Notch Legit) - Very well thought of,very deep,and very hooking!Gameplay- 4/5(Bootyful) - Can be clunky at times,but only if you don't choose skills to your play style.Graphics - 2.5/5(Okay?) - 4/5 if it were 2000 - Graphics take a hit,but for me,doesn't affect the gameAudio - 3.5/5(Almost Bootyful) - 5/5 if it were 2000 - Soundtrack is excellent! A favorite of mine is ""Enemy Within""Atmosphere - 5/5(Top Notch Legit) - Very dark and gritty,that is what you want when you have a game with this kind of story.Overall - 4/5 (Bootyful)- A masterpiece,for the time it came out,and a legend in the PC gaming world.Would definitly recommend to anyone who needs something to satisfy them for quite a few hours! (My best game of all time in my book ^_^) "

Short version: 93%Deus Ex is an old game, but still among the best cRPGs you can find. It offers a wide variety of options and choices, which are supported by a complex and conspiracy-heavy storyline keeping up your interest. Just don’t forget to get the community-created patches to make the engine compatible with modern video cards.Long version:The internet likes lists, especially if they want to collect the best of all times in a specific category. If you find one about the best cRPGs, you’ll more than likely see Deus Ex near the top of that lists, and for good reason.The gameplay is all about freedom. Freedom in play style: you can take out your enemies in lethal and non-lethal ways (you can finish the whole game with only taking one life), or you can sneak past them using cover, or create a diversion (throw an object, hack security, or even blow something up). You can rely on your wits, your items or your special augmentations, which– like magic in fantasy games– let you do supernatural feats as long as your energy levels remain.There is also a freedom in the story. Almost all goal can be reached in at least three different ways; all of the maps include several hidden spots and secret routes that lead you to shortcuts, additional rewards or sometimes even new secondary goals. And to make the list complete, you can choose among different endings for the story, which is something that even some of the best RPGs out there couldn't tell about themselves.The game was made on arguably the best engine of its time, Unreal, which really shines in night scenes. (Pardon me the oxymoron.) This not only creates a very fitting atmosphere, but it's also integrated into the game: there are plenty of dark corners to hide – and that’s another reason why Deus Ex is often compared to another successful FPS/sneak hybrid, the Thief series.The plot itself is an amalgam of all modern conspiracy theories ranging from the little grey people of Area 51 to the Illuminati and government-controlled epidemics. Still, it’s a very complex story with a lots of questions regarding human nature and sociology. And if we add in the excellent and memorable soundtrack, it's easy to understand why this game is still ranked so high even to this day.			"

												This is, and always will be, one of the best and most revolutionary games of all time. It is one of many places where I need to call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on metascore, because it deserves more than 90. I would not go as far as to say it deserves a full ace, but about 96-97? Sure. Back when it came out, it was the biggest deal. Sure, Half-life laid the foundation for FPS games, but this game is no mere FPS. It is an RPG, and an excellent one at that. Comparing it to other old-school RPGs, it would always come out on top for me.The best feature of this game is, it does not stop you from finding your own solutions to problems. Say there is a laser tripwire that sets of an alarm. You can solve this problem in so many different ways. You can run through and shoot your way through. You can hack the control panel. You can find one of usually at least two ways around it. Or, alternatively, you can stack up some boxes and jump over it. The game will not stop you. Also, everything you do actually matters. It matters if you go lethal or peaceful, it matters if you talk to people or not, it matters if you explore and it affects the game, and the story. It is up to this day, one of the most sublime non-linear RPGs on the market. The story is very good, provided you are into conspiracy theories. The hero, JC Denton will struggle with or against UNATCO, the UN, US government, NSF and even the Illuminati. To avoid spoilers, I will just say that the conception is just fantastic, but you need to experience it yourself. The graphics don't hold up today, unfortunately, but a true connesieur will be able to look past that, as lack of graphical fidelity is the case with many games of the past age. The soundtrack makes up for it, though. This is one of many cases where music from a game is a real piece of art.You would do yourself a great service if you bought this game and played it to completion. It bears the name of a classic with pride, and does not disappoint. After a little bit of tinkering it will run at 1080p, and the controls are fully customizable, so you should make do with those somewhat clunky mechanics.It is really that good. And dirt cheap too. Take my word, and pick it up.Deus Ex gets my 0451/10			"

												I played through this game fully back in the day when it originally launched, and I lost myself in it. Whilst the game hasn't aged well visually, and the voice acting is terrible, the amount of freedom afforded to the player to make decisions is still impressive. The feeling of reactivity and decision on the player is quite exhilerating, especially as the game goes on and decisions have further reaching impact.The opening can feel clumsy, but as you realise how immersive the level of reaction can be, and the opportunities you have to make meaningful decisions, the game really comes to life. The endings lack a little impact due to how they are presented, but the journey to making those decisions is worth the investment, the game is a true classic. It's a shame most games since have focused more on narrative and mechanics as separate elements, rather than blending decisions into meaningful influences on the game (as an aside, I think the closest to achieve this other than Deus Ex is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines).Whilst Deus Ex: Human Revolution never lived up to the freedom and openness and impact that the original set in place, the two slot together beautfully lore-wise, so if you've played one and not the other, I'd highly recommend them both.

												The game is undoubtedly a good one. I feel like I would have loved it more if I had played it back in 2000 instead of 2014. By now, I must view it as a retro-style game, and because of that I felt like I had to rush through this game in order to play the next two in the series.All in all, the plot was a bit convoluted, but by no means bad. It was dark and gritty enough to keep me interested to see what happens in the end. However, the ending was a bit disappointing since I had expected a lot more movie/cinematics. That's what I get for applying 2014-standards to a 2000-game.I think to rate this game fairly, I should give it a 8/10 at least. The sheer number of ways to get through the levels alone can qualify the game for a GOTY status since it allows the player to try numerous methods to accomplish the goals.The music was very good, surprisingly, and I think it definitely caught my attention so that I would feel more immersed in the cyberpunk environment of Deus Ex.Overall, I'd give the game a 8/10. I wish I could have enjoyed it more, but I found this gem of a game too late in my life, and I'm sorry that I missed out a little on how much fun it could have been. Hopefully, the reader of this review can take the game slow and enjoy all that it has to offer.			"

												Every time you mention the blessed words ""Deus Ex"", someone reinstalls it. With good reasons, too. This game is absolutely phenomenal. The levels are huge and varied, from New York to Paris, to Area 51, to my personal favorite Hong Kong. The game is designed around player agency. You not only get to manipulate what happens in the plot, but there are tons of different weapons, augmentations, and skills. The huge levels each have multiple paths in them based on all of these different possible combinations, and since you cannot get every augment (If you even find an augmentation canister you can only choose 1 of 2) or upgrade everything, there is a high amount of replayability which does not get old. It is sad that a game from 16 years ago is more complex and interesting than the majority of releases today. Deus Ex is a hugely influential game and deserves its place as at least one of if not the greatest PC game of all time.			"

												One of the best games released, and certainly the best in Deus Ex series (following games are quite pathetic in comparison). Great story, atmosphere, dialogues, gameplay (non-violent playthrough totally possible, including avoiding bosses), and probably the only game of this kind that is so good. I recommend it to cRPG players, to FPS players and to stealth games players as the gameplay will higly depend on the player. The only thing I dislike in Deus Ex are some quite crappy levels where it's easy to get lost even on a tiny map, but it's only about some of the levels, most are alright. It's a classic that you ought to play. You might want to skip other games in the series. The first Deus Ex is the only one that matters, and so far there is no other game that might compare with it.			"

												A game based around choice, it ends up being a must for anyone who enjoys fps/rpg hybrids, realistic difficulty modes, good stories or cyberpunk. Come in ready to think as much as act, and you'll enjoy this game.That aside, the game's main issue is the age that shows through it, namely the amount of reused models that are visibly re-purposed character by character through reskin.Thankfully if you have issues with that there are a plethora of mods to deal with the visuals.It would be advisable to modify it to run in widescreen regardless of your lean towards or against remastery.http://kentie.net/article/dxguide/For extra visual splendor you might wish to try the New Vision mod, which replaces every single texture in the game.http://www.moddb.com/mods/new-visionAnd finally, at the end of the day you may wish to try a new gameplay experience when you're done with the game once or twice.

												Deus Ex has to be one of greatest games of the 2000s. Deus Ex was a fantastic games from developers who were not that good at the time. It's a genre defining classic. Well okay, the graphics might not be the greatest, the gun play is really bad, and the AI really acts like blind maniacs. But the idea and concept of the game was truly uncomparible to any other game at the time. One of the greatest aspect of the game is the writing. Pretty alright voice actors and you can choose what kind of sentence you want to say to a person and that can affect the game. If you do something to character, like walk into the womens bathroom, they will remember that and will mention it and even my boss told me about it. The controls are extremely clunky for todays standards and there are also a crazy amount of keys. Not very user friendly for todays standards. If these controls came out in a game in this day and age, it would spark up some controversy with some.The health was also like no other. You have health bars for your head, torso, left and right leg, and left and right arm. This can really affect your gameplay if you've damaged a part in your body. If you damaged you leg, you would start limping. Augmentations are also really interesting. You can get a augmentation for turing invisible! I wished that seriously every game had that ability. While I was playing, but you can't swap out these augmentations for other ones, so you have to be careful with what you are sure you are getting. Now lets talk about the soundtrack. The soundtrack is very well composed and the person who made the soundtrack also made songs for the Unreal series. Look, this game isn't for everyone. Some people will like this and some people not. When first playing the game, I found it one of the most confusing games that I've ever played and I didn't really enjoy it. Would I recommend this game today? Yes, if you arn't too bothered by the graphics. As for the sequel, NO! Never play it. It's as if the developers didn't know this game was going to be this great and they tried too hard to do the same thing again. I can't wait for Deus Ex: Mankind Devided. 10/10			"

												It's the Greatest PC Game of All Time. It says so on the box, I swear! If it doesn't, ask anyone who's left Liberty Island. They'll tell you so.Incredible gameplay, with an interesting world, moody graphics, and a sexy ambient soundtrack that strikes the ""comfy"" cyberpunk nerve like none other. You might not immediately warm up to it, but you'll quickly learn to love what has been created here. Deus Ex is a meaty as hell game, and one of the indisputed kings of Player Agency.Also, manually save your progress often. Trust me.Have fun!			"

												While some details of the game haven't aged well, Deus Ex is one of the penultimates of gaming to this date. An experience of fluid gameplay, ability of flexible playstyles, non-lethal runs, excellent writing, and terrible accents, it is something that everyone should always have had played. Probably multiple times.I got this game on disc in 2000 so I don't have many hours on the stame version!			"

												Timeless classic and a game that brings nostalgia. Considered by many to be the best PC game ever made with it's amazing storyline. Made in times when storyline was important (if not the most important) part of game development. Graphics today can only make a smile on your face but remember this game is 17 years old and was considered ""beautiful"" in 2000. I've been returning to this title so many times - for fun, with cheats or just to see the story again, every time discovering something that I didn't in previous run and I hope it will be the same today. The only downside is poor AI, enemies don't see you sometimes even if you stand with them face to face. Sadly multiplayer is dead since gamespy shut down their servers.  I have a small wish that someday it will be remastered but likely it will never happen.			"

												Dislike this game and someone will burn your house down. Either that or you will catch Grey Death and die horribly like so many others in this dystopian cyberpunk world. Or maybe some punk from Hong Kong with an accent so horribly bad it's kind of amusing will rob you and give your stuff to the Triads. I'm sure there's plenty of other things aside from this that could happen as well.Or you can like the game. The choice is yours.More seriously, this game's age is immediately obvious once you start playing it. And yet it is still a great game with flaws that, at this point, are more charming or amusing than irritating. Gameplay and story are among the best ever done for any game ever. The weaknesses lie in the dated graphics and some terrible voice acting (particularly in Hong Kong), though it's still better than Oblivion's and has more than a few unintentionally funny moments, especially from your player character JC Denton (""What a shame""). That's really it. It's pretty easy to look past the flaws however and to see a game that is superb in (almost) every area. There is real quality here, and passing this one up (particularly when it's super-cheap in a sale) is a missed opportunity. Play it.Play it or else you might be sent back to the people... in a body bag.			"

												this game can be a little hard to get into if you're not used to older pc games, it took me multiple attempts to finally be able to enjoy it but god i'm so glad i did. this game is beyond great. the amount of work put into letting the player do whatever they want to complete objectives is at times astounding, and there will be plenty of moments where you're taken aback at just how in depth it gets. this game also isn't afraid to delve into and discuss openly the themes and ideas its world evokes, and they make for some incredibly philosophical discussions between players.a lot of games in the past five years have claimed that ~every decision matters~ but this game, a 15 year old game, is the only game where i feel like i can say with complete certainty and honesty, that every decision matters			"

												If you need a game that was totally ahead of its time - here is one. Deus Ex is one of the very first, fully realized sandboxes, learning heavily from previous titles like Thief or System Shock, the game offers player near unmatched freedom in approaching the objectives, while the game's basic rules, smart level design and multitude of items only support that idea. Yes, it looks ugly - no doubt about that - and it does have some truly awful shooting mechanics, but once you get into it - you'll love it.			"

												Truly a beast of game. Sprawling and epic. The genious of Deus Ex is purely is in it's impeccable level, and system's design. The story is cool with lots of characters and smart writing. The game lets you tackle most objectives in several different ways depending on whether or you you want to be stealthy or a go in guns blazing, true open ended gameplay. The only complaint I have is that it is a tad overlong. Not to say that the latter levels are lacking in terms of quality, but it did sag a bit coming up on the last third. I doubt many people initially introduced to the franchise in the reboot will enjoy this because it is truly the vanilla Deus Ex experience, while HR is more of a refinement. In terms of story, writing, scope and overall design though I'd say the original still stands tall above it's succesors, albeit with some accessability issues due to it's hardcore nature being a product of it's time.

Do I recommend Deus Ex?Well, that's easy... if you understand the impact of ""age"" on games, then YES, you will enjoy this title.Otherwise if you think a game like TES:Oblivion is 'old', or you don't know how to change button assignments.. then no, you probably won't.It's a classic game that everyone should experience, and although it has aged a bit, I think it holds up enough in the visual department that it should be enough for people to adjust. It's no worse than Half-Life for example. Controls are completely customizable so you can set up the keys to match any FPS configuration you prefer. With a little google help it's only a matter of downloading the correct OpenGL or D3D9 dll's for modern hardware to have a smooth experience.(I am not affiliated with this website, but I have used it myself... obviously use at your own discretion: http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/ )My bias towards Deus ExI have recently finished Deus Ex: HR. Just last night actually. While it is a 'respectable' game in its own right, I will use it as a ""modern day"" example to compare with Deus Ex to show why I think the first game is far superior even today.I have played Deus Ex back in 2001 on an old 233mhz computer, in windowed mode using software rendering, barely pushing 5-10 fps with loading times that would equal 8-10 minutes between levels. That's right... I sat through that for the entirety of the game. Then I replayed it again about 8 years ago, and more recently the other month. (I own a GoG copy also so my Steam hours are low.)What does Deus Ex from 2000 have in comparison to todays 'like' titles Limb damage similar to _Fallout_. Does not exist in DE:HR Skill levelling similar to _Fallout Tactics_. Does not exist in DE:HR Clever secrets. (Actual, clever secrets, not just obscured vents.) Better variety of tools. More use for augmentations. Separated hacking and lock picking tools. No annoying 'mini-games' to lock pick or multi-tool. More 'realistic' alert system. If you are found by 1 enemy, the entire map doesn't suddenly know you're a threat.There are definitely quality of life issues with Deus Ex. For example, unmodded: you have to loot a body before you can carry it and hide it. no grapple melee like DE:HR or MGS, etc (this is debatable I suppose) some of the outdoor maps do have vast empty spaces, such as the opening level. strongly encourages you to play stealthily. Although this is the best way to 'experience' the game, it does mean that if you try to use the Baton (trained) on the face of an enemy that's shooting at you, after 3-4 hits you'll be dead and they'll still be standing. If you however sneak up behind them, 1 hit KO is the way to go.ConclusionDeus Ex has deep gameplay even beyond the surface. While it's not perfect, and its age is starting to slowly show, I would not disregard it especially in comparison to its supposed successors. In comparison to DE:HR, there are more options, more consequences, less annoyances, better challenges and rewards. Puzzles are actually puzzles and not just obscured vents. Passwords are hidden in clever ways, like birthdates and book names found around the world. Sometimes they can be a little too obscure, sure, but the added feeling of accomplishment is undeniable when you do eventually stumble across them.Thanks to a separated skills and augmentations system, your character will feel powerful when you do choose an Augment between A or B for each slot. Unlike DE:HR in comparison, your character doesn't feel ""weak"" for missing augments, but instead feels stronger for having attained them and in turn will never be able to just ""buy everything"".Weapons are significantly better too... you have to improve your _skills_ in particular areas, such as weapons, so that for example it will reduce the spread of your gun to improve accuracy throughout the game. What this means is that you have to consider your distance to your target before firing as you might miss! Compared to DE:HR, you won't suddenly be a 10mm sniper across the map because you found a laser pointer. Plus, the enemies aren't always 'conveniently placed' in pairs or less, so there will be times when you will actively choose to avoid combat instead of clearing a level just because you can.People who would enjoy this are people who can distinguish the difference between playing an old game with old design choices compared to those who cannot (i.e. quality of life issues mentioned above).People who would _NOT_ enjoy this game are people who will complain that the default control scheme is clunky without realising they can change the button assignments to match any contemporary FPS.It's not perfect... but it encompasses more than any individual game does today. When you play this game and experience all the nuances it has to offer... consider for a minute how incredible it would be with a contemporary engine and some minor improvements. Then you will understand how this game was so amazing in its time, and despite its age, still offers gameplay that most games don't today.			"

Really, though, it's an experimental RPG made at the tail end of when mass market games could still be made by huge talent with good funding without being horribly dumbed down to maximize sales. Not only was it groundbreaking and brilliant, but it was executed without any big flaws that make the game difficult to play or otherwise suck.

												Deus Ex is another staple game, in my opinion. It's old, and it shows. The voice acting is so cringe worthy it's hard to actually listen to the dialogue between laughter. The graphics have aged as well as 3 year old oranges, and probably smell about the same. The combat? Fun. The writing? Enjoyable. The cybernetic systems? Cool! People who were fans of the Metal Gear franchise would enjoy this game, although I wouldn't go so far as to say that people who aren't familiar with the genre would.I do have to say, the writing is very dark, so when you encounter bits and pieces where it makes fun of itself - like the spam email requesting you commit suicide - it's very enjoyable.

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 2 | 3 4 *5*] = ~92% (83%-100%)I've played this to death, so when I ask myself ""Play Deus Ex?"" the answer is now ""Nah."", and this would negatively color my judgment. But if I really ask myself, I'd have to say that this is by far my favorite game of all time. I must have done more than 20 complete play-throughs, and that's a conservative estimate.This is (so far) the best execution of what happens to be my favorite kind of game: The lone wolf 1st person 3D experience. An immersive setting with story background and world simulation where I can (within tight limits) do whatever I want. Bonus points if I am somewhat a special/superior character, however borderline pathetic that may sound.So much for the review of this game.OTHER GAMES LIKE THISGames that satisfy some of the above criteria:Deus ExDeus Ex: Invisible WarDeus Ex: Human RevolutionDeus Ex: The Fall (which is relatively crappy, and most of all it has damn low FOV, but that can be fixed now according to PCGW[pcgamingwiki.com])Deus Ex: Mankind DividedThief: The Dark ProjectThief II: The Metal Age (2000)Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004)NOT Thief 2014, I don't like this one.Neon Struct (which was very obviously made to deliver on at least the bare minimum of said criteria - recommended, but you should set your expectations low for a good experience)And quite a few more. BUT NOT ENOUGH! Seriously, this kind of gameplay - if it's well done, you will get my money. I'm thirsty enough to even dwell on crappy such products like Far Cry 3/4 which are very obviously a theme park and very obviously uninspired.A MISSING GENREWhile I'm making wishes - what I very much desire to come into existence: A mix of Deus Ex like gameplay and Minecraft. No wait you don't know what I mean: Did you ever create a monster grinder in Minecraft? What's great about that is that the world's elements and simulation are intuitively used to create a considerably different additional element in the world. All of a sudden, you have a ginormous machine in which you constantly hear monsters die, and you get their drops in a central outlet. So, what do I mean when I say ""mix of Deus Ex gameplay and Minecraft""?The best way to demonstrate this is to point out a key difference between Deus Ex: Human Revolution and its predecessors. In DX:HR, the automatic turrets can not just be hacked (which is cool but possible in all DX games), but you can carry them around which allows to create new strategic situations. This is emergent gameplay! I must say that DX:HR's use of this aspect is a bit underdeveloped, but anyway: That's an example of you using elements in the world intuitively to alter the game's situations.So, what if you could build traps (camera wired with explosives; if certain characters are seen, the explosives go off)? Or you could take a terminal and reprogram/reconfigure it somehow. A fully destructible environment would be cool, too: Realize that so far, when this has been done, the destruction was just far too easy. In reality, if you'd explode a LAM on a wall of the 'ton hotel, it would wear down the wall, possibly even knock out a small part of it, but overall you'd do little damage. And shooting a whole magazine into a wall would not make a hole in it.So, what if a realistic form of destructibility and ability to construct (Requiring the right tools and considering weight limits, so no way you can carry around a wall.) were part of the game? What if the machinery you deal with in the end of Deus Ex (1) is somewhat really functioning with its water pumps and such, instead of the buttons just being facade that drive the story? What if in Doom 3, if a firefight damages the pipes and cables around you too much, a side-mission emerges completely naturally/logically: Before you can progress, you have to repair stuff.Do you have any idea how incredibly high the replayability of THOSE games would be? Deus Ex with its fixed world is already high in this regard, but with a more modular world, we'd do real damage to the game market economy :)An additional bonus would be this: 3D game worlds are only facades. Maybe you don't notice, but when you explore a new game world, you actively try to find out which types of doors (or whatever element) are real and which types are only decoration. This factor alone considerably lowers immersion, because even if visually nothing negatively changes to you, you're still looking at the world through these filter glasses instead of just looking at the world. But if the game world would consist of Minecraft-like objects (Not necessarily cubes. E.g. a placed computer terminal object could have its corresponding shape.), you'd know that everything is real, every ""door block"" (or whatever) would fundamentally be like any other door block. And you'd know that the wall is not paper thin with a hall-of-mirrors void behind it, but there is always substance.Minecraft survival is great (Let's ignore creative mode here, and let's also mostly ignore the ability to build.), and 1st person story shooter games are great, what's still COMPLETELY MISSING (Seriously, WTF? Do you realize how crass this is?) is games that mix the two properly. We have plenty of multiplayer destructive environment shooters, but we don't have such a thing as a single player experience in a realistic environment with story and not too much fighting. That's a completely unwritten book. An entire genre waiting to be created, ground waiting to be broken, gaming history waiting to be written.			"

												One heck of a learning curve, but once you understand what this is, you'll love it. It's not an rpg, a shooter, or a stealth game in the usual sense, but an odd mixture of the three that really can only be described as deus ex. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what makes it so great, but from what ive gathered it has to do with the level design, and your choices of skills to upgrade. For example: on one playthrough I built a ""James Bond,"" type character who would sneak through levels with his silent pistol and use grenades and stealth drones to eliminate larger targets, then on the another I made a hackerman type character who had very little in the means of combat, but could sneak past enemies to hack the security systems to turn off cameras and open doors. On the next I built the deus ex equivalent of the terminator. Able to move so quickly and take so much damage that no army could withstand my reign of terror. Once you understand the game, you can play it in just about any way you want... Except for master level swimming and poison resistance. Don't even try it.Protips:*The sides of the redicule do not indicate the exact margins of where your bullets may go. You are more accurate than you think.*Robots are mean, avoid them.*There is always a way to sneak into a compound, even if it appears to be a forced combat situation.*running away is always an option*The gep gun is the best option for a silent takedown.

												It's a level design clinic.  The only other game that's in the frame is Hitman: Blood Money, but these levels are stronger because there are just so, so many ways to get it done.  By the time you complete a level, you've almost assuredly missed half of it.Add to that meaningful character build choices and a wealth of freedom of choice, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.  Want to sneak around and bop everyone over the head with a baton?  Sure.  Prefer to go in guns blazing and use the GEP gun to solve the big problems?  That works too.  Snipe them from a mile out, brain them with a silenced pistol from behind...you've got options.  About all that's missing is Force Lightning.Then there's the sheer volume of content, which is almost too much.  New York is about the length of a conventional game these days.  Then there's Hong Kong and the endgame.  It doesn't get much better than this, if it does at all.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played, but don't expect it to be immediately great. The first level is kind of confusing, you need to rebind the controls, you need to install 'Deus Exe' to get the game running well, etc etc etc...If you can get past all that, this is a global adventure full of prophetic things like class conflict, terrorism, loss of privacy, transhumanism, globalism, rich """"""philanthropists"""""" manipulating society [cough cough soros cough cough], and more. I would recommend if you're a fan of stealth games or a political thinker, and don't mind dealing with an older piece of software.Play on Realistic for the best experience: you die a lot faster, but so do your enemies. Forces you to come up with strategies on the fly and experiment to get yourself out of a situation. The game's quality slumps only a few times: the mission where you board a superfreighter is nowhere near as exciting as it should be, and the MJ12 undersea base is similarly boring.As a music freak I am obligated to tell you that this game has some of the best songs you will ever hear in a game. There's so much good ♥♥♥♥ here that every player has a different answer as to what their favorite is.			"

A uniquely compelling game with an intricate storyline, vast amounts of dialogue and interesting technical presentation.This review originally from May 2009.Deus Ex is foremost a unique game in its field. It is really quite unlike any other game I have ever played. It shares territory with titles such as Half-Life and Tomb Raider, but also takes inspiration from some role-playing games as well. It seems to have carved out or invented its personal little niche in the game market, by mixing two normally contrasting game essentials. It manages to successfully combine puzzle, shooting and RPG elements to create a really exceptional atmosphere. While it may have several middling faults which will occasionally make you cringe, it is mostly an extremely fun and thought-provoking game, inspired by both modern conspiracy theories and philosophy.The storyline is based in the near future, and revolves around nano-augmented (basically this just means technologically enhanced) Agent J. C. Denton, who works for the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO), based out of Liberty Island, New York. As is normal, the world of the future is not a safe place to be, and UNATCO must protect the citizens of the Earth from various terrorist plots and evil denizens. Primarily in the first mission of the game, you must regain control of the Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island, which has been seized by an organisation known as the NSF (National Secessionist Forces). The plot is far to complex to go into detail, and it would also spoil the game, but save to say that the basic premise is that Denton must work to solve problems relating to deadly viruses (which has the lovely sounding name Grey Death), corrupt governments and world domination attempts. The plot is really the best aspect of Deus Ex, as without it, it would not have anywhere near the same novelty value. The game is also extremely long, taking often upwards of twenty hours to complete, and if you were to go hunting for all the many hidden locations, objects and side-quests it will take much longer. Luckily, there are only a few dull moments during this, as you will be visiting New York, Hong Kong and Paris on the globe-hopping crusade. It can however become slightly annoying when you must retrace your steps several times in order to return to previous locations in each city. During this epic journey Denton talks to literally dozens and dozens of other characters, all of whom have a great array of responses, and can be conversed with many times. However, this leads me to probably one of the largest faults of Deus Ex: the character voices.Although every character talks a great deal, and the scripts themselves are very good and involving, the voice acting is frankly rather below standard. Absolutely no characters (with the possible exception of arch villain Bob Page) seem to have any genuine emotions in their voices at all, and instead inhabit a world where emotions have seemingly been destroyed, or at least mainly forgotten about. Denton and his brother Paul both speak like they have walked out of the Terminator films as reincarnations of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Even when people are hurt, they shout or scream only in a vaguely half-hearted manner. Listening to all of these emotionless and mainly blunt conversations can sometimes get a bit tiresome; although you will often be too engrossed in the subjects they are discussing to notice this. On top of this, mainly the musical score is also rather dull, and mostly sounds very similar and unremarkable (though it will inevitably slowly grow on you anyway), apart from the classic main title theme. However, general sound effects and ambient sounds are quite good.Thankfully, gameplay itself is consistently solid throughout. It is theoretically possible to get through the entire game without killing anyone (save from one or two characters who must be incapacitated), as you are given a wide range of both lethal and non-lethal weapons with which to take on enemies. However this can get extremely difficult (as you will be frequently running out of non-lethal ammunition) and furthermore, you are given no incentive to do so (apart from the honour). It is much easier (and often all the more fun) to go in with all guns blazing, although this may not always be the best way to handle a given situation. Shooting and targeting is relatively easy, although it can be tricky earlier in the game when skill levels are lower. Graphically, the game isn't much to look at today, but that just gives it the much sought after ""classic"" feel.A nice touch is to give Denton the various abilities to learn skills such as lock-picking, hacking computers, swimming and making aiming easier, through the reward of skill points, which are earned by achieving certain goals or fully exploring the different maps. This can make your own version of Denton able to complete certain tasks much easier. At first, this system seems overcomplicated, and to be frank it often is leading to an RPG-ish feel, and could have probably been implemented more simply, though the scheme is easily workable. The gameplay also has several nice problem-solving virtues, and situations can be resolved through a number of ways. The game makes use of a detailed inventory menu, from which you can see objects picked up, check health and review known information and objectives. Also, you handling of situations will influence other characters views and opinions of you, subtly changing the storyline. Due to this, it is very unlikely you will ever replay exactly the same story.Deus Ex is simply different from anything else, and stands out from the crowd on its own plinth. It is a welcome change from the more stereotypical action-adventure, and blends many different elements almost seamlessly together. Although it does have some minor faults, I still highly recommend it to anyone, as everyone should be able to overlook the mediocre voice acting and still thoroughly enjoy this game, in all its ""cyberpunk"" glory. In retrospect, Deus Ex has to be looked upon as a worthy contender in any “Greatest Games” list. The true value lies in the morality, philosophy and conspiracy themes the story focuses upon, which help to stimulate both the mind and psyche.			"

												A game with a great story that has a lot of crazy plot twists and many different maps ranging from New York to Hong Kong and Paris, all made extremely well to cater to both stealthy and guns-blazing gameplay. A traditional RPG in the sense that you are able to make J.C Denton exactly how you want him to be, with many different things that you can upgrade, ranging from combat abilities like improving his aim with rifles or pistols, and non-combat abilities like lockpicking and hacking. You can acquire the points needed through completing the current map, many different side quests that can be found in that area and also finding secret locations. The combat in the game can be seen as dated by lots of people and they are not wrong, but when you take into account that it has to be how it is due to it being an RPG, you will learn to forgive it. How the combat abilities work is that you will need to aim your crosshair on the enemy and it will slowly become smaller, which gradually improves the accuracy of your shot. So, if you do not train in the pistol skill, it's going to be very inaccurate and slow to become accurate and will lead to boring tedious gameplay, so I personally recommend upgrading your pistol skill to Trained right at the beginning of the game.There is lots of great albeit corny dialogue throughout the game with all the amazing characters in it. The only negatives for this game is that it is relatively uneasy to get into due to the first map being extremely large and it's quite easy to get lost. Also, some of the dialogue in the game are very low quality, not in the sense that the writing is bad because it's a game from the year 2000, but some of the mics that the voice actors used were very poor quality. Some areas like Hong Kong and Paris have characters with hard to understand accents, and this is most likely on purpose as English would not be their primary language, and personally I loved this.If running on a modern system, I recommend getting some things that allow for higher resolutions and increased FOV, there is a great guide on Steam which helped me a lot in quickly setting it up. In my opinion, don't use the HD character models.

The gameplay remains to this day as tight and fufilling as it has always been. The only real issue that stands befor players today is the graphics, however these issues have been all but resolved through texture update mods that one can find easily through the game's very newsfeed.

												Deus Ex is a game that most of you should know already. It is a game that revolutionized the FPS genre as the original ""Thinking Man's Shooter"". It was groundbreaking in every single aspect, from the open-ended gameplay to the storytelling to the RPG elements it borrowed.Basically, Deus Ex is an FPS with some RPG elements added on to give your character a better sense of progression. You start off as just another agent but as you improve your skills and acquire new implants you become a truly unstoppable force.The maps are huge and sprawling with tons of enemies and civilians and there is never just one way of going about accomplishing your objectives. Everywhere is littered with secret tunnels, hidden stashes, locked doors, automated defenses and patrolling sentries. Although the storyline isn't quite open enough to say that every game plays differently you can safely say that each map has hundreds of different ways to complete it.The storyline will from the start seem like a classic cops vs. terrorists but as you progress through the game you will find that nothing what it seems and nobody is who they pretend to be. You will find that your actions have real tangible gameplay consequences as you decide who should die and who should live and there are many surprises waiting for you down the line.It's not a game that holds your hand and tells you who to kill and who to spare, more often than not a first time player will allow his enemies to live never realizing that there are real consequences and rewards to putting a gun to their head and ending their existence right there. Similarly there are those who can be spared or saved from death that will come back to help you or haunt you later in the game. This is all something you have to figure out for yourself as you play through the game and I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.Although the graphics have aged quite a bit since it's release the availability of high-resolution texture packs and other fan-made graphical enhancements means it's playable even in this day and age.Deus Ex is perhaps one of the greatest games ever released for PC and, in my humble opinion, the greatest shooter ever released. It's only real competition being from the System Shock games.Truly a masterpiece of gaming and hopefully one day we will see a proper sequel.			"

												A true legend, Deus Ex is the ultimate game, the game every other game wants to be. It is complete with a story worthy of a trilogy of books and their respective movies and an amazing, breathtaking, dynamic gameplay.What's your style? You could hide in the shadows, lockpick that door, walk around slowly, and silently take down that guard with your electric prod, or, you could blast through that iron door with a LAM and annihilate all enemies with your plasma rifle, or perhaps you could hack into their security system and turn it against them, the possibilities are infinite, but beware, your actions, decisions, and even the way you play the game WILL have consequences.""Never know when I might come up against heavy armor.

												The original Deus Ex has made its way into my all-time favourites since my very first time playing it about three years ago, and it is unfortunate that I did not experience this masterpiece when it came out. Just over two months ago, I finished replaying it, and those were amazing two-odd weeks ploughing through its almost perfect campaign.This is the ultimate epitome of a first-person role-playing game. Even its very few flaws do not result in any considerable frustration, and the fluidity in gameplay and mechanics outbalance the blemishes, thanks to its excellent insertion of the augmentation system and its relevance to mission progression, or its meticulously designed maps, or its well-balanced and concise skill chart. Stealth would need a little improvement in terms of AI response and timing of critical moments (e.g. the player finds situations in which, after being flat-out spotted, the only urgency is to hide behind a crate so that the sin is forgiven), and it must be said that this is the game’s most apparent problem. In sum, the challenge that the stealth element poses is greatly reduced by the enemy’s poor response and follow-up actions to spotting. Another problem is the shallow issue of graphics and general animation. Naturally, this is a minor aspect to worry about, but it could be argued that textures, as well as said animations, are not en par with games from the same period, such as the posterior Return to Castle Wolfenstein, or even the preceding System Shock 2; both more visually appealing than Deus Ex.It could be argued that story, writing and player’s choice are the pillars that hold the game up there on the eRPG Olympus. The main premise encompasses themes such as global conspiracy, scientific/pharmaceutical agendas, corporate domination of geopolitics, and the confines of biological manipulation. The approach to such themes demonstrates the maturity and profound research done by main writer Sheldon Pacotti, and the ideological directions that the game can take will depend solely on the player, without any biases ultimately affecting the general mood. Main missions are no-nonsense tasks that are as intimately related to the plotline as a story-driven gaming narrative can get, and the side missions are an additional flavour to the lore that periodically unravels with each book or data vault accessed. Everything works in perfect unison. The long and versatile campaign can be played several times and still not be exhausted from all the plot possibilities that arise should the player simply pick a different choice when dealing with a major objective. The choices shall always be there, whether the headway involves breaching into a building to reach a quest target’s whereabouts, or choosing the fate of the populace from a destitute area portrayed in a grim future. Additionally, the story carries convincing alternate chronicles for the fictional geopolitical scenario that it proposes: the protagonist J. C. Denton travels to multiple locations in different real-world countries and, either through news segments found on papers casually lying about or through dialogue, is able to make sense of the plot and the dystopian intricacies that it articulates. In fact, every piece of plot-related data is cleverly placed and communicated, and even the interpolations are executed meticulously and with later lore to back it up as the player advances through the missions. The several twists in the narrative never wane, precisely because every bit of adversity is accounted for during gameplay and is there to integrate the political dilemma posed by the storyline.Remarkably orchestrated, Deus Ex excels at virtually every aspect of gaming development, which paved the way for the title to become such a successful franchise afterwards. Incorporation of several gameplay dynamics may be its most notable quality – quite a novelty for a late-90s/early-2000s game, and a virtue that it shares with the likes of the aforementioned System Shock 2, for instance –, even though story and writing may be its greatest one *for an RPG*. In terms of audio production, besides some decent voice acting, the beautiful soundtrack conveys the game’s cyberpunk aesthetics, and the synth-based music is an aural delight composed by Unreal genius Alexander Brandon and Michiel van den Bos, among others. Deus Ex is a genuine gem of its time and onwards; a complete package for those who crave for a mature action-RPG experience and/or for those who want a taste of high-quality sci-fi in a videogame.

Soon you will have your God, and you will make it with your own hands.Often considered the greatest game of all time, I came into the original Deus Ex with high expectations. I played entirely unmodded, wanting to see what the game was like all those years ago. GameplayProbably the most important factor in the enjoyment of a game is gameplay, and Deus Ex delivers in this department. It does take some time to adjust to the somewhat clunky controls and mechanics of the game, but when it all finally clicks for you after some experimenting, you feel immensely rewarded. All it takes is to find a style of play you really enjoy, and there are many different styles. For example, the first mission provides you with an immediate choice of weapons: Rifle, Crossbow or GEP Gun. Then you are let loose to blast terrorists or sneak around, or any mix of the two. So many different choices in every level, it would take me a very long time to describe it here. StoryI don't want to spoil anything, because the story is one of the best I've experienced in gaming. But here is the basic premise: You are the newest agent in anti-terrorist organization UNATCO and are sent to stop a group of terrorists called the NSF from stealing a cure to a virus... The story unfolds from there...Graphics, Atmosphere and SoundThe graphics are quite dated but still functional. There should be no real issues here; gameplay and story is what matters. The main issue is facial animation for me, and I did get some texture clipping, but mods and other things likely fix this. The atmosphere is great, I felt as though I was actually there. I don't, again, want to spoil anything; it's best if you experience it for yourself. The soundtrack is truly excellent; a techno-beat to most of the music, and a little bit of jazz sprinkled in here and there; brilliant stuff. I listen to it outside of the game it's that excellent. ConclusionIf you have never played Deus Ex, then what are you waiting for? At least say you gave it a fair go, and you will have been able to experience what was once the height of gaming, and now is relegated to perhaps a lesser position, but is still truly excellent. jmcone's personal rating: Highly Recommended "

												The 21st century sees the global elite consolidating power like never before. Intergovernmental organizations usurp the sovereignty of member states: nullifying their constitutions and borders. Nations control their citizens through technology and subterfuge, staging false flag attacks in order to brand political dissidents as terrorists. Dread and unease accompany the feeling that everything's terribly wrong, but the world is so complicated that no one can connect the dots to see the big picture.Deus Ex has a kickass story that doesn't sound a bit like today's world stage, The gameplay is tight and encourages multiple playthroughs with radically different character builds and strategies. Spend 5 to 10 minutes re-binding those dank default keys and you're in for some Grade A Choice Cut Gaming™.			"

												Deus ex fanboys will try to decapitate me for saying that i liked the game but didn't love it. I know for a fact that i would have loved it if i played it when it came out but i only played it for the first time a few years ago so the game is a little dated to me. This game can be brutal to newcomers or modern gamers that don't play these classic pc games. You are not specialised at any skills at the start of the game so those first few hours can be very difficult and you can easily f*ck up what you chose to upgrade and you cant reverse it.Stages like Hong kong, raiding the warehouse in new york and the ocean lab is why i really like this game (and the laser sword) however i do feel the gameplay is a bit dated and some of the stages i found really boring like paris. I still think its a great game and you should try it at least once. 8/10 (Great)			"

Before rambling, I would like to give a special thanks to Brother Tasty and my actual brother, TableTerrorsMatt, for proof-reading this review. Deus Ex is a stealth action game created by Ion Storm in the year 2000. Now this legendary entry in the gaming industry is considered one of the most innovative of all time to many, included in its theme of stealth, roleplaying, choice, action, exploration, and many other labels, as its popularity has transcended since its creation. In Deus Ex, you play as protagonist JC Denton, an operative for UNATCO who’s primary focus is to thwart a terrorist organization, NSF’s, tactics, such as the theft of a chemical weapon known as Ambrosia. The player given primary and optional objectives during the briefing for each mission, and then are allowed free reign to complete said objectives in, pretty much, any way they wish.Here are a few items that I found of interest in Deus Ex:Roleplaying - As protagonist JC Denton, players traverse various stages with given objectives while gaining experience points to enhance aspects of their character’s statistics. The upgrade system is impeccable, and allows the player to proceed in situations in nearly any way possible, which allows for multiple forms of play and progression. Another element of great importance is how choices-both in and out of dialogues-affect an abundance of things within the game. For example, your starting equipment choices and statistics will influence how you manipulate the world and its peoples, allowing you to uncover a multitude of secrets. Simple actions such as going to the ladies’ restroom to check for loot may prompt simple dialogue changes, hence why Director Joseph Manderly, the protagonist’s boss, scorned me for doing so. A touch of realism is portrayed in Deus Ex as well since getting paid actually feels like getting paid. For example, Director Manderly will explain your monetary and experience gains after each mission within a conversational flow, which accentuates a seamless transition between operations and downtime.Stealth System - It is difficult to entirely describe the sensation that is this title’s stealth gameplay presents. Character augments, statistical upgrades, and player skill all contribute to the experience, yet this game seemingly knows how to also look past these and simply demonstrate a stealth ‘feel’ in comparison to relying on only the said features. Like nearly every other game created in the genre, the player can maneuver while hidden through territories by utilizing the crouch command-activated with the Control key-and by passing silently in the shadows, preferring muffled or melee eliminations over brutal assault. Several useable items such as the stun rod and tranquilizer rounds for the crossbow emphasize the purpose of stealth, but are not so overpowered that it makes the approach simple; player timing and cunning are key to success while dodging enemy forces in Deus Ex.Player and Non-Player Dialogue - As described previously, many of the actions that JC Denton can perform may be mentioned by non-player characters throughout the game; some of these exchanges can occur randomly-such as in the incident mentioned within the spoiler text-, but mostly appear within conversation with others. There is also a great dialogue selection when speaking with civilians or UNATCO personnel ranging from calm and inquisitive to brash threatening.Level Design - Though similar themes may be present through individual missions, each level retains its own unique feel and layout that abstains from any two levels being blindly alike. Deus Ex utilizes a multiple-layer design in many of its missions, with street-, basement-, and roof-accessible venues that contribute to the open-ended gameplay; this may not seem like a huge feature, but with so many stealth action games forcing players to endure ‘straight’ level mechanics while claiming its style to be open-world, this ideal is magnificent. Strewn throughout each level are also intricately-placed traps and alarms that Gary Gygax himself would be proud of.TL:DR - Deus Ex is undoubtedly a legend in the gaming world, and continues to shine in its current age. This title near-flawlessly executes a stealth gameplay experience that all fanatics of the genre must play. There is so much more I would like to say about Deus Ex but nothing anyone could say can truly bring justice to how innovative this game was and still is. I highly recommend this title to individuals who enjoy stealth action, roleplaying, and cyberpunk themes. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

It has everything - a magnificent atmosphere of cyberpunk, the interesting part of the story and memorable characters, varied gameplay and an excellent level design.

												How many years had passed since I first played this game? Nine? Well even after all this time, it's hard for me to find game which would give player great story with many ways of aproaching it. One of the things that didn't age well here are the graphics. Of course, you can repair it with some mods (if you're at moding try ""Malkavian"" mod), but animation may still bug you out. Is it worth it? Hell yes. You can put hours upon hours, and still find something like hidden stach, weapon, dialogues or even locations. My advice is to wait a bit, so you can save some penies on bigger discount.			"

												Extremely entertaining stealth and sniping gameplay that is negligibly marred by the suspension-of-disbelief-shattering stupidity of the guards. The shooting is atrocious and the guns are boring, but interestingly enough, on high difficulty (where open gunfighting is non-viable regardless) this isn't even apparent. The story is so conspiracy-theory laden as to be comical, but merits a mention as an interesting cyberpunk tale.			"

Choice and Consequence.Even in recent times, no other game comes close to the feeling of choice and consequence that Deus Ex offers.Along with atmosphere and quality of writing, it's one of the game's most obvious strengths. They are both factors that persist throughout the entire game allowing players to forge their own J.C Denton. At a time when players had not seen this marriage of complex storytelling but in a 3d world, Deus Ex managers to offer up an incredibly rich and adult story while pulling it off effortlessly. Huge props to the writers(s)Unfortunately time has not been kind to the gameplay and presentation of Deus Ex. The game was not a stunner on release, and the gameplay will definitely seem antiquated to most people. But it's not bad by any means, it just lacks a lot of niceties that modern games offer.Do yourself the favour. It's consistently named the best PC game of all time for a reason... "

												The ambience, the environment itself, the sensations I felt when I picked it up for the first time were...inefable. Okay this game is so great because some guys from Looking Glass (the dev team behind SS2, that is System Shock 2) decided to make another great game.It is pretty similar to SS2 in a variety of ways:-inventory-Role-Playing-Game features are almost alike-weapons are almost alike tooThere is something more:-talking with other people will help you get through a lot of troubles-there is some simple Stealth mechanic which makes the game more interesting-non-linearity makes replaybility feasible-deep reasonings around philosophical concepts (not too much I assure you and they are not unnecessarily mind-bogglingly complicated as Hegel)This game talks about how humans modified their bodies to become more powerful through cyber implants. This shifted human potential limitessly. You are the newest model: a genetic enhanced human being. Someone is hiding something, but for the moment you are safe. Watch your back Agent, for lots of issues lie up ahead.There is the DeusEx Editor if you wish to spend some time building your own levels.In short:I recommend this game because it is a must have in the FPS-RPG hybrid genres. I consider this game as the indirect offspring of SS2 and because it is a lot more deep than most games nowadays, I want you to consider this tiny review with a great deal of care.Thanks for reading.

												Let me start off by saying that I am not writing this as if I'm halfway into the game or I've only completed the first mission and collectively soiled myself in pure excitement and leftover tacos. No, I have just finished the game not more than 10 minutes ago, and managed to grab all 3 endings in the process. I will tell you right now, although games like Oblivion and Portal cloud my top 5 favorite games with the ham fisted strength of nostalgia, this game is one of the greatest games I have ever experienced. The stealth is near-superb, with the only hiccups being that bodies will go undetected and JC will be chewed out for killing, even though everyone was rendered unconscious. I played through the game utilizing only the stealth crossbow, taser, and police baton in a fruitful effort of not killing anyone, but the beauty is that you can play through however you want. Depending on how you allocate your skills, you can speed through maps toting a nuclear death launcher or a small machine gun, paving the way with bullets. You can be cautious and invest in disabling security, then sneakily headshotting enemy troopers. Or you can be like me, and be the ghost that is never seen. All of the above only focuses on the gameplay aspect. The story? Fantastic. It has the right amount of plot deviations and well versed story telling that surrounds itself in conspiracy. The graphics? They are subpar, but for the year 2000, not too bad. The soundtrack? While it is very 2000-centric in nature, it still holds up very well and fits the mood of the area. It will leave your ears wanting more and more.So, do I recommend this game? Yes. Yes, very much so. No matter what your playstyle is, the game will fit it like a glove. Don't hesitate to purchase.

												Members of the Trilateral Commission have gone on to become Presidential candidates and there is a conspiracy among these well connected elites to use the powers of the UN to bring about a global world order that begins with a continuation of a historical process that has been occuring since the 1920's whereby the wealth gap increases until we begin sanctioning off the lower classes and killing them off in a modern form of Eugenics where only the wealthy and elite survive.JC Denton: ""Do you have a single fact to back that up?""It was at that moment that I loved JC. This is what I like about JC: he's realistic. I'm tired of dimwitted protagonists that act shocked at twists we all saw coming, or act like teenage anime protagonists that believe in the power of friendship. JC is real. Albeit a little...odd. I think they were aiming for ""Robo-cop"" with him, which would explain his frank, albeit odd, manner of speaking. Such as when someone asks if their new partner is going to be the type to wear gaudy glasses, to which he reponds, ""my vision is augmented"". It's pretty humorous how matter-of-fact he is, but entertaining as well. I like it.In case you haven't figured it out, Deus Ex is a video game taking place in an alternate future where all the conspiracy theories Alex Jones espouses are actually true. You're Jesus Christ Denton, an augmented agent of UNATCO, a UN style organization that attempts to maintain the peace of the world, a world gripped by a dystopian future whereby a ""Gray Death"" illness is causing turmoil among the lower classes as the pandemic kills off people and the rations of cures seem to only go to the upper class. The game has you going out on missions in large maps with primary objectives and secondary objectives you get right away or by talking to locals. The maps are large because the levels are meant to be tackled in various ways, such as through grates or hacking. You're meant to explore levels and find a way to accomplish your goal, which is why this game has meme status as a title meant to be replayed over and over for years on end. It's sort of amazing that even to this day this level of openness in accomplishing objectives still feels fairly new. And it's not as if Deus Ex is some MONOLITH title where you can do 900 different things to complete an objective, but the fact that more games haven't caught on is sort of surprising. It's not as if the game has a divergent plot: the plot still moves down a linear path, so you can't say that linear storytelling is impossible if you have options in gameplay.I will say that the game's shooting mechanics leave a lot to be desired. The game's combat handles oddly; it's not bad or anything, it's just not the best shooter. I talked to someone about this and they told me its becase Deus Ex isn't a shooter...and with all the options in how to tackle objectives...I can sort of see their point. Or rather, it doesn't HAVE to be primarily a shooter, which is to its benefit as its a below average shooter. The game is like this partially because there are upgrades to weapons for accuracy and reload times, and you can upgrade proficiency in these weapons through your skill tree. My only issue with it is that it doesn't feel like you're ADDING to your proficiency but rather placing BACK what the developers took AWAY. There's a definition between addition to the original and placing back what was originally there; it's like actual DLC and merely unlocking what's on the disc. The game becomes a better shooter when you upgrade, but you'll have to really go far into the game for taht to happen.Also, unlike MGS where gunfire and shots alert the facility and everyone takes note, in this game an enemy firing his gun at you and getting killed won't necessarily alert his allies in the facility. It's not really a large issue, but it leads to a sense that the enemy alertness and ai isn't fantastic as you get away with making more noise than you really should be able to. You can have a loud firefight with a shotgun and after taking out two people, go back to stealthing as if nothing happened, so long as you take out the people in the immediate vicinity. It becomes apparent that this isn't MGS levels of tightness in stealthing. Despite that, move over Half Life why wasn't this game of the decade for 2000-2010. It has everything a complex game needs to remain relevant years later. Typically, a game that tries big things is outdated later on down the line, and simpler games tend to last longer due to how simple they are (Doom). But Deus Ex still has an engaging plotline, variety and versatility in tackling objectives, maps that are still commendable in their size and areas to explore, complexity in its mechanics and RPG elements, and most of all it still has a feeling of being unique in the totality of its package. Usually the crowd overhypes things, but nope. The crowd is right: Deus Ex is an awesome game that is still good to this day. *HIGHLY* recommended.PS. God damn is this game long without feeling like it's just padding ♥♥♥♥ out. Why can't more games be lengthy AND packed with content. Usually titles drag out but not this one: there's purpose to the length.			"

												I remembered having invested a huge amount of time playing this game last year immediately after buying it from winter sale and here's what I can say about this game based on what I can remember,  What I liked about Deus Ex  ;-  Gameplay variety  such as hacking an ATM or computer using ICEBREAKER, using multi-tool to unlock the door, being stealthy allows you to be a pacifist like rendering your enemies unconscious with stun gun or baton (with correct aug upgrades and skills), insta-kill your enemies with headshots with Stealth Pistol upgraded with scope and better damage or simply sneak past as many enemies as possible-  A well written story of a cyber-punk sci-fi thriller  about an augmented man working for an anti-terrorist faction against NSF who finds himself in a complicated, black and gray morality situation with corrupted people and others with best intention willing to do some shady work such as  a noble terrorist leader willingly gives away weapons to some punks who used them to mug a hobo -  Augmentations and skills In my first playthrough (pacifist-run), JC is trained in using Low-Tech weaponry and heavily augmented with Combat Strength so that I could knock out enemies with a baton on their heads while remaining stealthy. Later on, I made JC ♥♥♥♥ing bulletproofed with dermal armor and can regenerate his health at faster rate while knocking out most enemies with single hit using a ♥♥♥♥ing baton because JC is master in Low-Tech weapons.-  This game acknowledge your actions  For example,a) I remembered one time when my superior scolded me for entering a female toilet room.b)  During my escape from UNATCO, at a train station, I stumbled upon Anna Navarre who blocked the entrance to the exit. As usual, I decided to run away to the exit and surrendered to Gunther after finding myself completely outgunned and outmanned by UNATCO forces. But I got curious about what would happen if I choose to fight Anna so I reload a previous save and tried to fight Anna with my missle launcher. To my surprise, I killed Anna with maybe 5 or 6 rockets...and Gunther swore a revenge on me later on. Usually, pacifist players would kill her with a kill-switch in which I did in my first playthrough c)  Before I defect to NSF, I managed to turn the satellites to certain directions and eventually a villain found out about this and sent a group of UNATCO soldiers to take me out. Of course, I reload a save and knocked every UNATCO soldiers out in a building and once again to my surprise, the villain told me that I ""won this round"" and I'm going to die within 24 hours because they made a kill-switch specifically for me -  Attention-to-detail Admittedly I only read some newspapers, books or whatever to understand the lore and background of this game. But I do noticed for the fact that the writers put amount of effort to put any existed theories into the game such as Area 51, Illuminati and so on. Perhaps, I should read as many as I can in my next playthrough?-  Replayability This game is designed to be played in many ways as possible. Thus, giving me an excuse to play the game for a second round with a different build for JC in the future.-  Soundtracks -  Runs really well in modern laptop, for the most part  On the otherhand, there are numerous flaws in this game such as  ;-  This game is too ♥♥♥♥ing dark I remembered at one of certain points in the game where I had to navigate myself at the top of apartment buildings filled with NSF soldiers equipped with snipers. Even if I did make my game more brighter, I can't see a thing in distance and it makes me nauseas.-  Some cheesy voice acting especially from Asian characters... -  The graphic for its time seems a bit out-dated even compared to other games released at 2000/2001 that I've played -  The dialogue choices in the game seems limited -  Some skills are pretty useless and not worth investing skill point on them specially swimming and hacking Though hacking is not entirely useless, its just that you have to click the ICEBREAKER and wait until it allows you're in and from there on, you can deactivate the cameras, turrets and bots quickly before the timer runs out.Overall, I give this game 8.5/10. Deus Ex is far from perfect but its a well-made game that gives you many solutions to solve problems without resorting to killing enemies.  Hell, you can even finish the boss fights using words if you try to look for this solution with effort  "

												Prior to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and the success of that title, came Deus Ex, the game that started it all. Playable in 16 and 32 bit, this game shows it's age even on the higher graphical settings. More simplistic than later incarnations of the series, Deus Ex, still packs a punch as a fun and exciting game, taking you through the Deus Ex Universe. If you loved Human Revolution, you must play the Original Deus Ex, just to absorb the back story. If you are new to the series, I recommend the original Deus Ex, prior to playing the newer, later games in the series, to get the full back story. All in all, it is still a great game and there are aspects of the game that look visually amazing, such as some reflective surfaces. Still a Thumbs up.			"

												This is one of the best games ever made, I never got to play it when it was first released, so i bought it in the Square Enix titles sale, because i heard alot of good things about Deus Ex. Was Deus Ex  that  good?  YES   Yes, Yes, Yes. It was even better than I expected *Spoilers Ahead*Deus Ex drives you into a futuristic dystopian world, where you find out that the government is corrupt, that UNATCO (The organization that you worked for) is corrupt too and that they are working with different organizations that hide the vaccine to the plague from the civilians, one of those groups, Majestic 12, is doing experiments with humans and animals, and other terrifying experiments.In Deus Ex you change sides from the UNATCO to the NSF, Illuminati, Triads and the Silhouette. Turns out your brother, Paul Denton, worked for those organizations, and you have to the option to follow him or not, and later in the game you will have to make a critical decision if Paul lives, or dies. The more you advance and play the game, the deeper you go into the conspiracy.The Atmosphere in Deus Ex is just simply amazing, despite the old graphics (which i dont really care about, i dont play games for their graphics) it feels like you are really trying to find out the truth in a dystopian world, and the awesome  music is done by a musical genious, Alexander Brandon, who also made soundtracks for Jazz Jackrabbit 2, Unreal Tournament, Unreal, and many more games. By the way, this game predicted 9/11... when you start the game... you should notice.Deus Ex: Game of the year Edition is a masterpiece. Everyone should play it.			"

Deus Ex is quite simply a class apart.By the time I acquired a PC of my own, Deus Ex had already succeeded Half Life as the cutting edge game of choice and as such it was one the first titles I owned on the format.With so many well realized characters, set pieces and working objects ranging from hacking tools to working vending machines, Deus Ex followed Duke Nukem 3D‘s example by offering one of the most interactive game worlds ever seen.Although playing around with the basket ball on the junkie-owned court in the first open level was fairly pointless in of itself, it’s the little touches like these that gave Deus Ex a reputation for exceptional realism and believability.Ultracool protagonist JC Denton visits many detailed environments over the course of the story and the open nature of each one forms a basis for the game’s lasting appeal. Whether you storm into a hostage filled room guns blazing, enter quietly through an open window or hack the code lock on the front door; there are many different approaches to each situation you find yourself in.This is combined with a satisfying character progression system that allows JC to increase his proficiency in everything from firearms, lock picking, computer hacking and even swimming. Because of the range of non-violent solutions to each scenario, Deus Ex is often considered to be closer to an RPG than it is a straight shooter; something that was a very new and exciting prospect in 2000.In a similar vein to another PC classic Thief; Deus Ex blends stealth, gunplay and a mature cyberpunk setting to great effect and has created an enduring legacy for its legion of dedicated fans.The game’s final quarter is a bit weak though and many aspects of the story form a labyrinthine mess of conspiracy angles when you get down to it, but none of that spoils what is an excellent game and one rightly regarded for letting players take their own individual approach to the task at hand.Deus Ex is the game that taught other games how to grow up and reach a wider audience.Exceptional.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												DEUS EX is a Role Playing Game with First Person Shooter elements in it, made in the year 2000 by Ion Storm and published by Warren Spector, releaced for the PC, using the Unreal 1 engine.This is the greatest game ever made of all time (PC)No I'm not kidding, lying, or even just saying that to signify it's importance or how great it is:This really IS the greatest videogame ever made for the PC.It has won over 200 GameOfTheYear awards, and many areas of videogame ideas and influence of even compleatly different generas can be traced back to Deus Ex.The concept for Deus Ex came from Ion Storm (Austin) being split into three groups:Group 1 was dedicated to creating the best PC exclusive FirstPersonShooter everGroup 2 consisted of people with a lot of experiance in RolePlayingGames, andGroup 3 mostly included people from Looking glass studios, whose recent success in Thief: the dark project, wanted to see a future version of their FPS Stealth game.And by combining the ideas and thoughts of all 3 groups, Ion Storm (Austin) created the greatest PC game of all time. And when you play it, you won't find it hard to believe.The plot is set in a dystopian world during the year 2052, and follows the rookie United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) agent JC Denton (hint: YOU), as he sets out to combat terroist forces (the NSF), which have become increasingly prevalent in a world slipping ever further into chaos, through a highly contaigus viris called the Grey death, only curable by the vaxine Ambrosia. As the plot unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a deep and ancient conspiracy, encountering various organizations (to say whom would spoil too much), conspiracies, lies and twists, that carry on throughout the whole game, as he travels through various environments and cities, from NewYork, to Rome, to Hong Kong, and manny more.The RolePayingGame parts include Upgrading skills and Augmentations to increase JC's effectivness in the field, and choosing diologe between characters, which not only effects the way characters treat you, but also the effects of the multiple endings, and the multiple roots and pathways PRIOR to said multiple endings.But the real inovation in Deus Ex lies within the open-endedness in the levels: It's not a sandbox game, but its levels have manny pathways to the objectives and manny ways to approch them. You can go in all guns blazing, which gun is up to you, or choose different weapons, Lethal or Non-lethal, and try to stealth through it, and because JC has an inventory system, this is possable, although that certain weapons take up a bigger space in the inventory slot, and the re-aranging of the items has created the name ""Inventory-Tetris"".Remember when I said Non-lethal? Yes it is possable. You can stun, or knock out enemies to make them unconsious, meaning you didn't kill them, or hack a security turret to kill them, meaning YOU didn't kill them. Also, you can skip past the Boss fights entirely, not killing them or knocking them out.Heck, it won a guiness world record for being able to compleate the game and only have to kill 2 PEOPLE.It's that kind of deph you will find here.Obviously, it's not just stealth, and a few areas require you to shoot through them, and the FPS elements are pretty good:There's no iron-sights since they hadn't been invented at the time, although you can upgrade some weapons to have a scope on them, although if you aren't trained in these areas, your aim and crosshair will fumble and spread all over the place. There's no regenerating-health (F that cow-waste) or Heath-bar per say. Damage is taken through to the different parts of your body. Too manny arm shots & you're gonna struggle with aiming. Too manny leg shots, and you're gonna have trouble with movment. Health is replenished by using Med-kits on the different body parts, eating food found in certain places (i.e a drinking fountain or resteraunt), or using Androids found in a few places in various environmentsAnd the MUSIC: holy heck the MUSIC. Just look up the Unatco theme on YouTube, and you'll see how AMAZING the music is.It was composed by Alexander Brandon, who also did the Unreal tournament music, and a few others I haven't listed. OK...Now I've praised Deus Ex long enough, time to get into the problems.It's not perfect. When I say best PC game of all time, I mean that all the things good about it outweigh the bad parts so much, that it makes it the best Pc game of all time: it's THAT good.The first problem is for the modern era: it has aged like absolute COW-WASTE. The visuals are very dated, & it wasn't ground-breaking for it's time either, and that can put off a lot of first-timers.The second problem is with the design choices:Certain skills & augmentations are downright USELESS.Ask any Deus Ex veteran about the ""Swimming"" skill, and they'll instantly get what you mean. The skill is never needed to progress ANYWHERE in the game. This is the same-ish issue with ""Environment training"", because being able to use radioactive suits, dull effects of poisons, and things of that nature isn't that helpful.The skill for ""Melee weapons"" is also debatable in usefullness, because half-way through the game you are given a powerful sword that can kill most enemies in 1-2 hits.Stealth can be a bit glitchy with certain weapons downright wierd.The Crossbow with tranquilliser rounds for instance:The effects on the poison depend on where it hits the body. If it hits the head, it takes 1-4 seconds to pass out. Anywhere else and it takes 5-12 seconds, during which time the enemy can run around, warn other people, set off alarms, & be a downright pain.Also, the final problem, and this is directed at YOU if you plan on getting this, is that it has a VERY small accessabuillty factor.It can be hard to get into, if first-timers don't know most of the flaws.They read all of the reviews saying how awesome it is, and load up the game, expecting a good old time; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. They'll see the character creation screen, put a few points into lethal weapons, and gun handling, expecting to shoot their way through the first mission, only to find themselves out of ammo, and not killing anything.People who expect to play through the game, and listen to all the audio diologes, collect every weapon, hack all the security cameras, and upgrade everything on the first playthrough; It will JUST NOT HAPPEN the first playthrough.You may get into the universe, and master everything in the game, but this WILL NOT happen during your first playthrough.But at the end of the day, Deus Ex still stands the tests of time, and deserves ALL of those GOTY awards it got.You know the saying with Deus Ex? Every time you mention it, someone re-installls it? Yeah, there's a reason for that.So the 2 big questions are:Is it Really the best game ever made of all time on PC? andShould you play it?To answer both those questions simply: YES*And I said Yes with the asterix ( * ) as a disclaimer for first timers.Because there are problems with it that you should watch out for, but get over them, and there really hasn't been a better game then this.Deus Ex also had 2 sequels: Invisible war, and Human Revolution (the latter better well known), and while fans will argue till their mouths are sore over which is better, out of the 3, Deus Ex is the best of them.I  EXTREMALY HIGHLY recommend this game to pretty much anyone into this.6/5			"

												Few games exist in this mortal plane that provide the degree of choice and freedom Deus Ex provides. Want to run around and bludgeon everyone on Liberty Island to death with a crowbar? Go ahead. Want to explode every dog in Hong Kong? Go ahead. The fact that this game came out in 2000 is mindboggling. Sure, the graphics look like ♥♥♥, but the massive levels and sheer scope of the experience as a whole more than compensate. The ending(s) alone make for one of the most memorable choices in gaming history. Buy it.			"

												This hybrid of genres (RPG, First Person Shooter, Stealth and Adventure) is a gem. Despite the years, is a very complex game and introduced a series of mechanics which are still praised today.PROS :- Incredible story (What begins as the simplest thing in the world, ends up becoming a story full of conspiracies and betrayals to the point of not knowing who to trust, followed by a climax that few games can reach).- The decisions you make along the adventure change the narrative of the ending.- Completely open-character to all missions (From the first to the last, you have multiple ways to fulfill your primary and secondary objectives).- Long campaign (If you dare to explore absolutely everything, you will ensure a minimum of 60 hours of gameplay).- Multiple options for character customization (Integration of augmentations that allows you to perform specific actions and skills that can be enhanced at different levels).- You can mold the character to fit your playing style (If you're a pacifist, you can create a stealthy character to avoid direct confrontation, or if you prefer to face the situation ala John Rambo, you can create a real killing machine).- Wide variety of weapons (From improvised weapons to non-lethal, knives, pistols, shotguns, rifles, bazookas, energy weapons, etc. Many of these, completely customizable in their performance).- Various options to interact with the NPC's (Resolving a situation by the way of the dialogue, intimidation or force. Your choice affects the opinion of other characters and their behavior towards the protagonist).- The exploration is encouraged (Many hidden areas that keep items, ammunition, experience points to spend, etc).- Features Multiplayer option (Amazingly for a game of these characteristics, you have the option to play in LAN or Internet. At the time of writing this Review, there were about 15 active servers with people in them).CONS :- Relatively small inventory (Although this is not necessarily a bad thing, but merely strategic. You must decide very well which items to carry).- Some bugs and graphical glitches (Textures that become invisible, walls that inexplicably you can go through in certain situations).An unforgettable story set in a Cyberpunk atmosphere of the mid-21st century. The multiple customization options added to the various narratives that you have for your style of play, ensures that the Single Player mode will be played more than once.My Score: 8.8/10Note : Played it on Windows XP - SP3			"

												Need I say more? This is the best PC game of all time. Nuff said!For me, the best game of all time has to be Deus Ex. This game combines different genres (FPS, RPG, Stealth and action) into one and it was the very first piece of media that actually made me think about socio-political issues in real life. It also taught me the consequences of choice and how different choices can lead to opposite or even unexpected results. It might be a dated game by today’s standards, but this game actually respects the player by interacting with him/her through choices and liberty of gameplay to reach from point A to point B while maintaining the player grasped into the plot that is masterfully delivered and never feels unrealistic or over the top. It makes you think on the final outcome of all the choices and paths you have taken and can even make you second-guess yourself for doing it. This game teaches you that there is no right or wrong, just different ways to do things.			"

												""The best way to predict the future is to create it.""Even after a decade Deus Ex remains a masterpiece of visionary game development with a great storyline full of intrigue, political struggles and social commentary. The immersive atmosphere is rounded out by strong role-playing elements and fantastic music. In addition this game provides a broad spectrum of customization (e.g. weapons and bionic components), resulting in a high replayability. The only shortcoming comes in form of the clumsy combat system, which has not aged well.  Fun fact: A film adaptation based on the game was originally announced by Columbia Pictures in 2002, and the release date was scheduled for 2006, but the film never got past the scripting stage.  --My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Characters-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(You've got ten seconds to beat it, before I add you to the list of NSF casualties.)Characters: S-Rank(Now everyone will see why I needed a skull-gun!)Details: S-Rank (I know your UNATCO killphrase: ‘Laputan Machine’.)Tactical gameplay: S-Rank (You can’t fight ideas with bullets.)Story: S-Rank (Trust no one.

												Note: All of these hours are played without any gameplay mods whatsoever. Probably 3 hours on GMDX and that's it. Everything else is the original game. One day soon I'll play some fan missions, maybe. Also this doesn't count the hours I've played on disk which too is a lot and I don't leave the game on without playing it, well purposely anyway.This is my fave game of all time and has been since younger childhood. The first time playing through this was the best experience in any game ever. Absolutely mind-blowing. I just wish I could reexperience playing it for the first time because by now I've played over 300 hours on it (including my disk). This and the Thief series are the most magical games to have a first playthrough of ever. This game has a lot of flaws that also add to its charm, so instead of the normal Pro's and Con's, I'm going to have a Charmy Flaw list as well.Pros:+Great sound design+The greatest soundtrack I've ever heard+Incredible writing and story+Great UI+Kick ♥♥♥ weapons (except the PS20)+Characters are extremely memorable+Heaps of interesting locations+Sub-plots and mini storylines+Optional sidequests are great+Non-linear, multiple outcomes, ways of doing things+Five playthroughs worth of stuff to find and then some (not exaggerating)+Perfect length (took me 22 hours first playthrough)+Which means awesome pacing+Multiplayer ways of playing, lethal, non-lethal, stealth, all-out, no augs etc.+Great dialogue system+Upgradeable skills+Lots of replayability+A really good roleplaying multiplayer (if you want it to be)+Shadow based and line of sight stealth system, Thief like but not invisible when in dark+Have to mention UI again, I mean, it's REALLY good+Feels like a real world (""Who will help the widow's son?"", ""Excuse me?"", ""Oh sorry, I thought you were someone else."")+Nice plotwist early on+Every character you meet is memorable, every one. That dude shouting holy stuff at Battery Park. That rude newspaper girl in Hong Kong. That annoying boy who's annoying to the rude girl in Hong Kong. That ♥♥♥♥ who keeps asking you stuff in Kell's Kitchen (Used Car Salesman?). Those two lesbians in the club in Hong Kong etc.+Great bossfights+Extremely moddable, just like every other UE1 game, even a baby could do it (except Rumi)+Will update review in the future+Great artdesignCons:-PS20 is useless-Most augmentations are useless-Difficulty gets a lot harder all of a sudden at the end-Default FOV is quite small-Graphics were getting decently out-of-date by 2000-Will update review in the futureFlaws/Charms:*♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice-acting here and there (The Aussie chicks)*Hearing footsteps through rooms*AI getting stuck opening doors*Will update review in the futureSound: 9/10Graphics: 6/10 (graphics were getting old by 2000, but the art-design holds up very well)Gameplay: 10/10Content/Replayability: 10/10Overall: 10/10I can't recommend this game enough.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.It's an action/RPG first person game with a lot of different ways to play. You can go inside a building through the front door, or you can find a back entrance. You can hack computers, digital locks, and security consoles, but you can also get the password somewhere. You can pick locks, but you can get the key from somebody. You can kill your enemies, but you can just avoid encountering them at all.The level designs are just brilliant. They're big, but not huge. You can easily memorize them, so it's easy not to get lost. Some of the levels are visited more than once and it feels different everytime, yet you still remember the places.The graphics aren't amazing and they may look outdated, but they fit the atmosphere perfectly. The music is great and every location has its own soundtrack that fits to what you're currently doing.The story is great and a little bit complex with conspiracies here and there, but there's not much to tell without spoiling it. This game is set in 2052 and it takes place in a chaotic world filled with terrorists, drugs, diseases, and augmented humans. There's a lot of memorable characters in this game, and every single one of them has their own personality. You can kill some of the important characters but instead of failing the mission, it will change the story and you will have to face the consequences.In short, it's a great classic game with a great story and music that combines RPG, FPS, action, and stealth elements with a lot of different playstyles to choose.

												This classic was released in 2000, but you shouldn't be scared off by its age – on the contrary: Deus Ex is one of the cherries on the cake of pc gamings heyday; one of those titles you have to have played.Deus Ex offers a unique and fantastic storyline of conspiracies in a dystopic world, which was made so absolutely beautiful and authentic by all those many details you can discover: conversations, e-mails, newspapers, books, bulletin news, sidequests – you name it. I could write an endless text about how superb the story is, but I don't want to spoil anything and everyone should discover it for themselves.The gameplay also offers a great variety of possibilities to attain a goal. And that doesn’t limit to the question, if you should kill or avoid an enemy:  There is always more than one way and often more than two. And some of the consequences don't occur at once, but later in the game.Believe me: There is a reason why Deus Ex is always among the Top 10 of the best games of all time.			"

It was engaging, challenging, moddable, and overall: enjoyable! You may be skeptical at first, but by the midway point you're intrigued. By the endgame, you're hooked! Personally, I have not used any mods, and I only completed one ending, but DANG. WHAT AN ENDING. If you enjoy games with serious plot, action, stealth, decision making, and laughable voice acting on all the non-essential characters, buy this game! $7 is a pittance compared to the mighty wealth of enjoyment you will get from this title.

Not to mention with a beautiful soundtrack to accompany this game and lastly a well in-depth tutorial for players to easily understand. This game offers multiplayer for those curious enough (not sure if it's dead or still active).The only grip with this game but is easily fixed is the mouse senstivity and also when the game registers your PC in terms of what performance it should play on. Make sure you set them low when your in-game.One more thing don't play this game for very long you will feel dizzy and almost sick to your stomach. This is just a health concern and not an actual negative, just a caution.I highly recommend this game. So if you want a game with a dynamic storyline, characters, a worlds mythos and excellent gameplay get this game now.			"

												It is essential that you play this game, if you are even remotely interested in any of the following:- Stealth- Role-playing games and character personalization- The world around you- First person shooters- Meaningful player choice- Conspiracies, poverty, plagues, high-power a**holes and other real-world issues- Political storms- Technology, human augmentation and AI- Complex, scarily realistic characters- Lemon-limeDeus Ex was a pioneer in so many aspects when it came out fourteen years ago. The radical choices you could make (one example: you can actually trot away from boss fights, like a hippie chasing a butterfly). The fact that the game lets you play any style you want: gun maniac to stealth hacker, superior smart-mouth to humble and reasonable agent, and anything in between. The near-perfect blend of shooter, stealth and true RPG elements. The intellectual coherence of the game's philosophical and political conversation, most of which is starkly valid today. And just when you least expect it, a subtle touch of perfectly balanced humour.I won't spoil a bit of this game's fantastic story, which is a complex OCEAN of meaningful events, each one offering enriching, frightening and stunning insights into the condition of the world and the nations that live in it.One issue: the crossbow is useless as a stealth weapon. If an enemy is hit with a tranquilizer dart, they run around screaming, shooting and activating alarms for several seconds before passing out. It's useful if you're doing a pacifist playthrough. For stealth, stick with the prod. pro- with the prod.Just please, please don't let the graphics put you off. The game is widely considered a strong contender for the best game of all time. Don't let your addiction to particle clouds and tessellation and ragdoll physics and 9-hour playthroughs keep you from experiencing this sublime game.			"

Even back then it's graphics were a bit ugly but Deus wasn't about graphics, graphics didn't make Deus Ex the game that made video games worth playing. It wasn't just ""Here's a firearm now go kill whatever you simple-minded.... NO, Deus Ex was much more than that..    Deus Ex was all about the large world to explore and investigate. To play it the way you wanted to play. You didn't have to be a homicidal maniac, you could use stealth and wit. Afterall Deus Ex was/is about ambiance and if you go around killing all the NPC's is does lose the ambiance. It also impacts the storyline..			"

												When I first started playing this game last year, I hated it. Not because of the aged graphics and slightly dated gameplay, no. It was because I had huge difficulties finishing even the first level. I didn't understand that the key in this game is to experiment, find a playstyle and weapon-combination that fits for you and most importantly try different routes to reach your goal. But once I understood all this, my experience with this game changed entirely... It became my favorite game of all time!It is extremely satisfying each and every time you complete your objectives in this game. This is for one main reason, which games of today seem to have forgotten:YOU completed the mission on your own, without being handheld by the game the whole time. You found your own route and tactic to reach the objective and complete it. You don't just get a minimap in this game, or follow a questmarker till you reach your objective. No, you have to gather information, maps or drawings. You have to make notes, complete sidequests and search for hidden (and a bit less hidden) areas and paths. Long story short, you really feel accomplishment because you were the one who did all these things, you weren't just following a marker. The gameplay of this game feels a bit old at times, but it is still fun and rather deep. You have a ton of different weapons, and they all fit to different playstyles. They all work pretty good, except for a FEW hit-detection issues with certain weapons. Augmentations are also a major part of the gameplay, but I'll let you figure out that part yourself :)You can complete a level however you want, and there are a TON of ways you can play. You can be stealthy, a ruthless killing machine or an invisible hacker, OR you can go with one of the countless different variations in between. It is a ton of fun, as you can play exactly as you like.I don't have much to say about the story, because it is epic, exciting and thought provoking, and I am afraid to spoil anything for potential new Deus Ex players. Just believe me, it is GOOD, and it changes according to your actions and choices throughout the game. It was mindblowing even it came out, and even today it stands out as one of the best stories gaming has to offer.This has already dragged on for too long, as I expect most people to have heard more than enough about thIs game to know it is an old masterpiece and a legend in the gaming industry. I really hope that, more people will experience this gem for the first time after reading this review. It is, and will probably keep being my favourite game of all time! :)P.S. The game also has a superb soundtrack, really good stuff!			"

												My best game ever ... and a GOTY one :)I have enjoyed it since early 2000s and finished it from scratch about 10 times! Last time was in 2013 ^^As each game of the series, you will move in an awesome cyberpunk environment, which is as complex and consistent as in the best SF books. Cyberpunk games are usually really interesting because they often deal with a lot of interesting concepts such as transhumanism, bioethics, economy and law.### Pros:- Good story & great cyberpunk environment involving corporations, secret societies, viral diseases and charismatic characters- FPS game with many weapons and their modification, an inventory management system and physical augmentation upgrades (regeneration, stealth, moving speed)- Large number of side quests (you have to speak with most NPC to find them)- Play as a stealthy ninja or Rambo since you can choose your game style- Your choices will have major consequences on the subsequent missions (e.g. death or survival of main characters, long or very quick boss fights ...)- Difficult game in realistic mode, especially at the beginning since you start as a “noob agent”- You will not finish it in 10h (by contrast to many recent expensive bull$hit games) and there are several endings### Cons:- Graphics are pretty poor from a 2014 point of view since the game is OLD ... however, the fan community released mods (NewVision + HDTP) to improve textures and resolution :)- Use the hardest difficulty since the AI can be improvable### Conclusion:You must have Deus Ex in your games library ... just buy it in sales for less than 2 bucks ^^19/20			"

												There is a reason why people commonly use phrases like ""every time you mention it, someone reinstalls the game"" and ""best game of all time"" when it comes to this game - the hype is justified for a reason.Released in 2000, Deus Ex has stood the test of time thanks to its innovative gameplay concepts, engrossing storyline and well-written characters, both major and minor. The game puts you into the shoes of JC Denton, a government operative who is thrust into a world of violence, politics and intrigue while struggling to figure out who to trust.The game combines elements of an FPS with an RPG-style management and upgrade system, well-written and developed characters and a variety of interesting locales to create an experience that is still unmatched. Whether you're searching through the streets of New York to take down a generator, investigating a conspiracy in a high-rise office building in Hong Kong or trying to stop a missile launch in the middle of the desert, the game throws a variety of situations at the player in the context of a major global conspiracy.One thing I've always enjoyed about the story, and which keeps me coming back time and time again to replay it, is the range of possible solutions (and responses) to various problems faced in the game world. You can do things that seem counterintuitive or even absurd, and the game will recognize and praise/admonish you for your actions. Want to kill that nosy reporter, despite the fact that no one has asked you to? The game recognizes it. Want to skip the first mission by throwing a gas grenade at the front door of UNATCO HQ? The NPC's remark on it. Wait too long to talk to an NPC? They may have different introductory dialogue based on when you visit them.Likewise, the characters are very well-written, and have actions that extend beyond conversations with the player and into e-mails, newspapers and books found around the game world. All this material is optional, and players can skip it as they so choose.The combat and NPC reaction to damage can come off as a bit ""stiff"" to modern audiences, but the movement and reaction system in general still holds up quite well, with enemies and NPC's reacting to damage and running away if they are hurt, stopping to reload and changing their firing position or chasing after the player during combat.If there's anything I can criticize this game for (and that's very hard to do), the GOTY does introduce a couple of musical/ambient sound bugs that can lead to multiple pieces of music playing in the same level. Besides that, though, this is still the same tried-and-true Deus Ex experience - you'll play it for the deep characters and storyline, and stay for the different gameplay approaches and solutions (not to mention all of the mods and total conversions!).Deus Ex is a classic, and it's a game I'm honored to have both in my physical and Steam library.

												One of the greatest and most intricately designed RPG's of all time, Deus Ex offers dynamic gameplay which allows you to approach in-game situations how you please, the levels are sandbox styled and consist of non-linear layouts which span multiple different paths to your objectives giving you the freedom to explore and find your own way  through levels depending on how you like to play. Overall this is one of the greatest games ever made, do not be thrown off by the 'dated' visuals (which I find amazing and better than modern games but newer generations might disagree) otherwise you'll be missing out on a masterpiece!

												Even if it's not the best game ever made (and you can make an incredibly strong case for it), Deus Ex is, in 2016, without a doubt the most influential when it comes to modern game design. It was the first game to well and truly demonstrate the potential of ""immersive sim"", a term that you'll read a lot when researching this game. And it's just a fun, breathtaking game. Bold and ambitious and sprawling and surprising. And by God, it holds up.Have you played a game in which you come across an overheard conversation between two guards? Or read a newspaper article or character diary laying around? Or experienced an unexpected consequence of an action you took? Or found a starting-level combination safe with the key containing the letters 0 4 5 and 1? That game owes a heavy debt to Deus Ex. System Shock had audio diaries in '94, RPGs had choices and consequences, but the vision of Deus Ex is a living world, a world that is not just a playground for the character you control but a place where people have to live while you are out busting heads. Combat can and will break out in any setting, but the game shines in Hell's Kitchen. Return from defusing (or detonating) a few hostage situations and you're dumped on the streets of Manhattan, where people are walking around, trying to survive. It feels like a shell of a city because it is - a plague is spreading, jobs are drying up, people are giving up. The game doesn't come out and tell you this in big block letters, you just have to look around and you know (environmental storytelling is old hat in big-budget 2016 games, it was unheard of in DX times). Go to the bar and buy a cold beer for a guy on the job, try to get the bartender to open up about her cyborg implants. Go to the free clinic, where people are talking about the ongoing civil war and waiting to die of sickness. Break into a random apartment and find the bodies of overdose cases. Hack into ATMs and steal cash. Talk to vagrants on the street about how their friends have been vanishing in the sewers...Most of the game is like this - you play as JC Denton, rookie counter-terrorist, who stumbles onto a global conspiracy. Every ""hub level"" (Hell's Kitchen initially, but there are others) has a central objective, something you have to learn or someone you have to deal with, but you're not given direct instruction on how to accomplish it. You're dropped on the curb and left to figure it out, by helping people who live around it or gunning down resistance or just studying the levels and finding the air ducts (thank Deus Ex for how common they are now) and trapped back doors, and using your skills or your superpowered jumping legs to access them, then go in guns blazing or in and out like a cat burglar. And Deus Ex's most celebrated innovation, so imitated in later games, was the ability to go non-lethal, by sneaking past or using tranquilizer darts or knocking people out with a baton (the last is much harder than the first two). If you don't kill anyone, the game will notice and react, at least in the early-to-mid game.Gameplay-wise, there are some learning curves - Deus Ex uses an RPG system for its combat, meaning if you don't invest in a rifle skill (using points earned from completing objectives or for finding things off the beaten path), you're going to have to sit and steady your aim for a few seconds if you want to hit anything closer than arm's length. The stealth system is functional but rudimentary - it's mostly about line of sight, but sound and light levels factor in even though you have to play them by ear. It is possible and even advisable to stick with a pistol through the entire game (the pros, however, choose the GEP Gun).Flaws? There are some. The voice acting is horrible (and eventually, vaguely racist) but at a certain point, it loops around to being great, one of the game's charms (""what a shame""). Some skills are less useful than others. Knocking someone out with a baton requires a head hit from behind which is remarkably frustrating to achieve. And the story, as it expands into epic scope, loses reactivity and some of the Immersive Sim qualities that made it so revolutionary. But it is indeed epic in scope. They sold the demo on CD at Target back in the day, and there was so much stuff in it that I was convinced for awhile that I'd bought the whole thing for cheap. The game is never less than incredible, always showing you new things, throwing dramatic plot curves and more formidable challenges at you. The soundtrack is pure MIDI synth and befitting the cyberpunk setting, with some wonderful (if proggy) tracks.And the replayability? Believe the hype. The game takes choice more seriously than nearly any other game does, and by extension, more than most players do. There is a scene in which you are cornered by your enemies and a friend tells you to run while they stay behind - when I first played, I thought ""this is a game and a well-worn action movie trope, clearly I'll die if I don't do what they say"". I left, and later on I found the friend's dead body. Five IRL years later, I decide to replay the game for the nth time and think ""You know what? I'm going to take down as many as these mooks as I can before they kill me."" So I didn't run, and I killed all the attackers, and the friend lived to show up again, hours later, in a spot where every single playtime before I had run into a conversation about the dead friend. When people say they're still discovering things in Deus Ex, believe them.Deus Ex very slowly came to become the most influential game in AAA development. Games that once would have taken after straight-up shooters like Doom or ""atmospheric"" shooters like Half-Life have slowly begun to emulate its storytelling in key ways, jump-started by Bioshock's evocation of DX environmental storytelling. Many games have tried, in their own ways, to pay tribute to Deus Ex. Dishonored and Dishonored 2 probably come the closest in terms of going whole-hog in recreating the magic, but they don't quite get there, as good as they are. Alpha Protocol takes its bravery with regard to choice and consequence to new levels. And the Square Enix prequels, well, they're love letters, but they lack the fundamental boldness of spirit, the risk-taking, that make Deux Ex what it is.This game costs you almost nothing now, and once you acclimate to the controls and visuals and rhythms of gameplay, it will reward you, and if you're open to it, you will join its considerable cult. It is an undeniable achievement, a grail of design but also a hell of a game to experience. If you haven't tried it, try it. Choose the albino JC, take the computer skill, and walk into the ladies' bathroom when you get back to base. You will become a believer.			"

												About 2 weeks ago, I bought the original Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution: Director's Cut.  Really, I was buying Human Revolution, since that was the game I was really interested in.  I bought Deus Ex on a side thought, as it was $1.39 and all the old gamers kept saying ""It's a masterpiece!""  Besides, I wasn't sure that Human Revolution would run on my potato PC.2 weeks later, I finished the game, and for a couple minutes just stared at my computer screen saying ""Wow"".  I know realize that Deus Ex is indeed a masterpiece...although now that term seems inadequate.Set in 2052, Deus Ex follows the story of JC Denton, nano-augmented agent for UNATCO, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition.  Basically, the world's gone to heck in a handbasket.  A horribly lethal virus, the Gray Death, has spread throughout the world.  UNATCO controls the distribution of the virus, but, as it is in short supply, UNATCO makes sure that the vaccine gets to the rich and powerful, the ones deemed ""vital to society"".  The lower classes have no options, and millions of them die on the streets.  As a result of the lower classes's poor treatment, multiple terrorist groups have sprung up, including the NSF in America and Silhouette in France.  As a member of the ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION, your first missions as JC are to fight the NSF in search of a stolen shipment of Gray Death vaccine, (known as Ambrosia).  Immediately, the games environment perfectly fits the bill.  The entire game is at night, or soon before morning, adding to the dark environment of the world.  On the streets of New York City, it seems that the only people are either terrorists, police, or bums.  The entire city feels oppressed and dangerous.  But the game doesn't stop there.  As events progress and truths are revealed, JC travels across the entire world, visiting such places as Hong Kong, Paris, and the famous Area 51.  There are certain open-world areas, although largely without the side-quests that were found in the prequel.  However, this is where Deus Ex's greatest strength is: freedom.The open areas of Deus Ex are very large, much larger than anything we saw in Human Revolution.  Even the linear levels  were so open that I, in multiple cases, had to keep a rule to make sure I covered anything.  The same is true for the gameplay.  Within a level, there are multiple places to enter a place, achieve an objective.  Unlike games of its time like Half-Life, screwing something up in Deus Ex does not mean it's time to reload from the last save.  Even though it is sometimes simpler to do it the intended way, Ion Storm made a way to do it another way.  I'm sure that another player did something completely different then me based on their playstyle, weapons, resources, skills, and augs. The game does have some flaws.  The graphics are incredibly dated.  Upon first installing the game, the game had poor lighting, making it nearly impossible to see in some areas.  In addition, some of the augs are pretty useless, being useful once or twice but never being worth purchasing again.  Other than that though, I can't find a significant flaw with the game.This game is completely worth the price.  There is no reason not to get it.  9.5/10.			"

												If I had to go back to my teenage years and choose one, and only one, game that shaped my mindset and outlook on the world at large, it would be a close contest with Deus Ex and System Shock 2. Deus Ex is eerily more relevant today than it has ever been - released in the summer of 2000 and writing this review with the hindsight of 15 years, in-game you won't see the World Trade Center in the New York skyline, you'll read newspapers about martial law being declared in the United States, and deal with a global oligarchical conspiracy that intends to cull the population of the planet through a controlled epidemic. The themes and ideas presented in Deus Ex are not for the light of heart, and perfect for the skeptic and those that realize that what you're presented with on the evening news is anything but the whole, true, real picture. All the world's a stage, and Deus Ex illustrates that magnificently. Deus Ex is an arguably timeless video game that transcends the medium into something much more than a way to spend a few hours shooting bad guys. It is a thought provoking and radical experience that changed my life, much as a masterfully written novel would.It's time for my 3-4 year annual playthrough. Why contain it?			"

												Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you're even slightly interested. Absolutely incredible game. Timeless level design and story,Pros+ Absolutely tons of customization options; with such variety, few people can really boast that they have played the same game twice+ Narrative is both mature and showcases an impressive amount of depth+ Augmentations, also, offer great freedom in character tailoring; some are arguably more useful than others, but overall the sense of freedom inherent in this mechanic does well to complement the same freedom found throughout the rest of the game+ Modular damage; limbs and body parts experience damage separately, and this translates competently to gameplay (eg. taking too much damage in a leg will result in poor movement)+ The player is offered spectacular freedom in how level objectives and advancement are to be handled+ Level design is applaudable; everything flows well from one area to another, and layouts are generally sensible+ Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic; sets the mood, doesn't necessarily distract, and stays with you when the game is off+ Dialogue and writing is absolutely superb; this is easily one of the better aspects of the game, and it presents well even todayCons- Speed/compatibility issue; this may not affect everyone, but there is an issue with compatibility on modern machines which causes overall gamespeed to increase drastically (there is a workaround, but it's something of a hassle to fix)- Visuals and animations really show their age; these don't hold up well today, but it's not bad enough to detract from the overall experience- Voice-acting, though it can be quite good, is a mostly underwhelming effort; some voice actors go as far as to be terrible "

												So Deus Ex.The definitive PC experience. One of few games which wouldn't work on consoles at all.It's a cyber-punk First Person Role Playing Game in which you play as a cybernetically augmented special agent JC Denton on a mission to defeat a terrorist organization, all while a elaborate conspiracy uncovers itself through the course of the game. The game starts with our hero arriving onto the Liberty Island, NYC. There, he has to free a captured agent and take the terrorist leader into custody. It is a simple and fairly easy mission, which really feels like a sandbox, where you can test different equipment, see which elimination method you prefer etc. All the levels are open and free to explore, and the game rewards you with useful items and extra skill points you can use to improve JC if you do so. There are always at least 2 ways to get somewhere, even when NPC's tell you there is only one way. You need to be resourceful, and outsmart your oponents. The game shows a staggering amount of detail, as every little thing you do affects dialog and NPC reactions. Walk into the lady's restroom? Get scolded by your boss for doing so.Don't give a hotel owner in distress a pistol? Well, you better come to him when JoJo shows up or he will die.You can talk to many different NPC's to get intel, which will help you in your mission. What seems like a simple bum, can give you info about a secret passage, giving you a chance to avoid sniper fire. Deus Ex's soundtrack is incredible; It's a perfect exaple of old video game OST's: Powerful, catchy and memorable, the kind you'll want to stand in place and just listen to. A fantastic thing the game did, was remix the game's main theme using church organs in the cathedral level.The game itself tackles serious problems, such as which is better: globalisation or isolation, martial law or complete anarchy. Now, let's get into gameplay. The gunplay is very outdated, it feels fairly sluggish and not rewarding. The stealth system, while not perfect, is enjoyable. The augmentation system enchances the gameplay a lot, by giving you lots of new fun abilities, such as higher jumps, stronger hits, or even a remotely controlled spybot with a EMP attack.Overall, the game is great. The story gets deep, and while outdated, the mechanics are lots of fun. Subjectively, I'd say You should really check it out if you haven't.			"

The cyberpunk/conspiracy story by itself is a narrative masterpiece, so if you haven't played it yet, you ARE a moron.If you choose to rise from the shadow of stupidity, follow the path of enlightenment and install this game, there are great mods around to make it shine even brighter.

												Many old games become relics of bygone ages, yet Deus Ex stands as testament; great games are not forgotten. Depth unparalleled; the sheer amount of player agency, accommodation of a wide variety of playstyles and narrative choices; making for gameplay diversity rarely seen. It has aged most notably with it's outdated control scheme and sometimes moronic AI, yet those fail to detract from the ever enduring legacy of Deus Ex, a title truly worth playing.			"

												Fun Fact: A woman put this game on a chip and implanted i in her skin, that's how much she loved it.Deus Ex, which many of you probably know due to the infamous ""Bomb"" scene, is a true revolutionary by the literal definition. It's a game people seem to respect more than enjoy, but I disagree. It's probably jsut me, but I don't see its age at all, and I still consider to have the best replay value I've ever experienced with a game. Why is that? One simple word, choice. Deus Ex isn't a perfect game. Hell, it has more flaws than I can list, but it does what no other game I've played outside of anything Eidos has made, it gives true free choice, no illusions, no cop-outs, no story routes that converge, true freedom. It counters the world of the game. Deus Ex takes place in a dystopic United States, whose government has seized control of the planet. Paranoia plagues this world after terrorists attacked New York and destroyed the Twin Towers and the Statue of Liberty (This game was made in 2000, what a coincidence) and an anti-terrorist organization named UNATCO polices the world against the terrorist organization, the NSF. You are JC Denton, a cyborg recruit for UNATCO. A plague called the Black Death sweeps the globe, killing off the Proletariat, its cure in the hands of a select few in power. Suspicions are raised, questions are asked, paranoia grows. Is the government sacrificing freedom for safety? Where has this plague come from? What is the true intention of UNATCO? And that's about all I can say without spoiling. The game has enough twists and turns to make even M. Night Shaymalan blush. The game is everything you'd expect from a dystopic sci-fi fiction combined. Everything is thrown into the melting pot of conspiracy: the MIB, Illuminati, the Templars, evil corporations, Area 51, hushed up alien landings, gene-splicing experiments, the debate of man VS cyborg, and self aware AI are all crucial to the plot. The result leaves you as paranoid and confused as any other person living in this time, and the morality of good VS evil become decisively grey. There is unbound choice and freedom in Deus Ex. Being an RPG that just so happens to be in first person, the game doesn't have a black and white good or evil morality system. Instead, the storyline judges you from the sidelines in secret. The choices you make don't really matter (Some are a tad more advantageous) and none prevent you from unlocking a new skill or getting a new ending. There are an infinite ways to solve a scenario. Facing a boss? You can run away! You can knock them out if you wish (it is entirely possible to beat the game without killing anyone if you try hard enough). Need to break into a building? You can kill everyone and walk in, you can crawl through nearby sewers, you can hack the security to turn on the guards or disable it altogether, the list goes on. Deus Ex is also something most modern games struggle to be, it's balanced. Throughout the game you can score new Augmentations, cyborg superpowers. Each Aug is a choice between two different play styles. Do you want the Aug that makes your footsteps silent or do you want the one that makes you run faster and jump higher (Go with the 2nd actually, it is so much more beneficial for creative players)? Being an old RPG shooter, EVERYTHING requires skill points, but unlike System Shock 2 (A very similar game) the game doesn't punish you for investing in other skills (Though if you stupid and just fully max Poison Resistance and Swimming then you're ♥♥♥♥ed) because each scenario can be solved in so many ways and each way rewards a different playstyle. The choices in Deus Ex are some of the hardest I've ever had to make in any game. No, no choice gives you a different gun or anything and they don't affect the game, but there's deep rooted philosophical questions and ideals tied to every choice. The title is derived from ""Deus Ex Machina"", ""God of the Machine"", which means that no matter how hopeless a scenario is, something good will come out of it. That being said, I can not think of a more ironic title for a game as this one. Nothing good comes out of Deus Ex, and each dilemma typically involves judging the fate of mass groups or even few individuals between two evils. Do I allow this terminally ill man suspended in stasis to live with the hope that he can one day recover or do I put him out of his misery? It doesn't affect the game at all, but it's still one of the most haunting decisions I've ever made in a vidya. And that's the genius of Deus Ex, it's a game that sticks. It's story is so massive and so deeply rooted in real life conspiracy and philosophy that it's impossible to decipher in one go. Deus Ex tells a story most films struggle to, it is a sprawling epic that hits hard and never misses. Each little choice feeds into our larger and ever growing fears of our privacy being seized, secret oligarchies, tyranny, anarchy, and forces us ourselves to ask the most important question, ""s there any better alternative in a world as ♥♥♥♥ed as ours?"" The struggle of JC is one I will never forget, and the game itself created the core of modern gaming to say the last. 14 years later and games, and even the creators of the game itself, are still struggling to surpass Deus Ex. It still has the best and most established writing I've encountered in a video game while also allowing for free choice and having the storyline mold around the player. The game's penultimate moment is choosing between three possible endings, and it's still the single hardest decision I've ever encountered in gaming. Each one is dark and depressing but a necessary evil in some eyes and all 3 tie in different philosophical views on humanity and the state of the United States, which become more relevant with each passing day. It is a given that the difficulty curve is beyond ridiculous and it takes a heavy investment to know how to create your own style, but it's well worth it. There's an old saying on ♥♥♥♥♥ and is in fact written in the Rules of the Internet, ""Every time you mention Deus Ex someone will re-instlal it"". But I find this gross, as I can never imagine uninstalling it in the first place. It has been and will probably always be my favourite video game, and what I consider to be among the very top greatest games ever made. I don't rate games but if I had to it'd probably be 9/10, the difficulty curve is Satanic on a first playthrough and the voice acting (Specifically in Hong Kong) at times is hammy at best. But that adds to the charm to me, but I know it isn't universal. Also, the soundtrack is beyond Godly,

												Deus Ex is my favorite video game of all time.You play as JC Denton, a man whose body was augmented with nanomachines. He works for an anti-terrorist organization called UNATCO, and is sent on various missions. However, everything is not as it seems.I don't want to spoil the story, so I'll just leave it at that.The gameplay is brilliant. Typically, there are multiple ways you can go about doing any given task. In the first level alone, you can kill the NSF terrorists, or simply sneak past them. Get the code, disable the security, and go in through the front door, or sneak in through a back entrance. Save Gunther, or skip out on doing so. The first level isn't as good as I'm making it out to be, though - it's honestly one of this game's flaws.Speaking of flaws, the game's AI and graphics haven't held up well since its initial release, and the voice acting is... to say the least, pretty bad. Certain sidequests in the game feel unrewarding (with one of them not even rewarding you properly at all, due to a bug.) The weapons aren't very balanced, with the default pistol, GEP gun, and a certain melee weapon I won't spoil the existence of being incredibly overpowered.The game's narrative and storytelling are both incredible by video game standards. It's full of twists and hidden details (a plot-important NPC makes a brief, difficult-to-spot cameo very early on), a lot can be learned about the game's lore from reading notes lying around, hacking into people's computers and reading their email, and just talking to everyone you see. The game does a good job of building its world through the dialogue of random, otherwise unimportant NPCs. Honestly, I wish modern gaming could do things like this. Even the prequel, Human Revolution, didn't get it quite right - Every single NPC feels the need to talk about current events, augmentation, et cetera, whereas the original tended to focus more on other things.On top of all this, the replay value is absolutely insane! Every time you play through the game, things can go very different from the last. Each time, you'll often find things you didn't know existed in your previous playthrough. There are so many ways to play through it that it's worth it to just try everything at least once!Honestly, this game is one of the few I would give a 10/10 rating to. Everyone needs to play this game at least once.BE WARNED: To play this game on modern systems, you will need to get a patch called Deus Exe. This can be obtained here: http://kentie.net/article/dxguide/ Without it, the game will crash on startup.			"

												Like the reviews and description suggest, perfect mix of combat, stealth, role playing elements, there are TONS of ways to complete missions, plot twists, A LOT of alternate story lines, a lot of fun augmentations, basically you haven't played a good RPG until you've played this, it's actually better than the Elder Scrolls in my opinion. I'd give it a 10/10 and I'll conclude this recommendation on a short tutorial on how to configure this game to run properly on modern systems with Windows 7 or later.

												A game that makes you think outside the box.Deus Ex is just a pleasure to play, never once do you get frustrated at the game, every mistake is your fault. Is it faultless? No, but that doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece. Deus Ex has such a riveting story with so many intriguing characters most notably Morgan Everett and Walton Simons that will keep you engrossed for your entire playthrough. The gameplay is also superb allowing for many different experiences each playthrough as there are so many ways to complete an objective. You can kill, knock out or simply avoid your enemies, the choice is yours. There's also many ways to get to your objective.The graphics are obviously outdated (but it kinda has it's own charm) but with the OpenGL renderer the game still plays like a dream and I was using fairly meh integrated graphics on my Linux PC, I would go against using the DirectX renderer, even on Windows, runs like total balls. The soundtrack is also wonderful and adds even more immersion to the levels, my personal favourite being Enemy Within. The voice acting is awful, but has a charm and I actually like the way it is as opposed to Human Revolution. Just get this game. It's one of, if not the greatest PC games of all time. If you don't like it.... ""What a shame""P.S. I encountered a game breaking glitch where everyone in my save was aggro at me, this could simply be due to using Ubuntu to play this game using Wine, but my advice, save a lot. The glitch set me back 45 mins.			"

Graphics are quite dated, even for its time but it doesn't detract from the game in the slightest.The only drawback is that it is unlikely that there will be another game like this. It is truly unique in its presentation and use of topics such as nationalism, terrorism, corporate greed and conspiracy theories without sounding cliche'.

												Some of my friends would say that writing a review for Deus Ex just seems stupid. People already know how good this game is right? They don’t need me to be badgering them to play it! But the sad truth is that as the younger demographic come onto the scene, this is one of those gems that they are missing. And can we really blame them? Just one look at the screenshot or the gameplay on YouTube is enough to tell you that this is not a pretty looking game! Is it really worth getting in 2015?What Deus Ex provides is a lot of mechanical depth. There is a lot of freedom in the way you approach things: you can be a ruthless murderer, a hacker, a stealthy assassin… it’s entirely up to you how to approach the situations you encounter in the game. Also the mechanics, with the exception of the awful crossbow (don’t try it) don’t feel all that dated. Upgrading your abilities and the various augmentations you can make to yourself is implemented really well to the game, and feels quite modern. What I will warn you about though is that you should not expect to be able to shoot accurately when you start the game. If you don’t put points into pistols then you are going to suck with pistols – it’s annoying but mechanically it makes a lot of sense. After all, in order to shoot accurately you have to be a skilled shot!Unfortunately it does look terrible, which is the point that I’m going to put the challenge on you as the reader to make the decision. This is one of the best PC games of all time, that’s a fact. If it was released nowadays with modern graphics it would be winning awards. So if you think you can cope with the outdated graphics, then I challenge you to play this game. I advise that in the opening section of the game you put those points into pistols and stick to the shadows to begin with. But if you can get through that opening level, then you are in for a treat – because this game is fantastic.Please do feel free to comment if you’ve tried and you get stuck or whatever. Or if you were able to break through the graphics barrier and are enjoying arguably one of the finest narrative experiences ever created. I’d love to hear the feedback. "

												Some words of warning: this game looks and feels its age.  Graphics are really poor by modern standards and even at the time I hated the feel of the modified Unreal v1 Engine that this game uses, so those who put a high premium on look and feel should stay away.If, however, you can tolerate these shortcomings, you should know that everything that made Deus Ex one of the best games of all time is still intact.  This game pioneered open-ended gameplay and still does it better than most modern imitators: the level design and character creation system enable players of every persuasion to meaningfully approach the game with their own style.  For example: some bosses can be insta-killed through dialogue if thorough players found, via hacking, the necessary code words.  You can even kill everyone that the game's plot absolutely cannot do without, and characters will react accordingly.  The plot is rich and the world is immersive, with secrets that cannot be discovered by players of one build or other, creating a sense of credibility - like Dark Souls (my other favourite game ever), Deux Ex doesn't willingly give up all its treasures, but demands to be explored.In summary, this game started a genre, and it's still the paradigm of the action/RPG because it does so many important things so much better than its modern imitators.  If you're a fan of immersive, reactive action/RPGs, you NEED to play Deus Ex.			"

												It feels a bit redundant for me to recommend this game to people, but then again why shouldn't I do it over and over again and again.Do you like FPSes?  Do you like RPGs with character and equipment upgrade systems, as well as pseudo-magic systems?  Do you enjoy multiple game paths?  Conspiracies?  Futuristic settings?  Stealth gameplay?  If you answered yes to any two of those.... Get. This. Game.Deus Ex is a classic, in the sense that it is a huge milestone for PC gaming overall.  It seamlessly blends FPS and RPG elements of the day into a combined experience which resonated so well it became a standard in itself.  Newer games like Borderlands, Fallout 3/New Vegas, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, even Oblivion and Skyrim use much the same formula.  Deus Ex may not be the origin of that formula, but it is definitely one of the better implementations of it.  Dozens of games have tried and failed to recreate that balance of elements... sadly including some of the Deus Ex sequels.What makes this game get such a strong recommendation from me though is the replay value.  Quite simply the game is so densely packed with content and secrets that you can have played the game for literally years and completely miss certain bits of dialog or secrets.  Add to that the alternate playthrough methods opened up by carrying different weaponry, investing in different skills, selecting different augmentations, and its easy to see why the concept of spending years playing this game is not far-fetched at all.  Don't let my apparent play-time fool you; I've had the game since it was originally released, and if Steam counted that play-time it would be in the thousands of hours.In short, if you don't have it already, get this game.  Play it once.  Maybe it play it again.  Then, once you're hooked, get a mod that enhances and/or fixes the game and play it again.  Repeat for the next 1-3 years of your life at a minimum.  The last part is likely not optional once you complete the first two steps.			"

												A really entertaining game.With many possibilities to achieve any objective given to you, to the point that you might still find new ways to play through it after a couple of runs.An engaging story that becomes stronger as you get to know other perspectives, with tons of little details thrown around the world as newspapers, conversations, and e-mails.Clever level design and mechanics that let you choose whichever kind of gameplay you want to go for. Like taking a tactical approach, going like a spy hacking around security and stunning your enemies, or going full commando.And you're not forced into a linear way to complete each level. Most of the time, you're free to complete your objectives in whichever order you want. And once you clear a ""stage"", you keep all of your current items and money for the next one, making the transition between maps very natural.If you can get past the old graphics, you'll find a masterpiece.The only con I can think of is that you might need to download some mods to make it playable in new computers, because it will look DARK in its unaltered state.

												Althought Deus Ex broke ground in its day and is frequently listed on ""top 100"" lists as one of the most influential video games, I find it difficult to recommend today.The freedom to solve puzzles in the manner of your choice is appealing, and rarely has it been implemented so well. Deus Ex is hard, and that's good; it forces you to plan ahead.But the interface is really difficult to use, and the AI is so inconsistent that it breaks game immersion. These were problems when the game was new.Today, the original Deus Ex offers a walk down memory lane for people who played it when it was originally released But for younger gamers who are searching for some PC game history, it's confounding. I would recommend instead another groundbreaking game from the same era and same studio: Thief 1 and 2, which have aged much better.I give a cautious recommendation for Deus Ex, but only for people seeking historical perspective.

Heavy emphasis on stealth (can kill nobody if you want) or you can go in guns blazin, but the aiming system isn't as simple as point and shoot. Accuracy is based on skill level, and... you'll get used to it. If you're open minded and ready to learn a great game, this story and gameplay is second to none.

Music by none other than the composer who already made Unreal a feast for the ears.But rather than go over the good things that already have been stated a thousand times and list them a 1001th time, I find it appropriate to inform about some drawbacks you won't see mentioned nearly as often:Deus Ex is quite a challenge to run on modern PCs, and this is coming from an old Unreal Tournament veteran who knows how to edit every setting of every config file in his sleep.You'll have to spend some time fixing the game before you can even start playing. It suffers from a number of issues, like uncapped framerate which leads to it running too fast, prematurely cancelling ingame cutscenes/dialogue, screen tearing, crackling sound/music and mouse/cursor issues.There are a number of fixes available for some of those problems, some of which work better than others. The best renderer is a newer, fan-made OpenGL renderer, which you'll find on the net and requires the 1112fm update, also available on the net. This OpenGL renderer makes the game look just like it did back then, and has some important features like a framerate cap. I've also tried the often recommended DX10 renderer, and found that it makes rather drastic changes to the way lightning is handled in the game, usually for the worse, so I cannot recommend it.There's a 3rd party launcher for Deus Ex that apparently fixes many issues, but I don't like running additional software so I did most other fixes by manually editing the .ini files. Unfortunately, I have not found a solution for the mouse behaviour, particularly because it's the cursor in the menus rather than the ingame sensitivity that is way too high, with no way to change it. This makes going through the inventory, the logs and everything else you do in the UI a downright painful experience. And you will spend a significant amount of time dealing with the interface.Going through all that trouble is worth is though. When you're done pulling your hair out trying to get Deus Ex to run properly and scavenging the internet for various fixes, you're left with a great game that has a decent amount of replay value.

												Deus Ex is one of the best accidents I have ever tripped over.  I received this title as software bundle when I bought a video card, back in my early days of building rigs.  I had no idea what it was, but my roommate at the time said he had heard good things.  Boy was I in for a treat.Deus Ex is (yep, still is) the pinnacle of you picking whatever way you want to achieve your objective.  On top of that, you get conflicting objectives, forcing you to choose your path; thus shaping the game into one of three outcomes.  Sometimes it’s easy to get lost exploring the alternate routes you didn’t take on the way to an objective; it’s that engrossing.You are given a wide variety of skills, powers (cybernetic augmentations), tools, and weapons to go about your business; more choices to shape your gameplay.  As you play through you’ll get “skill points” (just another unit of RPG exp), and pick up “augmentation canisters” to establish your superhuman abilities.  You can even get upgrade modules for the weapons (silencers, lasers, etc.).To tie it altogether is a polished cyberpunk atmosphere with a well-written narrative.  The graphics limitations of the time are compensated for by legit voice acting, and AI behavior that’s impressive for the time it was released.A testament to this title is how the fan community has produced patches to maximize its performance on modern systems.  It makes playing it all over again that much more fun…over a decade later.  It is far better than its sequel (garbage), and still better than its flashy (but still good) prequel.Now, for the paltry price offered, why on earth would you not pick this up? "

												For the longest time of owning this game on Steam (When I have literally owned a disc version since it came out over a decade ago), I have been trying to work up the courage to write a review on this game. I don't feel worthy, plainly put. This game is my all-time favorite game. It has everything; from game-changing augmentations to a branched storyline that changes as you make altering decisions. I just recorded a walkthrough of this game and posted it to YouTube, and it was such a fun ride! The nostalgia was so pleasing. I have beaten this game countless times. Really, I don't even want to try to count. I LOVE this game, GET this game, you WON'T regret it!!!P.S. About the multiplayer game not working, the original master server was shut down.

												While the graphics look outdated and the voice acting is atrocious Deus Ex remains today as on of the best FPS/RPGs of all time. Memorable characters, an intriguing story, a fantastic soundtrack and a dark cyberpunk atmosphere reminiscent of Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. A huge amount of situational freedom gives it a much replay value.Reccomended to anyone who wants a great plot and countless alternate solutions to every problem.			"

												After almost 5 months of crawling through dark sewers, rummaging through the pockets of dead men, not cleaning my house and being late for work on several occasions, I completed the epic adventure and moral journey that is... Deus Ex. Even though it was released way back in 2000, and had never been considered pretty, I'd found that most well honed gamers still revered Deus Ex as a quintessential, almost religious-like, gaming experience... something I'd never experienced before (in anything.)So, sometime around the beginning of the year, I crawled into the skin of one J.C.Denton, spy guy.Deus Ex wasn't a difficult game for me (especially set on 'easy'), but it was challenging.  To spill blood or not to spill blood? (I'm a natural born spiller.) Should I  help the crazy lady find her cat? (I didn't.) Am I to go east or west? (I usually just turned left.) Will these decisions make a difference, somehow? *shrug*Deus Ex  was a game of Nerves and Patience and Decisions... and bullets.But, especially, Decisions.. which, by game's end, had become pretty monumental. Yeah, I really can't say that I had heaps-o'-fun playing Deus Ex. Sometimes it felt long and grueling. Or dark and oppressing.But, then, that's how it is, when something is intelligent and thought provoking.  And that's why I kept playing, because.. well, it was the object of the game.  I felt that, if I could make it to the end, I might, somehow, come out better than when I started.And, I think I did.			"

												We all know the cliche's: cyberpunk, dystopian future, with a morally grey protagonist who ends up entangled in something far bigger than himself. Hell, what am I talking about? We LOVE these damn cliche's!Deus Ex manages to deliver everything we love about the ol' William Gibson novels (which are turning out to be rather prophetic these days), while offering a pretty wide variety of CHOICE. What sorts of choices? From augments to multiple ways of handling situations. Wanna run-n-gun it? Do you. Wanna go Solid Snakin' it? Slither, homey. Wanna be diplomatic? Everyone needs friends. Just be sure to equip the augments that play nice with said play style.Graphically, Deus Ex uses the ol' Unreal Engine. So don't expect face melting graphics. However, for retro gamers like myself, these ""old"" graphics lend to the atmosphere in Deus EX: a time when cyberpunk was more escapist and less like what we all now live.In terms of difficulty, Deus Ex can be punishing. Particularly if you choose augments that don't work well with your tactics. At its time of release, this mechanic was still very experimental in gaming. Deus Ex definitely plays best on a second or third (or fourth or fifth) play-through.			"

Every level can be approached via multiple means, and it's entirely possible to make your way through the entire game without using combat at all - tailor the game to your style of play, and it will work with you.Modern games can only aspire to accomplish what this game did over a decade ago.

												A game that holds up well over time - Deus Ex is a first person RPG/action hybrid that tells an engaging story about conspiracy and world domination in the future. For its age, the voices, music, and environments are quite good. All of the levels are thoughtfully designed, with freedom to allow the player to consider multiple ways to complete them, and it provides direction without the hand-holding found in some more modern games.Its only major flaw is graphics, which weren't particularly impressive even when the game was new. There are user-created mods that can significantly improve this, but it is still within the limitations of the engine. If you are able to ignore the outdated graphics, this game will leave a lasting positive impression on you.Also on Steam is the Deus Ex: Revision mod, which adds and alters many of the existing areas and is fun to play if you've already experienced the original.

												This game is considered a classic.  And it's not hard to see why.  Though it was not the first game to try to combine first person shooters with an RPG style of game, it blended the genres together very well.  There are multiple paths to approach each problem, and sometimes your choices have an effect on the game.The game is not without flaws.  There are some very over-powered items in the game that can let you get through it without spending any points in your combat skills.  For all the branching paths the individual levels of the story may take, you're still ultimately shunted down the same end goal.  The AI is not particularly observant at times, and even coming across bodies of other dead guards they will not react (made even more noticable in that you can pick up and movie bodies, but there's no reason to.)Despite these flaws, the story is entertaining, the combat fairly effective and there's frequently ways to avoid it altogether if that's your thing.  Blending RPG elements into FPS games is commonplace now, but this was the game that truly cemented that revolution (along with other classics like System Shock 2).			"

												If you can get past the bad graphics and clunky combat you will find one of the most unique and enjoyable gameplay experiences. I played this game in 2015 and still found it to be extremely compelling. The level design is excellent. There is true freedom of choice that effects the story. Side characters and side missions are extremely enjoyable. The design of this game is nothing short of incredible. The story is very enjoyable and even though the game is so old i found my self on the edge of my seat to see what the next twist is. The world is so immersive and well developed and I really feel you would be doing yourslef a disservice by passing this one up. The game is also pretty cheep for the amount of content. Doing only one story route the game is going to last around 20 hours and this game is not very expensive. There is also a mod that improves some of graphic assets if the bad graphics really bother you. Finally not to be forgotten this game has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard period. The soundtrack is really amazing and even if you do not play the game go listen to it on youtube it's awesome. Seriouls this game is a classic and should be played by all fans of rpgs and shooters.

You uncover conspiracy theories and many other ideals from all over the world and travel to uncover the truth.

You hear his incredibly inaccurate thick German accent as he complains about a conspiracy by the custodial staff to replace all the soda in the vending machines with Orange flavor instead of Lemon-Lime?Well you see, he actually thematically represents the possible future plight of being left behind by the world due to physical augmentations becoming rapidly obsolete as new technology replaces it, and you not being upgraded due to the cost and lack of empathy from your superiors. This shatters your self-confidence and renders you irrelevant within society, furthering your frustration and anger that culminates in a hatred for the protagonist whose augmentations far surpass your own. This hate is unleased in the brutal execution of your employer's enemies and finally comes to a head once your unfeeling superiors send you to kill the rogue agent protagonist, fighting more for your own vitriolic feelings rather than for the puppetmasters that care not if you are melted down for scrap like a broken, inoperable machine.So that's something			"

												""Why contain it?'s cool.""-- VoltaireOne might argue what really makes a great game. Game mechanics, plot, characters, visuals, level designs, good marketing move to release at certain time or other nerd stuff. So why's everyone keep telling that a game with broken mechanics, outdated graphics, nonexistent ai and muhconspiracyfoilhats plot is one the best games ever made?It's always delivery. Deus Ex setups setting and drag you in from the first minutes, every time you play you will find something new: new newspaper article you didn't read, new way into some important building,  another chat from hobos about area 51 and stuff like this. Every level in this game is made for exploring. First time i played (2012, so no nostalgia tripping here) i didn't even know there's sidequests in this game. ""Kill a prisoner against my orders!""-- Joseph StalinWide variety of weapons with most of them being useless until you max out weapon mastery like it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Morrowind, one-shotting soldiers and randomly running enemies probably make it a bad FPS. But every time you find new weapon mod in some dumpster you're overjoyed like a boy who sees ♥♥♥♥ for the first time. Halfway in the game you're just noscoping with sniper rifle and stabbing people with jedi nano-sword and you're unable to notice any flaw, since plot has no brakes whatsoever and you jump around the globe engaging in terrorism and other pleasant activities.""I am the bartender... I am your man.""--BartenderBunch of ABSOLUTELY useless skills and augs that are in no circumstances would help you WHATSOEVER, non-existent economy and dialogue decisions once in forever would probably make it a bad RPG. However, with a way that characters react to your decisions and even playstyle,JC's killer quotes and a lot of really interesting stuff you will argue with absolutely random people (this barmen in triad club talking about how chinese dictatorship is far superior to corrupted Burgerland capitalism. I don't even want to mention this cool AI dude in some room in Illuminati hideout) along with sometimes pretty non-linear ways to handle stuff (Only time when game-designers will not let you do whatever you want and force you to bend to the plot by throwing at you invincible enemy and a bunch of invisible walls can be noticed only by true MLG autists like me) will make you forget this too. Not to mention that main character is collest and dangerousestest ♥♥♥♥♥ in da hood (major fault of deus ex 2 was a bunch of tumblr-like characters, even JC will talk some boring quotes of old farts like nobody's business).""I think the black people didn't show up for work at all...suspicous...""-- George WashingtonAnd atmosphere! It really feels like you're secret agent on the run in decaying near future society: uncovering conspiracies, killing corrupt officials, engaging in corporate espionage, lethally throwing soy food at soldiers, blocking enemies with cardboard boxes, using explosives to climb walls and healing yourself by jerking off a water cooler for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minute. While majority of good old games is rendered barely playable by time because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interface, already fixed in remakes/sequels ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, applied wizard science to launch them or what not, deus ex instead of being a barely moving old fart is a motherflipping MC Vspyshkin: game is unarguably pretty old, but is still fun and kicking butt. Once you played it one time you will reinstall every time you hear The Synapse on the internet.And with all this replay value, there's also mods and multiplayer.Considering all that, i can only give this game 100 rusty skull-guns out of 100 and encourage you to play it as fast as possible in case you haven't.""my 3 daughters turned up dead, heres your op bonus 1000 credits"" -- Manderley			"

YouTube™ Video: Deus Ex: Does It Still Hold Up? 

			Views: 398		

			We take a look at the original Deus Ex to see if it still holds up today. Check out DAKNAP's video here: http://bit.ly/1peQM4g		

After almost 15 years, the legacy of this game still live strong, there are many games that follow the step of the original Deus Ex like a whole feature, games like Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Dishonored and also the new sequels Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, but...Does this game still hold up? Getting over the ugly graphics by today standards, bad voice acting, not so good stealth, RPG and Shooting gameplay, this one still a badass game.Why?The level desing is so superb that even today I still find new ways to finish a level, it serve all the short coming that the mechanics have, is so open that you can roleplay in this game, is so complex that can feel like a good level from a 90´s FPS and you can beat those levels without killing anyone.The Story is complex and a fun ride, if you are a sucker for Cyberpunk fiction this is one of the best tales of the genre, it goes over the cheesy dialogue and the sometimes hilarious execution, to deliver a fun tale, fun in a Cyberpunk 2020 RPG Module.The Music and the art direction, make me forget about the ugly graphics, to the point that sometimes I get so inmerse that I can stop playin until I find a to rest (in game), the levels seems so livable (I don´t know if that a word) that I sometimes seem myself care about the nameless soldiers and goons, I feel bad for them. In the end, the awnser is yes, even in 2015 there are no game that match this one in my opinion, there are many that came close, but at this time, this one still the second coming of Christ. ALL HAIL J.C DENTON.			"

												In Deus Ex, you play as kleptomaniac supercop JC Denton, whose newest line of bodily augmentations allows him to be superhuman while suffering minimal disfigurement, with the unfortunate side effect of being unable to change his facial expression. In this deeply personal narrative, you will help JC Denton struggle to control his constant food binging as well as his chronic alcohol addiction. In the midst of his stuffed and drunken stupor, he must struggle to avoid crushing dearly beloved pet cats and dogs with his uncontrollably lethal feet, as well as fight a global conspiracy.A plague has beset the global population, and in a future in which Obamacare has never been repealed, health care in America is as terrible as it ever was. In New York, the native population of bums and hipsters struggle to get their treatment (hard to distinguish). Terrorists blow up the statue of liberty, and in a stunningly subtle act of symbolism, the UN sets up a global police agency right over the ruined remains of the symbol of freedom.  As a member of the global police force with the worst police brutality managment known to all mankind, you have been tasked with harassing tea partiers who mistakenly believe that the Constitution is a document which is still obeyed. As you responsibly taser/beat/shoot/blow up in mutual understanding with the community you protect and serve, you uncover a conspiracy to undermind the governments of the world.JC realizes that a global agency is behind the creation of the plague, in a conspiracy to  cull the population of South America  sow disorder in governments across the world so that they may take over. Not an organization to be outdone, they have shown an impressive resume in various feats such as spending billions in research to manufacture laser swords and bringing dinosaurs back to life. Never let it be said that capitalism is not a pragmatic and beneficial economic system.In a globe trotting chase for the ultimate 3D printer, JC and friends realize that the global organization has taken the internet hostage at Area 51 in cooperation with the ayy lmaos and Seth Rogen. JC goes to Area 51 to save his waifu from being compromised, but then he learns that the ayy lmaos are actually just monkeys, which is something no one really doubted about Seth Rogen.In this game where every choice matters, you must choose to save the internet or release the virgins from their prison.9.5/10 It's OK -IGN			"

												There is no designated order of things to do, whichever direction you take is always the right one! Game is built around exploration but the punishing combat mechanics will see you mashing that quicksave key or lose precious progress to a two second firefight that didn't go in your favor. (Bots that aren't using sniper rifles shouldn't be able to instant kill headshot you.) They coupled together a magnificent soundtrack with the most hilarious (so bad it's good) voice acting I've heard in quite awhile. Ye olde countable polygons and short drawdistances (complete with fog) reminiscent to the N64 and playstation radiate an unsettling vibe similar to the first couple Tomb Raider games. Despite an emphasis on multiple interlocking branching paths in each map, thirty hours is quite awhile for the mechanics to start feeling formulaic. It boils down to finding the keys/login information/rockets/lockpicks/hack tools you'll need to open the next door and then pulling up the item or information and punching it in. Augmentations should have been passive and not reliant on yet ANOTHER finite bar of constnatly depleting energy. If you're going to make your game dark as all hell (as opposed to orange) the flashlight shoudln't sap your energy leaving you potentially irrevocably blind. The cache of items you can hold is unforgivably small and the firearms are HORRENDOUSLY IMABLANCED. I put every upgrade onto the assault rifle and it still couldn't carry its own weight. You only need the pistol, crossbow, dragontooth, stun baton, and of course the gep gun. A masterpiece in it's own time. Also there's an irritating bug that crashes the game about two thirds of the way in on the frigate escape.			"

												Deus ex es el juego que todo aficionado a los videojuegos  debe jugar. Una obra maestra del pasado que nadie a conseguido igualar y que aún con el tiempo que tiene sigue siendo uno de los mejores, sino el mejor juego hasta ahora. Y no me refiero a gráficos, ya que los juegos actuales lo adelantan, me refiero a jugabilidad, me refiero a libertad de elección, historia, ambientación en un mundo en el que puedes optar por jugar de la manera que tu quieras sin tener ceñirte a un camino establecido, un juego en que según como juegues tu partida puede ser totalmente diferente, y esta vez si, sin subterfugios raros ni luces de colores.  Sin lugar a dudas, un juego único.			"

												What can I say about this game that thousands haven't already said? It's ahead of its time, hell, even today's time in some aspects. It is mind-blowingly open ended, every problem has at least four possible solutions. The game, however, is very dated in some parts, but it is very easily overlooked once you get into it. I am playing this game on a 2012 Toshiba laptop, which means that it'll pretty much run on anything. Again, buy this game, $7 is an insultingly low price for this masterpiece.			"

												This game is one of my all-time favorites.It's a mix between FPS, stealth and small RPG-elements in it. You can upgrade some skills and  also choose from different implants, which will help you see through walls, jump higher, be stronger etc.It is set in a dark, cyberpunk-themed world, where mechanical augmentations are quite common.I don't want to spoil to much of the story, just summarized shortly, as the story is one of it's big strenghts:You are working as Agent JC Denton for UNATCO, an anti-terror force, which is operating worldwide, especially against the NSF, a terror group. At the beginning you are doing some missions against the NSF, which has stolen a  vaccine against the so called ""grey death"", a virus which infects lots of people.As the story progresses, you are dragged deeper into the mysteries and conspiracies of this world. What is this Virus? Who is Majestic 12? What is Echelon?I highly recommend this game to all of you (if you don't mind a bit outdated graphics), it's worth every cent imho :)I still get goosebumps when listening to the intro-music in the menu!! ^^			"

												A milestone in the history of games. The first game which came to my mind instantly when I wanted to nominee one game for the Steam Awards in the ""Test of Time"" category. It's now almost 17 years after it's initial release and it's still one of the best games ever made. If you have only the slightest interest in rpgs, shooter, stealth or narrative driven games then you have to play this game.Maybe the only game in which I've found countless new possibilites, secrets, dialogues or level areas even after I've played it now more than a dozen times from beginning to end. The amount of freedom you have as a player is monumental, you can be  very creative in how you want to play all the brilliantly designed levels, Gameplay mechanics, narrative and sound design are also extremly well made. I also suggest that you play this game vanilla at least once or twice before you alter the experience with some (well made) mods out there.			"

												Deus Ex's bland graphics, questionable AI and somewhat clumsy gameplay can't hide its age, but its unique mix of first-person action, puzzle and RPG elements with a bold, groundbreaking focus on story and characters changed the landscape, and would signifcantly influence developers for the decade to come, demonstrating that a game can share qualities of film or literature and still be successfull. It's exploration of human nature is still valid now, more than a decade later. If only Ion Storm had replayed this game before making Invisible War... If you're not a graphics aficionado, and don't require the latest in tessellation, filtering, or ambient occlusion to have an engaging experience, Deus Ex may be worth your time. If you don't know what any of those are, this is even more likely the case. Being a prequel with some of the same characters, Human Revolution also draws many call-backs (or ""forwards"") to this game.			"

 A measly review wouldn't do this game justice. I've had this game outside of Steam for quite a while now:For years, games come out one after another in a specific genre with the sole intention of being better than the last in many fields, or being unique in a multitude of ways. The genre of ""RPG"" or ""shooter"" is one that is often explored to the very end of it's capabilities - the introduction of new technology in games like Fallout 4 and The Witcher 3 are games that were and are very easily promised Game of the Year time and time again. But through the embers of blazing releases and trailers, there is a game that pioneered a variety of things in undue time.And a measly review wouldn't do it justice.Deus Ex is most likely one of the best games I've ever played. It's old, unoptimized, and sluggish nature is something I can very easily ignore and regard as setbacks of the age it was released in. Though it's time deteoriorated the mechanics and features, it also gave it an advantage - it shook the medium, and the seismic shock can still be felt to this day. The story is something that draws you in and immerses you into a world of conspiracy. The music is a lovely additive, and you can feel every synth, piano key, and guitar riff even for the time it was composed. The set pieces are convincing, well-made, and lovingly crafted with attention given all the way down to the back bowels of a New York City borough. Deus Ex is a marvel of engineering for the year 1999, and it's accomplishments can be appreciated in the present time.Buy this game and play it through if you haven't already. DO IT. "

												It's not easy to review Deus Ex. So much can be said about it, but then, so much already has. There is a good chance you have already played and completed it - but if not, allow me to suggest why you should. Deus Ex is an FPS/RPG sci-fi masterpiece, packed with action, stealth, conspiracies and philosophy. You will often find it referred to as 'greatest game ever' or at least in many people's Top 10 list, and you might wonder what the appeal is. Even fans can agree that it’s not the best looking game out there. The enemy AI isn't great and the voice acting... well, the less said, the better. These flaws aren’t very subtle either, they are quite blatant - so if the game has these problems, how can so many people find it so amazing? What defines a great game is not an absence of flaws, but an experience so rich and rewarding that any flaws - no matter how obvious - are happily ignored because they do not detract from the game overall.Nevertheless - do people claim Deus Ex is great just because of nostalgia goggles? Yes and no. Deus Ex pioneered a number of things that have become standard practice since, and so someone coming to it completely fresh won't find it as innovative as someone who played it when it was first released. Despite that, it still shines when it comes the most important part of the game - the story. If you are the sort of gamer who cares more about the polygon count, or skip through all the text so you can get back to the shooting, this might not be the game for you. For everyone else, prepare for a wonderfully rich and detailed world with secrets around every corner. Prepare for characters that will assist you with vital information, only to find out later that they were lying through their teeth to manipulate you into furthering their own plans. Prepare for hidden agendas, dangerous enemies, international conspiracies and difficult choices.Deus Ex is designed so well that despite being very linear, if feels like an open world game. Every level has different methods of approach that can completely change your game experience. Most importantly - your actions have consequences. It's not usually as blatant as 'go this way to save this character or this way to save this character' but far more subtle, with different ideas and philosophies introduced to you for you to decide which one you think should be the right choice.It's my favourite game. Many others say the same. This review, as well as all others, is attempting to put into words something better left unsaid - something far better experienced. It's Deus Ex. What more can you say?

												Deus Ex is set in a dystopian middle of the 21st century, filled with religious extremists and powerful organizations, and stricken by a devastating new plague. The main character is JC Denton, a nano-augmented agent working for an international counter-terrorist organization. But as the plot unfolds, we realize that the situation is much more complex that what we expected.Released around the year 2000, Deus Ex provides outdated graphics and sound effects (even for its time, it was not the state-of-the-art). The musics are simple, and the AI is not very clever. Yet, the game has two major qualities.First, its complex and deep storyline. Various organisations are involved (terrorists, Illuminatis, Chinese triads, corrupt military forces, rogue artificial intelligence, political plotters, etc.) and all are related to each others. So, many 	unforeseen developments will occur, JC Denton will have to find out everyone's true motives, and where to put his trust. All of this allows for an extremely long single-player campaign, with many different levels and chapters. And if that was not enough, the game is full of philosophical and political cyberpunk-themed reflections (freedom of the people vs efficency of the state, the foreseen dependance of our modern society on connectivity...).Then, its extremely well designed gameplay. Deux Ex is a mix of RPG and FPS. The RPG part provides secondary quests, hidden objectives, useful and talkative NPCs, and choices to make that will influence the storyline (several endings are possible). There is also a system of skills and nano-augmentations, that you will have to manage in order to build up your character the way you want. This strongly influences the FPS part, which can be either infiltration or action-oriented, depending on how you upgraded JC Denton, or managed your items inventory. There are also many ways to complete the game, as Deux Ex will almost always provides several solutions to solve an issue.Thus, Deux Ex is a very intelligent game, with a great plot and a very interesting gameplay. It's not surprising some call it a masterpiece, and if you've never tried it before, you should.			"

												Its storyline is gripping, the environment rich, a lot of people to talk to, many sidequests to solve.You can choose how to complete a level (melée, infiltration, sniping etc.) and combine all of those.The development of Your capabities is three-fold: You can level up Your skills, aquire augmentations (special powers) and get weapon modifications - some of these You can combine to some degree (e.g. You can get temporary weapon skill increase by using an aug instead of increasing the weapon skill), so combining them intelligently definitely will give You an edge on the field.The setting itself is futuristic cyberpunk world, full of conspiracies, where the protagonist have to try his best to staly alive and further the agenda of one group or another - because in Deus Ex Your choices have consequences, and these may not be readily apparent.A 1000 Kudos to the creators, May Your BioEnergy Never Deplete!

												If you are a fan of RPG, FPS, or stealth games you NEED to play this. Deus Ex is up there with Bethesda's games in terms of sheer freedom of play. Wanna be stealthy? Go for it. Wanna go balls to the wall guns blazing? No problemo. There's also hacking, lock picking, nano augmentation, hiding bodies, dialog options, multiple endings, you name it. This game was stupidly ahead of its time. Even the story is eerily conspiratorial and prophetic. A dystopian cyberpunk future where global governments use surveillance and engineered pandemics as population control. Did I mention the game predicted the destruction of the WTC at the hands of a terrorist organization? in the year 2000. Now with that being said, this is an old ♥♥♥ game with wonky shooting and dated graphics. Essential mods you will need to maximize your enjoyment of this undisputed classic include - BioMod, HDTP, and the New Vision Mod.			"

												Deus Ex, despite being released in the summer of 2000, is still one of the greatest role-playing shooter hybrids available on PC. If you're a fan of futuristic settings or the cyberpunk science fiction genre as I am, Deus Ex's storyline and environments should be right up your alley.Set in 2052, you take on the role of JC Denton (JC supposedly refers to Jesus Christ) a rookie to an anti-terrorist organization called UNATCO. But things quickly get out of control and you are soon involved in a huge conspiracy involving various factions - including the Illuminati and the Hong Kong Triads, as you travel over the world to unravel this conspiracy.The game allows a great deal of freedom and various choices - you will also have a few multiple endings to achieve. Deus Ex is a branching game, meaning there are always multiple paths to choose from, you could even choose to not kill anyone at all through the entire game - which is a lot more complicated to do than it sounds, trust me!

												There's not much I can say in my review that hasn't been said in the other positive reviews on here. Deus Ex is a first person shooter/RPG hybrid, regarded by many as the best game ever made. Is it? In my opinion, no, but it is still a great game. If you've played System Shock or Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, you should feel right at home here.Let's get a few of the 'bad' things out of the way first, the things I've seen a lot of people ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about on here and on Metacritic. First off, yes the game is ugly. Look at the screenshots before you buy it. If you don't like how it looks, then don't buy it, simple. The graphics are bad, the character models are fairly wooden, and the voice acting is so bad it's good. Oh, and the default key bindings are pretty bad. But you know what? You can re-map the keys. So it's really a non-issue.Onto the good stuff. This game focuses a lot on inventory management. It's like an old RE title, or Diablo II, where you have only so much room in your inventory for items. So you'll constantly be wondering if it's worth it to carry around the huge flamethrower or keep a couple of pistols and a sword; personally I find this a great change in pace from some games that just let you carry around everything. The sheer level of character customization is crazy. You get skill points, but only at certain points; you gain nothing from defeating enemies, unlocking doors, etcetera. When you find a secret room or explore a certain area, you get skill points, and you get them from completing objectives. Then its up to you where to put them. Pistols, rifles, melee combat, explosives, pickings locks, swimming, healing, and more. You can't master them all (withoug exploting a bug late game) so you have to manage the skill points wisely. On top of that, you can find countless modifications for your guns, among them recoil, reload speed, range, scopes, and laser sights. Oh, and and on top of that, you have several slots for augmentations to your body to give you healing power, quicker speed, strength, defense, and more. But you only have so many slots, and the augmentation items you find carry two for one slot. So do you take health regeneration, or an energy shield? There are so many ways to customize the character to your playstyle it is really astounding.The levels themselves a huge and allow for a variety of routes. In the first mission, I was looking for the person I needed to speak to for my objective; he was to allow me to get into the building where my foes were. Instead I found a big stack of boxes and jumped up on them until I got to the roof, totally bypassing that part of the mission. Later on, if you're careful and look everywhere and make the right decisions, you can even find information to skip entire boss fights. The story can be a bit on the confusing side, but it's well written and takes into account a lot of different conspiracy theories from the real world. I can't say to much without spoiling it so I'll leave it to you to figure it out. So should you get this game? Yes, absolutely. For $6.99, it's practically stealing.			"

												One of my favorite games on my list, Deus ex is a game like no other. It introduces unique storyline and an rpg-esque  feeling to it. A great thing about this game is that you can choose how you want to play. Like for example, you can play the game non-letal or lethal. And your choices you make in the game will change how parts of the game happen or what will happen. Also you know its a good game if you want to replay right after beating it ;)			"

												One of the best games you will ever play.  If you want a surprisingly believable story involving government and global conspiracies with a multitude of characters & a wide variety of skills to upgrade, buy this, you will not be let down.  The soundtrack  is phenomenal, the music matches exactly what the level and setting feels like.  There are lots of skills in which you can put skill points into to make yourself a deadlier close range fighter, a pinpoint sniper, a more proficient hacker, and more.  The augmentations are awesome, you can give yourself the ability to cloak, to see through walls, to run as quiet as amouse, and much more.  There's an abundance of weapons which you can upgrade to give it a laser, a scope, make it more accurate, and more.  There's really just more of everything.  You get to go to Hong Kong, Paris, and even Area 51, the places are very memorable, with the amazing soundtrack to accompany them.  One thing that people would argue as being a flaw of this game, is the voice acting, and while I do agree it's mediocre, it's that voice acting that gives the game even more charm to it.  Fighting with enemies isn't really that much fun though, it's a standard 'click until dead' combat system.  + Believable and gripping story with lots of twists+ Best video game soundtrack ever+ Many skills and augmentations+ Many weapons with modifications to boot+ Memorable levels and great level design+/- Mediocre voice acting- Battles could be done much betterWithout a doubt, the best single player game ever made.

This game is about choice, you can specialize in different skills, weapons, stats etc and almost every level gives you a ton of different ways to solve a particular problem. It's got a twisty, turny and occasionally humorous plot steeped in conspiracy and music by Alexander Brandon, who brings suitably demosceney sounds that fit perfectly with the game's gritty, futuristic aesthetic.

												Despite the dated graphics and often poor VA, Deus Ex rules supreme for its combination of excellent storytelling and great (though at times borked) gameplay.

So good I rebought it upon its steam release.We are the invisible hand. We are the Illuminati. We came before and after. We are forever. And eventually... eventually, we will lead them into the day.

												Deus Ex is simply one of the TOP 3 FPS of all time, the others being Half-Life and DOOM.The reason for such high standard is not the graphics quality, or sound effects or the RPG elements of the game, but the story. This game has a unique story in the game industry.  It makes the gamer keep playing just to see how the story will unveil. It is also possible to reach the goals by various ways, not just the standard go forward and shoot approach. You can approach a goal by sneaking, by finding different paths, or by shooting everything on sight. The last option usually does not work.There are a few places where you can make a choice that changes the story a bit, and that makes the replayability of the game amazing.It is a great game to be replayed every year!

												Dues Ex is my favourite video game of all time, there I said it. Even better than Final Fantasy VII, better than Tomb Raider, better than Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike and Command and Conquer. It's like totally awesome.So how what exactly is so awesome about Dues Ex? Well everything (apart from maybe the graphics).The Story is truly excellent, an exciting and compelling cyber punk narrative about huge companies conspiring to maximise profits at the expense of peoples lives (sounds far fetched I know)....what's truly great is the game gives you scope as a player to make meaningful choices that affect the story in large, sweeping ways. OK, that's just not true, though the choices in the game feel really significant and weighty, they don't have a large impact on the story itself (for example one choice is the decision between killing an important character in different ways, but ultimately she's toast) but the fact these choices exist was at the time groundbreaking and led to a real sense of investment in the world.The gameplay is satisfyingly emergent, you have the choice to approach different scenarios like Snowden (by hacking), Clinton (being duplicitious) or Putin (by using overwhelming force) or some combination of the three. This ties into the character you have designed in a very natural way (so you can choose to make a cyber specialist if you love the Matrix, a character who can sneak around like Corvo in Dishonoured or, if your big and stupid like me, just tote a huge rocket launcher around blowing everything to smithereens). This leads to a real sense of creativity and fun as well as giving the game tonnes of replayability as it feels deeply cool to solve the same problem in multiple ways.The writing of the game is intelligent, and uses sweet science fiction technology like super powerful AI's and cloning to ask questions concering the nature of humanity and consciousness, the trade off between security and liberty (still very relevant in the digital age) and to what extent (if any) we should avoid using lethal force in the fight against ""terrorists"" (an argument which came up recently in UK politics thanks to Corbyn). There's some scenes in the game where JC (the protaganist / antihero) will simply debate concepts like nationalism versus individualism or the tendency of power to corrupt (as in Cicero's famous dictum) and his opponents will present compelling counterarguments of their own (and awesome lines like ""God was the dream of good government""). The nuanced, slightly ambigous, ""grey"" tones of these discourses matches the grim cyperpunk pallette of the landscape without descending into nihilism or a feeling of futlity.The game even manages to work as a power trip in certain moments as JC can turn invisible, set huge ED 209-esque robots against one another and (with the help of an overpowered augment) regenerate his health like you were playing call of duty. Yet at the same time the game (despite what some will tell you) clearly does not want you to play the game like a mindless shooter, on the hardest difficulty setting the easiest, most cannon-fodderry baddies can kill you with one shot to the noggin and cute Sir Killalot robots will shred you in seconds. The game isn't perfect, as stated the graphics are average, the game arguably gets easier as you get through it and the choices are largely illusory. Yet it's clever and engaging, memorable and  fresh.			"

												Rating? 10/10 Why? This is quite possibly the best First-Person Shooter of all time. Brilliant storyline, brilliant gameplay, brilliant sound and music, brilliant everything. It's just that good. While the graphics are certainly dated by today's standards, the game still holds up VERY well in its mechanics. Sneak, hack, shoot, lockpick, blow up, how you approach the situation is entirely your choice. A detailed health system tracks how much damage is done to each limb, and it makes the game very challenging. The game features an RPG-like leveling system. Aside from various skills needed to progress, players also get the choice to implant ""augmentations"" in their character, giving the player special abilites that they can use to approach any situation. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests you can do to make the way ahead much easier. The only thing I think is a negative is that the endings are very short. Still, the game is well worth it. Highly recommended.			"

												There are tons of options for how to play this game. Each level has different threads to follow, and is playable in different ways. For example, you can choose to pursue methods of stealth or use brute force. Your behavior is noted by other characters and changes how you interact with them. Sometimes your actions affect their fates as well. But unlike other games of this vein, it's hard to tell, even after consequences have occurred, which choice was the ""morally right"" choice. You just make a choice and have to live with it, and follow through until the end of the game. You'll be asking yourself what the designers made to be the ""right"" and ""wrong"" choice, but in the end you have to choose who you want to be and act accordingly. In that way, Deus Ex is more true to life than many other games. Aside from that, it's just a lot of fun. It's a classic for a reason-- I most definitely recommend it!			"

												Deus Ex, despite being released in the summer of 2000, is still one of the greatest role-playing shooter hybrids available on PC. If you're a fan of futuristic settings or the cyberpunk science fiction genre as I am, Deus Ex's storyline and environments should be right up your alley.Set in 2052, you take on the role of JC Denton (JC supposedly refers to Jesus Christ) a rookie to an anti-terrorist organization called UNATCO. But things quickly get out of control and you are soon involved in a huge conspiracy involving various factions - including the Illuminati and the Hong Kong Triads, as you travel over the world to unravel this conspiracy.The game allows a great deal of freedom and various choices - you will also have a few multiple endings to achieve. Deus Ex is a branching game, meaning there are always multiple paths to choose from, you could even choose to not kill anyone at all through the entire game - which is a lot more complicated to do than it sounds, trust me!

												There's a lot that's been said about Warren Spector's brainchild, that over-achieving cousin of Daikatana. What I'll say is this: it's dated, a bit janky with some bad (if heartfelt) voice acting and graphics that aren't exactly eye-pleasing.Yet...the very fact that all of those things are seen as lovable quirks by its fans are a testament to everything else Deus Ex did right, all the way back in 2000.And, as it turns out, there is such a thing as a free (graphical) lunch. The Deus Ex: Revision mod is a total aesthetic overhaul of the original game (including music) made over a period of 7+ years by dedicated fans. It's almost comparable to Black Mesa, except the Revision crew largely left the gameplay alone. The purists in the fan community still don't like it, of course, but they're friggin' nerds anyway.Suffice to say even without Revision, Deus Ex is a timeless classic and formed one of the cornerstones of video gaming's adolescent period; not to mention it's just a good stealth FPS/RPG in general for its age. The gameplay by itself could be partially considered a product of its time - the combat while satisfying enough for me is clunky like Bethesda's Fallout model, some of the augmentations are mostly useless and the aug activation buttons take up your entire F-key row. The presence of lean keys and an interactive item toolbar are welcome, at least.If you're not familiar with FPSes and can't manage to get a grip on the (reconfigurable) controls, you will have a hard time more often than not. Actual progression takes long enough that many people who play and replay the game, even veterans, stop after the first couple levels; it doesn't help that some of the lategame levels can be a slog at times. It's comparable to Half-Life 2 in this regard.Those are, however, the only criticisms I can think of. While I'd say there's too much that's been stuffed in to really call it elegant, when the good stuff clicks? It's really good. There's enough meaningful choice and emergent gameplay here to surprise you even after you read this review. Deus Ex rewards exploration and forethought, and while I'm not some jaded, entitled complainer, I'd like to see more of that in today's games. It was certainly innovative back when it was released. If you find the game slow going, I would advise you to simply stick with it. The amount of player choice and customization even in the vanilla game is also noteworthy for a title this old.As for JC Denton and his quest? While it's kind of corny, convoluted and obviously influenced by 1990s conspiracy theory culture, it ultimately grabs you by the collar with its twists, intricacies & personality - and doesn't let you forget it. It's reactive enough to the player's actions that I'd say it's also comparable to Undertale.And the music. It isn't to be missed; rarely do game soundtracks achieve so much harmony with a game as in Deus Ex.Now, this was still back in the Bad Old Days of Pentiums you needed to upgrade every year and action heroes who could be described as Gruff Man or Big Boobs, so while Deus Ex probably isn't the 2000s equivalent of The Talos Principle, it's still definitely a cut above the rest of its time.There is...was...multiplayer as well, but not only did it use the now-defunct Gamespy service and is very likely dead, it seemed largely perfunctory. It's still nice to see Deus Ex-style gameplay in a multiplayer environment, but if you somehow get it working you'd need to bring friends along for that particular diversion.In conclusion, if you are interested in gaming history and/or action RPGs and have a tolerance for old games, play this. You won't regret it.A word of advice, however: visit this guide, scroll down to ""Installing Patches"" and install the two listed there. Launcher/graphics stuff is up to you, but at least patch the game up.			"

												This game may be old but where it lacks in graphics it makes up for in gameplay and story. Few games have captured me so much that every single book and newspaper I see lying around I read. Either it contains information related to the plot or some halrious ancidote about nothing important. I found so far that everything is kept fresh and there is always motivation to move on to the next room and explore everything just to find the hidden box of ammo. The stealth requires patience but nothing is more satisfying the eliminating a whole wharehouse of guards one by one. Wish more games were made like this one.			"

												Deus Ex's bland graphics, questionable AI and somewhat clumsy gameplay can't hide its age, but its unique mix of first-person action, puzzle and RPG elements with a bold, groundbreaking focus on story and characters changed the landscape, and would signifcantly influence developers for the decade to come, demonstrating that a game can share qualities of film or literature and still be successfull. It's exploration of human nature is still valid now, more than a decade later. If only Ion Storm had replayed this game before making Invisible War... If you're not a graphics aficionado, and don't require the latest in tessellation, filtering, or ambient occlusion to have an engaging experience, Deus Ex may be worth your time. If you don't know what any of those are, this is even more likely the case. Being a prequel with some of the same characters, Human Revolution also draws many call-backs (or ""forwards"") to this game.			"

												Do you own a PC? Yes? Do you like playing games? Yes? Do you own Deus Ex? NO?! What's wrong with you?  You have shamed your family, your keyboard, and yourself. Neither seppuku nor sacrifice will restore your dignity. Only acquiring a copy of Deus Ex will. THE.BEST.GAME.EVER....EVER!1!one!1!  Epic story? Check. Shocking twists? Check. Unforgettable settings? Check. RPG? Check. Shooter? Check. Stealth? Check. Timeless music? Check. Badass nanosword? Check! There's so much to do with so many ways to do it. You have five different ways of performing a task as simple as opening a door. While playing this game you are constantly questioning humanity, morality, and society. Who do you trust and what consequences are you willing to accept? Should you eradicate your misguided and well intentioned enemies or sneak through with the constant fear of death? One way or another, you are JC Denton. Your nanosuit and augmentations put you at Captain Falcon levels of awesome. I played this game in 2012, so there's no nostalgia blurring my view. In this timeframe I also played titans like Half Life 2, Mass Effect, and Bioshock. This blows them all out of the water. The English language is severely lacking when trying to explain the brilliance of this game. No, only grunts, moans, squirms, and drool come close...but even they are inadequate.			"

												So, this game made in the year 2000? Well, it's hard to believe. Game is about future so does it's codes too. Too many details for an old game. For example, I went to women restroom and I got caught then she tell on the boss about me and he chew out. Whatever, game is really good for it's release date. You can upgrade your skills by completing missions, exploring areas or using speacial ways to accomplish missions. Also you have a technological body so you can add yourself some Augmentations and you can upgrade them by finding Augmentation Upgrade Canisters. You can hack computers, bypass the secure codes and lockpick the doors. These are too hard for you? Just poke around a little bit and you'll find the nano keys for doors, security codes and logins to computers. So this is what this game like. Just give it a try I'm sure you'll love it!			"

												Deus Ex is one of those games that define what an RPG is; a game that allows you to build and progress your character throughout the game and make choices throughout the game's solid plot to build your own take on it. Throughout the game creative thinking is encouraged to reach some areas, surpass obstacles, or even defeat certain enemies. The stealth mechanics are crude, however, the enemies seemingly having tunnel vision alot of times making it easy to sneak past them, or peak around a corner at them, somehow without them seeing your head poke out from behind a wall. The difficulty can be pretty weak when it comes to the enemies, I recommend playing on Hard or Realistic for a decent challenge. For a game released in 2000 the graphics are pretty solid though by today's standards they're pretty primitive, but that doesn't matter, graphics mean nothing so long as you have fun. You have a couple of different skills for different methods for making your way past the game's enemies, security systems and some hazards, but skills only enhance your capabilities with the tools, weapons and items associated with them making them more efficient, but in some cases it is hardly needed, for instance, with Explosives you don't really need skill enhancement that much, explosive weapons already do enough damage to instantly kill the majority of enemies you encounter. (And in the case of grenades you can have plentiful amounts of them.) But skills definately help in getting a better aim faster with ranged weapons, and modding and enhancing said weapons is a nice touch when you can stick a ""silencer*"" on an Assault Rifle or a Sniper Rifle, turning a sniper into a quiet one-shot-kill weapon most of the time. (so long as you aim for the head) Ontop of that, slow reloads on your shotguns? There's a mod for that. Trouble with the gun's shots hitting your target? There's a mod (and skills) for that. Want to turn a pistol into a marksman weapon? There's a scope mod for that. Multiplayer I haven't played much of but I vaguely recall it being fun but also confusing, can't really comment on it, but I can certainly comment on the actual game itself: A classic that has stood the test of time.9/10*Unlike real life -suppressors- the silencer in the game actually makes weapons silent to enemies.

												Real conspiracies. Severe consequences. Intense action role-playing.Writing this takes me back to pre-Steam times. I played this game for the first time back in year 2001 and later on made either a partial or full replay every 3-4 years. Everytime I was overwhelmed and impressed with immerse story that takes you all around the world, all these well written characters, movie-like screenplay and captivating sound environment. I would spend many hours looking in every corner, putting the pieces back together and digging the story and it's background, discovering secret areas, thinking about philosophical questions hidden between the lines - pretty much embracing Deus Ex. (A huge portion of this was successfully recreated and implemented in Human Revolution - which I would like to recommend as well). Deus Ex is among my few best games I have ever played, literally a diamond of a game. Everything about this game is exceptional: moral choices and it's consequences, elastic gameplay, the atmosphere, all the ambiance you can experience. Everything, in a way modern games try to achieve with mixed success.Did I mention replay value? Tremendous. Someone mentioned Deus Ex and I reinstalled deciding to not to give up and push on till I see the credits! Game from year 2000 won with growing line of brand new titles. To my amazement I managed to discover three new hidden areas and finding them after several replays was really rewarding. Has it aged well? For 2000 game, hell yes, only of you can handle near millennial style of boxy graphics and somewhat wooden animations, but really it doesn't matter and shouldn't bother you since backbone and writing of this game is really solid and presents still open and actual questions like: global government, NWO, infiltration, genetic enchancement and augmentations knocking to our door. ""Trust no one. Question everything"" - Play Deus Ex and soak in and embrace the night.			"

												Deus Ex is one of the most influential games ever made. No genre describes this game as it seamlessly blends action, stealth, RPG and story elements into one unique game. It's safe to say that this is the best game in the Deus Ex series, with Human Revolution taking second place in my opinion.Firstly, I will talk about the gameplay. The game has three difficulty settings, and I prefer to play on normal. It isn't ridiculously difficult, but first-time players will be challenged and may find the game rather punishing. You really have to explore every inch of the game because if you run out of lockpicks or multitools, things are going to take a turn for the worse. But I think that this encouragement to explore really enhances the experience. This game makes you think. You can't just run gung-ho into combat because you WILL die. Instead, it makes more sense to creep around in the shadows with a melee weapon or sniper rifle, picking off unaware foes and dragging their bodies into a dark corner where nobody can see them. However, the stealth is often very inconsistent. There was one time when I sniped off a guard from afar and his comrades didn't even notice, but there was another time when I did the same thing and everybody was immediately aware of my exact position. Thankfully, there's always another way around an objective, and this open-ended level design is a hallmark of this series. The game has RPG elements such as skills that let you specialise your character, and a wide range of augmentations that allow you to regenerate health, see through walls, go invisible and even detonate rockets as soon as an enemy fires them. These elements force you to choose a playstyle that suits you well, and caters to any player's needs. Want to go in charging like a living tank? The ballistic sub-dermal armour will let you take more damage without dying. Want to sneak in the shadows like a ghost? The cloak aug will stop enemies from seeing you. I found the most useful aug was regenerating health, because you will frequently take damage from hazards littered liberally around the environments. Choices matter a lot in this game. For example, if you tell Jaime Reyes to stay in UNATCO, he meets you later in Paris and gives you a killphrase that allows you to bypass the fight with Gunther Hermann. This brings me to my next point: this game has the BEST BOSS BATTLES OF ANY OTHER GAME EVER. You don't even have to do them. You can just run right past. You can even kill bosses in earlier levels so you won't have to do them later on. I wish other games used this mechanic!         Not everything is perfect, though. This game has plenty of issues. I have encountered many bugs, from getting stuck in doors, to characters transmitting me the same message ten times, to using my jumping aug to jump through the ceiling of the 'Ton hotel and then landing on an invisible floor 3 feet above the ground. But to be honest, this doesn't detract from the experience and in some cases even enhances it. I mean, it would be fairly logical for me to be able to get stuck inside a repair bot, wouldn't it?  Maybe not. In any case, this is a fun game to play.       Now I will talk about the presentation. This game is 17 years old, and graphically it really shows its age. Character models look blocky, textures look blurry, and the environments are so ridiculously dark that I couldn't see things a metre in front of me in some cases. But the game is still really immersive, and although some sci-fi elements are REALLY far-fetched, the game still feels real. The political themes of the game mirror real life and in some cases, the game even feels like a social commentary. This results in a game that is still immersive despite its laughable graphics, and is probably the number one example of ""graphics aren't everything"". "

Product received for free
A role-playing sci-fi game with loads of features, a very interesting story, great music, and iconically bad voice acting.I couldn't get into it the first few times I played it and I disliked it from the first few hours of gameplay but after a few recent restarts I learned to appreciate it. There are loads of gameplay features but much of them are pretty broken if not outdated, which was initially one of the main reasons I disliked the game at first.There are a multitude of skills you can upgrade that are given to you right from the beginning: Lockpicking, Electronics, Medicine, Computer, and Swimming. The Weapon Skills in the same window are Heavy, Pistol, Rifle, Low-Tech, and Demolition. If you don't know what weapon you just got benefits from what skill, you can check the info on its description.I realized that the skills aren't actually mandatory for the game's progression and I'm pretty sure you don't even need to upgrade any to beat the game; they're there to make certain play-styles easier on the player so should you obtain enough points to upgrade. For example, Lockpicking just decreases the amount of lockpicks you use for a heavily-locked door, Computer allows you to hack computers if you don't feel like or just haven't found the login/password for a terminal, and all the Weapon Skills increase damage & accuracy. As a good role-playing game goes, you can't legitimately max out everything in one playthough, at least not as far as I know anyway.Fancier upgrades can be found in the game via augmentation canisters that are located throughout the game with various functionalities that all eat up your energy meter when used. You're not a shake flashlight so you have to recharge your energy meter when appropriate via these recharging robots or a certain recharge item you can find throughout the game.Augs consist of things like the ability to lift heavier objects, run faster, EMP shield, and more. Each canister gives you a choice of what two augs you want to install to its desired slot. Unfortunately you can't replace already installed augs so you need to choose wisely on what you want to have. You can  quicksave/quickload to see how one augmentation works if you must. There are also upgrade canisters you can find that upgrade said installed augs for improved functionality.During my mostly-stealthy, mostly-non-lethal playthrough I found only a select few augs to be of any use and some I regret installing.Taking damage is pretty unique in this game as each limb has their own HP.If your legs' HP reach 0 you'll have to crawl instead of walk. If your arms', then your efficiency with weapons is decreased. If the head's or torso's reach 0, then you die. With medkits you can heal each limb individually. Miraculously you can practically regrow your limbs via food & drinks though you'd have to consume a hefty ton of those for that idea to come to fruition.Much of the game has you doing things manually with one of these things being the inventory. There's no inventory-tetris in the game despite several items taking up more than one space which can be a real pain sometimes. You can't rotate items so if something takes up 2 squares of inventory space horizontally then you'll have to make 2 empty horizontal slots yourself since there's no auto-arrangement when it comes to inventory space. It's a bigger nuisance if you're trying to pick an item up but you don't know how much space it needs so your only choice is to ignore the item altogether or drop several items on the ground hoping you've made enough room to even pick it up.One of the selling points of the game is how there really are multiple solutions to problems as advertised.Door's locked? You can lockpick it. No lockpicks? You can shoot it, hit it with a melee weapon, or use explosives depending on whether or not the door's weak enough. Is the door immortal? Either find a key or find an alternate path. The game's designed for each level to have at least more than one way to get through something save for one part of the game. You're even rewarded with supplies and usually skill points for exploring nooks and crannies.And of course you can go about the entire game using non-lethal measures.The gunplay is a little unreliable until you upgrade the appropriate weapon skill and/or you upgrade the weapon of choice with upgrade mods that you can find throughout the game. It's even more unreliable to go guns blazing in the beginning as well. Your crosshair is spread wide open until you stand still for a bit but even then the bullet can look like it just went outside of the crosshair diameter. For some reason the crosshair thing applies even to melee weapons, even if it's not visibly shown. I'm not entirely sure how the gunplay is played out if I upgraded their appropriate weapon skills since stealth was so strongly encouraged and that's how I often like to play games like this.The AI awareness when you're sneaking about is weird. They're certainly ""functional"" but how they work can easily shatter one's suspension of disbelief; they don't often hear gunshots when it looks like they should, sneaking up to them & colliding with their models doesn't alert them, and etc. etc. For some reason, to do a 1-hit takedown, lethal or non-lethal, on most humanoid enemies you have to hit them on their lower back for it to work. Hitting the head steathily just treats it as regular damage. You also have to collide with their bodies as you swing your weapon an inch above the belt region, otherwise it's just relied on RNG on whether or not you hit the desired spot.The tranquilizer darts are said to be ""quiet"" but it's hardly so when it doesn't instantly take them down and the enemy just runs in circles until they finally go down.

												In the opinion of many professional (and unprofessional) video game reviewers and commentators, Deus Ex is hailed as one of the singular greatest arguement for the greatest game of all time. The in-depth story is as long as it is captivating, taking the player on a global journey from New York City, to Shanghai, to Paris and California and a rather surprising ending location. The story is unparralled in it's depth and creativity, despite broaching a genre which has been entrenched in many fictional works. The gameplay is superb, and serves as a model for close to every FPS/RPG succeading it. Ultimately, the excellence of this work is somewhat inhibited due to the aged graphics which it holds, the faces being a notable point of contention. But this minimially detracts from the experiance, and the atmosphere is unparalled despite this. However, Deus Ex belonged to a generation of games helmed by Warren Spector and other early PC innovators. This collection of programmers and coders worked on some of the most renowned games of all time, System Shock 2 (1999), Thief (1998), and other celebrated classics. They run in tandem with a more focused RPG genre, led by the Fallout games, Elder Scrolls games and other Dungeons and Dragons isometric games largely held as the culmination of masterpieces for the PC. In a sense, Deus Ex is sort of the harbinger of a new age for PC games, one which sort of loses a touch which System Shock 2, Thief and Deus Ex had, and this is inherent within the sequel, which abandons many of the tropes which made Deus Ex a masterpiece. Morrowind serves a similar function albeit for the RPG side, with Oblivion and Skyrim notably streamlining many RPG aspects within that particular game. That is not to say the sequels for Deus Ex are bad. On the contrary, Invisible War is good - but strange. Human Revolution however is noteworthy and worth a playthrough, if only for the grandiose set-up it leaves for this game. Overall this series is one of the innovators within gaming, and thus should be worth consideration.			"

A role-playing sci-fi game with loads of features, a very interesting story, great music, and iconically bad voice acting.I couldn't get into it the first few times I played it and I disliked it from the first few hours of gameplay but after a few recent restarts I learned to appreciate it. There are loads of gameplay features but much of them are pretty broken if not outdated, which was initially one of the main reasons I disliked the game at first.There are a multitude of skills you can upgrade that are given to you right from the beginning: Lockpicking, Electronics, Medicine, Computer, and Swimming. The Weapon Skills in the same window are Heavy, Pistol, Rifle, Low-Tech, and Demolition. If you don't know what weapon you just got benefits from what skill, you can check the info on its description.I realized that the skills aren't actually mandatory for the game's progression and I'm pretty sure you don't even need to upgrade any to beat the game; they're there to make certain play-styles easier on the player so should you obtain enough points to upgrade. For example, Lockpicking just decreases the amount of lockpicks you use for a heavily-locked door, Computer allows you to hack computers if you don't feel like or just haven't found the login/password for a terminal, and all the Weapon Skills increase damage & accuracy. As a good role-playing game goes, you can't legitimately max out everything in one playthough, at least not as far as I know anyway.Fancier upgrades can be found in the game via augmentation canisters that are located throughout the game with various functionalities that all eat up your energy meter when used. You're not a shake flashlight so you have to recharge your energy meter when appropriate via these recharging robots or a certain recharge item you can find throughout the game.Augs consist of things like the ability to lift heavier objects, run faster, EMP shield, and more. Each canister gives you a choice of what two augs you want to install to its desired slot. Unfortunately you can't replace already installed augs so you need to choose wisely on what you want to have. You can  quicksave/quickload to see how one augmentation works if you must. There are also upgrade canisters you can find that upgrade said installed augs for improved functionality.During my mostly-stealthy, mostly-non-lethal playthrough I found only a select few augs to be of any use and some I regret installing.Taking damage is pretty unique in this game as each limb has their own HP.If your legs' HP reach 0 you'll have to crawl instead of walk. If your arms', then your efficiency with weapons is decreased. If the head's or torso's reach 0, then you die. With medkits you can heal each limb individually. Miraculously you can practically regrow your limbs via food & drinks though you'd have to consume a hefty ton of those for that idea to come to fruition.Much of the game has you doing things manually with one of these things being the inventory. There's no inventory-tetris in the game despite several items taking up more than one space which can be a real pain sometimes. You can't rotate items so if something takes up 2 squares of inventory space horizontally then you'll have to make 2 empty horizontal slots yourself since there's no auto-arrangement when it comes to inventory space. It's a bigger nuisance if you're trying to pick an item up but you don't know how much space it needs so your only choice is to ignore the item altogether or drop several items on the ground hoping you've made enough room to even pick it up.One of the selling points of the game is how there really are multiple solutions to problems as advertised.Door's locked? You can lockpick it. No lockpicks? You can shoot it, hit it with a melee weapon, or use explosives depending on whether or not the door's weak enough. Is the door immortal? Either find a key or find an alternate path. The game's designed for each level to have at least more than one way to get through something save for one part of the game. You're even rewarded with supplies and usually skill points for exploring nooks and crannies.And of course you can go about the entire game using non-lethal measures.The gunplay is a little unreliable until you upgrade the appropriate weapon skill and/or you upgrade the weapon of choice with upgrade mods that you can find throughout the game. It's even more unreliable to go guns blazing in the beginning as well. Your crosshair is spread wide open until you stand still for a bit but even then the bullet can look like it just went outside of the crosshair diameter. For some reason the crosshair thing applies even to melee weapons, even if it's not visibly shown. I'm not entirely sure how the gunplay is played out if I upgraded their appropriate weapon skills since stealth was so strongly encouraged and that's how I often like to play games like this.The AI awareness when you're sneaking about is weird. They're certainly ""functional"" but how they work can easily shatter one's suspension of disbelief; they don't often hear gunshots when it looks like they should, sneaking up to them & colliding with their models doesn't alert them, and etc. etc. For some reason, to do a 1-hit takedown, lethal or non-lethal, on most humanoid enemies you have to hit them on their lower back for it to work. Hitting the head steathily just treats it as regular damage. You also have to collide with their bodies as you swing your weapon an inch above the belt region, otherwise it's just relied on RNG on whether or not you hit the desired spot.The tranquilizer darts are said to be ""quiet"" but it's hardly so when it doesn't instantly take them down and the enemy just runs in circles until they finally go down. Only if they're alone (as well as not being near an alarm button) will it be considered ""quiet"" as no one will be alerted while they run around until they drop. Even if an alarm is tripped in any manner it's easy to just hide and wait until the alarm silences and then everyone just goes about their usual stuff.You can loot a body, whether unconscious or dead, and can only pick them up when their inventory is empty. But there's no point in picking bodies up aside for comedic purposes since no one cares if there's a new body on the floor; all anyone cares about is if they ""witness"" the attack itself.The story is very interesting to say the least even if they are often portrayed through silly voice acting.

												Deus Ex is truly a masterpiece. Despite the name there is no Deus Ex Machina effect whatsoever - everything is logical and consequential and every detail is a piece of whole - user's password can tell you about his life more than you can hear from anyone, organisation name contains a key to it's entrance, and internet adresses hint major plot twist. The world of demolished Lady Liberty is surprisingly and eerily real both in it's behaviour and as a very possible future of ours. It also one of the most stylish worlds out there. Without overusing design cliches and descending into self repetition it keeps cold, metallic demanaur faintly lit by distant LED lights and blue ROM module colloids from the start to the end. And the wonderful tracker soundtrack by Alexander Brandon and Michel van de Bos is making perfect - transcendent.As for the gameplay. On the first glimpse arsenal is quite poor - less than ten types of firearms, couple of throwables, few melee choices and array of tools - but what this game about is you, as a player, as a character. Main tool in your arsenal is your head - numerous ways to approach the objective are only multiplied by your skills and the most useful tool in game - augmentations, which allow you to perform superhumane tasks such as invisibility, wind speed combined with impossible jump height or even projectile-stopping nanite shield - everything is in your hands. But beware that you are limited not only by supply of bioelectricity, but also with finite augmentation possibilities. The brighter you burn the faster you expire and one possibilities take take place of anothers. So at the end your head - is your main tool and weapon, not even the GEP gun.Don't be scared off by strange and old look of unreal engine or somewhat obsolete (i'd say more outmoded though) futurology - game holds it's mark to this day and is, and never cease to be a truly amazing and unique experience. Give it a shot. And don't play it like game - feel it, live in it. Because it's how it's meant to be. Because it's worth it. And remember - trust nobody, question everything.			"

There's all the great elements of a FPS/RPG in there, the plot is great, the levels are all superbly designed and for a game thats now 12 years old, its still really enjoyable. My score for Deus Ex is a hearty 8/10			"

DEUS EX - Every time you mention it, someone will reinstall it.Three years after I first played Deus Ex: Human Revolution and enjoyed it immensely, it was finally time for its big brother. I tried the original Deus Ex a few years ago, but I just couldn't get passed its outdated visuals (including New Vision) and especially its awful animations. Which I think is probably typical for the Deus Ex series, since Human Revolution also wasn't a looker to begin with. But I suppose I kinda matured in terms of gaming in the last two years, because when I started Deus Ex again a few months ago, the visuals didn't bother me.But enough about me. Besides the convincing dystopia future with its own share of society problems dripping with atmosphere, I needed some time to adjust to the gameplay. Because it has been quite some time that a game didn't spoon-fed me how to play the game or which way to go with a huge pointer on-screen. Overwhelming at first, but the level of player freedom makes you comfortable very quickly. You get a relatively big area each level where you can go where ever you please, do whatever you want in a manner you find appropriate. The excellent level designs makes sure of that. Later on, based on the augmentations you choose, you get even more options that suit your play style. No wrongs or rights.+ Excellent level design, a lot of player freedom, all roads lead to Rome.+ Not a single moment of holding hands, just good ol' fashioned exploration and finding the way on your own.+ Dystopia cyberpunk future and its problems are represented very well and convincing. + A great story to boot that rarely to never loses its grip.+ A lot of choices and consequences that can make your life later on easier or harder.+ Great atmosphere and an even better soundtrack.- Ugly face animations, probably even for 2000 standards.- Mediocre/static voice acting, except Bob Page whom I thought sounded excellent.- Stupid AI, though understandable considering it's 15 years old now.I still prefer Human Revolution (first love and all that), but now I can understand where most of its brilliance comes from. If the next Deus Ex, Mankind Divided, can combine the strengths from both Deus Ex 1 and Human Revolution, and somehow iron out their respective little flaws, Mankind Divided will be a very, very unforgettable experience. The hype is real.9/10			"

												I want to tell you a story. It has spoilers, so consider yourself warned.My JC Denton was a good agent. In the field, he was an intelligent, efficient snipe-happy hacker, with a pistol for emergencies. (Side note: Silenced sniper rifle + laser-sight pistol, both at Advanced skill level =OP.)However, when he infiltrated the building Paul Denton told him to to show him that UNATCO was corrupt, my JC mixed up his objectives and went to the roof, where the satellite dish he was supposed to change if Paul was correct was located, instead of the basement, where the proof was. This was a bit of a dilemma.Then my JC Denton had an epiphany.He realized that he would work for whichever side allowed him to shoot, loot, and hack as much as possible. So right then and there, my JC hacked the satellite dish and looted what was inside, betraying his country for some immediate cheap thrills. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't psychotic; my JC was just extremely vindictive, self-righteous, and challenge-seeking, and he had a lot of guns.He then went through the rest of the game, shooting and looting and hacking all over the place, and when the time came, he took the only sensible option and merged with Helios.Deus Ex has a lot of problems. It looks awful, there aren't enough character options for the action-oriented player, the voice acting is atrocious, and some enemies have way too much health (lookin' at you, greasels). However, any game with this amount of player choice and understanding of the player (one time, when lost and trying to leave a cathedral, I walked up to a French chef and JC promptly asked how the hell to get out of there) deserves whatever recommendations it can get.Seriously though, f*ck all the transgenics.

												This game is one of the best I've played. Before I got into sandbox games like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series of games I played Deus Ex. This plays differently than both of those titles, but it does sanbox play in its own way very well. The game can be advanced in any way you desire, be it stealth gameplay, run&gun, smash things with a crowbar, hacking terminals, killing everything you see, non-lethal takedowns, etc...You also have access to a rudimentary skill system that allows you to focus your expertise in whichever areas you so choose. You can be extremely skilled with handguns or relatively skilled with rifles, heavy wepons and melee weapons. You can increase the effectiveness of your medkits to heal you for more or focus on avoiding combat by getting more usefulness out of your lockpicks and multitools (high tech lockpicks for security doors and cameras).You will gain access to augmentations for your character as well. These are upgrades that have an active effect when you need it most at the cost of bio-electrical energy (basically a secondary resource like mana). These augs can be chosen from one of two per body part. You can augment your arms to deal tremendous melee damage or give you the strength to move heavy objects. You can augment your legs to give you faster movement speed or increase the height you can jump as well as ruduce falling damage. You can augment your lungs to allow you to hold your breath for longer periods underwater or to filter harmful substances from poisoned or irradiated areas. You can augment your skin to reduce damage from projectile wepons or from energy/fire weapons. There are many different combinations you can choose from, and each will help a particular style of gameplay. The choices are left entirely to you.Then there's the story. I won't give away spoilers, but know that nothing is what it seems nor is anyone who they really seem. There are many great twists and turns beofre you reach the end, and there are several different endings depending on your actions throughout the game. You can advance the story any way you want through your actions and dialogue choices. Deus Ex does this very well by allowing you to decide for yourself what actions you want to take in any given situation. Did that guy betray you? You can trust that he won't do it again, not trust him and never deal with him again or kill him for screwing you over. For every choice you make there will be some sort of effect on some aspect of the game, be it causing you to switch alliances or just a quirky dialogue change. Due to this there is a great deal of replayability that will keep you playing through over and over to see what would happen if you did things differently.Remember that this game was released in 2000, so don't expect hyper-realistic visuals and sound effects or nop-notch voice acting. What this game does best is to deliver a fun, memorable gaming experiece that sets it apart from your average yearly installment of CoD.BE FOREWARNED: To those who come from playing games like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout you will have to leave items on the ground never to be seen again. There is no storage nor are there vendors. The game revolves around you only taking what you inetend to use. It kills me coming back to this game after playing Skyrim. I hate leaving rocket launchers and flamethrowers behind due to my compulsive desire to take everything, but after a little while you get accustomed to it. As you increase your skills in certain areas you will find weapons you don't specialize in are less desirable due to their ineffectiveness and lack of monetary value. I specialize in handguns, and in leveling my skills in that area the usage of handguns becomes more fluid. I become more accurate, can use them more effectively while running, deal more damage with them, etc.., while with a sniper rifle I would have to stand still for a good ten seconds to get a good bead on my target, have a hard time aiming and deal less damage. It gets to the point where when I see a rocket launcher lying on the ground I don't even want to pick it up.I would highly recommend Deus Ex to anyone who enjoys a game with a good mix of story, solid gameplay, freedom of choice, decision making and consequence. 10/10 a classic.

												For those of us who remember the N64, Goldeneye 007 was up there with Ocarina of Time, and Super Mario 64 as one of the most popular games of the system. Deus Ex reminds me in many ways of Goldeneye.The gameplay is unmatched. Every level presents new scenery and new challenges. Just like in Goldeneye, you have various objectives that must be completed. And to complete the objectives, you have to deal with enemies as well as many other hazards, There are multiple ways to get to the objectives; do you clear the resistance or do you use your tools to get through the securely locked doors? This game features level ups in the form of augmentations and skill points. Skill points are gained by finding secrets and clearing objectives and can be used to better your skills, while augmentations are enhancements that can enable you to do things like healing, causing enemies to blow themselves up with rockets, or seeing through walls! You find these in canisters; found throughout certain areas. It's a fun game and for all you diehard Goldeneye fans (and even if you aren't), you'll love this game. Quite frankly, I don't know why anyone wouldn't. So go and get it.			"

Ill toss my opinion in the sea of maymay reviews and BOMBs etc etcIll start off with the badThe gameplay is clunkyThe graphics are ♥♥♥♥The game will most likely run like ♥♥♥♥ without a fanmade patch or fix like DEUSEXEThe voice acting is bad and can have some very bad actors here and thereNow for the goodThe voice acting is bad and can have some very bad actors here and there (its one of those wierd quirks in the game that makes it enjoyable and unique, not just a bunch of british people making everything sound dramatic)The graphics, while bad, have a style to them that I havent seen matched in any other game, not even the subsequent Deus Exes... its very dirty and cool temperant with all the blues and greys, with vibrant colors sprinkled across the levels to keep it just interesting enough to the eyeThe gameplay is indeed garbage, but it has a charm to it as well, it hard to explain and very subjective, but you might find yourself laughing your ♥♥♥ off after you smack a guard in  the back of the head with a baton and he falls flat on his faceThe real gem of the game is the story and writting as well as characters and twists in the plot. Its one of those games where you never want to really finish it because its so good, you dont want to see the ending come just yet. Ive reinstalled 3 times already and still havent seen the endingThe level design is very open and large for its time, Im always impressed at how many paths are crammed into the level without being to obvious. This is a short review, Its my favorite game of all time, it has flaws, but those flaws give it some character. I highly suggest you hop into it if you ever have a weekend to get ingulfed in a game. The first 2 levels arent top tier by any means, so dont let  them drive you off like they made me for awhile. I played this in 2014, and loved it. So dont believe the very few haters of this game when they say only people who played it when it came out like the game. "

												Deus Ex hasn't aged very gracefully, but it's still a blast to play. The story is compelling, the visuals aren't that bad, the music is dynamic and addictive, and the gameplay is very non-linear. You can be stealthy or you can go in guns blazing. There are lots of ways to complete missions and lots of secrets to find. Cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												This game is a fun action-adventure role-playing game (AARPG). It has a unique upgrade system that allows for more upgrades the more you explore an area. The main story so far is good, but there are plently of side stories that make the game even more enjoyable. This is a game everyone should play, it is truly a gem. It took me 9 hours to do 3 levels because of all the optional exploration and side stuff to do.			"

												The best video game of all time, bar none; the sequels Invisible War (horrible game) and Human Revolution don't even come close. The game takes place in the year 2052 where the world has become a ghetto ravaged by war, terrorism, and disease. A new plague, known as the Gray Death, is spreading rapidly with no cure; only a vaccine known as Ambrosia can prevent infection, and only if you can keep taking it. Worst of all, production is extremely limited and most of it is rationed out to key government and utility workers. You play as UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) agent J.C. Denton, fresh out of the academy, on his first mission to reacquire a supply of Amrbosia that has been stolen by the terrorist group NSF (National Secessionist Forces). But it doesn't take long to figure out that something much more sinister is going on.Deus Ex features incorporates conspiracy theries (Illuminati, Trilateral Commission, Knights Templar, Majestic 12, etc) into a well-integrated cyberpunk storyline. It is the most cerebral game I've ever played, which focuses on the ideas of liberty and authority with very intelligent dialogue.The gameplay is incredible as well. Deus Ex is a FPS/RPG hybrid and the best I've seen in it's genre. You gain skill points that you can invest into different skills, such as Heavy Weaponry, Lockpicking, or Medicine. You also receive nano-augmentations throughout the game that can be toggled on or off at the expense of bioelectrical enegry, such as Quiet Movement or Invisibility.The only downside to this game, if you want to call it that, is that the graphics are outdated as the game came out in 2000. However, there are lots of mods that improve things like texture quality which make the game more visually pleasing. If you were a PC gamer around the time though (Half Life, Unreal, Tribes, etc) then it shouldn't phase in you the least bit.Play this game NOW. You're not a real PC gamer if you haven't. 10/10. Such fun. Much wow.			"

												Well what can I say... This game needs a rework.It really was one of the best games of its time. Nowadays it lacks some of the simple things like changing music, more kinds of different npc looks, and overall a better.Nothing of that was bad, but after about 2 hours per level listening to the same music my head started to hurt.This game got some things even current games lack: - Full voice cast- Manymany items, not only useful ones.- Big world with many places you actually don't have to visit- A choice between good or bad (kill or sneak in this case)- A complex story.Too bad after 14 hours (with at least 6 hours to go) the game crashed at a certain point, no matter which savegame I used or which of the multiple ways I went. Would have loved to reach the end.			"

												I've just beaten the game yesterday--first playthrough--and I've had a bit of time to reflect. I wish that I hadn't read a ton of reviews of people building this game up to be the best game ever. So if you haven't played yet, my advice is to go into it expecting that it'll be above average for its time (also assuming you're old enough to know what to expect from that era :P ). I think you'll enjoy it a lot more.I went in with VERY high expectations on the storyline becuase of all the reviews on here and wound up underwhelmed. Not only at the end of the game, but throughout as well. Just always wondering when it was gonna get really good. While the storyline was ok, I was never drawn in by it, and my reaction at some plot twists was more ""huh...didn't expect that,"" than actual surprise.One main reason I never got pulled into the story was the absolutely horrible voice acting. They had 1 real person doing voices for like 15 different characters. With the lack of facial variation in the game, I was often confused if it was a new or old character I'd just met up with. The reason the individual voice acting was so bad is there was a complete lack of emotion in the voices. Impressively lacking I'd say. Like they grabbed people off the street. At first I thought it was about concerns for the size for the game fitting on disks back then, but the voices actually have acceptable bandwidth, just no change in pitch or volume. Finally in the last hours of the game ONE of the characters was emotive, raising their voice and changing the stress in the voice. Who knows, maybe it WAS a disk space thing, I'm not an expert.As you may have noticed, I do recommend the game. It's pretty good, and I hope I can relect on its backstory for when I play the later games (I know to skip Invisible War). But I think that there are a LOT of people who view it through star-struck eyes because they played it when it came out or it was the first game of this type that they played. Just as the original Halo has a special place in my heart, I realize I probably wouldn't think so highly of it if I started with the latest FPS games and THEN played Halo for the first time. But aside from Golden Eye, that was the first game of that sort I ever played--and right when it came out--so it left a huge impression on me.			"

												Deus Ex is often claimed to be the best game in computer game history. Personally I agree but it's not without it's problems. Join me while I take a look at this critically praised title.The StoryDeus Ex begins in the docks of the island where the statue of liberty is located at. The island is under lockdown because of a terrorist attack by an organization called ""NSF"" that has managed to overtake the entire island. You are ""JC"" Denton, a nano augmented super agent working for the security agency UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) and your task is to infiltrate the statue of liberty and capture the leader of the terrorist attack alive. You meet up with your brother: Paul Denton which gives you a weapon and the location of a contact that can help JC into the statue. JC is later tasked with working under the supervision of his machine augmented collegue Anna Navarre in several tasks related to attacks against the NSF. The story has no problem introducing new characters to you. All the major characters you meets are colorful and memorable but most of all they feel real.Level DesignWhen you exit the docks you come across patrolling terrorists pretty much instantly. How you prefer to go up to the tower of liberty is entirely up to you as there are a number of ways to do so. The level design in this very first level is optimized to be as open as possible with plenty of secrets so it makes newcomers confused as to where to start and how to approach the problem. If you search around you will find to be able to get the Sniper rifle and the Crossbow on the very first level of the game.The other levels in the game varies with open areas and enclosed areas but they're never entirely linear. They are more often than not full of branching paths but of course there are a few linear levels which JC has to venture though but even those can be progressed through in different ways, making for a truly varied experience. Almost all levels in the game allows for a subtle approach (or even several) but a direct assault approach is never out of the question either. However, the game rewards subtle approaches more than lethal ones which is apparent even in the first few levels of the game.There is however one level that I want to bring up, directly before you arrive in Hong Kong - where you need to rescue your helicopter from a hangar of some sort: While not being a bad level in it's own right - this level did not add anything to the game and felt entirely unnecessary to me.RPG ElementsJC Denton starts out with a couple of skill points which he invests in different skills. These are in several different areas ranging from very useful to merely a convenience. The developers are aware of the convenience skills and they cost a lot less than the more essential skills that you can invest in. So if you want to be able to be a great swimmer it will not cost as much as being a good hacker or a good shooter but it will still cost something. Even if you don't have any skills in the different areas you will still be able to do these tasks - albeit at a higher cost of the resources to carry out the tasks. For example you might come across a locked door. If you are untrained in lockpicking you will only be able to unlock 10 points (of a universal maximum of 100) from the lock per lockpick. As the tools of these trades are relatively difficult to acquire large numbers of and locked doors being plentiful this skill easily turns out to be one of the most useful ones. So if you're untrained you will merely have to be more selective in the doors you want to try and unlock. If you run out you can also sometimes just blow up the door with explosives but the explosives in this game is even more rare than lockpicks. Unlike lockpicks though - explosives mostly only need 1 charge to succeed.Deus Ex also features an ""augmentation"" system where you get to choose between different buffs and abilities JC will permanently be outfitted with during the game. JC can choose between being better at smashing peoples skulls in with melee weapons or lifting heavy boxes and crates. One allows JC to take people down in one hit and the other allows him to bring cover or trap people. You also get other kinds of abilities like being able to either be invisible to people or to cameras or being able to see details of your target (like health and weapons) or have night & heat vision. You always have to choose between two augmentations that works in similar ways but they also need to be upgraded and upgrading is something I think the game could have done without; because without the need to upgrade, augmentations could have been playing a larger role (especially in the early parts of the game) instead of being a bonus on top of JC's more useful Skills system.Combat and StealthBecause this is an RPG - Deus Ex's combat changes according to the skills JC acquires during the game. The game favors silent takedowns as the game isn't afraid of pitting you against several enemies at once, but in a way it is possible to try and engage the enemy with lethal weapons as well but perhaps not as rewarding. Eventually though JC pretty much needs to equip himself with some form of lethal weapons due to the increase of armored enemies during the later stages of the game. This oddly enough gives a sense of progression and a strange dynamic to the fights where you have to use the less lethal weapons against human grunts and the lethal ones against the tougher ones.There is one strange thing with Deus Ex's aiming system where you have to crouch in order to get maximum accuracy. It's mainly a way to allow players who doesn't have good fighting skills to still be able to defeat someone with a gun. The games has some other, more desirable options open for such players such as throwing grenades and using pepper spray.Of course sneaking is the greatest asset to JC and you don't have to skill up in order to be a great ninja in this game. In fact: JC starts as a pretty good ninja right from the start. As long as the player sticks to the shadows or behind the enemy he's not going to be able to see JC coming and be entirely in the mercy of the players whims.ConclusionDeus Ex does have it's problems, just like every single other game but somehow what Deus Ex tries really works. The story, despite it's weaknesses is ultimately very good. The pacing is brisk and you're never without any goals. The level design ranks as one of the best in games up to this point. And unlike so many other games from 2000 this game actually looks really good. Much of what isn't done very good or great is at least solid and the game has very few apparent weaknesses.Most games I play have quirks that makes the experience playing them somewhat worse by being central mechanics. Deus Ex's problems are very minor in comparison of it's qualities. The augmentation system that I mentioned earlier is after all ""a bonus"" since JC's power really comes from his skills system. That's why I believe Deus Ex is as great as gaming has ever gotten and deserve a 6 out of 6.			"

It's mainly a way to allow players who doesn't have good fighting skills to still be able to defeat someone with a gun. The games has some other, more desirable options open for such players such as throwing grenades and using pepper spray.Of course sneaking is the greatest asset to JC and you don't have to skill up in order to be a great ninja in this game. In fact: JC starts as a pretty good ninja right from the start. As long as the player sticks to the shadows or behind the enemy he's not going to be able to see JC coming and be entirely in the mercy of the players whims.ConclusionDeus Ex does have it's problems, just like every single other game but somehow what Deus Ex tries really works. The story, despite it's weaknesses is ultimately very good. The pacing is brisk and you're never without any goals. The level design ranks as one of the best in games up to this point. And unlike so many other games from 2000 this game actually looks really good. Much of what isn't done very good or great is at least solid and the game has very few apparent weaknesses.Most games I play have quirks that makes the experience playing them somewhat worse by being central mechanics. Deus Ex's problems are very minor in comparison of it's qualities. The augmentation system that I mentioned earlier is after all ""a bonus"" since JC's power really comes from his skills system. That's why I believe Deus Ex is as great as gaming has ever gotten and deserve a 6 out of 6.			"

												A true gem, even by modern-day standards, Deus Ex took me a while to get in to. It wasn't until a few missions/hours in that I was really hooked, but as the story became more understandable and the levels more varied (and there are a lot), I got to look past the dated graphics and A.I., and found a really deep, enthralling title with lots of rewarding exploration and true varied playstyles: you can complete any level how you want and there are a number of ways to do it. I would recommend Deus Ex to any fan of shooters, as it can fit almost all shooter playstyles: run and gun, stealth and snipe, superhuman abilities, melee, etc. The story and voice acting is great, and a long, content-filled adventure of conspiracy and tension. Great endings. 9/10			"

 Introduction Deus Ex is a first-person shooter published and developed by Ion Storm Houston in June 26, 2000. Directed by Warren Spector, Deus Ex is about one man’s destiny of becoming the God in the Machine to make a truly fair autonomous world government that appeals to the minds of the living – though this is only the first of many choices to take.Deus Ex is an incredibly influential game of it's time known for level design and scripting which has been designed towards various players actions that a player may take to complete an objective, a breakthrough in “emergent” gameplay and through experimentation secret dialogues and other rewards unlock through the exploration and reward.  Deus Ex’s setting is that of a futuristic cyberpunk world shrouded in ambiguity and fear as a nanite-virus known as the Grey Death spreads across the American continent and rural areas committing to the genocide of millions of people! The working classes, now cower in constant fear and terror of their government’s policies. It’s dark ambience and semi-realistic representation of 21st century world in turmoil coupled with the scale of its maps, intelligent design and humor help deliver an intense, conspiracy-themed world with high re-playability. Gameplay Deus Ex is a hybrid of First Person Shooter and Role Playing elements. Though semi-linear, there is many quests to do in the game which offers a challenge and reward of skill points or weapons/upgrades. There is a total of 10 skills in the game; Computer, Rifle, Low-Tech, Pistol, Heavy, Environmental Training, Swimming, Medicine, Electronics and Lockpicking.  These Skill upgrades improve Denton's ability to hack, swim (rarely used), shoot certain types of weapons without movement or accuracy penalties, jump higher, regenerate health, deactivate security restrictions such as a locked door to an armory or shop, gain access to robots interfaces and drones.4 difficulties are Easy, Medium, Hard and Realistic, all 3 increase NPC health and damage dealt but Realistic Realistic deals heavy damage on different body parts for both parties depending on what weapon is used to kill a target. Recommendations Lore-heavy with elements of interwoven themes concerning the socioeconomical abuse of a nation, the results of a corruptive government and the dangers of indiscriminate survillence giving the game a great sense of scale, depth, and mystery compared to games of its time.Modification friendly. Deus Ex uses Unreal engine to run so many SDK tools can be used to create new content. My recommended ones would be Deus Ex GMDX, Revision, Shifter and the tons at MODDB; http://www.moddb.com/games/deus-ex/mods Criticisms; Minor Requires Kentie’s Direct3D 10 renderer for extended options and playability.Deus Ex is very clunky gameplay wise with a considerable amount of skill bloat. To briefly explain this, a lot of augmentations overlap the Skills in the game such as Swimming and Environmental Training which are notorious for being the least useful skills to train in the game because they can be replaced with items or biological modification that do the same thing and better.Graphically poor, even for it’s time. Designs of certain weaposn are bland and nonsensical (such as the Stealth Pistol being a bullpup pistol) Animations are varied but stilted and wooden looking.Deus Ex's level design can be very confusing and maze-like at the end-game. The best thing to do is  is to explore and find new things. Gunplay The gunplay has a great selection of combat tools and different ammunition but is extremely clunky and spread is random until you gain the Targetting augmentation or use Gun Modifications to upgrade Accuracy of the selected weapon. You can use everything from Crowbars, Tasers to Rocket Launchers and Turrets (with the help of a Computer Skill) to take down enemies or you can use stealth and toss a throwing knife into the throat of a weary enemy. The game takes heavy considerations for what body parts are hit - for example, hitting a crowbar at the base of the spine will instantly knock or kill a target or a gunshot of a large rifle to the torso or head will terminate their life and in opposing manner you as well on Realistic Difficulty.  Music Deus Ex music was composed by Alexander Brandon, who is known for focusing heavily upon electronic and classical hybrids similar to Vangelis’ works. It is dynamic, peppy and very beat heavy - influenced in a unique way by the players actions. Assaulting enemies and friendlies will cause the music to be suddenly rough, choatic classic electronica hybrid ochestra (yes, it is THAT good) to a calm, placid ambient drone that heals the ears when visiting the bustling cities when walking around or sneaking. You should have a listen to Alexander Brandon's works as they are very sublime for their time. Graphics The Unreal 1 engine was updated in Deus Ex to allow for coloured lightmaps, textured shading, mipmapping, skeletal animation (to include more advanced animations). Though Deus Ex paled in graphics in comparison to other games, the world is still believable and large for it's time. Due to the expandability, the source code and SDK's packaged with Deus Ex, this produced many modifications from graphical, gameplay and to minor changes such as changes to HUD. Mechanics Deus Ex uses a 'Skill Point' design to allocated a fixed price of skill points which are earned by doing quests, use of dialogue, clever exploration or by experimenting with certain actions in the game's environment.Deus Ex awards exploration, inquistiveness and theres tons of hidden content, including story, items, mini-quests and lets you play as if it were an open-world and it gets better from there! Many, many guns to choose from, many ways to play stealthy or violently.Deus Ex makes much use of emergent gameplay, meaning your actions can take serious consequences and changes to rewards and storyline. The very first level can be played in many different ways - some that you would think the developer would miss! Storyline The introduction begins with two mysterious figures amongst a large statue of a hand palming the globe, explaining their plans for a new augmentation project and the virus known as Grey Death.Meanwhile… J.C Denton, a rookie officer at UNATCO is briefed to take action and arrest an NSF commander by his brother Paul Denton. UNATCO is an anti-terrorist organisation founded after the Statue of Liberty was blown up by Northwest/Nationalist Secessionist Forces, a “terrorist” group. J.C Denton is sent with his brother Paul Denton to find the source of the deadly plague that haunts American civilizations with an atmosphere of death and secret control. The player as JC finds out more and more about the sinister plague and the lack of Ambrosia, its cure. This leads you, the player (and by extension JC) into finding out much more than what meets the eye as you find leads all round the world leading you to the ultimate conspiracy.			"

												Is DEUS EX the greatest game ever?It might be. Seldom, if ever, has a game blended so well elements of first person shooters, stealth, assassin and puzzle games, all into an RPG with great combat, minigames, and a self-driven narrative. While it is stylistically dated--shades of the MATRIX show throughout--the story is a rich one, and the game has remarkable replay value. Rarely is it ever the same game twice. Play it now, play it again, and live the perfect Cyberpunk RPG. 15 years after it hit shelves, it's still a treasure for gamers everywhere.			"

												Holy christ, I just saw this game on sale for one dollar and seventy-four cents. $1.74. Get it. This game is an absolute gem and a legend within the cyberpunk genre. An early rpg/fps entry that oozes nostalgia and exudes genius. I'm not the best at reviewing games, but there are those hidden amongst Steam that I feel are too amazing not to promote... this is one of them.You play as agent JC Denton, a shiny new nano-augmented agent (successor to mechanically-augmented agents) in a counter-terrorist organization dubbed UNATCO. The secretive politicking and social banter you'll be exposed to can be overheard from enemies mid-conversation, read through security terminals throughout the gameworld, deluged via e-mails sent to your character (as well as other non-player characters, provided you can gain access to their accounts...) will influence how you want to play your character. Do you blindly obey the higher-ups in your organization, or lean toward the ideals of UNATCO's enemy--a 'terrorist' organization calling themselves the NSF.Between the conspiracy theories, feeding homeless kids for intel, jumping on rats, getting turnt on zyme, breaking into storage rooms for bags of soy nuts... there's intelligent humor and timeless music to help you immerse yourself in Ion Storm's take on a futuristic dystopian United States of America.OH AND NOT TO MENTION: REVISION. It's a breathtaking graphical overhaul of the game, provided as a free DLC through Steam. Deus Ex is given a facelift for the 21st century (which goes deeper than mere graphics, mind you) and you're also given the option to play the game with two of it's most famous mods-Biomod and Shifter.Again, I'm no good at reviewing but by all that is holy, you need to pick up this classic masterpiece in PC gaming. $1.74, I still can't believe it!!!Welcome to the coalition, JC.

												I'm not going to present the game and what it is about since you can easily read that anywhere else. Everyone knows Deus Ex. I don't expect this title to have any apeal to the early generations of gamer, but this game was praised by many for good reasons. Despite its old unreal engine, blocky designs and poor combat IA, the game shines through its brillant story telling, plot setting, lore, ambiance and RPG elements in a FPS. It's the achievement of people who worked on System Shock and Thief (also very inovative for their time) and you can feel they kept their personal touch in future titles like the Bioshock franchise and the latest Deus Ex titles.Heck, it even earned a meme of its own. ""Deus Ex: Everytime you mention it, someone will reinstall it."" .... well, back when memes were untaged and cool.			"

												“Without leaps of imagination or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities.” (Gloria Steinem)Nowadays, most games are well-polished updates of old games: Beautiful or retro graphics, good stories, new environments, well-rounded gameplay - but without new ideas, without invention, without creating anything of their own.Deus Ex was different.Its developers created something never seen before, something fresh, giving players a degree of freedom and choice in accomplishing their objectives that was unprecedented. They got the graphics, sound, story, and other elements on a par with or better than others at the time, but they did more than just that. The game did not fit into an existing genre, it defined its own, took that evolutionary leap into the unknown that has become so rare in the industry. By now, many other games have followed in its path. But Deus Ex was a groundbreaking title, it was the first of its kind. +1 for taking that leap:  11/10			"

												Deus Ex is showing its years, particularly in the graphics department, and I had an issue with the high-def mod I tried, in which everything else was fine but having water anywhere onscreen would slow everything to a crawl. But I'd still recommend the game. I already have three different character builds going, so I can try three different skill builds without knowing yet what I might need or not need later on in the game: a hacker, a sharpshooter, and a Thief-style lock-picking, head-bonking, hug-that-shadow-like-it's-his-girlfriend version. I'm pretty sure I'll be way past three before I'm done. I like the comments NPCs make, both idly and about some of the actions I take in the game. It's fun fluff. Also fun is that there are multiple ways to proceed to goals, and multiple ways to deal with trouble encountered in getting there. I've gone at the game stealth-knockout style, or guns blazing, or avoiding combat (or sneaky head-bonking) as much as possible, and all three ways were fun. There's occasionally things I wish I could try to do and can't-- like offer an NPC asking for thing A if thing B would be an acceptable alternative-- but there always will be.Speaking of that, let's talk nitpicks: I'm not a fan of the crouchwalking-to-sneak part, the sneaking part is fun, but the crouching feels awkward. The grid-style ""realistic space usage"" inventory (necessitating inventory-fussing to make a space of the right shape for an object I want to pick up) is as annoying as it always is, although not quite enough so to make me mod it out. I'm not crazy about the hack-o-meter countdown either. I was hoping there'd be some way for Denton to download the documents for a more convenient read, given that this takes place in a world in which cybernetics and nano-augmentation exist, but if there is one I haven't noticed. They don't seem to be showing up anywhere in the ingame logs the way conversations do, which seems a bit backwards to me.Well, as far as that last one goes, it is a game that was made before USB or wireless goodness existed... So, given that augs are a thing in Deus Ex and those things probably should be too, and that I was getting really annoyed by this nitpicky detail, I went to a game wiki for the text of documents I discovered while using the Hack skill. I now read them that way as I find them ingame, waiting until a point when ""Denton"" reasonably could stop and check out what he'd found, and it's much more fun now.Minor irritants aside, I'm having a lot of fun with Deus Ex, another title I didn't get to enjoy when it was released. Definitely better late than never.			"

												Alright I'm doing this for the steam awards thing, but I just want to say this is one of the coolest old games out there. Honestly, I was torn between nominating this or half life for the test of time award, but I decided to go with this. The story is fantastic, and the world is incredible. Lots of options in what you do. Really my only concerns are the game play (for example, shooting was a little messy) and the setup to get the game to work well, since it isn't great for today's systems. I can't remember the program you need to make it a bit better. Mouse acceleration was also a problem. If you'll excuse me, I have to go redownload this.			"

												Deus Ex: released Jun. 22, 2000A summary of gameplay: exploration and stealth (or combat if need be)To make it clear, this game, unlike its sequel is amazing, the world is filled with so many plot points (hidden away, to be discovered) and a large variation of approches for hostile territories. You never have a formal tutorial, but an optional and advised traing, which only covers basic mechanics, the rest is for the player to learn, wether that be ideal stealthy approches or how to survive a shootout. Overall, can't but keep my hands away from this game as it's always fresh every replay. Reccomended: YES!			"

												Great classic game with one of the best RPG elements.Its hard getting past the graphical difference but after immersing yourself for abit you'll just play on for hours.Great for any who likes the reboot Deus Ex series.			"

												When people say this is the greatest game of all time, they are telling the truth. I didn't think it was possible for a 16 year old game dubbed ""The Greatest"" by so many could possibly live up to the hype, or even hold up to modern standards.I was wrong.  It has aged very well (besides the graphics, but it is surprisingly compatable with modern systems). It has more substance than possibly any other game I have ever played, and it puts every modern AAA title to shame. You should at least attempt to play this game before you die.			"

												Even with all the new graphics and physics in the modern Deus Ex games, they still dont have the same atmosfear, conspiracy and story telling of this original game.This is a true classic game that everyone should own.			"

												This game is so '1999 conspiracy culture' that it somehow covered my wall in a corkboard with newspaper clippings connected by string, shortly before my door was kicked down by federal agents coming to tear it down.			"

												Even for an older game it holds up well. Not just for gameplay purporposes but for the relevence of the story that is being told. It is an amazing game that means even more in todays technological and political landscape.			"

												An RPG where you can affect outcomes through actual gameplay, not just the things you pick in dialogue menus. Levels always have multiple solutions and you're free to essentially do whatever you want. Lots of fun.			"

												One of the games that I remember most from my childhood, this game came out in 2000 and in my eyes is still one of the best games I have ever played. It has a dark feel to it with the MC in the shadow of worldwide conspiracy theories.			"

												I had difficulties playing this game the first time; getting used to the controls took a while but afterwards I started enjoying the story and freedom in terms of the options of how I could progress through missions.  I personally found the sidequests more entertaining than the main plot.  The only real downer would the rather lackluster ending.I would probably recommend playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution first to help newer player ease into this one.			"
