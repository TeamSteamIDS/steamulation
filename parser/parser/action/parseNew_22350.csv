												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL BETHESDA BRINGS BACK THE SERVERS ONLINE!!!It is a nice game with really new/fresh game play and style. I guess it is something like a breed of Mirror’s Edge and some fun/mediocre FPS with a quite big freedom/choice in classes and class creation. For the rest just check some youtube videos. What is annoying though is that Bethesda has SWITCHED OFF THE DEDICATED SERVERS, SO THE GAME NOW IS PLAYABLE JUST IN SINGLE PLAYER MOD!!!Please thumbs up this comment, so more people can see and do not spend their hard earned money on a false multiplayer advertised game and hopefully this will make Bethesda to put the servers online again, then I can highly recommend the game. Also be warned that Bethesda can do the same “trick” on any future multiplayer title in order to make you buy the next title eg. Dirty Bomb.   "

												This game came out 4 years ago and I still have not forgiven it for stealing 60 dollars from me. I have never since preordered a game. This game is merely a series of unfulfilled promises and unforgiveably poorly executed ideas. What could have been a truly amazing plot with an lovingly crafted aesthetic is instead a generic class based multiplayer shooter. Do not buy this game.			"

BRINK: Proving that great ideas don't always make great games.Despite this game being released 4 years ago, I picked it up and wanted to give it a shot. Lots of people were furious over this game and how disappointing it was. Lots of awesome trailers and mechanics to show off such as Brink's S.M.A.R.T. mechanic (Smooth Movement Around Rough Terrain) and dynamic objectives. Even as it is right now, I'm loving and hating this game.MULTIPLAYER:There are less than 20 players global. Unless you are lucky and get some friends to play with you, you won't get much fun out of this deserted game"" (That is if the game doesn't give you connectivity issues).Story:Well...there isn't exactly a story. The ""Singleplayer mode"" is just multiplayer maps with bots. However, I liked the setup for Brink. Humanity has fled to a manmade island called ""The Ark"". This island was able to renew resources and allow a safe last place for people to live in. ""Was"". The Ark is running low on resources and has lost communication from the outside world. Two factions: The Resistance (made up of refugees) and the Ark Security (basically the cops), are at a war. The resistance wants to escape the Ark while Security is trying to save it. Besides a short one minute cutscene at the beginning of every mission with some interaction between characters, that's as much as you will get storywise. Gameplay:I'm guessing the developers made the AI ""dumb"" so that in multiplayer, the AI would not be able to ""play the game for you"" (similar to the bots in Titanfall that don't alter the gameplay much).However, the singleplayer mode is going to torture you. The AI will constantly go for the secondary objectives such as taking command posts (you will hear them chatting about this A LOT) and build turrets near your spawn. Medics will still revive you, but that's even if they don't get swarmed by three enemies. It doesn't help that the enemy AI seems to be much smarter than your team AI. Also, the difficulty of the AI scales to your level so playing a hard mission at Level 1 is just as challenging as playing an easy mission at Level 10.Gunplay...well, it plays like your typical modern shooter. You have 4 classes: Assault, Medic, Engineer, and Operative (Like the spy from Team Fortress 2). There are 3 body types: Light (moves the fastest), Medium, and Heavy (Terrible because you gain only an additional 40 health and you can barely move as fast).Level design isn't helping Brink much either. Levels will either end with stalemates or they are extremely one sided. Take the mission ""Early Launch"" for example. On the security side, it might be a bit hard to repair the crane controls at first, but eventually, when you have to hack the missile controls, its ridiculous. Why? Because the Resistance spawn point is RIGHT IN FRONT of the objectives and the security spawn is all the way at the other end of the map. It also doesn't help when you have the AI as I described above.Customization:Alright, I can at least give some props to the design team. I really liked the customization options for styling your character, even if you rarely look at characters in game. You could get tattoos, change color of your clothes...and that's probably it.Weapon customization is a bit nice. You can customize sights, barrel attachments such as grenade launchers and bayonets, and different sizes of magazines.Graphics:A smooth art style with ""unique"" character design. Backgrounds would look nice if they weren't so low res. Otherwise, the art style is similar to games like Team Fortress 2 and RAGE.Sound:The only reason I wanted to give Brink a shot was because I found a Youtube playlist with game soundtracks and Brink's main theme was playing. While many FPS games have fast adrenaline pumping music, Brink's OST is calm and ambient. Weapon sounds aren't much, they are self explanatory.Should you get Brink?Unless you are like me and you want to experience what a game that was supposed to compete with TF2 should have been, then buy it. The Agents of Change DLC may give you an extra hour or two of funtime. Otherwise, I would not recommend buying Brink. Not even during a sale.			"

												Alright, let's put aside the hate and generalized distaste for this game and actually break it down into something that may be worth your time. Now, to start out, I would like to say that I pre-ordered this game the day I heard about it and the day the developers released a video on  the vaulting mechanics. I played the crap out of this game for a while and I didn't care what other people thought (partly because I didn't know people hated it until long after I defeated the game and unlocked all of the guns, outfits, and most of the skills/attachments). Truly, this game is a lot of fun. Think of this game as a really watered down version of TF2 with classes such as the Engineer or Operator (hacker, etc.) that can be switched around with others on the fly. The gun play may not be the best but it really is fun when you start leveling your character and unlocking stuff. Attachments help a lot and skills do as well such as having third person when interacting with the objectives in-game. -(Note that I am writing this review years after I stopped playing)-.The story is something that I felt like was just a filler for the story missions, in the beginning, but as you progress that slowly changes. Throughout the game you can find dialogues and journal entries that really add to the game's back-story and adds some real character that would have been otherwise unkown in-game. The end mission is really intense and a lot of fun whether or not you win or not. The game sets itself up for a sequel, but it looks like it may never happen in the near future. Truly, this game had a lot of heart and some pretty good art-design with some great back-story that would have made this game a real hit. Game mechanic choices and poor decisions really watered this game down to the point where no one likes it but the selective few like myself. In reality, I am writing this review out of nostalgia out of the lots of fun I had with this game. Pick it up if you would like sometime soon, fairly small and can be run pretty easily with any system. I would suggest getting it on sale because it may not be worth the full price. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.			"

												This is probably one of the most underrated games of the 21st century. I picked it up back on the PS3 originally, and despite it's flaws at launch such as mediocre AI and minor lag, (issues that were improved later into the games life) it was an absolute blast to play. The varying levels of customization were great, spanning all the way from weapons to the character itself. Not only that, but all the maps played well and looked absoulutely georgeous. The gameplay was a refreshing change to what you experienced in most FPS games at the time, with fun and flamboyant free running moves that not only looked great but were simple to execute. However, because Brink was developed by 'Splash Damage' and not 'Infinity Ward' websites such as IGN and Gamespot gave it a 6, slamming the game for it's poor AI and repetition. Sure I'd accept that if this was a game that based itself around singleplayer rather than multiplayer gameplay, but marking it down for repetition when video games such as Modern Warfare 2 get given 9's is ridiculous.At the end of the day, this was a game that had it's head put on the block before it even got released. Sure, it's far from perfect, but it's as good as your going to get if your looking for a multiplayer FPS that's a little different from the norm.			"

												I loved Brink. Back in 2011 Brink brought some fresh air in the multiplayer FPS community. It required a lot of teamplay and skills related to movement & aim. Brink is different because of its many different game modes, a highly customizable character (skins & guns) and the way each mission is going on (meaning in 1 mp game you can be required to set up a charge & escort a vip..) I'm more than ok graphically if you can withstand the futuristic theme. The solo is awful and more like a training for the multiplayer. It's also one of the first (the first?) to bring the ""parkour""movement style you can find later in Battlefield 3.BUTI played Brink as much as i could and in my gamer's life, Brink is the only game i had to stop because no one was playing anymore. It's unfair because this game is still really great...With a tear in the eye, do not buy this game...			"

												I've been following the game since it was announced, but after the countless reviews and opinions bashing it after it came out, i decided to drop the hype.Years later, i came across BRINK on sale for $4,99 and said ""Why not?"" Even if i heard bad things about it, i still wanted to at least try it.Dropped expectations, launched the game, played for a while and... I liked it!While i understand some people's frustration, i dont think the game deserves the bashing it got.TL;DR: At full price, it's a risky buy, but if you get it on sale, give it a try, its not as bad as the reviews make it look like, it's actually enjoyable and fun.

Posted: June 30, 2015
												So, not too long ago I made a review on Dirty Bomb, a game made by the same Devs that made Brink, and that got me thinking... Why I never made a Brink Review? Well, not anymore. As usual, I'll start with the BAD details of the game, then switch to the good ones:First and foremost, the game is stupidly short. Well, more like the devs were lazy. Both stories use the same maps, and there's like only 8 or 10 of them. While the story is well voice-acted, you don't even get to know ANYTHING about the characters or factions. It just feels like the game was supposed to be twice as big and they ran out of time.Second, when it came out, lag was an insane pain in the balls. I haven't played in years, but lag can still be found at times.Third issue it has, is the redundancy of the classes. There's 4 classes, they all use the same guns, only difference is the special equipment. That's dumb, specially when the game was SO based in Team Fortress 2. Funny thing is, Dirty Bomb, the ""spiritual succesor"" of the game, felt into the same God-damn mistake, and it failed even harder by blocking most of the game behind pay-walls.Lastly, another big issue the game had is how fast the Devs ditched it. I mean, yeah, it was a gigantic failure at release, but it had potential. Why not just stick to it and FIX IT, instead of just comming back a ton of years later to commit the same mistakes? Specially when they could have just made Free-DLC's that fix the game, and keep releasing new content by Standard DLC's.Now, the good stuff. Is the gameplay FUN? When you get over the dumb classes, IT IS! I mean yeah, nobody uses Heavy characters because movement is key, but fast characters are just fun to play with. You can move arround the map freely and it was the thing that got me attracted to the game. Quite ironic that the best thing the game had, didn't came back for Dirty Bomb.Another thing that's quite fun, is the variety of weapons: and not only weapons, but accesories for them. Like to make as less noise as possible, or to just spray bullets? You can pick most weapons and make those changes work. Ironically enough, this wasn't in Dirty Bomb as well, something that blows.Something that was also quite interesting was the customization. An insane amout of items to pick up for your avatar, making everyone look diferent on the battlefield, like in TF2 but with less flaming hats. And would you guess? Also not on Dirty Bomb.Quite frankly, I gave that game a ""Not recommend"", and I'm going to do the reverse here. I feel like Blink, while a mediocre game, is way better than it's EVEN MORE MEDIOCRE Pay-to-play-Cash-Grab succesor. Does that mean that you should just go right ahead and buy it? No. Wait for a sale, pick it up with friends. You will all have fun and a good time playing together. Playing it alone is kind of dumb, and you'll just do better by downloading and playing Team Fortress 2.			"

												A game that I hyped up to all my friends for several months prior to release.  They got a lot of things right.  They certainly had the e-sports scene covered with a well polished interface and flawless steam integration.  However, the gameplay itself was lacking.  Certain aspects of the game seemed more like a chore than enjoyment.  For example, all of the classes required you to be right next to your teamate in order to heal them or provide them additional ammo.  This is a problem when everyone is running all over the place in a combat situation.  Battlefield's approach of simply dropping a medkit container or ammo supply box was much more enjoyable.  The weapons were uninteresting and the pace of the game was far too slow to really capture anyones attention.			"

												Brink was promised to be the next big thing of the FPS genre and Bethesda's legendary smash hit.  Unfortunately it was far too rushed so the developers could meet corporate deadlines, meaning it couldn't possibly deliver everything that it had promised, and what we did get wasn't optimized very well. The result was extremely underwheming gameplay. By the time they got around to fixing these problems, the vast majority of the playerbase abandoned it and didn't come back.  Huge shame too, considering the amount of potential Brink had to be one of the best games ever, and I preordered it because I thought it was going to be just that.The dedicated online multiplayer servers are long gone, so there's really not much reason to recommend this one anymore. Unless you like playing by yourself on singleplayer with bots.			"

												If you enjoy team gameplay like Team Fortress 2, I suggest buying Brink. Brink is a FPS game with team-oriented gameplay mechanics with medics, soldiers, engineers, and assassins. Medics can revive team members, give accelerated healing abilities to other team members, and has specified special skills and abilities. Soldiers can give ammo and can unlock grenades. Engineers are like the engineers in TF2 where they can set up sentry guns. Not only that, they can give upgraded ammo or armor to teammates and they can also drop mines. To add to that, the members all have different tasks to do such as planting C4 to blow up bridges or walls preventing escape, hacking into systems to complete tasks, and more. The ""new"" Call of Duty Ghosts fuction of running and then sliding was already utilized in this game where you can slide by pressing the hotkey. Sliding can also knock down enemies so you can kill them without them shooting back. Weapons are customizable and you can unlock some other weapons through mini-games. Depending on the size of the character you chose, you can parkour through maps, jumping off the walls and whatnot. The only unfortunate aspect of this game is that the multiplayer is dead. I hope that my review will cause a few of you to buy this game or to take another look at this game in your library and revitalize this great game.			"

												I'm going to give this a negative review because I think it deserves it, but christ, you want to talk about guilty pleasures? I really enjoy Brink as a game, even though there's a LOT wrong with it, but for some reason I still go back to it. That being said, I understand why a lot of people really hate this game.I wasn't part of the hype train for Brink when it came out. Brink was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pushed to the moon with hype, which rasied people's expectations to fatal levels. Brink tried really hard to advertise itself as a competitor to Team Fortress 2, which is not only suicide, but also a really dumb idea. If they had just changed any mention of ""Class"" to ""Combat Role"". Also, you can probably find multiple reviews saying how terrible the ♥♥♥♥ing missile hacking mission for the Secutiry is, how the Engineer is the most overpowered combat role, or even how flimsy the connecting narritive between the missions is.There are pretty much no active servers. I'm the pleb loner who's okay with playing with bots, but if you're not that interested in that, thenThe singleplayer is locked to 30FPS. It's only the singleplayer, too. If I locally host a server using the Dedicated Server Tool it runs great. As long as you know what you're doing you should be fine.The biggest thing I'll praise about this game is the sound direction. It's fantastic. I can't name a lot of other games that have more satisfying gunshots or explosions. It sounds so good!The game's theme that plays thoughout the game it also an earworm of a jingle, too. Good luck getting it out of your head.The character customization and art direction is also great. I enjoy the odd valley between realistic and cel-shaded. It almost looks like it's a rotoscope. I could fill all ten character slots you're given and come up with awesome mix-and-match designs for people. Even though you won't see it yourself most of the time unless someone disguises as you, I still enjoy it.The line ""Mucho bad guys spotted!"" - It's so good. It's so bad. I love it.I don't reccomend buying this game. I'm a weird extreme case where I have stockholm syndrome or something.			"

												There was so much false advertising behind this game.It is a miracle, AN ACTUAL MIRACLE, that Splash Damage/Bethesda managed to come out of this one without a lawsuit. Would not recommend.There's a lesson to be learned from this whole ordeal, though: That Bethesda's publishing division are MASSIVE SCUMBAGS (There's tonnes of evidence of this online) and you shouldn't give into the hype for any Bethesda-published game before it's released and reviewed by people that aren't paid-off journalists.I rate this game 1 out of 5 boring chokepoints.

												The game itself is a great concept, but I have to give this game a negative review, because the AI for your teammates is terrible, and finding a game with actual players that are in the same spot of the game as you, or even getting players to join your game, is next to impossible. I recommend buying this only if you have a group of pals to play with. If your friends don't own this game, you're gonna have a bad time.			"

												Old game, old review.I actually quite like the game. The story isn't fantastic nor is a lot of things but I don't tend to notice them half the time. I only ever played with Bots because I'd imagine not many servers would be up and I don't know many people who would be up for it. Either case,Weapons. Most of the suck. Yet it got me excited when I found a combo that actually worked. Using certain attachments allowing some to shine just a little bit to be worthwhile. Unlike most where it just didn't freaking matter. Nothing was class locked but rather weight locked. Honestly made more sense this way. Same goes for actual survivability but locking down what you can and can't do with agility actions. Common sense. For a time a lot of games just class locked weapons and weights to make it difficult to play in the style that you would like. I certainly liked being a big fat guy with a chaingun throwing revive syringes at people. Also, syringes? I don't know many people who like needles and know less that would be content in jabbing themselves with a needle that may or may not be unclean. Particularly if you are Resistance.The two sides, well. I liked the Resistance far more. Disregarding how flawed the story is for both sides and the reason there has been fighting I preferred the Resistance for their badass punk style. Both sides got their 'creepy' costumes but I always went with the badass look of the Resistance. Their music was also significantly better than Security. A sense of desperation and despair with a lot of hatred. Security was just, meh. In fact Security is really nothing special. They have some sweet clothing but out of the available 'stories' they were the worst. Most bland and only partially relatable. Whenever I heard conversations about Brink I've always heard (aside from dead game, glitchy and boring) was that Resistance were cool and relatable and Security sucked♥♥♥♥♥♥Most of the maps are terrible. When fighting against AI you just hope the enemy screws up or your team actually does something useful. I will give the game credit where it is due, the AI will at least do objectives. Unlike most co-op games where they expect you, the player, to do EVERYTHING to wiping their♥♥♥♥♥for them. But boy do most of the maps suck. Only Container City really stuck for me. Because on either side it is fun. It is the most memorial out of the maps for me at least.I wished the game did better, that the Devs had stuck to it making the changes it solely needed. It was just forgotten tragicly by players and the developers all the same. BRINK wasn't on the brink of death when it released or when the Devs stopped caring. It died before they even committed to not giving a ♥♥♥♥. I still like it and I still recommend it because it is good at the things it can do.			"

												Well, Game went Dead quite fast, and Promised more than it could hold, but it is a solid game, not good, but not terribly bad.there are 4 classes, and while everyone has it own set of skills, you can play like you want, you can be a skinny soldier who runs aross the map like the TF2 scout giving ammo to everyone, a heavy spy with a minigun who disguises himself as an enemy, or just a averagely bulid medic with a shotgun,  and you got quite a nice collection of cloths, so you can make your own unique character, may it be a street-cop, an engineer, or a heavy SWAT-Like Unit,and color the uniform how you want, as i said, your own unique character,you can also mod your weapons, give your gun a silencer, a scope, a knife (requires the agents of change dlc) a bigger ammo Magazine. so it fits your style.maps arent many there only eight (10 with the agents of chance dlc) but depending on wich site you are on you got a diffrent objective, so you have to Escort a person as security while you have to stop the same person as resistance, Or you Need to hack a terminal as Resistance, while security has to defend the Terminal, lets say the Resistance hacked the Terminal sucsessfully, the next mission could then be a Round of Capture the Flag,  in most cases is the attacking side with the various objectives, while the defender...well...defend till time runs outgraphic is a strange mix between cartoon and realistic, the faces have a slight cartoon look, with a realistic graphic over it, and the game world in general is colorfull and not brown everywhere (just like the devs wanted it, a colorfull shooter)story is Great Imo, in short, the sea level rise and million people needed to go to the so called ark, a swimming city, somewhere in the sea, but after years the place falls apart, with two sites, the slums where the Guests live and want a better life, not only because everything rusts and falls apart under thier♥♥♥♥♥♥ but they also belive that the Founders are Facists who only care about themselfs, they also do all the maintence, and the still rather clean part of the ark with the founders, who are annoyed of the guests constanst attacks and complains and belive the guests ""invaded"" the ark in the first place, as it wasnt planned that they live here.also, depending on wich side and mission you are on, your handler and boss of your organisation tells you a diffrent story than the other, so while the boss of the police tells you that you need a rescue a man who has a venom injected by the resistance, and dies in the next hour, the resistance leader tells you in the loading screen that the security will torture the man if they catch him.the Computer characters are smarter then they seem, so you don't need to do all the work yourself, the cpu's are smart enough to do main missions themselfs and depending on on wich difficulty you play, they almost seem like a human player, and WILL knock you out  when you fall on the ground if you play on hard or reach a certain level on easy, however, sometimes one side of the CPU can become braindead and the other Hyper-Intelligent.Skills are shattered around the levels, you need a certain level to gain skill points and ranks to purchase the skills, like reloading while running, 3rd person perspective with rotatable camera when using something, or have class relevant skills, like the soldiers flashbang, or the engineers sentry.Overall i would rate this game around 7/10   it had good looks, but promised more then it could hold and therefore fell flat on its face, but it is still a Solid and nice shooter who can make your weekend if you let it			"

												This is unfortunately, a disaster-piece wrapped up in a package that really destroyed my hope for this game when I received it. I found myself... forcing myself to have fun playing it - and a game shouldn't make anyone do that. I played through both of the very underwhelming ""campaigns"" that are mostly the same levels just on the opposite teams with a friend. That's what made it and any other less-than-acceptable game fun. Playing with a friend. It has it's great moments and the music is STELLAR. I regularly listen to parts of the OST while doing other things, or playing other games. The atmosphere is wonderful, and the story is pretty engaging at first.Then, there's the gameplay and the AI. In the beginning, it's not so bad. Wow, I can do parkour as a light class, this is awesome! Oh, I'm dead already - OK, let's try a medium class. Okay... let's try a heavy class. It comes down to what's right for the moment, which is a good thing. But your impact on the level you're currently playing is totally underwhelming and there are a lot of really cheesy actions you can perform that don't encourage strategy and counter-play.Online, netcode is downright appalling. This -could- have been fixed since I played last, but it doesn't appear to be. Players constantly rubber-banding and shifting around, suddenly finding yourself dead frequently without being able to determine where you could improve your own gameplay is an atrocity.Simply, it WASN'T fun. What was fun, was hanging out with a friend and playing the game. Even with games that are intentionally satirical and are at their core dismal are similar experiences to this so long as you're playing with a friend.			"

												This game is fantastic.  Did I expect it to have a call of duty-style campaign? No because I'm not an idiot.  I know that isn't what was shown in trailers and that Splash Damage (the developers) were obviously making a 3rd Enemy Territory game.  It's also fantastic that this game has GOOD BOTS since I always play the games I want instead of whatever anyone else is playing.  Servers don't matter, good gameplay does, and this has it.  I knew what I was getting when I got BRINK and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.I remember dreaming of putting call of duty 4's shooting into TF2 as well as wishing that Mirror's Edge-style parkour could be added to many more first-person games.  BRINK made that dream come true and it has been everything I hoped it would be since I bought it on launch for the PS3 so long ago.  Unfortunate things happened to my PS3 and that version of BRINK.  So glad to have it back on steam now.When BRINK came out, the gameplay was focused on solving common problems in FPS games at the time.  It competely succeeded.  For example, grenades can't be spammed randomly to get easy kills, they do lighter damage and knock the target over.  The weapons as well were well-balanced from launch and no gun was obviously dominante like happened in so many shooters and still does.  As for game structure, they use Enemy Territory's fantastic assault-style game mode wherein you accomplish one objective after another.  One team attacks, one team defends in a dichotomy that I prefer over any other game mode.  A feeling of progress, unique perspective for each team, and varied objectives are why this is my favorite game mode.  If only more competitve shooters used this mode (I call it ""Assault"" mode because of my experience with the original Unreal Tournament)The aesthetic is gorgeous.  Every tattoo you can get, face, everything.  I just love it.  It is a personal taste, yes, but works of art never get old.  It is all about what you love.  There's certainly nothing wrong with the smooth aesthetic that BRINK has.  The hyperealistic style was a great idea, and the customizations are there to make it perfect.  The gun designs, character designs, maps; they all come together beautifully.  BRINK is a lovely game to look at.  I focus on art style over graphical detail yet BRINK has both.The only legitimate complaint that I see with BRINK is that it feels a bit slow.  Not slow as a slug though, so it's easy to manage.  The game is fantastic.EDIT : Forgot to mention that it WILL freeze if you have a weak cpu.  Sometimes when it loads tons of data at once (like on character customization aspects).  Strong computers need not fear.			"

												BRINK! Yeeeeah! O_:_O● Finally, a shooter that focus' more on TEAMWORK than actual K/D ratios! This will finally weed out the whiny COD players and leave true gamers to have some fun with a game thats been designed very artistically. For starters it turns people off camping and gets them doing useful things instead, like actually taking objectives and so on.● The SMART system is probably the best thing to happen to games yet. I'm sick and tired of getting stuck on invisible ground objects in other games. ● The art style of this game is extremely well done! There's post-processing done to the entire game, so you get colorful blue/orange tones depending where you are and what map. ● Online multiplayer with skilled players or Competitive play is where its at in this game. If you have friends, its much better to go VOIP and carry out objectives. ● Recommend this for people wanting a new specific type of gameplay!!!___Croatian_________***Fantastična igra, obavezno je uzmite na nekom od popusta. Dobro se pripremite za igru, tu se ne radi samo o pucanju, taktika i snalaženje su najbitniji. Igra je za probrane sladokusce FPS - taktičko - objektnog žanra, budite i vi jedan od njih.... ;)			"

												I noticed that many reviewers that are on the front page have very few hours with this gem.  It is amazingly fun after a few unlocks.. granted MP is probably completely dead, but as a SP focused player (I mean if I wanted human interaction I'd go outside.. or at least play an MMO) The bots do pretty good.   Pros:Upgrade your Char! Want to run up the side of walls and be a slippery ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is fast? Go light frame. Want to carry the big guns and wreck? Be a Heavy!Upgrade your weapons! Want to reload fast? tape a mag together... want to just spray rounds? Get a drum.It's basically TF2 but gritty and messy, with about as much story. (Yeah like barely any)Cons:Basically neutered by the devs prior to launch.  Abandoned. Completely.Over all?  A fun Team based FPS that has some unique art, and (For the time) ground breaking departures from accepted games of its class..			"

												Hyped up to be the next blockbuster hit from Bethesda, I, alongside many others made the most unfortunate decision to pre-order...and play this game with high hopes. The game is a disaster. The singleplayer is a madhouse driven by mentally-ill friendly AI characters, a disgustingly bad storyline, and some trippy, forgettable- and once again frustrating combat scenarios. The multiplayer is dominated by inhuman monks programmed to play the game, bash your face in, and then♥♥♥♥♥♥on your remains. The game is so bad, it's painful to talk about. It goes down as probably the most disappointing game I have ever played.Other than that, it was good.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Brink had a lot of good things going for it. A cool art style, tons of weapons and customization, team-based objectives, mirror's edge movement and was made by the developers of Quake Wars, which was great. Unfortunately, this one isn't.Gameplay, It has the things announced, half-baked but it all feels half-baked. Yes, you can run over obstacles with ease, you can slide and shoot..but just doesn't feel that special or interesting.Objectives are also repeated way too often and are boring to boot, and the SP is a joke. It's just the MP modes against bots, and the AI is terrible.buy it if you are tired of CoD and wants something with a little more structure (but only a little), otherwise, wait for BF 3 or play Bad Company 2 till then.In general, I always thought that the future of shooters started with Battlefield Bad Company 2 and it will probably end with BF3.

												My first official steam game, back in 2011 I decided to stop pirating stuff like cs and move onto steam, I thought this game would be a whole lot of fun but it is the first step that is troublesome:+Visuals: Back in 5 years ago this game had great graphics, it was kind of fun to play.+Sound work: Nice OST, nice gun sounds, this part is well done as well.-Gameplay: the game itself is a disaster -the main promised feature, the core of this game - parkour - is total bullsh`t, you can only *jump* and *wall run* in some areas that actually meant to be passed that way, and not all the classes can do that stuff, you know even BATTLEFIELD 3 has that kind of *parkour* and that is just sad -no class balance and rеtаrded AI - you can stay in the middle of the hallway with machine gun shooting in the one point and bots will suicide running towards you. -no map balance - most of the maps are one sided, you need a miracle to win for the weak side, or you enemies should be brain damaged. -boring campaign, If i want to play PvE vs bots I better choose StarWars battlefront, and PVP in this game is non-existent, dead multiplayer + lame campaign.-no steam cardsSo what do we have after all: stillborn game, dead multiplayer, a lot of promises that were never implemented + this game was nearly instantly dead, for the 6 years this game got a maximum discount of 50% ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ this game is bad and abandoned by the devs long time ago.

That is all there is to say really, the style of game is a nice change away from the ""modern soldier"" or ""future soldier"" style FPS that seems to plague the market these days.

It corrected a poor habit of mine while it was still in its infancy.  That habit was blind publisher loyalty.  When I first came across Brink, I wanted to like it.  I really did.  I was immediately interested in its art style, and the Bethesda logo in the corner of the box assured me of its unquestionable quality.  How wrong I was, and how very much I overpaid that day, I cannot stress enough.  As a competitive first-person shooter, Brink has a lot of competition on today’s market, and yet it just feels like the developers haven’t picked one up in the last ten years.  Case in point: Brink sports no campaign to speak of.  The single-player mode, guided by a sheer-thin veneer of a narrative, is just a string of multiplayer maps in which players’ squadmates are A.I.s with about as much tactical sense as a rabid honey badger.   Multiplayer itself is stiflingly limited in terms of map variety, arena size, and weapon options, and many of the maps are rife with arbitrary choke-points that fatally cut down on the pace and entertainment value of gameplay.  Avatar and weapon customization is a welcome feature, and the options available do allow for some unique and inventive character designs, but the decision to require unlocks and temporary in-game purchases for rather basic customization options, like body types, smacks as a bit counter-productive to players finding their niche early on. The total lack of female avatar options at all is equally disappointing.  There are female gamers out there, Splash Damage, and they don’t always want a mountain of armored flesh for an avatar.  Perhaps most disappointing of all, the parkour elements that seem to have been such an integral part of the game’s concept are clunky at best, and a tacked-on gimmick the rest of the time.  Mirror’s Edge this ain’t, as it’s often difficult to tell which surfaces a player can vault over, which ledges one can grab onto, and why one shouldn’t just take cover and use some tactical sense rather than running into the open to charge enemies armed with assault rifles and shotguns.  There’s just no incentive the put it to use the vast majority of the time.  Wrapping up, Brink is visually pretty average.  Personally, I found its art style to be quite inspired and rather reminiscent of the modernistic, tagger-culture influenced, Marc Ecko’s getting up, but that’s just my personal taste, and will not factor into the game’s rating. The score and sound effects are par for the course, but ultimately forgettable, and its mechanics just fall short of their intended mark.  Most damning of all is the fact that there are now multiple free-to-play shooters on the market that outclass Brink in every way.  Blacklight:Retribution, Team Fortress 2, and APB Reloaded, just to name a few, are all superior titles that come with a zero dollar price tag, casting Brink’s sixty-dollar launch-mark in a pretty grim light.

												People always say ""Dirty Bomb is what Brink should have been"". I say, ""What the hell does that mean?"" Brink is an excellent overall game. Combat mechanics work great. Game has good character customization (a must). Both Security and Resistance have their strong points (Security has the better theme, for example). Decent variety of weapons, and good customization options. Story is a little short, but out of all the good things about this game, that is a relatively small issue.  8.9/10			"

												I actually really liked this game. It did a lot of really cool things at the time, but it was tragically killed by two major problems.1) It didn't run very smoothly at launch2) the devs were VERY slow with patches and other content, so for a long while there really wasn't all that much to do.I enjoyed this game a lot when it came out, and it showed a ton of potential, so it pains me to not be able to recommend this game to others since it's essentiallly dead.Great idea. Mediocre initial execution. TERRIBLE follow-through. I stilll loved it.			"

												The most underrated game of it's year. Yaaay!If you thought that every game is another CoD or BF, and you cannot tell the differnce between them anyway, Brink was a game for you. Focusing heavly on team play and cooperration, ""where everyone does have a place, regardles as how good he is in FPS"", and with awseome art style (at least for me), it based on assumption that gamers want something new, that they are tired of the same stuff every year. Well, gues what? Gamers wanted another CoD.Today the game is dead, but FPS parkour is pretty much alive... in another CoD.			"

												So I got brink for the console so thats why i don't have much play time on PC, but I have recently purchased it from♥♥♥♥♥for Just £2!So BRINK is a game, which you would love for a very long time IF you played it on release because now it's useless apart from singleplayer because no one plays it & people have said the servers are shut down.In my eyes, BRINK for the price of £2 from♥♥♥♥♥is an amazing price, but from the steam store for £10 is a no go and I will tell you this now.Brink is one of those games you'll love for a very long time, so that includes the concept, the gameplay and the execution from the day release & I think the developers done a great job of that, BUT didn't do one of the things I said and that is 'execution'. The reason for that is because most of the content and the hype towards this game before it was released wasn't really included and also the game will get boring when you play the online and offline.Luckily, for me, when I played it on console for £20, I played offline and probably will have as much enjoyment as I did when playing it online.So in my opinion this game is reccomended if you have the spare time. I loved this game and played hours and hours of it when it first came out, but now it's useless so if you would play this game, i suggest buying it from♥♥♥♥♥and also prepare to only play singleplayer.I love this game though. One of my favourites.			"

												I ""Recommend"" this game because it has most of the elements to made an epic game, but since the community is longer-dead than the Spartans, and since you can only have so much fun with the AI, I'd only recommend it if you have a group of, say, 12+ friends or so. Then it could be AWESOME. :DThe best part of it all is the customization of characters, and the fact that your body size affects the parkour you can do, as well as the weapons you can carry. Customization is pretty fun in Brink.But it falls short of what it was supposed to be. Maybe it was epic and super populated back when it first came out. I dunno. I bought it last year on sale, so I must have missed the hayday. But you'd think a game like this would have a following for years to come. :-/I LOVE YOU, BRINK!!!

												i have to say this game is very very fun i mean the combat is amazing,the motion is sick and the teambased objectives make you realy work with your team, now realy there is no story to the game your just that one guy with the other guys trying to attack or defend againts the other guys, now there are 2 factions the resistance  withc wants to escape the ark  and the securety withc want to save the ark the problem i had with the game was where are the civilians the game focuses on this story that we dont know where there is a civil war but we never see civilians only in escort missions and thta kind of bugged me there isnta loss or somthing like a mission to protect civilians but over all the customization is awesome you can customize alot and the game has this army of darknes feeling to it over all score a 8/10 i would give it a 9 if for not the stupid AI and repetetive escort missions .

												2011 was a game of big releases, we can all agree on that...Skyrim, Arkham City, Fallout New Vegas DLC's, Portal 2, MW3, Battlefield 3, Gears of War 3, Serious Sam 3, FEAR 3, something that ends with a 3, etc.But no other game, NO OTHER! Got my attention as much as BRINK, BRINK had my highest expectations of 2011, more than skyrim, Arkham City, Portal 2 or any other game.Did it meet the hype? Sadly, no...maybe I hyped it too much, but many people have the same feeling as me.Starting with the graphics, they are not groundbreaking, but not bad either, ok-ish I would say, however it has pretty slow texture pop-ins...The game also feels to be poorly optimized and console ported (you can't lower teh shadows more than normal, and besides that there aren't all that many options besides texture quality and V-Sync. So, if you have a crappy computer, you're screwed!).Moving to the gameplay, it's what somewhat saves the game, your character flows really nicely thanks to SMART (Smooth Movement Across Round Terrain, I think it stands for...) and teamwork is a very important aspect focused in this game, so there wont be any Lone Wolf crap here (I mean there can be if a noob enters, but he will get totally owned...). Sadly, the guns lack punch, only some assault rifles and shotguns and pistols, SMG's feel terrible and they have like a F2P-like handling (watermelon seed shooter).A good thing about the game is the customization: It's enormous, absolutely HUGE! It's impossible for 2 people to have 2 characters look the same. It's very deep! Both the character and weapon customization.The game also features a class based system, assault, medic, etc. There is even the secret ops guy or whatever the name is (which is like the spy from TF2, can sap and hack stuff and disguise as an enemy. Except BRINK, unlike TF2, requires skill...). It's varied and VERY interesting.Audio quality is pretty good, surprisingly (not the guns, btw), your movement, jumping, the effect sounds, etc. All are really well done.Map layout and level design is absolutely phenomenal! It has many twists and encourages tactics, like ascend to higher places or flanking, as it's very team and objective focused!The word of the day for BRINK is definately: Potential! Potential! Potential!Sadly it's just the potential. If Bethesda gets their thumbs off their asses and stop supporting Skyrim and start growing balls and investing in BRINK, I would be very pleased, but more careful, after all, I paid 50 euros for this game to get 80 minutes out of it. -.-But before BRINK 2 or something along those lines, I'm still waiting for FALLOUT 4! HUH?! Oh sorry Bethesda, I forgot it's your money-bath time...Anyways, I wont give a score. get under 9,99€ anything equal or under that is worth it! Beware, this game isn't bad! It's a colossal disappointment, it's different. If the expectation were much lower, this game would be GOOD! But all that hype not met...it's disappointing and it saddens me. A lot...			"

The weapons are bland, the variation is really just clip size, and the classes are meaningless.

The game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess that I felt really bad for recommending my friends check out, because some of them preordered and started to send me hate mail.My favorite part of this game is that when you compared what they said the game was going to do in the hype and what they actually delivered it made me nostalgic for the late 90s early 00s level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t coming out of E3.

												I know this game gets a bad rep and I totally agree with most of the criticism this game has received.

I will say, however, that it is a really fun game with fantastic mechanics that just happened to have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""multiplayer campaign"" kind of like titanfall, which also got a bad rep. With the current price drop on steam from 20 to 10 dollars I think that it's worth it to buy brink, especially if it's on sale.

												I spent so many hours on my PotatoStation 3 playing this game.And, it's still better then CoD:Ghosts.10/10.But no seriously, this game is amazing. I saw it on steam and I said to myself ""I remember playing this on PS3, and knowing how much better the experience can be on PC, why not try it?""I was not disappointed, at all. The graphics are pretty decent for this time if you crank 'em up and turn off motion blur.Gameplay is phenomenal, despite the dead community.Audio, fantastic. I love the menu music. Sometimes I'll just sit there and listen to it, no kidding.The story may not be the greatest, but it introduces some original and interesting concepts, such as the ark,etc.Ratings breakdownGraphics: 4/5Gameplay: 4.5/5Audio: 5/5Story: 3.7/5Overall I rate this game 8.6/10, I actually added up my individual ratings above. My only gripe with this game other then the dead community is the story. IT WAS TOO DAMN SHORT. I loved the story, it could be better, yes, but it had potential, like a metric butt ton of it. If they ever release a sequel to this game (which is doubtful) I would buy it. Despite the graveyard of a community this game is still a blast to play offline or with a few friends. This game (In My Opinion) was under rated. This is one of the best FPS games I have ever played and it will be that way for a while.As I said, if you have a couple friends and are looking for something to do, consider picking this up. As a hardcore FPS? Eh, not so much, mainly because of dead community. (Which by now I've said ~5 times).Anyways, thank you for reading my review. Oh, and sorry if there's any spelling errors. Feel free to make fun of me or w/e you do to people who spell stuff wrong.I DO REALIZE MY REVIEW MIGHT BE ALL OVER THE PLACE. I'm sorry, I really am, I tried to organize it the best I could.			"

												Brink. A game that was unfinished. some of the mechanics are a bit clunky and the delay on some actions is frustrating but some parts of Brink are quite fun such as the class based team objective based shooter but the things which hint towards to game being unfinished is that the freeplay missions are the same as the campaign but with your choice of settings. one of the things they have dont quite well is the customisation. for example i could have a assult rifle with an acog scope, extended mags, fore grip and muzzle break and the character customisation is also quite nice and again for example i could have a security guy soldier with a demolistion suit. over all i do recommend it but i wouldnt spend lots of money on it just pick it up in a sale.

												This game is at the brink of extinction.Bad puns aside, The community of this game is currently in the dozens. Get this game, and get your friends to get it.What you're buying is a team based first person shooter consisting of two campaigns with a maximum of 8 PLAYERS cooperatively working on the battlefield with multiple objectives occuring at the same time. If your not interested in the campaign, then there are huge shootouts of balanced teams on the stages (if there's enough people). You've got a variety of customizable weapons with at least two of them suiting your playstyle. A leveling and rank system that rewards more customization options and allows you to use skills that modify your playstyle of the four different classes (With enough skillpoints to usually perfect your favorite two). Challenges to start the game off with so you've got battlefield experience (And the challenges give you weapons, mods and experience so you aren't jumping into multiplayer at level one). A parkour system that if mastered can allow some crazy combos and even hidden collectable lore. Also you can make a ton of characters should you want a different build or just to experiment.If you've read this, just get the game already.			"

												Oh boy was this a good game. was.I got the disc when it came out and actually played it before I added it to steam years later, so my hour count is much higher than shown here. It was a Fantastic game that I enjoyed to the fullest. Sadly, the playerbase vanished way to quick and thus it died a swift death.I give it a positive rating because for all the fun I had playing it. It could have been so much more. The mechanics were incredible!			"

												Brink is exactly what I was expecting and what I wanted--a souped-up and expanded Enemy Territory. The objectives, weapons, and maps are good. The character customization is great, too. While it's not everyone's kind of game, some of the early reviews were just weak, and it seemed to me that a pile-on mentality developed in which people who had barely played the game at all started dumping on it. A shame, because it's challenging and fun.Not many people play today, but I still enjoy the single player, and I still do find other friends playing. "

												I had so much fun with this game when it came out. In promotions, the movement system and  its ove-all dystopian art and story is what drove me to want to experience Brink for the first time.The online gameplay was insanely good and challenging.I believe now the multiplayer community is scarece. The single-player game itself holds little remaining drive to play, because the story simply does not immerse and drive the player enough. I had expected a very lengthy campaign with a massive free roaming environment, where the player takes part in a massive campaign to save the Arc... the game sadly does not have this.As I see this game on my ""not installed"" games list daily, I was reminiscing.

												There is something about brink, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the look of the world your in.If you have ever stared off into the distance in mirrors edge, you will understand the beauty of this game.The contrast between the resistance and the security’s living areas is crafted perfectly to give you a true sense of the poverty the resistance is fighting to overcome and the wealth the security is trying to protect.Brink feels like its own separate world where you can immerse yourself in either saving or ending the ARK.If you take this game seriously, it will reward you with two great sides to a story and two very different viewpoints on the way money can influence your views.I found it best to play the game alone, against bots (single player mode) to give the best immersion possible.

												I remember when this game came out it received a lot of hate.  It's online presence these days is practically non-existant it seems.  I think in it's hey-day it would have been significantly better.Most of my experience sadly has been from Singleplayer.as is, the downside is that your team AI is pretty...I wouldn't say dumb as it's just really simple.  If a medic is nearby usually you'll have priority on the revives, I think buffs can be distributed pretty frequently as well.  The problem is that they are almost entirely inept when it comes to level objectives.  When it comes to defending a point or supporting you, they do just fine, however finally pushing to take a point they're just inept.Gameplay wise, yes the parkoure isn't perfect but for it's time I'd say it was pretty solid.  I've scaled objects with relative ease (though there are some issues) wall runs (or springs, Not sure what to call it) are alright, I think the problem is they didn't make it as flashy as other games.You have these typical class systems (assault, medic, engineer etc) which have a somewhat different but not entirely original spin to most games that use the same system have.  What I did like was how they implement a sub-class weight system, but wish they took better advantage of it.I like the the weight class system, basically they restricted weapons to certain weight classes and provided base perks to those classes.  Light weight, are the most mobile but have access to the least amount of weapons;  Heavy, are slow but tough and have access to all weapons in the game (namely the most devastating); and Average build lies somewhere between those two.  It allows you to play a tank-like medic or a nimble one, or a rapid assault character or a heavy assault character.  It's somethin to play with.There's also a perk system for each class, and general perks.  I believe there's a limitation to how many perks you can upgrade so it adds an interesting dynamic to how you build a character to fit your playstyle.I remember people hating on the gunplay in this game, honestly I had no trouble with it.  It's not as accurate as other games of it's time but I believe that was te point.  Speaking as someone who has actully shot guns before I thought it added a degree of realism or challange to shooting that has been lost since the red-dot, point and shoot accuracy made popular by most COD games I played.  I think the real problem is that sometimes enemies feel ""spongey"" (they soak a lot of bullets).  Attachments are pretty average, red-dot sight, different clip sizes...etc.  Not nearly enough options compared to COD games, and definitely not compared to the ridiculous combinations in Ghost Recon Future Soldier.Character cusomization is pretty neat, The options are somewhat limited but still provide a breadth of diversity.  Don't expect sliders like in Bethesda games, From Software or Korean RPGs.I liked the look of the characters and the levels tell a neat story in and of themselves.  The game's narrative can change somewhat based on your success and failures.  I realy wish there was more of an online presence still but I guess that's what I get for buying it so late after it initially released.TL;DRIf you see this game on sale I think it's worth a pickup, at the time I'm writting this however you're probably too busy playing Overwatch, or some other MP shooter.

Playing with bots has proven to be enjoyable enough, and you can still find players on servers every now and then.Over-the-top customization, basic sorta story (more of it can be found in audio logs for completing missions over and over), neato scenery, astonishing soundtrack - Brink has it all.

One of my first steam games and the idea of the parkour was nice, I liked the art style, some of the maps and costumes were good but it was dead and is still dead with no community or player base and as a team-based shooter with classes that's bad.  The AI isn't bad but it's still useless and often the defenders can do a better job as their AI just all sit on choke points and your team run headlong ito them			"

												Never usually write reviews but felt i had to because of all the hate this game gets. Originally bought it for Xbox 360 and LOVED it so bought it again for PC.Pros:Some of the best character design I’ve seen in my life, the games art direction is impeccable and so it looks stunning. The character customization is probably the best in an fps game I’ve ever seen with so many awesome different helmets, tattoos etc. (You can even decide your characters voice!) Overall the visuals and aesthetics of this game are near perfect. Intriguing story sets up game nicely and gives it a unique feel although they could have gone more in depth. There are two campaigns from both sides of the conflict and also what if scenario missions so a decent amount of single player content. Shooting mechanics are basic but there is a nice variation in classes and absolutely awesome parkour mechanics.Cons:No one online so the multiplayer is pretty dead, sometimes the AI in single player can be a little dumb but only occasionally. Apart from the story missions there isn't much else to do apart from some challenges (however they do have leader boards).Conclusion:One of my favourite games of all time, I can’t understand why it gates so many bad reviews, with some tweaks to the AI more content and a living multiplayer base this game would be PERFECT.

It has no story line (barely) same repetitive lock'n load, and one magazine clip of ammo is used only for one person, so running out of ammo takes not much of a long time.

												BRINK is a marvelous endeavor created by the talented personnel at Bethesda Software, whom you know and cherish from other great masterpieces such as The Elder Scrolls and the more recent Fallout 3. BRINK has a bona fide class system that you will find both intuitive and easy to use. This is a game meritorious of all the awards that it won. I wholeheartedly endorse this game as possibly the best computer I have ever played.			"

												This game was much better than people gave it credit for. Sure, it had its flaws, but it was a welcome change of pace from the Calls of Battlefields or the Modern Warfighters. If only the community didn't die so quickly... If this game had even twice the servers it currently has, I'd go back to it in a heartbeat. The artstyle, music, voicework, and atmosphere were all quite surreal. Bethesda, bring us a sequel. Give us a BRINK worth playing for more than half a year.8.3 for when it was active, but it's only got about 6 servers now, and half of them are empty.			"

В игре есть два режима: основной режим – компания с возможностью создавать собственные матчи на тех же картах с особыми настройками.

												The game itself is great. Great design and fun mechanics with a strong focus on parkour as a way to move around. The gun customization  and the storyline made it into a really enjoable game. 4,5/5, I'd say. The only problem right now - it's dead. It was a lot of fun to play back in the days but now there isn't anyone around to play except for CPU Bots... which is a shame. If there was any hope the game gets miraculously revived - I'd highly recommend it, but, sadly, it doesn't seem to happen any time in the future.			"

												Brink is all about running around with your team trying to achieve a number of set objectives, which usually involves killing an enemy team on the way. I have a fairly large number of criticisms of this game, the first of which is that there are loads of customisations, yet no female characters. AI isn’t too bad, but the bots on your team are constantly getting in the way. Game-play is very confusing. Not only are the objectives very unclear, but enemies seem to just appear in the worst possible places. You are often staggering  around lost and confused, then you get incapped without knowing where the bullet even came from becaseu an enemy spawned behind you. And enemies seem to be far more difficult to kill than you are! All in all it adds up to a lot of frustration. It’s not a bad game, but it's far from a great game. It has some serious game-play issues. Recommended? Well, At at Sale price, yes, but not at full price. "

												This game has many good things about it...but the problems overpower them. I bought this game to play with my friends (What the store page said I could do) I currently cannot join any of my friends even going so far as to download a program which helps matchmaking (still doesn`t work)I have played Brink for more then enough time to say this Things Brink NEEDS to Work on1. Campain Missions: They`re basically the exact same thing, there`s no change its always just attack this or defend this 2. Matchmaking: If you claim to not only have a fantastic game but have co-op multiplayer in the game then actually do it instead of making people frustrated (make the matchmaking like Team Fortress 2 with no problems) 3. DLC Gun Overpower: I have purchased the DLC and can already see both the Fallout 4 rifle as well as the DOOM submachine gun are very overpowered (DOOM gun does not have any recoil and has the fastest fire rate and the Fallout 4 rifle is the second most damage rifle that you can unlock as a noob)4. Bots: The bots are just basically awful. Playing campain its either your teammates are dumb as logs and don`t help with the main mission and don`t revive you when thier standing right on top of you or the enemies are damn near impossible even on easiest dificulty taking you out in a fraction of a second without you knowing where they are.5. Character Development: When I watched the videos about the character creation I was so excited...only to find out thier all the same. The voice selection as well as the character actually moving his lips with accuracy is amazing yet they all say the same thing with no uniqueness. When you first create your character all you do is make a face, get a voice then get shirts as you play the game. I wish the selection you made on your character could affect how your character handles in combat because no matter what shirt you get (Even the suit for Resistance which is basically a tank) you all mostly have the same health with no difference (Best example of what I`m trying to explain is Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim with each race having benifets as well as armor having benifets). I want to love you Brink because you have all the powers alligned in your favor, please fix these problems and make your game shine.Sincerely- The Professor			"

												This game reminds me of borderlands, TF2 & battlefield.Currently it has a few annoying bugs like sound going out on the map you are playing but that is like once every 4-6 maps.For SP gaming it is confusing as hell if you don't read manuals & jump into game like i do.As for MP gaming it is LOTS of fun & the earlier you get into the game the more likely you will not get your azz handed to you over & over  again.I would give the game a rating of 7/10 in it's current state, once they fix the bugs this is a 8/10 game easy when playing MP.

												Save or escape the ""Ark"" you get to choose which side you are on. The campaign is a series of levels that deal with certain things like blowing up a place or stopping a group of guys from blowing up stuff. The game is a must have if you have friends to play with, the co-op modes are alot of fun and alot more easier to play with 2 people. The customization of characters is alot of fun to play with because there is so many different combinations to mess around with. The customization of weapons is great to have that advantage when your in a battle. The  ""SMART"" (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain) is awesome and is something that is not seen in games these days, you run and moving smoothly while vaulting over objects which is a fun feature to this game. Time plays a huge factor in every match of Brink, you need to be fast and use strategy to accomplish your goals. The game is great and alot of fun for any FPS player. Just make sure you have friends to play with.			"

												I grew up on Doom and Quake, and this harkens back to a time before Call of Duty, back when the mod Team Fortress for Quake was still king. There are issues, balance, ai, gun mechanics, map bottlenecks, all need a little more work. What Brink is good at, though, is making people work together as a team, helping out, and providing a different style of play to a stagnant genre. The Parkour mechanics add a wonderful element to the play, the customization is great, and there was definitely some ambition from the developers. Ultimately, the game is not a success, but it is a gem that I will pull out and admire from time to time and enjoy. If you catch it on a steam sale for <$10, I would check it out, and pass along anything positive in the hopes they can use it to make a better genre overall.			"

												I've played this more on my other account. Unfortunately, copy on it is region-locked.This game is multiplayer-based, clearly... I think devs never considered that it'd die out and be played solo mainly. This game blossoms when played with players fighting on both sides - in singleplayer it's more dull, fighting with bots who are equally stupid on your side and on the enemy side, in multiplayer you need people on both sides, otherwise it becomes a babybeating fest of a game, as bots can't do anything against a squad of players. If you have friends who are willing to play with you, get this now. It's worth it......however if you are on your own prepare for frustration with the stupidity of your bots, dull fights with the enemy bots and the nigh-incompletable challenge that is required to unlock all the guns and attachments, talking about tier 2 and 3 of ""Be More Objective"". The aimbot-like accuracy of enemy bots and concentrated fire, lack of aim on the side of bots that are ""helping"" you and  the fact that you get blasted away in mere moments, AND you are the only person completing the objectives in rather short amount of time are already enough to smash your keyboard.Sad this thing died. It's so reliant on players that without them you suddenly realize it frustrates you more often than it makes you have fun.Still, I'd recommend it.It was good.Rest in peace, Brink.			"

												A fun multiplayer shooter with a good amount of story to expand its appeal. Combat mechanics are great and customization of characters and weapons is one of the best within this genre of games. With that said, it also has the feel as a partially completed game. The previously mentioned story is short and not exactly climatic, character customization is limited to only male characters, and the AI are either really easy to beat or extremely difficult. A personal favorite to play when bored or just looking for a challenging AI arena shooter. Should have delayed the release and kept working to make this better.			"

												The game was way ahead of it's time and people weren't ready for it.I found everything in Brink to be in my liking. It was fast tempo fps that was one of the first to introduce parkour in it's game.Truly a gem that died too soon.			"

												I have never been this disappointed by a pre-order. NEVER. Brink was not at all what I was expecting or wanted. Sure, the art style was nice but the gameplay was bland and ultimately boring. It doesn't offer anything that any other game doesn't do better, except maybe parkour, but I don't care how good your parkour is if your gunplay sucks and makes me want to parkour right off the tallest building in the game.

												Background: I'm a FPS fan, I enjoy some similar game play types such as Unreal Tournaments Assault.  This particular game didn't click with me.I played this game in early 2013 as part of a personal challenge to play some games on my backlog.  Naturally I had to play SP with bots as the MP community had mainly moved onto other things years ago.  Also as your have to ""level up"" I didn't want to start as a noob with rude people who would be telling me I was doing it wrong.  The levels are quite fun at first, you can pick what type of  character to play, follow the other bots to an objective and either earn it, or death zerg until success.  Be prepared to hear about capturing or losing command points a hell of a lot.  You could be about to win the level, then the enemy AI take one of your command points and the AI on your team decide to go get their revenge.The movement to the game is kinda fun, but really its just a gimmick.  In battle you'll either kill the guy or get killed, its not about fancy movement and gunplay at the same time.The game has 2 sides, each map lets you play the story from either side, but really, does anyone care what the story is about, why the are getting wound up?  The third time you have heard the bots talking about ""WE HAVE TAKEN THEIR COMMAND POST"" you have forgotten what or why you were doing.  You just know you have to get closer and press and action key to win the objective.Overall the game wasn't fun enough.  Apart from going back to get some more achievements I won't be going back to this.Things that annoy me:I don't want a choice of voice actorsOne of the maps was impossible to win at the normal difficulty.  Partly as the bots never teamed up with me. I dropped the difficulty and got through the map flawlessly.Lots of focus on things that I'm just not interested in.The bots dialogueThe bots, both friendly and enemy are the main reason you'll want to quit.

 BRINK  is a good game, it's a team-based multiplayer shooter like TF2Only downside, this game was unfinished and was rushed back in 2011.. this game however help redefined the generation of shooters by introducing parkour mechanics Brink had it's moments, it was very fun playing online with players Splash Damage is making a new game and it's under beta, it's a predecessor to Brink with more polished gameplay and better mechanics  click here [dirtybomb.nexon.net]

												I've previously owned this game before on PS3, so I decided to give the game another chance on PC. Personally, I like the artstyle, its fairly unique and sets the game apart from other run of the mill shooters. Although it is what you'd expect, everything for the resistance is improvised and gritty, everything for the security forces is shiny, white and looks brand new, etc. The soundtrack is also decent, the main menu theme is currently stuck in my head as I write this review. The gameplay is class based, the game requires a large degree of teamwork to accomplish any of the objectives, this isn't really a game where you can be the lone wolf and decimate everything in your path. Anyone familiar with games such as TF2 or star wars battlefront, will feel right at home with the gameplay. The only aspect of the gameplay I don't like is the parkour, its very jerky, sometimes unresponsive, and difficult to pull off in certain situations due to the 1st person view limiting your perspective of the surrounding environment, it feels like the parkour was an afterthought and was wedged in at the last minute in order to attract the Mirrors Edge crowd. However, I've found that parkour isn't particularly usefull in all the missions anyway, so the clunkyness isn't really a problem as I rarely used parkour to its full extent.Character customisation is rather good. By leveling up you unlock different outfits for your character, allowing you to personalise him as you see fit. Anyone wishing to play as a female character may be slightly dissapointed as you can only play as a male character. You can however choose from three different body types, Light, medium and heavy. all with their own advantages and drawbacks. e.g Light characters can run very fast but can be killed in only a few hits, wheras the heavy characters take more damage, but move slower. There are also perks and abilities for each class, with the Medic being able to upgrade his healing abilities, the engineer can gain a sentry gun upgrade, the soldier can dispense more ammo to comrades and the operative can genrally become more sneaky. More weapons and attachments for said weapons can be unlocked through the completion of individual challenges, separate from the main game. Most of these challenges are fairly easy, and don't require a great deal of effort, allowing you to unlock all the weapons and attachments somewhat quickly. The game has a wide variety of weapons to choose from, allowing for a good variety of playstyles. Sadly, the multiplayer is fairly dead. Whenever I try to search for a match, there's no one else playing. This means you're left with the single player mode. However, those familiar with Star Wars battlefront's 'instant action' feature, will feel right at home as the 'free play' mode allows you to jump into any mission of your choosing, and apply custom mutators to that mission. Unfortuntely, the AI is not the best feature of this game as it is very temperamental. Sometimes the friendly AI will be as stupid as a sack of hammers and at others it will be flawless, the same can be said for the enemy AI, sometimes it wrecks you and your team, sometimes it just sits back and takes whatever beating you're giving it. In conclusion, the game is fairly solid but is held back by the lack of an active multiplayer scene, the temperamental AI and the clunky parkour.			"

												Brink was badly rated, hated and put away in a rush. People judged it too early, way before any patches got released - they didn't give it a chance because of the technical hiccups. I admit the AI was bad at the release date... but who wants to play with bots in a game that was made for multiplayer matches with humans? Also, there is the choppy gameplay problem  - but only if you play locally. Once you connect to a dedicated server (you can even do it on your own PC), the gameplay turns as fluid as it should be. I think this game has one of the best character customization systems in the FPS gaming industry. The gameplay is similar to ET:QW; minus vehicles, plus vaulting. The art has to be mentioned too: characters; weapon design; colors; maps; atmosphere; sounds; music - everything about it is unique and top notch quality. I think this game was neglected because the majority of the players are too arrogant if they are confronted with technical issues... Anyway, this game is neat! :)			"

												There is nothing in Brink that hasn't already been done. The parkour controls, objective focused combat and class specific levels system are all game devices that have been tried and tested. In many instances, Brink even fails to make better of older, cheaper games that offer such features in their games. It doesn't help either that the game's presentation is poor. Brink's interface is clumsy and confusing, the engine is seven years out of date and it is too demanding for what little visual dexterity is presented. Still, Brink is somewhat enjoyable. If you're familiar with Quake Wars or Return to Castle Wolfenstein's multiplayer, the gameplay will make you feel right at home with weapons providing the same kick and combat moving as fluid as it did with both games. However by contrast, the maps are bland - not really having any appeal at all unless corridors and stairways gravitate towards your interest. Brink's difficult to recommend overall unless on discount.			"

												Brink is a parkour, class based, FPS with story that let's you customize your weapons to your specifications.  The following classes description was taken from wiki:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brink_%28video_game%291.  Soldiers: Soldiers are primarily concerned with destroying important objects with explosives. They are also in charge of resupplying their teammates with ammo. Soldiers can also throw damaging speciality grenades, such as molotov cocktails, flashbang, and plant satchel charges similar to C4. With the proper ability equipped and utilised (Scavenger), they are the only class that have access to a potentially unlimited supply of ammunition.2.  Engineers: The Engineer is concerned primarily with building, repairing, and upgrading things on the battlefield. Engineers must also disarm enemy explosives planted by soldiers as well as enemy landmines. He can also upgrade his and his teammate's weapons to do more damage, upgrade teammates' body armour, and plant hidden landmines.3.  Medics: Medics revive downed teammates and buff their teammates' health. They also have special health buffs they can dispense to their teammates, such as improving their teammates' metabolism (how fast they heal on the battlefield) or temporarily boosting their sprint speed. They are the only class that can buff their own health or self-resurrect themselves when downed.4.  Operatives: Operatives are the spies of Brink. They can hack computers to complete certain Mission Objectives and can also disguise themselves as the enemy. They are the only class that can spot hidden landmines.The game was pretty damn good, but by now the games online would probably be dead.  So beware when purchasing.  Everyone working as a team was fantastic and fun.  The parkour is exactly as it sounds.  You do a lot of jumping here and sliding there.  Think Titanfall if you've played that, but without the jetpacks.  Customization is cool in which you unlock certain attachments and upgrades for your weapons and how you characters look.  Similar to how Call of Duty does it, but Brink's user interface makes it look all pretty and the 3D models of weapons stands out.Interesting, fun and well worth checking out.  It does have a story and simi-single player.  Drop in Drop out coop online, but chances are you'll be playing by yourself unless you have some friends willing to play with you. "

												GOSH DARN IT BRING. YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE.  Brink is awesome. Strait up fantastic. The gameplay is balanced, the combat is fun, the guns are a blast, the map design is epic, and the character creation is fun. Sadly, this game was crippled at launch by having botched support for AMD cards. At the time, I was on Nvidia but most of my friends who purchased the game had AMD and couldn't play with me. This is certainly a game to play with friends, and by myself got a bit lonely over time. That being said, this game is fantastic, and I'd give anything to play it online with full servers again. - PR0XIDIAN			"

												A new Game-experience...If you play the most known games like Counterstrike, Call of duty, Crysis... then you will find here a fresh new style. The Trailer is really catchy (to be honest: it was the reason why i thought about buying). This is not a game you can play every day, but a nice variety to everything you know before.Mentionable points+ New and own game style, easy to learn+ Climb over machines, containers... use the direct way to the target-  MP Servers are mostly down__________________________Graphics - 7/10 The graphics seems rough and bit edged, but this is also the style of the game. It is basicly nice done.Sound - 7/10Sound is ok. nothing special.AI - 8/10The Bots are average-good programmed. Less to none buggy behavour.Ingame enviroment possibilities - 9/10The best possibility is here that you can nearly climb over everything - depending on your body-type. If you choose to play light-body character you can run, slilde on the floor... why using the path? climb the container and take the direct way. really.... nice done. complexity 7/10It takes a few minutes until you understand how to use everything. how you make xp the best way, how to change character... but its not too bad.Single Player 4/10There is no real SP Story line. The SP and the MP are nearly the same, because you play the same maps. you can choose to do it in random order or in a ""story-campagne-way"" Multiplayer 5/10Playing MP is fun but there are most of the time problems when you open a server. For example others cant connect because an option was missing or connection problems,.....The public servers by the developers are down also.The only way to play MP online is now either to connect to a serve from history-list or to open a LAN server via Tunngle.Price 3/10 Since you can buy this game nearly everywhere for round about 5,- EUR, The 20,- EUR here are too much.In my opinion 5,- EUR would be okay, since the dlc's are nice: 10,- EUR for the complete-pack would be a good deal. Personal SummaryEven with the DLC, there are round about 20 Maps you can play. Not bad but also not really much. The main thing that keeps the fun factor up in this game is that you have many possibilitys to turn the table around during the fight. Most of them need to be unlocked (which keeps you playing also). For example: Enemys keep killing your teammates and you cant reach them (as medic) without getting killed? Equip the ""medic-grenade"" and revive many (!) of them at the same time from cover.Enemys are too many? Equip ""mechanic"" character, boost your own weapons and your teammates' and also build sentry guns and mines.Enemys come from everywhere and catch you?

Then go behind enemy lines and kill him with an ""suprise"" from behind. You can also ""hack"" (as a spy) enemy sentry guns so they attack THEM or put remote control on them to control them manual ^^and so on....			"

												5/10 Oh boy. Brink.It's pretty, and like TF2 with actual class-specific objectives and places you can't go if you picked the wrong character model, but just as you get warmed up it's over.Single player's too short with bots that don't really challenge you.Co-op can be worthwhile, but even shorter.Multiplayer is pretty sparse.I guess that if they knock the price down to the point where you're only paying for one of the game modes, it'll be ok.It was going to be the biggest thing ever, it was going to be legendary, it was going to... work.Sadly it was a buggy mess on release, leaving a wave of players who'd paid full price (or even worse, pre-ordered) with a list of valid complaints. As the first wave largely abandoned the servers for TF2 the price was halved and the new blood came looking for a decent budget fps. Which it is, to be fair.Now it's a decent budget shooter with an interesting parkour mechanic for getting around the maps in new ways. but it's still not worth the price.			"

												A class based FPS much like Battlefield focused on completing objectives and parkour movement. There's no point in recommending this now - the player base is minimal and there are tons of other shooters with more players. Thankfully, there is a sort of campaign, but fighting bots doesn' feel fun or rewarding and they aren't terrible, but not a good enough test aginst human players. I'm not sure I'm fond of the way the guns feel either, though I can't describe why. Unless you're DESPERATE for a parkour based shooter, don't waste your time or money - the <10 servers are only occassionally not empty.			"

A team objective based game with 4 different classes, each with powerups and abilities that could change the flow of a round.You have the following:- Engineers: able to place mines, buff their or their teammates' weapons, place sentries and so on- Operatives: capable to disguise as enemies and hack mines- Soldiers: able to resupply their or team's ammunition- Medics: health buffs and reviving downed teammatesThe game also offers three body types: heavy, medium and light. Each body type has a weight limit when it comes to weaponry, Heavies being able to take any weapon as primary and secondaries reaching up to AR'sThink about how many builds can you work around with.Weapon Mods are also obtainable from challanges that can get harder as you go through them.Maps might seem overly simple and few, but they offer enough cover spots and good spawns and command post positions.

												Бринк. Игра меня впечатлила. Сюжет есть: Защитникам острова защитить остров, а русскому сопротивлению собственно уничтожить остров и сбежать с него. Как ни странно, при хорошем сюжете эта игра сетевая по большей части. Графика более, чем хорошая, краски тоже, как и звуки. Много разных видов оружий, способностей и костюмов. Существуют 3 типа телосложения: Плотный, обычный и худой. Плотный тип телосложения таскает пулемёты, всё тяжелое, у него много здоровья. Может забираться на выступы, которые ему по пояс. Обычный тип обладает меньшим запасом здоровья, на может забираться на выступы с его высотой. Худой же тип самый слабый в здоровье и оружии, но он очень быстро бегает, не устаёт, забирается везде и на всё, так как умеет отпрыгивать от стен, забираться по ним и вытворять акробатические приёмы. Оценка хорошая (8/10).			"

												About the controversy around this game...It was terrible on launch, with loads of performance issues and glitches, but was patched after a few months (runs well for me). Unfortunately, by then, everyone had stopped playing. The current state of the game is that there are only a few servers and only a few players. Despite this, I would still recommend this game but only if you have some friends to play coop with as public servers are very, very empty (at least last time I checked).About the game...It's class based team games, with a variety of objectives and freedom to help your team in a number of ways. Great art style and graphics. The environments look great, but aren't as open as they should be to take advantage of the parkour mechanics. The singleplayer is basically just a botmatch, so I would stick to coop and multiplayer. The main flaw for me was that you are likely to distribute all your skills to one class so that you are very powerful, which dissuades you from switching class to help the team when you need an engineer to blow something up or an operative to hack, etc.			"

												One of the WORST FPS I have EVER played. I seriously regret this $10 purchase, I wouldn't pay $1 to play it. Absolutely horrible and unplayable. Glitchy graphics, team AI is unintelligent and usless with unbalanced gameplay. Only good things are  maybe some of the concepts in the game, story is okay but that isn't enough to make it worth playing. Extremely disapointing game from Bethesda. Mind you I have only played solo. The game might be better played with others but even then I am certain there a better games out there with less issues. I have also heard most of the servers are dead so multiplayer is  for the most part a no go. If they fixed the solo campaigne so it was possible to progress and not waste 20-40min per mission because your own team mates are so useless, this could of been a great game, but It is just horrible. I don't play games to do the same thing over and over, and over, and over, and over... I don't just play for the sake of playing a game, I want to be able to progress. I think it was designed to be MP only, as the single player is just unpleasant and unplayable. They shouldn't of even bothered with a single player mode. While some of the customization is cool, it sill all seems more or less the same and the faces, while funny, are unappealing. The parkour is cool, when it works. this game is not worth the frustration. Over all, the game looks cool, not worth it if you want to play solo, and I am not even sure multiplayer is all that active. buy at youer own risk, do not pay full price.			"

												My God. What have I done?To clarify: I jumped so hard on this bandwagon I'm surprised the wheels didn't come off. The free-running, the different body types, the whole idea of either siding with the guys trying to keep the fallen paradise in one piece or with the others who truly believed that there was hoarding going on that should be shared by all and scarcity was being made up. The ability to change your class mid-match to fill in what was needed.I even put together a cosplay of The Anger. That's just not something I randomly do, but I felt like this game was going to set the world on fire. Oh, it did. Like a bag of flaming turds left on someone's astroturf, catching their trailer ablaze, and the trailer next door, and so on until the whole park was an inferno. The matches grew stale, the lack of good AI made it so players who didn't fit on one of the Human teams didn't have a prayer, and no dedicated servers from the creators made for a wasteland shortly after launch.So here I am, wondering what I had done, blindly following a game, becoming a day-one adopter, only to stare into the abyss of a trailer park fire burning away the glee I felt when I started seeing previews of this game with all the heat of a thousand angry suns. You went from being the chosen one to the jerkface who killed all the younglings.May you pass from all memory.			"

												Possibly the worst game I preordered. Overall the game is not even THAT bad but it just doesn't excel on any level. One of the reasons i preorderd this game was because of character customisation. Although it has more customisation than most first person shooters these days, the game is just too fast to see any real difference between characters other then they're white or black, something the Unreal Tournament series always succeeded in. Obviously, I did not buy the game just for the character customisation. I also bough the game because it should have great gameplay and there apparently was a story mode. While there is a story mode, I don't think anyone really cared about the story unlike in games like Left 4 Dead but it was a nice attempt to implant some sort of story mode. The gameplay is OK, just your typical shooter but somehow, to me it just didn't feel right for a FPS. There are also objectives your team needs to complete in every mission, which could be great but everything is just too chaotic and you have no idea what to do.Brink isn't a bad game but there's a reason why players stopped playing the game. You probably won't find people playing so it's you vs bots. The only way this game could get alive is if they gave it away for free. "

Be amazed when you realise you can glitch your way to the top rank in about two ♥♥♥♥ing hours, and recoil in horror at the ♥♥♥♥♥iest explosions in all of gaming history. Be captivated by the fact that this game was made by the same people that developed the Fallout franchise, and wonder how many lines of cocain it took for them to think that releasing this game was a good idea in its current state. 4/10			"

												Underrated is the word for this game.It's not one of the best fps games ever but it has some nice features.

												This game is great it has a great parkour system that has inspired so many other games, great fighting mechanics, awesome levels of customization, and a really good storyline. I would give this game a final score of 9/10. 1 point was subtracted for some boring moments, some blandness, and low levels of servers and players. If you get this, expect to be mainly playing it for the story.			"

												This game is what I think of when I think of shooters done poorly. It does very little of what it attempts properly, the level design, and mission objectives are monotonous. Just like EA and its business practices.The gunplay is so-so, with a decent level of guns, and customizability. However, I found the mods to be bleh, at best. They affect your gun a little bit but very little notice is taken from them most of the time. It's an average shooter that brings little in the way of gunplay that's new. Just like EA, they fail to innovate in any capable manner.The running and jumping off walls, free running thing. Not done very well, in fact once I got online I saw maybe 3 people do it with even mixed success. It's like a Mirror's Edge knockoff that went south in a jiffy. EA may be to blame... they usually are. Wow now for the real killer that made me get a whopping 32 hours from this game. The level and objective design. First the levels are not balanced in any remote sense of the word. Every FPS has those levels, but every level has a high degree of balance issues in this game. Then to top the cherry off on the cake, the game modes all revolve around this King of the Hill type of design. That “Hold this point you’re our last hope” kinda thing. Which it doesn’t even deliver on the potential of the game mode. Epic shoot-outs between lines are not what you find. Mayhem and chaos are all that await you. Just like every time you buy an EA game and allow them to create more terrible abominations.So the most important things are: 1.) Don’t buy EA games, they’re a cancer. -and- 2.) Find a better game to play that’s an FPS, if you’re gonna be a hate-monger and buy EA even they have better choices out there.			"

The multiplayer is a laggy and buggy mess, no matter what your connection or personal set-up may be. The campaign is a laughable attempt at a story of rebellion and class seperation.About the only draw points are the customization options you have for your arsenal and your character, but they're nothing that can't be found in other games.

I tried one game with a friend and it was lagged like crazy. I was getting anywhere from 30 to 60 FPS and it wasn't consistent at all.

												While the professional reviews for this game are a bit harsh, I'm still having fun with it so far. Sure, it's not the game it could've been, but it's definitely not as bad as the reviews want you to believe. The graphics are a bit dated, but they're stylish nonetheless. And the gameplay is a solid mix of Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Call Of Duty and other popular shooters. The only downside is that there just doesn't seem to be any decent balancing on certain maps. Sometimes you're stuck in the spawn zone for the entire match, and there's no way to get out. Things like that really take the fun out of the game. That, and a few bugs (like no sound at all on certain maps). There is still a lot of fun to be had here, so if you like multiplayer games you might want to give it a spin :)[Rating: 77/100]			"

												A rushed, shallow game with some good ideas and a fair few bad ones. Over all the game died due to a fair few mistakes by the devs, seriously bad QA on launch and the community's lack of trust, and general discontent with the way things were going.Objectives and map design that lead to stalemates and general onesided matches with clear bias.Weapon balance, and weight/class balance...a lot of reasons to be very agile, and not very many to be anything else. The marketing campaign sold the parkour as a major feature, and mobility as a major feature, but generally it was just a side element.			"

												Inherently disppointed with how the game turned out.There was potential. The engine was mishandled so combat interactions was outright infuriating.  It was difficult to know when I should be shooting due the visuals. Lag simply compounded the issue.Level design was made with  bottlenecks in mind and that made it ridiculously difficult for attacking teams to get near their objective.  The lack of ways to get around brought the game was contrary to their claim to ""free motion"" with the 'SMART"" button. "

												One of my most disappointing purchases. The game promised to be something different, introducing what was supposed to be fluid movement via a ""parkour"" style. I had this game pre-purchased on the promises delivered by the trailers, and I wish I had saved my money. The ""Parkour"" part was not well-executed, and seemed to be ""laggy"" on every server I played. Want to get away from the lag and play with bots instead? Expect to have to do every single objective by yourself, because the bots aren't programmed to do it. But Brink's most disappointing feature is that it's just....boring. A game about parkour gunplay should not be boring. It takes half of your clip of ammo to down an enemy, and even when they're down, they're not dead yet. You'll essentially have to use a full clip of ammo whenever you want someone to really, truly die.			"

												Brink is a game that wants to be innovative and different. Yet it feels like any other FPS.The Character customization is bland, and doesn't offer that many choices. The Story jumps all over the place.I do like it whenever the game tells a story from another point of view, But it just doesn't work here. There are a fewguns, but they don't differ from one another. You're most likely to find a gun, and use it for the rest of the game.Brink had a good idea, but it feels like it was a Jigsaw puzzle in which all the pieces came from different puzzles.The picture isn't clear. Hell, there isn't even a picture.			"

												Brink is what happens when you try to make a multiplayer FPS game that promotes movement and fast-paced action but feel constrained by the modern trends of ""tactical"" play and cover mechanics. Simply put, it falls flat in every way imagineable.It's disappointing because I was really excited for this game when I first heard about it. I thought it might actually be the next best thing since Unreal Tournament 2004. ""Finally, a new competitive shooter that encourages movement."" But nope. In fact, most of the time, you get more points for being near an objective and just standing there. That's already a bad sign for a game that supposedly encourages you to run around, climb, and jump off walls whenever possible, but if the guns didn't all feel like pea shooters it'd at least be tolerable.One thing I'll give this game credit for is that it doesn't keep track of your kill/death ratio. It's all about the objective here. All about the teamwork. But even then, as mentioned earlier, you'll find that the easiest way to play this game is sitting still and shooting at people running by. It's not inherently a bad thing if a shooter isn't pure run and gun, but when a game puts a lot of emphasis on its parkour system, I certainly expect some faster-paced action.Even if you somehow find a way to enjoy this kind of gameplay, the horrible optimization will completely kill off any desire to keep playing it. If you use an ATI graphics card, you better pray to the gaming gods that your game won't run at less than 10 fps for no reason at all. And THEN if you happen to enjoy it and can run it well, you'll be disappointed to see that the game is pretty much empty online. It died off that quickly.Short version: Don't get this game. You won't find anything worthwhile here.			"

												I'm writing this as someone who'd enjoy this at its prime on the Xbox.This game had a lot of desirable elements that hadn't been seen in a lot of other shooters at the time. Yet, it still felt like a condensed version of TF2 prior to the customization. But that made it interesting. The classes by name were there, but a lot of the elements mixed together in a clunky and sometimes enjoyable game.Like the medic aspect, it could be paired with a spy-like ability and a scout-like speed. All good on there own, all pretty hard to work with when melded together.Would I recommend this game? Hella. If only on sale and under $5. The game has a linear campaign that repeats in a multiplayer format, which means that multiplayer to this game was almost a requirement. Within a month of buying this game, the active players number was almost gone already, and it was a bot vs bot game, which was just a merciless frustration. Buy this game and bring friends, a lot of em'. Honestly, if this game were just introduced again on a different face, it'd probably do well. It's an experience, the guns, the characters, even the movement style. But the lack of players and clunky class unity, (among other things) rightfully brought it a quick demise. I'd love to see this go F2P, because it'd pull in a lot of players and revive the servers for a short while. It has a lot of good in it, but not enough interest to inspire a renovation worthy enough of bringing it back.Buy it cheap, play with friends. Avoid bots.			"

												Thing is, launch killed this game.  It failed on an epic level and Splash damage couldn't recover to fix the bugs and errors fast enough.  I feel bad for them cause years later, I still open this up and play vs the bots and have a fun time.  To me the asthetic is a vibrant and wonderful change from the drab CoD# and BF# games.  Guns and gameplay feel good too.  Playing alone is a real limitation of a game that seemed ready to have it all, but its all there is.  I really feel this is a game that inspired the fun and dynamic movement we see in games like Destiny today.  Despite the utter disappointment I felt after pre-ordering this so long ago, I still think that since I play it now and then, I got my money's worth.  Thanks for pushing the envelope Splash Damage and I'm sorry for what happened.Since its a dead game, I only recommend for cheap or to play via lan (if ppl still do that) :)			"

												Surprisingly good fun, considering how much flak it got when it was released. Sure, it's a very generic FPS, but I got my fair share of entertainment out of it. Of course, I only played the single player campaigns so I can't say if there's any online traffic for co-op or competitive play in this game anymore.That said, it's undoubtedly a bonus if you manage to get a few friends to co-op the campaigns with you due to the occasionally rock-stupid AI. If you see this game on sale and are in the mood for some shootybangs, then I would say go for it.			"

												I think it's a shame that this game wasn't one of the highest sellers of 2011, however I can still see why it didn't do well at all.The AI could be classified as mentally handicapped, the story line could so with some minor fixes to make it more interesting, and they shouldn't sell the Doom/Psycho and the Fallout/SpecOps Packs on Steam while selling a Doom/SpecOps and Psycho/Fallout Pack on the hard-copy (it just makes buying the other Packs far more complicated).Other than these points (which aren't really noticeable when playing the game), the character customization is by far one of the best I've seen in any other game, the missions do actually get pretty tense and just the concept of the story is awesome!I would gladly play and re-play and re-play this game if my computer could handle it.

												With many hours on record (and counting) I certainly enjoy this game. It's a different take on the FPS game modes with the SMART controls. I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a game with strong customization not only with character but also for guns. The only 'chains' this game is the lack of diversity with maps and moding hasn't/won't happen. If Bethesda or Splash Damage released a tool to create maps then I would highly recommend this game, however in its current state I would still recommend but most likely when it’s on sale for < $15.Recommended!

It was obviously designed from the ground up to be a different team FPS experience, and it had a lot of potential.-The graphics are clean and stylized.The Bad:-A totally lackluster singleplayer experience.  No campaign worth mentioning, it's just multiplayer with bots.-For all the talk of classes, roles, and cooperation, ultimately every class kind of feels the same in a firefight.-When the community died, the game died.  It has no replay value if your friends aren't logging in.-Controls are iffy.Don't bother with it unless you have a sizeable group of friends who play.  Even then, try to convince them to get something else.  Maybe TF2, if you don't mind the hats.			"

												i have mixed feelings for this game..mostly negative feelings for this game. you start off as either a security officer as part of ark security to secure and save the ark, or you play as a washed up trigger happy ""terrorists"" the security calls them to escape the ark. you start out mostly underpowered while everything else is a bit stronger. and bots are rather anoying when one guns you down..sits at a corner where obviously oblivious medics rush in to heal to be gunned down right in front of you, your only choice is to respawn. gameplay is pretty bad..thanks to the AI now for bonuses its rather bad that you have to do EVERYTHING and when i say everything i meen ""hack this,destroy that, escort a droid to the drop of, intercept a hostage escort, etc"" and the bots are practicly brain dead in terms of helping you, as they sometimes run into the enemy and shoot at anything or everything or nothing at all (that sort of thing) especially when it comes to those ""training"" missions were you can do level apon levels to get ingame gear that can help you in the campain. i have no hopes for this game in the possible future of it EVER having a sequel.

												this game feels rather broken and empty, eventhough the concept was good, and the artwork is very good.when it all comes down to the gameplay, it is really a mess. and if the core of a game is corrupted, then i dont see a reason why you should buy it.the amount of people scattered around the floor waiting for revives is ridiculous, and the amount of bullets ennemies chew is over the top high. this is not an RPG dammit!

												I'll be honest this game is buggy and dead buuuuuut it's still fun. Though many people seem more content with Dirty Bomb a case can be made that it's a step back. Tactical positioning that can be implemented fairly quickly with SMART can be the difference between a quick loss or fast death. This is leaving out the sheer amount of customization that allows you to create classes out of the base 4 and to your liking as well. Pick the game up if you can, on sale if you can get it, but definately pick it up. Tactical action of the early Battlefield games with the high octane running and gunning of Quake and my personal favorite FPS.			"

												Brink is an ""eh"" game.  The multiplayer scene is dead.  I haven't been able to find a server with a ping below 100 at all, so don't go into it looking for awesome online play.  The bots themselves are kinda dumb, which means you end up having to do most of the work yourself.  The parkour aspect is actually pretty minimal, at least the way I've played, and you have to unlock the ""light"" body type that's most capable of parkour anyway (but which is the weakest body type).  Honestly, it's just another underwhelming idTech game that I got as part of a bundle.  I don't recommend it.  It's nothing special for single player.			"

												Ковчег являлся частью современной экологической концепции, примером самодостаточного местообитания. Огромный плавучий город, созданный людьми, стал прибежищем учёных и мыслителей, которые хотели реализовать эту экологическую концепцию, а богатые руководители города предоставили им для этого поистине курортные условия.Но угроза глобальной экологической катастрофы вскоре стала реальнее некуда: таяли ледники, поднимался уровень моря, и выживание самого человечества оказалось под вопросом. Многие тысячи людей со всего земного шара бросились на Ковчег в поисках спасения. Беженцы всеми силами старались выжить, а отцы-основатели города и их потомки пытались во что бы то ни стало сохранить над ним контроль.Теперь Ковчег утратил все связи с тем, что осталось от суши, и находится в полной изоляции. Предположительно возобновляемые ресурсы Ковчега истощаются, и есть риск того, что власть сменится, и противостоящие социальные группы вступят в кровопролитный конфликт.Напряжение растёт, а Охрана и Сопротивление ведут бой за власть над Ковчегом.

I wish I could place a hack box there and it hacks it by itself. I can't hack it without one asshat bot coming from behind while I'm defenceless.Oh yeah, the bots, they're pretty much useless and annoying. Even on easy mode the enemy bots are annoyingly hard. The friendly medic bots sometimes are standing RIGHT BESIDE ME, but keep shooting while I'm laying there all like ''DUDE, REVIVE ME''.I used to love this game.

												Brink has a lot of potential, but has not even come close to matching it yet. I'll list a few points that you should really consider before buying it.The Bad:-ATI Support, you WILL not experience good framerates with an ATI card unless you have very old drivers.-There is a known glitch that sound cuts out, thats right, you will have NO sound.-Graphics, they look muddled, not great-Movement is sluggish and even glitchy at times-Heavy guns are underpowered, I don't see heavy classes played very often due to this.-Engineer/Medic are going to be far more played than Soldier, and WAY more than the Op (which really sucks imo)-Virtually no in-game stats, at the end of a match you don't even know how well you technically did beyond points and ""awards""The Good:-Plenty of guns, plenty of different attachments for most guns-Lots of different combinations for customization, so your guy can look relatively different-Teamplay focused gameIt has lots of potential, but honestly the bugs are literally so bad that I get annoyed after playing for a few hours...

												Pretty balanced weaponry/gadgets and easy to use SMART system which is used for hopping walls, sliding, etc and requires teamwork with the use of 4 classes similar to Team Fortress 2(Soldier, Medic, Engineer, Operative) to win. The story is basic  with 2 factions opposing each other though neither are shown to be ""evil"" and can be played with 7 other players. Its adversarial modes and customization are where Brink shines with players able to change the appearance of his/her character(s), customize his/her weapons with multiple attachments which both are unlocked through completion of obstacle courses, and level up to unlock many abilities in each class catagory. Overall Brink is a decent game and is fun to play with/against others.			"

												The worst release and game I have ever bought. This game has ruined pre-ordering for me forever. I have not preordered a game since the disappointment I experienced with Brink. The game released broken as anything I have ever seen (keep in mind, this was a FINAL RETAIL RELEASE, not an early access or anything on the sort); the sound on the final level didn't work for weeks. Server lag was ridiculous until about a month after release at which point most players had abandoned the game and its multiplayer aspects. This game makes Battlefield 4's release look good. I wanted to like this game, I really did. Just no. Don't support this game or anything it stands for (preorder bonuses, early release schedules, etc.)			"

												Unlike many reviews of this game , I had a fair amount of entertainment from this game when it came out. The main issues for me was that the 'story' was abismal and failed to flesh out the amazing potential that the world had with the factions and fight for survival and order. The gameplay was solid and the parkour added to the faced paced multiplayer matches, however the single player was very dull and repetitive due to there being zero story to distract me from the monotony.-Fun gameplay , although somewhat repetitve.-Zero story-Had so much potential but the completely missed their chance.-Dead Community-7/10			"

												Ковчег являлся частью современной экологической концепции, примером самодостаточного местообитания. Огромный плавучий город, созданный людьми, стал прибежищем учёных и мыслителей, которые хотели реализовать эту экологическую концепцию, а богатые руководители города предоставили им для этого поистине курортные условия.Но угроза глобальной экологической катастрофы вскоре стала реальнее некуда: таяли ледники, поднимался уровень моря, и выживание самого человечества оказалось под вопросом. Многие тысячи людей со всего земного шара бросились на Ковчег в поисках спасения. Беженцы всеми силами старались выжить, а отцы-основатели города и их потомки пытались во что бы то ни стало сохранить над ним контроль.Теперь Ковчег утратил все связи с тем, что осталось от суши, и находится в полной изоляции. Предположительно возобновляемые ресурсы Ковчега истощаются, и есть риск того, что власть сменится, и противостоящие социальные группы вступят в кровопролитный конфликт.Напряжение растёт, а Охрана и Сопротивление ведут бой за власть над Ковчегом. Чью сторону примете вы? "

												Brink is an epic first person shooter that should not be missed by anyone. Ignore the other comments that people make about this, because this is a true masterpiece.The combat in this game feels solid and the AIs are of a reasonable difficulty, and the three difficulty levels make the game accessible for all gamers. Getting kills feels very satisfying and rewarding in this game, and you can even see the XP roll in as you deal damage.The gameplay in Brink is excellent and provides fun each time you play. The game is very clear with regards to the in-game objectives, as there is an 'objective wheel' which directs you towards each objective.In addition, the graphics in Brink are very good for the time and have features such as anti-aliasing and aniostropic filtering. The graphics engine used in Brink is very well optimised for the PC, so the game will run on most modern PCs.However, the primary objective can sometimes switch quickly and suddenly, which can make you a bit confused with where you need to be.Overall, Brink is an outstanding game and deserves much more respect than it gets, so I am giving it an official grade of A*.

												I know I will probably be in the minority with this, but I just found the game too difficult to control with keyboard/mouse combo.  Add to that the bullet sponge enemies and I just did not find the game enjoyable to play in the least.  Game looked and ran fine and I'm sure it has an audience for it.  If it offered out of the box controller support, I probably would have recommended it (and no, I'm not going to get involved in having to type in tons of console commands and all of that to get my controller to work).

												This is a game, that, unlike a lot of greenlight games, doesn't deserve punishment for low effort.  Why, then, is Brink a bad product?  Because it's the perfect product to show off everything that's BAD about the new era of online gaming.   A huge amount of effort went into look, feel, quality, construction.   But they did just enough to achieve that, and ignored all gameplay, but they hit you hard and fast with demands for DLC purchases.   It could have been a contender.  But it's everything that's bad about the microtransaction era and nothing that's good about it.   We have a lot to learn from this failure.Technical:  No support for 4K earns an immediate thumbs down when your strategy is to release a high graphics cutting edge game.   It's smooth and fluid enough, but optimisation could be better.  Graphics:  They hired artists and put in a huge amount of effort refining the look and feel of the game, as well as hiring great voice actors, so you would think this is thumbs up territory.   This is why we have so much to learn from this game.Gameplay: Now here's where it gets controversial.   It's a mediocre arena shooter (like there aren't hundreds of these) with a fairly well done art style and even a plotty single player campaign.   But the single player is just the mediocre arena shooter with mediocre bots.   But balanced around PvP, badly.   No effort was put into gameplay balance.  No effort was put into refining this after the massive amount of effort put into polishing the game.  There's actually a single player storyline that might be quite interesting if it wasn't for the horrendous miscarriage that is the gameplay.All the effort in this game went into polish and DLC options, and none of it into the heart and soul of gameplay.  They give you no doubts when it comes to making sure you know they want your money.  But for what?  There's far better free arena FPS games.  Final note:  At this stage it's 4 years after launch, and the online servers are abandoned.  Even if you wanted to pay money to have a worse experience than the free arena shooters, you can't because there's not enough players.   They still want $10 for the full package though.   Go buy $10 worth of donuts and play TF2, you'll have a much better time.			"

And I mean BEATEN, as in: highest rank, all weapons, all clothing options, etc.Have had more trouble with this game than my (currently) 95 other Steam games.Such potential, and good team game, is very fun when it works.

												I really do not see people's issues with this game. Its two great stories centered on a conflict both sides are making for themselves. You watch as the distopia of the ark crumbles into a war simply because the Security and their bosses wont tell the common people that the world outside the ark is in brutal, unrelenting, choas.  And the Common people are not telling the higher up the stuff the Ark is made of is Dying. If you own this game Give it a second chance, pay attention to everything. If you are thinking of buying it do it while it is on sale. The game is far from perfect, but it has nice tight controls and great customization. This game is far better than people give it credit for.			"

												I know I will probably be in the minority with this, but I just found the game too difficult to control with keyboard/mouse combo.  Add to that the bullet sponge enemies and I just did not find the game enjoyable to play in the least.  Game looked and ran fine and I'm sure it has an audience for it.  If it offered out of the box controller support, I probably would have recommended it (and no, I'm not going to get involved in having to type in tons of console commands and all of that to get my controller to work).

												This is a game, that, unlike a lot of greenlight games, doesn't deserve punishment for low effort.  Why, then, is Brink a bad product?  Because it's the perfect product to show off everything that's BAD about the new era of online gaming.   A huge amount of effort went into look, feel, quality, construction.   But they did just enough to achieve that, and ignored all gameplay, but they hit you hard and fast with demands for DLC purchases.   It could have been a contender.  But it's everything that's bad about the microtransaction era and nothing that's good about it.   We have a lot to learn from this failure.Technical:  No support for 4K earns an immediate thumbs down when your strategy is to release a high graphics cutting edge game.   It's smooth and fluid enough, but optimisation could be better.  Graphics:  They hired artists and put in a huge amount of effort refining the look and feel of the game, as well as hiring great voice actors, so you would think this is thumbs up territory.   This is why we have so much to learn from this game.Gameplay: Now here's where it gets controversial.   It's a mediocre arena shooter (like there aren't hundreds of these) with a fairly well done art style and even a plotty single player campaign.   But the single player is just the mediocre arena shooter with mediocre bots.   But balanced around PvP, badly.   No effort was put into gameplay balance.  No effort was put into refining this after the massive amount of effort put into polishing the game.  There's actually a single player storyline that might be quite interesting if it wasn't for the horrendous miscarriage that is the gameplay.All the effort in this game went into polish and DLC options, and none of it into the heart and soul of gameplay.  They give you no doubts when it comes to making sure you know they want your money.  But for what?  There's far better free arena FPS games.  Final note:  At this stage it's 4 years after launch, and the online servers are abandoned.  Even if you wanted to pay money to have a worse experience than the free arena shooters, you can't because there's not enough players.   They still want $10 for the full package though.   Go buy $10 worth of donuts and play TF2, you'll have a much better time.			"

												BRINK in a nutshell. Look at a gun! *game crashes*. Play a mission! *game crashes*. Do anything but customize your character, pick the weapons you want, and wonder why you bought this game since you already watched about 2 videos that said it was a PAIN to get it running, and knowing that you don't know how to do anything to fix the game, you buy it anyways, and never get it to run right.. *GASP* Okay... I'm going a bit too far here, it was my fault i bought this, but, if you don't know how to install all the patches you need to RUN brink, then don't buy it. No matter how much you try to get it to run without the patches, it wont work, trust me, all the time I spent on this game was retrying the missions waiting for one to actually go to the loading sequence and NOT freeze up and crash.BTW, anyone who thinks I'm over-reacting, just say so, I'm not the arguing type of person.

												Very solid team-based shooter. I played Enemy Territory competetively back in the day and always meant to pick up Brink, but got busy with other things and didn't want to get wrapped up in another multiplayer game at the time. Now that I've put some time into it I'm wondering what went wrong? It's a damn solid game... the few online games I managed to get into were extremely fun and there's a level of quality here that has really held up well over the last few years.In my opinion, Brink is one of those underestimated gems that could really benefit from the (yes, I know) free-to-play business model. A lot of people are probably hesitant to drop $20 on it, considering it rarely goes on sale- so they will never know how good it actually is. There's a ton of visual customization upgrades already built into the game, they should honestly just slap price tags on those and re-release Brink as F2P.			"

												Brink is your standard establishment versus rebels (government v terrorists) FPS story arc. The game itself has a relatively weak story, told mostly by a 1-2 minute cutscene before each mission, first narrated by your commander giving objectives, then from the perspective of the soldiers. This game definitely didn't invest heavily in the campaign as it is basically a series of objective missions with AI, which means having a friend is definitely a plus as the missions become much more enjoyable when playing with friends. Even with this, the game takes less than 7 hours to clear 100% meaning low return on your funds. The gameplay offers combat most similar to Killzone 2, there is a class system and there are weapons useable across classes but they have their trade offs, and there is a unique feature of this game which is the parkour system (freerunning). The classes follow the Killzone style, with the soldier, sabateur, engineer, and medic which offer some class abilities which differentiate them from one another. Furthermore there is weapon customization like call of duty where you can modify your weapons with attachments, the good news is most of the attachments are easy to get, thus most people are on a level playing field. The leveling of characters unlocks more abilities and makes the character's more diverse, the classes are relatively balanced although personally the medic seems to be one of the stronger classes minus his inability to perform objectives (which is what all gamemodes are around). The parkour/freerunning mechanic is the main draw of this game, you can essentially climb any wall within reason, jump ledges, slide under obstacles or behind cover. It is a feature which worked well and gave the game a good ""feel"" to it, as your mobility was greatly increased. The graphics are relatively good despite the style leaving some things to be desired, some regions have low res textures (even on max), the character models look extremely similar even with the customization options (although the contrast of the slums and the ark is well done in level design/graphical appearance). The problem with this game at the time of writting this review is the online is effectively dead, either being too laggy or being nobody playing ever, which is kind of depressing because I did enjoy the game despite its flaws, and the game is obviously orientated towards multiplayer. As a result I cannot recommend this game unless you can purchase it for very cheap and are looking for a gaming experience which takes between 5-10hours for everything.			"

												Brink is what happens when you put more money into marketing than development. Single player ""campaign"" is just multiplayer with (bad AI) bots. Multiplayer is repetitive and dull because of the objective-based maps. Character customization and the unique graphical style are the only positives about this game. There's tons of guns to play with but many feel the same and it's hard to tell them apart. Not worth your time or money.			"

If I had to pick ONE game to keep installed on my PC for the rest of my life, it would be Brink hands down. If not to play it, then at least for nostalgia's sake in memory of the fantastic times we shared. To appreciate it as a work of art, and a game design triumph.May be well past its prime, with a dead community and repetitive singleplayer... but pitch some Brink to me and I'll be down to play, any day.

This game is basically a bad comic-copy of a bad CoD game without any outstanding features. The single player is nothing else than the multiplayer with terrible AI. It's repetetive and not exciting. The customization is fine but it does not make the game any better. It's just no fun to play and I would not recommend buying this.			"

												What to say about BRINK.Primarily -- do not buy this game: it is multiplayer focused and currently has no online community, rendering it a dead product.This is a game that was touted with a great amount of potential in its ""free-running"" parkour-like movement system, its stylised aesthetic full of realistic human models and the plurality of their costumes and faces.Ultimately, while these two strong selling points partially deliver, the game is let down by its pathetic Artificial Intelligence system and buggy mutliplayer implementation, which killed it before it got out of the gate. The class system based on experience provides questionable benefits requiring a huge investment of time to unlock, quite a long time after you will be bored of the game itself. The free-running aspect which has an interesting slant to it suffers in execution: it is too difficult to navigate, often vertically, while still combining gunplay and avoiding opponents in the first person perspective.Avoid.

												Good mix of sp and mp game. Good audio-visuals. Nice (rather small/medium) maps. Great movement mechanics - very fluid. Various body types allow different weapons and different level of movement freedom (light - very fast and able to climb, medium - fast, but not that agile, thick - bullet sponge+turtle movement+no vertical advantage). Two factions offer different stories. Guns are ok and so are the perks. Classess are standard - engineer, assault, spy and medic. Customization of your character and weapons is pretty rich. Solo game allows bots, so you don't run all by yourself when people don't join. Game is objective based - there is no standard DM/TDM/CTF. I would say that it has potential, but something didn't click. It is still enjoyable even with bots - they tend to do well (not perfect but enough to win all maps and finish the story).  I still play it at times - a map or two. Fun thing.Performance on this is weird. It doesn't need powerful PC (I'd say weak on will do), but I faced sudden crashes on 2 of my machines (one under Win XP SP3 and Win 7 x64 Ultimate SP1 and laptop with Win 8.1 x64). Graphics is ok, nothing extreme in any direction. It has a touch of cartoon/cel shading. Sound is good (voice, guns, ambience). Controls are fine and the port seems solid (just those sudden crashes on different machines).			"

												Today's Review: BrinkPersonal Overview: At first i had doubts about this game, basically because by the time i got this game i was running on Windows 7 32bits, since the game requires at least a 64os system, i had to search for a patch to be able to play it, i was using the very same pc than that time but in that moment the game ran in minimun like crap (slow as 5 fps with fps drops and constant stuntering), 2 years later i've decided to install the game running under the same machine with Windows 7 64 and the experience was BEAUTIFUL, i'm talking about max resolution with high quality and even high quality process, and the game starts here:Brink is a first person shooter (FPS) set in a future where we live in the last human refugee ""The ARK"" a place is falling in decadence and there are 2 groups heavily armed and organized: one in favor to stay in the ARK in the middle of the ocean and fight for the place, and the other group wanting to leave and search for another place, game resambles pretty much the online part of call of duty black ops 2, history is set as multiplayer maps with an objective, there are some RPG factors as ""abilities"" (at first you think, i might trust ID to make an fps, they have a story with it, but bethesta? let me tell you, YES!)Overall Metascore: 87/100 ""Exelent piece of work, get it!""

												A disapointment. Upon purchasing Brink I regretted my desision. Poorely optimized, unfocused art and sound design, an overall abrasive experience. This is the game where I learned feel comes before features.			"

												""The future of shooters...""yeah, that's what some big-time pre-reviewer said about the game months before it came out.Maybe ""Brink"" is the secret subconscious symbolic Illuminati slang-short for Boring(k).What can I say, for the past few months up until present half the New York City buses had the Brink ads on either side posted.The game has been given special care, very special care...by the advertisers. I also feel bad for people who pre-ordered this game.If one was to take one quick general look at the game, he or she wouldn't necessarily find anything wrong with it. But that's the thing about Brink. It has a catchy name and flashy gun fights, but underneath it all is either broken or overdone mechanics.Don't get me wrong, the weapon recoil is realistic and short burst from just about any gun will do the job. In general the gun-shooting feels right, but sometimes it does take more than a magazine clip to clip someone.I like the general mobility of the character you play but I was under the impression that there would be more wall bouncing, and more obstacles to easily climb on and climb through. So for the most part, you will end up doing the same thing: sprint, slow down, peek, crouch, shoot, step back and reload, repeat until you are dead or bleeding, respawn, repeat...Well, there are team objectives to complete, but most of these objectives are same or similar - we've seen it all before.I also realize that plenty of multiplayer games out there have the auto-healing, which I quite frankly despise. But this game takes it to a whole other level. Your health fully regenerates within 4-5 seconds, the only time you need a medic is when you are bleeding on the ground which is when a medic can run up and give you the adrenaline serum.There is also less than ten maps. And I KNOW what they are going to do next. In a couple of months or so, they will anounce a DLC with ""ALL THREE NEW MAPS"" for 10 bucks or so....There's no single-player to speak of. I mean it looks like there is one, but once you start playing for either the resistance or the security forces, all you end up with are short skits between skirmishes-NO STORY MODE. Each successful skirmish (map) is slightly harder than the previous one, but all it really is the multiplayer play against the AI - fulfilling the same redundant objectives over and over again.There are also mirror-edge kind of stunts that you can do, only i found the mechanics to be slightly awkward. If you bounce off the walls the right way, you also get points (same for kills) that you later use for customization. So the outcome of your stunts isn't always clear.I can't comment on the severity of the multiplayer bugs and the lag just yet. Maybe the PC servers are slightly better than their console counter-parts, or maybe I got lucky, but they are also much less numerous.The customization was meant to give the overt feeling of individualism, but in the end, it doesn't matter as much, at least to me. The ironic thing however is that after developing my character a little, I was more interested in customizing my weapons and dressing up my avatar as opposed to playing the actual game.Overall, the weapon customization is the one that matters, but that has all been done before in other games.The graphics aren't bad, but they aren't impressive either.I also found it interesting how the soldier class has infinite ammo. This was supposed to be the city on the b.r.i.n.k. of complete collapse, yet somehow you can have infinite ammo.Furthermore, the grenade explosions are laughable. You can also hear the sound of you running but if you look down, you will not see your legs. Also, since this is a port, the aim of your mouse will auto-aim for you as if you are a playing on a controller, cool huh?The so-called co-op in this game doesn't really apply. Because the single player is the same as the multiplayer. It's the same as playing co-op in Battlefield 2 BC, but at least that game has squads, and it is also better at doing everything, and stuff...All in all, there's no real incentive to help out your team mates by giving up your ammo and health serums. You can if you want to, but you don't have to. You can just continue blasting and hoping to get a kill. I am sorry for thinking back to Battlefield, but that game makes you want to help out your team mates and squad mates and rewards that splendid.One of my main gripes with the game is the way it was shown to be in previews and trailers. And that tells you a lot about the Art of Ads. I would also like to know what exactly is so revolutionary about this game.In general, I always thought that the future of shooters started with Battlefield Bad Company 2 and it will probably end with Battlefield 3.In the end, I think Bethesda should have focused more on making the next Fallout, only this time in NYC.P.S. The elongated, pickle-head faces are annoying			"

												What was an interesting concept turned into a burning tire rolling down a hill. The game is well polished and has a interesting art style that isnt to bold but the fact that this ""storytelling"" game relys completely on multiplayer gameplay to flesh out the plot makes it crash and burn.I feel all games should be able to support themselves on some form of single player gameplay. If the player cannot enjoy the game by themselves then there isn't any point to it. Granted you can play with bots but after two ""matches"" the player feels confined in the adequately programmed AI. This game's multiplayer is dead as well since a majority of people who were interested in this game wised up and went on to do better things with their time.But if you have a bunch of friends and extra cash coupled with free time I can see this being a worth while thing. But that is the only circumstance this game is viable for.			"

												FIRST impressions, after only a very little amount of play: seems to be a Team Fortress clone, except with slightly more flexible movement but not nearly as fun. Will update this as I go on...Enemies that kill you in one shot (ONE FRICKING SHOT!!??), but it takes 2 clips including multiple headshots to kill them... I guess that's considered a ""challenge"" rather than ""cheating""? What happened to actually making things challenging, rather than changing the rules of physics?Quite frankly, after a couple of hours of enduring (I use the term accurately) a ""game"" like this, I fail to see the attraction. Team Fortress is MUCH more fun, this game just makes things annoying. For instance, I get LAG - opponents teleport across the screen - even though I'm playing completely solo. WTF is that about?			"

												Honestly, not really all that terrible. Not exactly the greatest shooter ever made, but I had some fun with it. The massive technical issues have been ironed out since launch as well. Biggest problem you'd have is that no one plays it now, and as a multiplayer game, that's kind of important. There are bots, but they don't substitute for real players. Only way I could recommend this is if you had a group of friends who also want to play a mediocre shooter with you.			"

												Brink is unfortunately one of these games that gets the formula right for what it is trying to do but fails to deliever that special something that makes it a great game. It is a good game and would actually be a fun coop shooter to play with friends but I doubt in all honesty that anyone could recommend you buy this game. Which is a shame, it was close to delievering something pretty special but somehow missed the mark.If you want a summary of points why you shouldn't get this:-Bad AI which is incredibly stupid.-No Online Community, it's dead.-Weapons feel kind of all the same.-Levels feel a bit cramped and too linear.-Movement system can be a bit unresponsive or difficult; you find yourself never really going where you want/aim to go.

I do recommend this game but only if it goes on sale for 5$-15$ you should buy it for.what the story is about is you choseing a side on wether to defend the ark or against the ark.with this you have a total of 8 misson's on each side both haveing 2 diffrent endings and 2 on each what-if missons creating 2 alternate endings on each side  pros-Lots of weapons-lots of customization-lots of apperence options -3 roles to play as (light,medium,heavy) all having diffrent atributes -2 diffrent endings -total of 16 missons all together(excluding dlc missons)-diffrent classes (soldier,medic,engineer,operative)-parkour-great artcons-stupid AI-forgetable campaign-bad graphics-not to many people playing online-certain customization options are permanent(tattoos and scars) they add realism but be careful-can not use xbox 360 or ps3 duel shock 3 controls for game you will have to go in to codeing and set it inconclusion you should buy brink but only when it is on sale for 5$-15$ if you are realy into fps parkour with stupid AI also with a forgetable story but yet lots of weapons and customization then ya buy it. THIS GAME GETS A 7.5-10.I HOPE THIS REVIEW HAS HELPED YOU DECIDE WETHER YOU SHOULD BY THE GAME			"

												What is the best way to describe Brink....well TF2 had sex with Quake Enemy Territory and they had a child. Counter Strike Source had sex with Borderlands and they had a child.Years later the children of those two families met and had sex and BRINK was born , and destined to rule over the land of objective team based  first person shooters.Later he would go on to become King of all games by his own hand.....but that is another story.......

												Em primeiro lugar uma decepção sem dúvida alguma.BRINK é um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa desenvolvido pela Splash Damage e publicado pela Bethesda Softworks para Windows, PlayStation 3 e Xbox 360 Lançado em 2011.Brink tem lugar na Arca, uma cidade feita pelo homem flutuante que está à beira de uma guerra civil.Ela deveria abrigar 5.000 pessoas, no entanto está abrigando aproximadamente 50.000. Desta forma, esta situação se torna insustentável e os residentes começam a ficar rapidamente insatisfeitos com a falta de comida, roupas e água potável, assim nasce  ""Resistance"", que luta pela adequado fornecimento desses suprimentos. Com as tensões entre os dois grupos em crescimento, forças de segurança e resistência são trancados em uma batalha aquecida para o controle da Arca.Após a negação deste fornecimento pelos líderes da Arca, a Resistance se prepara para tentar tomar o poder e distribuir água e comida gratuitamente, uma vez que defendem a idéia de que a Arca tem recursos renováveis suficientes para tal. Com as tensões entre os dois grupos em crescimento, forças de Security e Resistance são trancados em uma batalha aquecida para o controle da Arca.É possível jogar com ambas as facções, Security ou Resistance.Single-player, co-op e jogabilidade multiplayer até 16 jogadore uma experiência perfeita, também permitindo-lhe desenvolver o seu personagem. BRINK focado em movimentos de Parkour aonde precisamente não tem nada de especial, depois não existe prazer ao jogar simplesmente não da vontade de continuar o que é muito negativo.Tinha tudo para ser um excelente jogo mas falhou.Já tentei jogar este jogo 3 vezes 3 oportunidades para mim é impossivel não consigo.Which side will you choose?Humiliation ★☆☆☆☆			"

												Hey you guys its me reviewing (after three years upon it's release) Brink.First off, no I can't really explain the campaign to you guys, as I haven't been able to get past a certain mission, because the AI goes full retard mode on the second objective...I'll get it eventually, BY MYSELF.And second any idiot who says the shooting in this game is awefull or the storyline sucks, is a dunce, who is used to the real crappy plots, and shots, like 'modern warfare' and 'black ops' (aka♥♥♥♥♥♥of dooty).Now I will admit I expected so much more out of the engine that created 'Rage' another wrongfully bashed game, but this game scratches that Itch that I so badly wanted from rage...PVP SHOOTERthis game is incredibly complex wit class skills, aside from weapons, and smoothe character and weapons customization.all in all it is an ok game the multiplayer is kinda dead but only because people thrive on negativity, so thusly to one guy its bad so everyone else must follow.7.8/10			"

												The poster-boy for failure to launch. The trailers and previews were dotted with lies, talking about a ""seamless experience"" and how you would want to fight with your faction to ""control"" parts of the ARK. Consistently, they implied it would be an MMOFPS-style game, where you'd move between zones, then be pulled into multiplayer encounters.What we got was a bog-standard, class-based, objective-focused FPS with a half-baked parkour system, decent character customization, janky controls and extremely spotty hit detection/lag compensation. Regularly you will die without knowing why, or pound a clip into an opponent only to be killed by a single shot in reprisal.As others have said, this game is garbage. Ignoring the fact that the servers are likely dead as hell by now, it should be a stern reminder (and is to me,) to never preorder without all the facts. I wish that the store rating system had existed back when Brink came out--I could've helped save a lot of people 60$.I still wear the TF2 hat they gave me for preordering as a reminder to be vigiliant.As a reminder... of my shame.

												i'm started playing single player 3 nights ago 8/28/2014, installed from DVD and activated and updated through steam. i get under 20FPS and overclocking my FX8350 to 4.4 had no effect, so it is not a CPU bottleneck, also my HD7870 is @30-40%i struggled through the first few missions with the 17-19fps on the rebel side until i noticed the broken AI. i'm on a defend mission for the first 5 and a half minutes of defending i kill about 15 enemies, with most of the fighting being done in a different area by the AI controlled players.  then the last 30 seconds of the defense hits, then ALL OF THE ENEMY AI converge on my point, i manage to kill 1-2, then the 17-19fps drops even lower to a 10-15fps making it to were the AI are able to kill me and i feel like i am moving in slow motion, which is sickning.  so they capture point 1, some doors open then i have to defend a safe. same story, no enemies close to the objective for the time of the mission, until the last 30 seconds, then all of them converge on the point, take it in to overtime and also dropping the frame rate back down to 10-15fps, if it wasn't for me having a little better of a position they would of won.

												Oo, This Game... For any of you that Haven't seen Angry Joe's review of this Game, let me Summarize:Brink is an unfinished, buggy as hell, frustrating mess of a game that has a lot of great ideas, but little to no Execution. The Parkour mixed with Guns gameplay seemed like a good idea, but it ends up being a watered down version of Mirror's Edge. In places, that's honestly what this game strives to be. It tries so unbelievably hard to be good, but it just misses the mark. Brink was a good idea, and had it been executed properly, I'm sure that it could've been good. But, it just doesn't make it, I'm Afraid.I Give BRINK 4/10 (Far Below Average)			"

												EDIT: Just changed my rating to negative (it should have always been), since Steam didn't allow for negative reviews at the time I wrote this.Brink is the poster child for trying to do many things right, and failing at every single one.It is a class-based multiplayer FPS. Don't even try to play it single player, since you will still be playing on the small multiplayer maps, but with idiotic bots.This game, in attempting to mimic Team Fortress 2's success (and style), attempts to fix things that weren't broken, introduce new mechanics that are pointless and frustrating, and ignore every legitimate issue.Classes are hardly any different at all (at least in the beginning), with identical mechanics. Literally the only fundamental difference is what you face when you hold down your use key.Get ready to spam your use key, die a LOT, and question existential things such as ""what's the point of it all?"" Or better yet, just don't buy it. If you already did, delete it. It is the aborted fetus of Mirror's Edge and Team Fortress 2, that somehow still lives, wandering around horrifying people.

The guns, as good as they look and sound, are all fairly weightless and boring with absurd recoil and hideous animations.

												i'm started playing single player 3 nights ago 8/28/2014, installed from DVD and activated and updated through steam. i get under 20FPS and overclocking my FX8350 to 4.4 had no effect, so it is not a CPU bottleneck, also my HD7870 is @30-40%i struggled through the first few missions with the 17-19fps on the rebel side until i noticed the broken AI. i'm on a defend mission for the first 5 and a half minutes of defending i kill about 15 enemies, with most of the fighting being done in a different area by the AI controlled players.  then the last 30 seconds of the defense hits, then ALL OF THE ENEMY AI converge on my point, i manage to kill 1-2, then the 17-19fps drops even lower to a 10-15fps making it to were the AI are able to kill me and i feel like i am moving in slow motion, which is sickning.  so they capture point 1, some doors open then i have to defend a safe. same story, no enemies close to the objective for the time of the mission, until the last 30 seconds, then all of them converge on the point, take it in to overtime and also dropping the frame rate back down to 10-15fps, if it wasn't for me having a little better of a position they would of won.

												An FPS game made by Bethesda with in depth class sets, player customization, an interesting story and incredibly fun parkour? What could go wrong!? So much......Brink was one of my top picks at E3 in 2010. Projecting tactical gameplay, of the likes seen in Counter Strike and an abundance of customizations for weapons and characters alike. Unfortunatly this game goes down as one of my most dissapointing purchases. Everything that was presented fell short. With the customization lacking the depth that was promised, the four class sets becoming incredibly boring, so many glitches that the AI becomes undefeatable and a story that grows incredibly boring it wasnt even necessary to have. Playing as the bad guys is fun, weapons are balanced and parkour is spot on. But there is more negatives than positives in Brink and for that I give it a 5/10.			"

												The poster-boy for failure to launch. The trailers and previews were dotted with lies, talking about a ""seamless experience"" and how you would want to fight with your faction to ""control"" parts of the ARK. Consistently, they implied it would be an MMOFPS-style game, where you'd move between zones, then be pulled into multiplayer encounters.What we got was a bog-standard, class-based, objective-focused FPS with a half-baked parkour system, decent character customization, janky controls and extremely spotty hit detection/lag compensation. Regularly you will die without knowing why, or pound a clip into an opponent only to be killed by a single shot in reprisal.As others have said, this game is garbage. Ignoring the fact that the servers are likely dead as hell by now, it should be a stern reminder (and is to me,) to never preorder without all the facts. I wish that the store rating system had existed back when Brink came out--I could've helped save a lot of people 60$.I still wear the TF2 hat they gave me for preordering as a reminder to be vigiliant.As a reminder... of my shame.

												I'll be frank, I had higher expectations. I heard free-style FPS and came running, but found a slightly mediocre game compared to the hype I had built. Credit where it is due, it is customizable in both character and weapons, with playstyles to suit each person's needs. Take a Heavy class, and mow the opposition down with your weapons, or choose the light class and be sprinting around and above the enemy, always staying just out of range. Mediocre game, if on sale a good pick if you want a fun shooter.			"

												I played this game at first in Iraq on some bootleg hodge copy. It was great between the platoon and I at first in-between patrols. When I came back state-side I purchased the bethesda bundle they had a couple years ago and I was slightly filled with delight when I saw this game in the package. Unfortunately the game was all hype as the FPS content is terrible. Despite how you gun down an enemy, they can always be resusitated via a nearby player regardless of loadout. Needless to say this game was built solely on empty promises. Dont waste your time or money on it.			"

I dont recommend it cause the community is dead, still has some dedicated servers up, a few players, bots and campaign mode but isnt that enjoyable multiplayer experience.The game: 2 factions, 4 classes, freestyling and shooting each other, tanking points or protecting VIP (and VIThings) on a few maps.

												It's okay, I guess. The visuals are alright and the music is awesome, but there's not much else going for it. The guns, as good as they look and sound, are all fairly weightless and boring with absurd recoil and hideous animations. Framerates are incredibly unreliable, with un-toggleable depth of field etc. Get it if it's cheap and you really want it, but otherwise I'd say avoid it.			"

												Brink? More like Uninstalled: The Video GameUgh I was really hesitant to buy this knowing full well what I was getting into and folded to peer pressure by people who quite honestly were ignorant of the game's development history. I don't claim to be an expert on it, but I knew I played enough QUAKE WARS to know that Brink was a game to wait on reviews for before purchasing.I viewed Quake Wars as a preview to Brink's philosophy. Quake Wars required intense pub cooperation that was above and beyond most players' expectations of simple and straightforward team deathmatch.Brink's primarily failing was pretty simple to me. It didn't present a preview of each map to the player, leading everybody who played it to get lost, or behave in a way that was disadvantageous to them because of designed ignoranceThe game's pacing is just plain slow and unrewarding. Even the competitive scene panned this game, The GIANTBOMB.COM CLICK QUICK LOOK http://www.giantbomb.com/brink/61-26694 "

												I have a controversial opinion about this game It seems that there are dynamics of battle, and like it is not. Brink does not have enough speed, the speed of the gameplay. I understand that this is a port of the game with the PS3 and xbox360, but why so few options ... Brink can not be called ''perfect game for qick 420 blaze it qick scope'' etc.Pluses + :• Awesume history and adventure.• Decent test system with stars passing ★★★• Good game design (If it would be more game details, then maps be great)• Wonderful OST and audio part of the game.Defects - :• Graphics for the 2011 years is nice, there weapons drawn perfectly, but when before you fly like a piece of pomegranate fuzzy soap impression that shet texture painted 6 years ago.• Physics in Brink just puzzles many concepts of physics, such as a = (v₁ - v₀) / m the acceleration of gravity, then grenades and other flying wherever he wants.• Bad online make this game so lonely...♦ Outcome ♦•This game deserves the attention of those people who like something non-standard. One play will be boring after 2-3 hours of passing the mission. There is something from the game The Club. Console players will feel right at home here.			"

No women, no interesting looking people, just ugly samey looking junk. Completely pointless editor which means that they didn't include any proper or different looking characters and is just an excuse to make you grind for junk.Online suicided a long time ago.

												0/10 completely worthless because of one of the dumbest things I've ever seen, it locks your fps to 30 in offline solo play, which is bad since mp has been dead from day 1, and because its overall quality is severely lacking and is often completely deprived of basic necessary qualities.I've always wanted to see if this was decent because it looked alright and I read you could set up your own dedicated private server to play solo to avoid the incredibly stupid 30 fps single player cap. I got it for $3 on humblebundle and did all that. Turns out you can't progress the campaign missions that way, it's just private online solo play. Offline solo locks the game at 30fps, online solo/co-op lets you hit 60fps. One of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Anyway, I was lucky and when I selected campaign online co-op mode there was amazingly a couple servers and one had a 50 ping so I could actually play the campaign missions at 60fps. I was the only person on it with 15 other bots of course. But how long would that server be up and why was it in the first place? Who knows who ♥♥♥♥ing cares, time to give the game a fair chance.It turned out to be the worst team shooter I have ever played, like a really crappy rip-off of TF2. It is junky, clunky, and janky, with the graphics and sounds being its only worthwhile points. The only game mode I saw was either defend a point or attack a point. The side objectives are mostly pointless and are just worthless distractions from the real goal. Some are useful, like blowing up a wall to make a shorter point to the objective, but the enemy can easily swarm it, kill you and all the bots there, and patch it up, or just close it back up when nobody is around which is very easily done. So really the gameplay is extremely basic.Teammate AI can be decent but are mostly just a bunch of dumber than hell bots. Enemy AI is worse and are very poorly balanced. They either stand there while you kill them, fire back a little, or are one-shot kill masters. That was the biggest problem I came across and it is bad. Quite often when you suddenly come up on a enemy they will one-shot headshot kill you in a millisecond before you can react. It is extremely annoying. The other huge problem that is constantly aggravating is some of the most annoying knockback I have ever seen. It is caused by enemies melee'ing you when in close or by grenade blast radius. Your entire view gets knocked back and lowered to simulate a knockback/knockdown combination effect. It is violent and jarring and massively irritating. It's like getting the most annoying video game b-tch slap in gaming history and it happens a lot. As far as the missions go, some are easily fail-able with no proper indication as to why. I failed mission 5 3 times in a row when I thought we were doing well, defending a point that it told me to. That was the point when combined with the overall bad quality of the entire game, made me uninstall this and try to forget I ever wasted my time on this total mess.The game is just overall a badly executed poor man's version of much more competent team shooters like TF2 and even another dead game, Battleborn. In fact this game makes me want to actually reinstall Battleborn just to play the new mission and two new characters they put out since I quit.			"

												Это ""игра"" меня просто разочаровала. Bethesda впервые сделала то, что мнеТАК не понравилось. Кампания однообразна, а мультиплеер ничем не отличается от кампании - теже миссии что и в компании. Графика сама по себене плоха, но смарт система все портит. В общем дорогая игра недостойная таких денег (599 руб) - 2/10.			"

Ultimately, though, the clumsy parkour mechanics and lack of true variety left me disappointed. In a gaming world dominated by shooters, it's not hard to find something better.

												So when I was a young boy this spectacle of wire frame sliding beauty came. By that I mean the commerciaks were great... but those charlatans!!! People put hard work into this game and that is apparent but the pay off seems to have missed their mark.The main draw to this game was it's hip new slidey macho man randy savage charm that ""at the time"" seemed inovative and life long...but friends, we were fools.The fast paced shooter has expected elements in a team based FPS including escort, bomb, death match, etc..  It's a bit hectic at times but there is pay off when you pull off elaborate plays utilizing your class ability or equipment. The problem reveals it self when the clunky mobility system drowns out the noise of any seperation from the classes or exchanges of carefully picked equipment. Normally this is a sought after quality when talking about shooters, but the poop in the room that nobody wants to talk about it right under your shoe. The lag spikes (unfortunately they happen alot) along with the dead servers (1-800-CALLMEIFYOUPLAYBRINK), clunky parkour mechanic (#parkourlyfe) and completely vegetable like AI that not only lets you down, but they make you feel sad about real life vegetables. This game shot for the stars but ended up shooting their friend in the woods whilst hunting. Sometimes you can take a buck home friends, but sometimes you kill frank from accounting.-☆☆☆ 3 STARS-NOT A BAD SHOOTER-CLASSES WERE FUN TO PLAY WITH-GHOST TOWN-CLUNKY SOFTCORE PARKOUR-AI IS YOUR NEW MENTALLY CHALLENGED COUSIN			"

												Most dissapointing game of 2011? Yeah. All the hype created over those trailers- the beautiful concept and possibility.I blame the developers for their decision to stray from the intended path and into the ""cartoonish"" and unrealistic mess the game turned out to be. Personally, I'm not a fan of playing the same storyline twice with only minimal changes(Plant the bomb this time, stop them from planting the bomb next time)- Not only does the campaign have you do both storylines, no time has passed in the game either way- playing as the Security stopping the Rebels from planting the bomb you planted during your Rebel playthrough, for example. The only thing about this game more broken than the story is the combat, nobody dies until you have killed them twice.  First you have to knock them down, say with a headshot of a couple slugs to the chest, you then have to do the same once more to kill them.Just get Blacklight: Retribution, much better, free, not BRINK.

												The game was disappointing enough as a full-price retail release that required Steamworks. It delivers on none of the hype, and a lack of care permeates every aspect of its design, from the imbalanced maps and weapons to the completely uninspired unlock system and lack of features or content. To this day, the game feels unfinished and barely received support after launch. A stain on the name of the studio who brought you the Enemy Territory series, not even Bethesda wants anything to do with it, as they've apparently shut down the master server and now you can only connect directly to servers by specifying IP addresses. A true example of squandered potential, it's not worth your money or your time.			"

												Brink is a perfect example of a brillinat idea that is executed in a soso manner. Enemy territory players will feel pretty much at home with this, it tries something fresh in terms of every match having a story, a reason behind it, with outcomes based on the winning team. Art style is pretty nice, customization is very fun to use (only issue is you can't custom color your items, just pre-sets.) Sadly I am not sure if many people still play this game, as it had mixed to poor critical review due to bad console versions, but you would have to look into that if you are interested. The game is not for everyone, but if it is for you, someone who loves team based games with a twist, you'll adore this game and look past the flaws. If you are looking for just pure shooter, avoid it.			"

(True story, not mine though).I got quickly tired of the game, unless you play like a rabid flying squirrel on LSD jumping on everything possible and shooting while doing the most hideous of wall runs and jumps you have no way of gaining the upper hand, because this is the norm.Friendly tip: Check steamcharts.com for steam user activity for the game you have interest in as of today Brink has a crazy amount of 35peak players today and 417peak player all time.TL;DR : Avoid because the game is dead some people are just really slow in realizing it.

												Tl;dr: A fun FPS that brings something new into the market. If you're into Character Customization, be warned that there aren't female characters.Brink is a fun game overall. Gameplay is nice, teams are balanced, and nobody goes home a loser. The fighting is relatively simple. Aim, shoot, kill. But then you factor in ammo resupplies, damage buffs, and armor enhancement, and it complicates the equation. Complicate meaning ""funnifies"" in this usage. Plus, the movement is unique. Holding sprint activates a kind of ""dynamic parkour"" feature that allows you to find new paths and move around more fluidly. This also allows for some characters to vault walls taller than them. Class perks and abilities are cool, being able to give someone a damage buff or resupply of ammo. There is also a cool perk system, which as you level up allows for more abilities and tricks to be available to the character. Instead of set perks, they are bought by level coins, a nice feature in my opinion.The story is engaging, albeit short. Depending on which side you play, you get both sides of the story. You can replay any mission as either side and learn their views and reason for fighting. Alongside the main campaign (which can be played solo or multiplayer), there is freeplay and challenges. Freeplay is exactly what it sounds like. Challenges are different tasks that test your ability to use the ingame skillset. The only qualm I have is with 'Parkour This'; I love the parkour aspect of the fighting, but in no way did I ask for you to require me to master it to unlock silencers.I love the character customization. Very simple, clean, and creative. Two things: No girls, and no custom facial/bodily features. I find the lack of girls sad (if you emphasize character customization, you dang better have both genders!) but not game ruining. Yeah, it'd be nice to seduce my enemies into not shooting me, but it's okay to have only guys. The only thing that really grinds my gears is that you are locked to a specific set of facial setups. No big pouty lips and anime eyes here, just a couple dozen near identical faces. On the bright side, each clothing piece comes in an assortment of colors (which often change the patterns of the clothes as well). The face paint and tattoos partially fulfill me in the way of face modification. Overall it's nice, but still makes the character customization just feel like chara custo.One aspect this game displays nicely in gun modification. You can attach multiple enhancements to your gun. That's it. You get a few sights, a couple muzzle brakes (purely cosmetic, still fun), and if you try hard enough, silencers and speed holsters/slings. No camos, nor extreme performance enhancements (which adds to the argument of team balance).Overall I give it an 8.5/10, really fun to play, but has a couple bugs and missing features that kind of harm the gameplay. If you have the money, it's worth it.8.5/10, would knockdown again.(Btw, the reason I complain about Brink not having girls while CoD and Battlefield don't is that advertising character customization implies having women; and I don't think that CoD or Battlefield said that there was a totall of 100+ quadrillion total combinations.)

												This game is beyond the most strategic and action-packed arena game as of late. Indeed the characters are curiously modeled, but it's just Brink's unique graphics. No other arena game- save perhaps Halo Reach, has such a multitude of combinations to create a truly unique character. I suppose there may not be anymore dedicated servers, I've never noticed a different between them and private hosted servers, which Brink has.If you haven't bought the game; buy it. And if you own it, join the Brink universe again, get it back on it's feet.Call of Duty has an impressive arsenal, sure, but there's absolutely no strategy involved, and I'm not certain as I've given up on that franchise, but as far as I'm concerned doesn't have character customizations, as with Brink, your character evolves as you progress. And the combat, with some games it's too complex, or the game itself pratically fights for you, but with Brink you have inumerable ways to approach a firefight, with inumerable guns, and as a character with no equal.

												This game is actually no worse than Battlefield 4 and other similar titles like Call of Duty. The problem is Battlefield and Call of Duty are mediocre games, and they use expensive marketing, DLC packages, yearly releases, and massive funding to stay in business. There was also no real benefit to the style of matches you play in Brink, or the class based gameplay. It was just a game you easily forget and move on from, something people should do to this entire genre.			"

Beeing a fan of games made with any version of ID Tech engine, i bought this game some time ago.The game itself looks nice, but the gameplay is kind of weird. Stupid bot's and deserted servers showing the obvious how good this game is. It was a nice idea that didn't lived up to the expectations i had when i purchased it. Now it stays in my library as a black spot that can't be erased. To make a long story short. I will not advise anyone to buy it now. If you want a game with ID Tech, there are plenty others arround with time consuming and fun factor gameplay. Such as Enemy Territory : Quake Wars ( Not in the Steamstore anymore ) or RAGE .			"

												For all that hipsters and cynics love to mock it, we owe a lot to Brink. It was Brink that set the benchmark for how shooters looked and played in the HD era. It was Brink that redefined the FPS as all-action blockbuster, while transforming multiplayer.The premise is interesting, albeit faintly ridiculous. In the near future a new power – The Federation – rises in South America and its influence begins to spread across the world.  Federation forces attack a US orbital weapon and turn its weapons of mass destruction against the US, blasting half of the states back into the stone age and putting an end to North American dominance of the region.Brink's one shining aspect is SMART (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain). Using SMART, holding a single button lets you navigate up walls, over obstacles, and through the game world. Depending on your body size, you can do more or less with movement, but overall this finesse is fantastic. Nothing in Brink feels quite as good as sliding under gunfire into someone, taking them out with a shotgun.Brink is by far the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game my friends have ever played! 7/10 A Masterpiece.			"

												This is exactly what I expected. It is Enemy territory. I do wish that there was more of a solo/coop 4 man squad campaign, its not that the bots dont work, and its not that the cutscenes and flow isnt there, its not single player campaign its a solo multiplayer design. there nothing new with that. What is new is the smooth seemless SMART. This is the best exp in mantling since COD4MW. reduced jumping kills bunny hopping but with SMART it doesnt feel like you cant climb up there or jump there. If only players would play a full solo campaign on HARD before joining an mp match. the greatest weakness in this game is the online players.8/10 - higher if there was more of a SP style story for solo.maybe in a MOD or DLC.

												Brink is a good game for a good price. Why? Let me tell you.- Wonderful execution in the control department. Very fluid gameplay, I did not have to change any of the controls from default. It is very smooth. Maybe it's just smooth for me, considering I've spent an embarassingly long time sitting in front of my computer playing Brink.- If you play single player, you will find the AI is on par. They have their weak moments, most definitely. But overall, they function fairly well.- Actual gameplay is more ""shoot everything that moves"" rather than being on the tactical side. If you like to sit on your laurels and snipe people, this game will not be your favorite. If you generally play a tank-like character who rolls in to battle and blows up everything that breathes, you will love this game.- Sometimes has the feel of a FPS tower defense game. Especially if you play as an engineer. But I don't mind that aspect, and actually enjoy it.- Multiplayer is well developed, but could use more maps and the entire game could use more weapons. You can at least unlock attachments for your guns through the challenge mode included in the main game.- Campaign is interesting. You can play as radical terrorists on the Resistance side or as the grounded Security. There is no advantage or disadvantage to the sides. Weapons are the same. Appearance is only slightly tweaked (different jackets, hair styles, etc etc). I prefer the Security story line only because I like the appearance and dialog better. The story could have been more developed and more levels included, but I can't complain that much. I completed the campaign in a few hours. Replaying it has kept me occupied for a good while, however. Maybe it's jsut because I'm a simple person. My favorite aspect of the entire campaign and story is that you can play both sides and see how the story develops and progresses as you complete levels and objectives. Save the ""Ark"" or destroy it.OVERALL RATING: 8.8 out of 10. Polished game. Few bugs. Keeps you occupied for a while. Would have liked it to be longer and more in depth with more variation in gameplay. Brink is a good game for a good price.			"

												I totally wanted BRINK to be much more popular.  I loved playing it. As a huge fan of Splash Damage's Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, I was anticipating this greatly.  I loved all the mechanics, but I felt like it could have used a bit more polish before release.  I recommend it because I think it's a good game, despite the lackluster reviews it got. It's too bad it never caught on, because I would have loved to see where the story would have gone.  Story?  From a competitive shooter you say? I'm crazy like that.			"

												The game is actually pretty fun to play, even solo. Obviously a LOT better with friends. It's cool that you can customize your character as well.The biggest gripe I have with this game is the story. It's incredibly short, and really not all that great. The intro scenes before each map seem pretty pointless to me as well. Every intro basically goes the same way: your character stands around holding their gun (and not really doing anything else...) while the other characters complain about the mission as genericly as possible.I would recommend this game for anyone looking for a shorter shooter to tide them over until the next Call of Duty or Battlefield game (which isn't a long wait anyway...), but try to purchase the game while it's on sale. $10 is really the most I would say this is worth, and even that is kinda pushing it....(I personally only paid $5, if I recall correctly)			"

												I was looking forward to this game for about a year, since the early announcement and release with a friend of mine.I played half an hour on release date. I spent at least twice that time alternately crying and moaning with my friend about it on skype.Has potential, in both story and gameplay, but it feels rushed. Character classes are mediocre and frankly not very distinct from each other. There is a 'high level of customisation' but is not easily unlockable - and the matchmaking system confused me.Would not recommend unless less than £5 on the steam sales, and even then the indie games would probably give you more entertainment.So sad :(			"

All that is just playing solo, not to add on all the multi player, the whole game can be played with other's.  Great story, can play both sides, character cuztomization is outstanding. I would give this game a 10/10. One down fall tho, there is no Xbox 360 remote compatability. Other than that , which i hope they fix, this game is perfict.			"

It's not AMD's fault they never tested it on an ATI card.I'm annoyed that the standard shotgun and revolver are worthless but they made up for it by making the SMGs have a lot of power. If you do need an SMG try the bullpup one as it is also incredibly accurate.			"

												Brink is a fantastic take on the FPS genre. Following similar style to TF2, Brink offers everything CoD doesn't, teamwork, full gun and character customization, class based combat and co-op. What's to hate? Majority of the critics are stupid fools playing on Xbox who have a mind set of, CoD CoD CoD CoD, Call of Duty isn't everything! Brink has one of the greatest weapon customization menus out of any game I know, immense character customization, dedicated servers, co-op, single player, multiplayer, Single player and multiplayer that link simultaneously online and offline, and classes the offer different game play types each game, every time Brink is a step above. I recommend to true FPS fans who enjoy teamwork, playing with mates and not the 12 year old's that think everything but Call of Duty is bad. 9/10 Game.			"

												So this one time I was playing Dystopia, and then everyone stopped playing Dystopia because of all the bugs. Luckily, the guys at Bethesda and Splash Damage realized that the best way to get us all back into Dystopia was to create a game that made Dystopia's bugs look much more pleasant by comparison. And so, Brink was created. Thanks to Brink, I've played more Dystopia in the last month than I have been playing in the last year! It's just like that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where Data has to outsmart his holographic nemesis Professor Moriarty by tricking him into thinking he was somewhere else. Brink tricks you into thinking you like it, but unlike Moriarty most of us are smart enough to realize that we should really just be playing Dystopia, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake. Do yourself a favour and get Dystopia. It's like Brink except much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, better.			"

												this game is so so bad offline because your team mates dont do nothing !! but the enemy team are better some how but you can follow an enemy and there so stupid sometimes they wont shoot at you , meenwhile on multiplayer online the game is much better but no one picks medic so you always die but its more fun and competitive , the servers are bad.the only reason i still play this game is becouse of the unique whey of moving around like parkour war.i really dident know whether to put good or bad but i dont reccomend to buy this game so im going for a no...

												Brink had huge potential, but it was destroyed by the first month of bugs, balance issues and unplayability for some (including myself for the first 3-4 days). It's the kind of game that had they waited another 1-2 months, could have topped the charts and been a memorable game for years to come. Unfortunately, by the time they had resolved the problems it was too late, and most of the player base had disappeared. But hey, at least they got paid, right?			"

												I strongly recommend you buy this game, it offers new unique gameplay,a cool art style,loads of customization and it's main focuse is on team work,compelating objectives and having a blast. The game dosn't track KDR or WLR it only tracks the XP during a match you earn which in my opinion is FANTASTIC. Don't buy COD or BF, buy this new refreshing shooter from splash damage. "

												Best COD like since well since COD was good and stoped beeing just a money grabbign amchine, brinks has awsome art style, single/multiplayer merge as one seemless game so u can play solo for a bit then just drop into the same game but against human players, tons of unlocks and guns to customise and same for ur toon perks and lot's of looks to just make ur toon unique, including a mix up of TF game play with COD intensity and weapons feel and a bit of quake... whut's not to like? ... on the other hand, section 8 prejudice only 15 bucks, and it's pretty good too, only thing i don't like about that one is the weapons feels weak so i'll pick brink over it, but u honestly should try booth as they are booth probably the 2 best multiplayer shooters out right now. Now get slaugthering people are waitting to be killed! Viva la revolution Brothers!Ps: don't forget to stock up on molotovs ;-P			"

												Brink is something of a confusing topic in the office. We're pretty split down the middle in terms of supporters or detractors, and there seems to be a common thread: Team Fortress 2 players, like the hardcore ones, will not like this game. Everyone else might enjoy it for what it is -- a squad based shooter that REQUIRES teamwork to succeed. If you play online, most people you run into will play really well, but there are a few players that ruin the experience. I'm going to go with a toss up for this one. If you and the rest of your baseball team sized group of friends want to get pumped up before a game or something, this might be for you. If you have a lack of friends who like to play fps games, or are already into TF2, pass.			"

												Interesting visuals, climatic music, the best AI available in FPS game, especially at Hard difficulty level. Perfect game for anyone interested in a fun multiplayer FPS, especially if he/she prefers to play mainly with bots. The Brink will provide a player with tens if not hundreds of fast-paced, objective-based combat. SMART movement system and Objective Wheel (used also to communicate with your teammates about your intentions, so they can adjust theirs) are both truly ingenious inventions by the Splash Damage. The game is maybe not for everyone, but if you like to play with smart bots and play it a few hours you will probably love it. I hope that Extraction (aka Dirty Bomb) will carry over the best features of Brink (including the AI), and it will deserve to be called Brink 2 (Brink even better).			"

												Like everyone else in 2011, I was anticipating Brink, and what it would bring to the table in the myriad of FPS games at the time. It offered some new things to the table, but it kinda screwed itself over with having a foot stuck in the past, and a major identity crisis.A big thing that was advertised was parkour elements, and this was exciting to see, but for something that was so blown up, it's hardly used. You may have to use it to jump over a table or something, but it's not really used that frequently, and it's not even fully unlocked until later in the game.The art style and musical score is a bit underrated in my book, the characters have this cartoony, comic book feel to them, which is a nice touch, but isn't really a selling point.The game teases you with a promising story, and does little to nothing to deliver one. The campaign in this game is basically multiplayer matches with bots, and not in a helpful ""Battlefield 2"" way, it's more like a ""Left 4 Dead times 4"" kind of way. Yes, the bots do absolutely nothing except run and shoot things, objectives are ignored, and it makes you wonder why there's even a campaign at all.If this was a multiplayer-only game, that'd be fine, but because this game was crapped on big-time by critics, almost nobody plays it anymore. Which is understandable, considering this game's level cap only goes up to 20, and you can max it out within a day if you really wanted to.Another good concept gone bad by dumb design choices and an overall undercooked game.4 oddly proportioned McLovin's out of 5 for effort.2 out of 5 for the finished concept.

												Brink... it is a brink of Splash Damage former self. SD USED to make fun, balanced games but this game has way too many CONS that makes playing it in solo-mode pointless.Even trying to find a game with online strangers makes it worthless. This game is focused to be played in Guilds or Clans, where you can coordinate your objectives and missions goals. Alas, playing with strangers simply adds oil to the fire, playing in chaos. Besides, good luck finding online players!Other cons: Lame weapons, takes forever to reload, takes forever to unlock good perks/skills/items. I found this game to be VERY VERY SLOW PACED compared to Splash Damage older games, namely the unforgettable and better game, Enemy Territory.Brink should've been online ONLY and set at a lower price since the SP is really a big joke. I made it halfway on SP then lost interest.Thankfully, I paid 5$ for this otherwise, I would've been much more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game sucks, play other games!RATING:4.0 / 10			"

												This game is a huge let down to me but that still doesn't make it a horrible game. I bought the Bethesda pack back in 2012 maybe late 2011. Brink was on it and i didn't really want it all that badly, but it was hyped back in 2010 and when i sat hyped i mean i got exited for it and didn't even want it (CONFUSING!). -Graphics- You know what? they are not half bad. In 2011 i would say this was one of the best looking games back then.-Gameplay-It's pretty much all gameplay and i feel as though it wasnt good enough. It's a very objective based game and i can tell it was made for multiplayer. Singleplayer is all gameplay and lacks a story but we will get to that. Please if you decide to buy it, get friends to play it with you. The game is just boring alone.-Story-If there was a story, please someone tell me. I am a gamer that plays just to be told a story. -Overall- I would not reccomend this game to anyone. It was very disappointing.Rating: 4.9/10			"

												Good game, I'd give it a 7/10.  This game really focuses on the team objective a a little less on the shooting for the sake of shooting.  It definately is a good game to play with friends due to the fact that you must work together.  The parkour is a plus for the game, being that it was one of the earlier FPS's to have that mobility.  Single player is horrible, it really is.  Going around and doing what robots tell you to do and completing objective after objective gets REALLY repetitive and seems pointless.  For me at least, this game always glitches, so that if I spend more than 2 minutes on the character screen it will glitch out and shut down.  I still have not figured out why, but if your into team multiplayer, this is a good pick for you.  And for reference, this game is like a more evolved-combat version of Team Fortress 2.			"

												Brink is a mult player game to the core.  The campaign was done so you can play it online against people or bots.  Which sounded awsome when I first heard about it.  And sold me on the game.  Playing the campaign online is pretty much the same as multi player.  The difference is you have objectives to complete and most objectives are defend this attack that which comprise each map in the campaign.  You do get cut scenes in between each map telling the story.  Brink is also a class based FPS with RPG elements.  You can chose from 4 class's Medic, Soldier, Engineer and Recon.  All in all I felt the campaign was to short and I didn't get my money's worth.  The S.M.A.R.T. controls the devs added respond well and are easy to get used to.  For an FPS the controls are top notch.  Weapons handle well with many way's to customize.  Devs releasing the first DLC free.  Hopefully it adds more of what I was looking for. 7/10 my score.			"

												A masterpiece unguilty of its own failureBRINK was and still is one of my favourite MP-FPS-games I ever played.The problem is there are few actually playing it, also from people that played it I only heard things like ""bad game"" and such.I for myself could've been one of them. If I wouldn't have read the conclusion of a writer of a (now no more excisting) magazine.Quote: ""You MUST NOT play this as a game where you go like ""BOOM HEADSHOT"". This is a game you can not enjoy this way. But you WILL enjoy it - promise - if you play it with teamplay and the common goal in mind.""I'm incredible greatful to that guy who wrote that and allowed me to enjoy this game.The problem of this game is not its complexity, it has. The problem is not the beefy heavies, dominating CQ. The problem this game has is the FPS-community. The problem is not everybody who played this game read that article, or even wants to play towards a common goal. That is the problem of the game. If you truly want to play together with others, this game is one you should try. But you should not touch it as a shooter, but as a ""Common Goal Action Game"".			"

												Weird. That's the word that fits BRINK the most imo. The game does a terrible job at explaining itself and you can easily get confused by the cartoony graphics, that make you think that this must be an over the top TF2 style game that allows you to do silly stuff for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles right? WRONG. If you want a tight team based game then keep your eye on this title as you'll be hard pressed to find another game that requires more teamwork than this. This game is nigh-impossible to solo/lone-wolf. The only game mode available is objective based. Some objectives can alter the map layout. Combat is medium to close quarters oriented. All weapons/unlocks become available when you finish the tutorial. Only class specific abilities are xp based. 4 classes. Best avatar editor in a FPS game yet. Game encourages you to make different characters tied to different classes. Different body types allow different levels of parkour traversal through the maps. Team players need only apply.			"

												I sort of expected this to be a good game. The guns felt pretty good. The team mechanic looked interesting. The outfits were enough to appeal to my sense of customization. The parkour was a neat idea. And somewhere in there the developers decided not to develop fun AI to play against, more like, stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys at the keyboards controlling the AI, more likely to stand against walls than do anything productive. I tried real multiplayer but it seemed just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and broken, and I never could seem to be the right class in the moment to move my team forward. Good ideas, broken mechanics. It could have been better.			"

												Brink is a completely different FPS game than you’re used to. If you think you are going to run around and kill every bad guy to end up on the top of the scoreboard, you’re wrong. This title requires a team effort towards the objective. The controls have a lag or weighted feel to them and are not as responsive as I would like, playable but expect some adaptation time. The visuals are very good but the sound needs work as it will completely stop at times. When playing single player, the AI do not focus on the objectives as much as they should and get caught up in fire fights, wait a second, that’s exactly what happens in online multiplayer as well! :0)  Bottom line: Not much to hold peoples interest,  I give the game a 6.5 out of 10.

												BRINK /would/ be an awesome team-oriented shooter if there was actually more than 5 people online playing it -- on the same server.  This game seriously could have been really good, but there is just a few things wrong with it that don't work that well.  The bots are just horrible, mainly due to their inability to prioritize for objectives.  Also, undisguising as a spy behind a bot will give you away, but if you sneak up behind them undiguised them they will not notice.  The bots have to be the most gamebreaking of all.  The SMART movement is weird to get used to at first, but it becomes a lot easier if you just let it do the work for you, instead of trying to mash jump, crouch, and sprint like you would in other games.  The core game mechanics are actually really good, the secondary objectives offer a twist to traditional team-based objective gameplay, and it's actually very playable overall. This game could have been great, but alas, it just doesn't have the community support.			"

												The game is really fun, but it does have many issues. I really hope that future shooters steal ideas from this game. The focus on objects is solid, the gunplay/parkour is spot on, the graphics/art style are very pleasing, and the abilies/attachments are diverse. Doesn't hold a light to BF:BC2, but again, this game does a lot of things right and you should give it a try just to experience the team/objective focus that this game has. Biggest flaw is the lack of content. I'm still working on some abilities, but I got all the weapons and attachments within an hour. As for the maps, there are only 8 which is not too many, though they are large and many neat areas to discover with the SMART system.4/5			"

												I've had mixed experiences with Brink... At first glance, it's not the best game around. But once you get into it, and get a feel for the whole mobility aspect of the game, you start to see a whole new variety of movements, sneak-attacks, and combos, that you've never seen in a FPS game before. That said, the AI in this game is pretty bad, so I'd definetly recommend playing it online. It also suffers from some bugs, like crashing now and then, etc., but it's a funny diversion in a genre that's gotten stale.			"

												It blows my mind how this went under the radar. Brink is an extremely unique and impressive FPS. There is absolutely *exceptional* character AND weapon personalization, three different character classes each having different positives and negatives, and around a hundred unique character abilities. The campaign, regardless of which of the two factions you decide to fight for, really does an impressive job at making you care about your side. Will you be a freedom fighter trying to resist Ark suppression, or Ark Security trying to put down the terrorist group? The campaign maps are the same but starting points and objectives different, making each faction's campaign different yet tied together quite well. To top it off, the AI, which is terrible in most games, actually *isn't* in Brink. In fact, playing with the AI is usually better, as they actually go after the objectives and help you out with things. Underrated			"

I am updating this review for the sake of being current, but I'm leaving my original review down below as my feelings towards the game itself have not changed.The reality is that this game was so horrendously overlooked it was a damn tragedy. No one plays it anymore. The best you can get is a bot match with maybe a couple real people if you're lucky.The only thing that could save this game is a re-release or an update with developer run servers.Unless the above scenarios happen, do NOT buy this game. Not for $5, not for $1.Original reivew:This game will leave you wanting more, but totally in a good way. I wish there was just more to it. More storyline, more maps, etc. Some maps can be a bit unbalanced, too, but it really just becomes part of the challenge.It puts TF2 to SHAME as far as gameplay, though. Similar roles (engineer, soldier, medic, spy), but with more of an RPG character building element, so you can pick and choose skills in which you'd like your guy to excel. Not a lot of diversity with weapons, but you find yourself becoming more interested with your particular role's abilities, and balancing it out with your weapons of choice. Plus, since any role can pretty much use any weapon (few exceptions), you can really cater to your own playing style.Play this game if you love team-based FPS!			"

												Okay I just want to say something before I get into the mechanics and present of the games standing. A couple years ago i purchased this game on the playstation 3 where it's player base was far higher than the number that you see today. The game had amazing mechanics and delivered beyond my expectations. This game had the feeling of Overwatch (A game coming mid 2016), the colour of dirty bomb and the fun of team fortress. The game died QUICKLY as many newer FPS games came to brush this masterpiece off. Now thats out of the way let me discuss what you can still do now. The singleplayer is still a fast paced interesting action filled shooter with multiple gamemodes, similar to games you see today. If you were able to to experience this game with your friends and compete with or against them, you will have hours upon days of fun. Now if thinking of purchasing this game, I would like you to think first, am I going to be open to the games singleplayer and/or should I recommend this game to my friends and play with them to maximise my playtime. The games price should not be as high as it currently is but the game is real fun and I enjoyed it. 9/10 during its time,  6.5/10 in todays standing.			"

												I enjoyed playing this game with it's different take on FPS combat, the customisation options for the weapons. It's a shame that it didn't rise to become popular, biggest disappointment was the promise of development tools for mods / custom maps but they never saw the light of day after many months of promises and then no delivery. I would still recommend it, but no-one plays it anymore so no point playing a game purely centered on it's multiplayer aspect on your own...			"

												I think I might hate this game.  The way the devs talked it up and the pre-launch trailers portrayed it in advance was hugely misleading.  It's a class-based shooter where playing the different classes feels identical.  The single player campaign is just the multiplayer maps with bots.  You have to fill your targets with so much lead to kill them that it's like you're firing rubber bullets.  The HUD is ridiculously cluttered and awkward.  For a game that set out to rip off TF2 (and it obviously did), there isn't one single aspect of the features or gameplay that it does as well.  I can haz my $50 back plz?			"

												This game is a nice time away from Team Fortress with neat customization for both characters and guns.  The classes are very different in their roles and functionality and the sound in the game is unique and in your face.  The visual style of the game is a nice touch with riot-worn slums and pristine modern establishments. I do recommend that you wait for a sale or when the free DLC comes out because the game is very low on content for a full 50 dollars.  If you want a fun team based shooter, keep an eye out for this later down the line.			"

However, the lack of any sort of meaningful campaign and the fact that at level 20 (max level) the game becomes significantly less fun are both major issues that these types of shooters released in 2011 probably shouldn't have.

												I was excited for this game for a long time prior to release. I watched dev videos where they explained how fresh it was that the singleplayer and mulitplayer mixed. The way they discribbed it, you got the impression that you had a singleplayer game where people could join and fight with you. It was never fully explained how they blended together. The parkour, aesthetics and gameplay all looked smooth. My biggest dissappointment came from playing the game and realizing that the singleplayer is just the mulitplayer maps with bots. There is little to no story in this game except a few audio logs you can earn. It is a shame too because the backstory described in the dev videos was very intrigueing. The mulitiplayer part was okay and fun for a bit but there are not many playing it now and the bots are horrible.			"

												BRINK /would/ be an awesome team-oriented shooter if there was actually more than 5 people online playing it -- on the same server.  This game seriously could have been really good, but there is just a few things wrong with it that don't work that well.  The bots are just horrible, mainly due to their inability to prioritize for objectives.  Also, undisguising as a spy behind a bot will give you away, but if you sneak up behind them undiguised them they will not notice.  The bots have to be the most gamebreaking of all.  The SMART movement is weird to get used to at first, but it becomes a lot easier if you just let it do the work for you, instead of trying to mash jump, crouch, and sprint like you would in other games.  The core game mechanics are actually really good, the secondary objectives offer a twist to traditional team-based objective gameplay, and it's actually very playable overall. This game could have been great, but alas, it just doesn't have the community support.			"

												The game is not♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it is the definition of mediocre. For everything the game does well (parkouring) it loses in its absolutely terrible map design, weapon ""upgrade"" (read replacement) systems, as well as its mission. Weapons are either ridiculously strong, or so weak as to be puny.The mission objectives system is nicely implemented but does not taking into consideration such things as ""that big♥♥♥♥♥♥♥wall in the way"". The missions themselves are likewise poorly constructed and suffer far too much from ""narrow hallway, open exposed mission area, and enemys spawn on top of your mission objective""It's never clear enough precisely what areas are parkourable and which areas are walls that you just can't touch.To give it, its positives the combat can be engaging at times - the character creator is interesting but as a point of annoyance - you can only create male characters. The entire game world is composed entirely of males.tl;dr - buy something else.			"

												Brink brings several new and unique concepts and mechanics to the world of first person shooters in very comprehensible ways, and, unlike most modern shooters nowadays, players have enough health to survive the first couple of shots in a gunfight and have a chance to retaliate or attempt to escape to cover; this isn't your arcade-y style run-and-gun Call of Duty or Battlefield, but a game that requires more precise aiming and control over yourself and your weapon. Unfortunately, Brink suffered from one severely debilitating setback: it was over-hyped so much that its failure was guaranteed from the outset. The beautiful environments influenced but not overtaken by science fiction elements are a sight to behold, and the music fits very appropriately, but it's all brought down by the developers' hubris. Know that the game is very entertaining, but, at the time of this writing, there isn't enough of an active online community to be worth the investment.			"

												This game is defiantly geared more towards hardcore gamers that enjoy dynamic gameplay and the devs took the pretty ambitious idea of adding La Parkor mechanics and incorporate them into a FPS while still keeping it accessible to gamers of all types.  I think they made it work well, but it feels as if you are playing the piano on your keyboard... and I'm talking Mozart Piano Concerto No. 20, not chopsticks.  You'll need a higher end keyboard to make sure it can handle many keys simultaneous pressed at once.It has the feel of Quake II's controlled action mixed with Mirror's Edge La Parkor acrobatic gameplay and  BF:BC2's class based game play and in-depth weapon customization system.  The NeoTokyo source engine mod is the only game I can really think of that this most similarly resembles, and I enjoyed that mod a lot. If you did to then there is a good chance you'll enjoy this as much as I have.At $25 it's a fair deal, anything more isn't worth it due to the lack of maps available.			"

Added dynamic movement brings a new style of combat to the field along with hightened recoil and gun firing stability factor make it a tougher game to be a competent killer at in multiplayer.The game had a huge hype rating, and although it didn't pull through entirely, the concept was what caught us. Being able to leap over anything, sprint-slide, and wall jump added new heights to maps that would normally be linear.Added classes and ability system, gun customization, and character customization, bring total player customization and a RPG style to the game. This is a great game to play and I pick it up every once in a while.			"

But you WILL enjoy it - promise - if you play it with teamplay and the common goal in mind.""I'm incredible greatful to that guy who wrote that and allowed me to enjoy this game.The problem of this game is not its complexity, it has. The problem is not the beefy heavies, dominating CQ. The problem this game has is the FPS-community. The problem is not everybody who played this game read that article, or even wants to play towards a common goal. That is the problem of the game. If you truly want to play together with others, this game is one you should try. But you should not touch it as a shooter, but as a ""Common Goal Action Game"".			"

												This game is a good example of how to ruin a good idea. When it was released, it was full of bugs and I needed an external config tool to run it smoothly. The community is very small and none of my friends is playing it. But apart from that, it is a good game! So if you have some friends who want to play it, too, and you don't like CoD like games in hardcore mode, this is your game!			"

												Brink is a fantastic take on the FPS genre. Following similar style to TF2, Brink offers everything CoD doesn't, teamwork, full gun and character customization, class based combat and co-op. What's to hate? Majority of the critics are stupid fools playing on Xbox who have a mind set of, CoD CoD CoD CoD, Call of Duty isn't everything! Brink has one of the greatest weapon customization menus out of any game I know, immense character customization, dedicated servers, co-op, single player, multiplayer, Single player and multiplayer that link simultaneously online and offline, and classes the offer different game play types each game, every time Brink is a step above. I recommend to true FPS fans who enjoy teamwork, playing with mates and not the 12 year old's that think everything but Call of Duty is bad. 9/10 Game.			"

												So this one time I was playing Dystopia, and then everyone stopped playing Dystopia because of all the bugs. Luckily, the guys at Bethesda and Splash Damage realized that the best way to get us all back into Dystopia was to create a game that made Dystopia's bugs look much more pleasant by comparison. And so, Brink was created. Thanks to Brink, I've played more Dystopia in the last month than I have been playing in the last year! It's just like that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where Data has to outsmart his holographic nemesis Professor Moriarty by tricking him into thinking he was somewhere else. Brink tricks you into thinking you like it, but unlike Moriarty most of us are smart enough to realize that we should really just be playing Dystopia, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake. Do yourself a favour and get Dystopia. It's like Brink except much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, better.			"

												Its a RPG FPS and is pretty similar to Borderlands and no wonder since it is made by the same group; Splash Damage. BRINK is rather unique for its gameplay, character creation and stuff, but it just cant be helped to find too much similarity to other, altough to good games and their best sides: the gameplay, from using knife all the way to red dot sighting is almost, or maybe even a rip-off from Call of Duty games, although fast melee/knife and iron sighting is nowadays very popular, so maybe i cant blame about that. About the movement and moving in the game: it is rather unique to be able to parkour from place to place and like that, but people seem to recall it from Mirror's Edge, well, whatever it is or is not parkouring from Mirror's Edge, i can only give pros about parkouring in the game, although it somehow just feels.. lacking, even with light body type, which with you can make wall jumps and stuff. Altough i gave more cons than pros, other than that, BRINK IS a good game9.5/10			"

												As a whole I actually really like Brink bar one factor, movement speed.It just feels slow, even when bounding over obstacles and other parts of the terrain. I am not sure if this is to accommodate Console gamepad gameplay, but as a FPS PC player, this factor is very annoying. It also appears about half the speed of ET:QW which I thought was excellent in terms of movement.Unfortunately, Reflex type gaming is becoming part of history.			"

												Brink makes you feel when you are proceeding through the objectives or defending your area. The downside is when teams are uneven and all you do is get spawn camped and boned. This can be frustrating and at times made me want to rage quit more than any game I've played recently because of the chokes.  XP system and upgrades that only minorly affect the game without being overly dramatic. While the maps are small (About 14 maps between challenge and normal), they contain lots of compact area's and pathways. However most of the levels are kind of ugly looking with no open areas.I was mostly interested in the game because of its ability to travel around, wall jump, and quickly move into combat areas. In the actual online multiplayer game I found that no one does it because you'll get shot and killed quite quickly.My overall review is that the game is good, but flawed because of the lack of content, classes, and the shoddy environments.

												Let's be truly honest here.Sometimes, playing with real people tends to get on your nerves. Whether it be people who don't know how VOIP works or just idiots trying to ruin a game for everyone, sometimes you just don't want your mind to be muddled and just want to hunker down after a hard day's work.In the following paragraphs, I'm going to tell you how BRINK can give you that and so much more.BRINK has had a rather unsteady history. I was one of the few people who bought it at launch and actually experienced it's rather disastrous start.It was a mess. Massive lag hampered the game as well as netcode issues plaguing even dedicated servers. It also didn't help that ATI card didn't even run the game properly, and it even had problems on the Nvidia side of things!So BRINK's launch-that-was-not ruined its reputation with the community, and sadly, a lot of people abandoned it as a failure.I, however, did not. Determined to get the bang for my buck, I and many other souls soldiered on with the game. And that's where it started to show its greatest strengths both as a competitive and casual shooter. Let me talk about a few of these.For those like me, who are not interested in playing with real players due to the stress or those who just simply don't have good internet connection, BRINK still allows you to play the game the way it's meant to be played through a single player (or co-op) bot mode.Now I do admit, the bots were way underdeveloped when the game first released, but Splash Damage, even with the mostly negative reviews, didn't abandon the game and continued to patch it, which I believe the company should be lauded for.At the games current build, the bots are smart, strategic, and will keep you on your toes. Even on normal difficulty you see the bots employing new strategies to outsmart you. They will play the objective and they will play it well, and you can rely on the enemy team to keep up the tense firefights.In my almost 100 hours of play, I've seen bots use every ability available to the average player, even the ones you unlock at the highest level! These bots have come a long way from simple peashooters, and now are a decisive enemy that can be the fuel for hours of entertainment.Sadly, the servers have been long dead for this game for a while, so bots are the only option if you want to play this game. I find this to be a shame, since BRINK was an excellent competitive shooter to. I'll get to that in a momentNow you might be asking ""Why play a game with bots? Where's the drive to keep me playing?"" Let me show you.BRINK used a system called ""Mingleplayer"". What that basically means is that you can play the game however you want, without the game punishing you. Wanna just play with bots solo? You can and can still gain experience and levels! Wanna play the games as an ultra competitive shooter? You can do that to (at least, you could if the game still had servers. Though you could always copy the competitive format of the game into a custom bot game, a feature in itself that has given me hours of entertainment). BRINK rewards you, however you want to play the game, and that for me is it's biggest strength.Aside from that, BRINK made for an excellent competitive game as well. Way back when my online experience was almost entirely 5v5 scrims. That's the beauty of BRINK, it can be played both as a casual shooter where you join a server and blast away and as a highly competitive team shooter, voice comms and all. Each class (Medic, Engineer, Soldier, and Operative) had their distinct roles in the battlefield. Every class had its own skill tree and abilities, allowing you to customize to your playstyle. At the highest levels of play, all sorts of gadgets could be used from healing fields to UAVs. This gave BRINK endless replayability both at the lowest levels of play and the highest levels of play.So you might be asking, why buy a dead game? Well, you'll just have to trust me on this one. Splash Damage gave this game the support it deserved and it has grown beautifully into a hidden gem. I can guarantee you the bots will give you a run for your money and you will have a great time with this game. The game is a beautiful tragedy, as it didn't get to reach its full potential in its lifetime, but can still offer you countless hours of offline bot play. I heartedly recommend this game to anyone who has an itchy trigger finger, and wants something new in their fps library!So after a hard day's work, BRINK's got you covered. No screaming children. No Trolls. No idiots.Just you and the game.BONUS: The only fundamental DLC is Agent of Change, as it adds two new missions and several abilities and attachments, as well as raises the level cap. The others are purely cosmetic.Thanks for reading!			"

												An amazing game. Fluid, fast action, great customization, however definitely falls short of the hype and the expectations. One of the reasons for its downfall is the constant issue with servers (which, as of writing, are down for an indefinite amount of time) - without multiplayer, the game does not provide Co-op experience, or refreshing fun. I recommend the game for it's current price of £10, which would allow for 10 or so hours of fun, but do not buy it if you hope for much more.			"

												It's actually a good game and better than you may expect.  Some people thought it would be like TF2 (I did as well), however, the online play is much more... intense.  Yet another game that was sadly lost to time.  The online community for it isn't huge.			"

												This was supposed to be a good game. An objective based team multiplayer FPS from the developers of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars? It sounds like it should be the next best thing in online FPS gaming, but sadly, this turned out to not be the case. The art direction and the free running mechanic is pretty much all there is that's good about this game. Poor gun mechanics, poor controls, poor optimization, a community that was nearly dead as soon as the game launched, poor server browser, and practically no post release support all helped in putting Brink into an early grave. Gamers buried this one alive while it still had life in it, because there was just no future hope for this title. Seeing how Splash Damage is now developing a new free to play FPS called Dirty Bomb, the chances of this going free to play are basically zero, so this game is as good as dead now.Here's hoping that Splash Damage has learned from their mistakes with Brink...

												Actually a pretty good, fun game. It's mostly TF2-like, with + limited parkour + more guns + more teamplay + some RPG elements/character progression. Its graphics/art/style are beautiful, and the ""teamplay for dumbasses"" really does seem to work (i.e. it incentivizes people, eg former CoDders, to complete helpful team objectives).  It is plauged by some bugs (apparently old ATI cards don't like it), but I think they're largely acceptable.It's a fun game with a short, interesting story. Just don't plan on playing it for its singleplayer, MP is where the fun's at in Brink			"

												A great FPS with an original backstory. Added dynamic movement brings a new style of combat to the field along with hightened recoil and gun firing stability factor make it a tougher game to be a competent killer at in multiplayer.The game had a huge hype rating, and although it didn't pull through entirely, the concept was what caught us. Being able to leap over anything, sprint-slide, and wall jump added new heights to maps that would normally be linear.Added classes and ability system, gun customization, and character customization, bring total player customization and a RPG style to the game. This is a great game to play and I pick it up every once in a while.			"

												A masterpiece unguilty of its own failureBRINK was and still is one of my favourite MP-FPS-games I ever played.The problem is there are few actually playing it, also from people that played it I only heard things like ""bad game"" and such.I for myself could've been one of them. If I wouldn't have read the conclusion of a writer of a (now no more excisting) magazine.Quote: ""You MUST NOT play this as a game where you go like ""BOOM HEADSHOT"". This is a game you can not enjoy this way. But you WILL enjoy it - promise - if you play it with teamplay and the common goal in mind.""I'm incredible greatful to that guy who wrote that and allowed me to enjoy this game.The problem of this game is not its complexity, it has. The problem is not the beefy heavies, dominating CQ. The problem this game has is the FPS-community. The problem is not everybody who played this game read that article, or even wants to play towards a common goal. That is the problem of the game. If you truly want to play together with others, this game is one you should try. But you should not touch it as a shooter, but as a ""Common Goal Action Game"".			"

												Brink made it's debut as a fast-paced parkour shooter, and to this end it has been successful. Wall-jumping, vaulting, and sliding into enemies to knock them off their feet are all movement-based features integrated into the game. Players can also heavily customize their characters features, such as weight, tattoos, scars, clothing, ect. To a slightly lesser degree, they can also customize their weapons, adding muzzle brakes and scopes. The gameplay is fast, hectic, and the more you play, the more abilities you can bring to bear on the enemy. The environments are varied, and some of them can be quite beautiful, but aren't more explorable, or impressed upon the player, which is a shame, because some maps really have a lot of potential. To be honest, the story mode is quick, generates more questions than answers, and doesn't have all that great of a story in and of itself. You can take the sides of either the Resistance or the Ark Security forces, fighting each other for the fate of Ark. Nonetheless, story notwithstanding, the action is fast, gunplay better, and for sure this game is worth a try at least. Overall Score: 9.5/10			"

												This is the WORST game I have EVER bought.If I try to launch it, either via Steam or the .exe, a Steam window pops up saying 'Preparing to launch Brink...', after a second it disappears, then the Brink logo pops up and another second later- nothing. It just won't launch. During the last days I've tried everything from updating my drivers and reinstalling to deleting and renaming single files and folders, all of it in vain.  According to several entries in different forums many people have the same problem. Some of them seem to have called the official support hotline without any improvements and in their own forums the developers didn't answer any of the threads about the problems, so far. If this doesn't get any better in the next days I'll never buy any of their games again. With this recommendation I hope to spare you the WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY this piece of mud brings with it.Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS.			"

												This game is rushed. The AI is garbage (making one of the challenges nigh impossible), the story is boring (skippable) trash, the voice acting is a little annoying, the free-running is mediocre and nowhere near Mirror's Edge quality; half of the weapons are poorly tuned, multiplayer server searching reduces FPS from 60 to about 2, engineer turrets are little more than a large paperweight (when I think turrets done right, I think TF2). This game is just poorly made. Typical Bethesda work rearing its ugly head.To be fair, the graphics are really nice, the intro character customization is really well done, and the game otherwise runs really smoothly, but there is no way in hell that I can recommend that somebody go out and pay $90 for this when there are plenty of better games out there for under 10 dollars.Don't bother buying this. Go buy TF2 instead.			"

												Let's be truly honest here.Sometimes, playing with real people tends to get on your nerves. Whether it be people who don't know how VOIP works or just idiots trying to ruin a game for everyone, sometimes you just don't want your mind to be muddled and just want to hunker down after a hard day's work.In the following paragraphs, I'm going to tell you how BRINK can give you that and so much more.BRINK has had a rather unsteady history. I was one of the few people who bought it at launch and actually experienced it's rather disastrous start.It was a mess. Massive lag hampered the game as well as netcode issues plaguing even dedicated servers. It also didn't help that ATI card didn't even run the game properly, and it even had problems on the Nvidia side of things!So BRINK's launch-that-was-not ruined its reputation with the community, and sadly, a lot of people abandoned it as a failure.I, however, did not. Determined to get the bang for my buck, I and many other souls soldiered on with the game. And that's where it started to show its greatest strengths both as a competitive and casual shooter. Let me talk about a few of these.For those like me, who are not interested in playing with real players due to the stress or those who just simply don't have good internet connection, BRINK still allows you to play the game the way it's meant to be played through a single player (or co-op) bot mode.Now I do admit, the bots were way underdeveloped when the game first released, but Splash Damage, even with the mostly negative reviews, didn't abandon the game and continued to patch it, which I believe the company should be lauded for.At the games current build, the bots are smart, strategic, and will keep you on your toes. Even on normal difficulty you see the bots employing new strategies to outsmart you. They will play the objective and they will play it well, and you can rely on the enemy team to keep up the tense firefights.In my almost 100 hours of play, I've seen bots use every ability available to the average player, even the ones you unlock at the highest level! These bots have come a long way from simple peashooters, and now are a decisive enemy that can be the fuel for hours of entertainment.Sadly, the servers have been long dead for this game for a while, so bots are the only option if you want to play this game. I find this to be a shame, since BRINK was an excellent competitive shooter to. I'll get to that in a momentNow you might be asking ""Why play a game with bots? Where's the drive to keep me playing?"" Let me show you.BRINK used a system called ""Mingleplayer"". What that basically means is that you can play the game however you want, without the game punishing you. Wanna just play with bots solo? You can and can still gain experience and levels! Wanna play the games as an ultra competitive shooter? You can do that to (at least, you could if the game still had servers. Though you could always copy the competitive format of the game into a custom bot game, a feature in itself that has given me hours of entertainment). BRINK rewards you, however you want to play the game, and that for me is it's biggest strength.Aside from that, BRINK made for an excellent competitive game as well. Way back when my online experience was almost entirely 5v5 scrims. That's the beauty of BRINK, it can be played both as a casual shooter where you join a server and blast away and as a highly competitive team shooter, voice comms and all. Each class (Medic, Engineer, Soldier, and Operative) had their distinct roles in the battlefield. Every class had its own skill tree and abilities, allowing you to customize to your playstyle. At the highest levels of play, all sorts of gadgets could be used from healing fields to UAVs. This gave BRINK endless replayability both at the lowest levels of play and the highest levels of play.So you might be asking, why buy a dead game? Well, you'll just have to trust me on this one. Splash Damage gave this game the support it deserved and it has grown beautifully into a hidden gem. I can guarantee you the bots will give you a run for your money and you will have a great time with this game. The game is a beautiful tragedy, as it didn't get to reach its full potential in its lifetime, but can still offer you countless hours of offline bot play. I heartedly recommend this game to anyone who has an itchy trigger finger, and wants something new in their fps library!So after a hard day's work, BRINK's got you covered. No screaming children. No Trolls. No idiots.Just you and the game.BONUS: The only fundamental DLC is Agent of Change, as it adds two new missions and several abilities and attachments, as well as raises the level cap. The others are purely cosmetic.Thanks for reading!			"

												It's not amazing, but it is definitely fun with friends. The customization is great and all items are unique. Very sad to see, however is that all of the servers are down. Therefore making some challenges impossible to complete (extremely hard without friends) and some unlocks never unlockable without a cheat. It's great mix between CoD style gameplay and teamwork makes it a fun co-op or vs game. The servers being forever down and challenges non completeable makes this title go down considerably. 6.5/10			"

												This game could have been better than it is - the smart move is a great addition to FPS, but feels rather limited to sliding and vaulting over things I would have been happy to jump over anyways. Nothing feels more badass though than sliding through someone's legs and emptying a clip into their body before they hit the ground. Too bad the game is laggy, colour issues, some strange clipping and extremely limited map choices. Character customisation whilst at first appears cool, don't really add much to the game. 3/10.			"

												Cheap as chips FPS that hits all the buttons, looks stylish in it's futuristic theme and plays beautifully on modern systems. One of the first FPS games to have an involved movement system, and that's emphasized in the additional maps.Currently this game sells for very little and it's a worthy addition to your library as people still play it as an alternative to Enemy Territory and ET Strogg Wars.Aside from that the cinematic storyline evocative of the way that Killzone 3, Titanfall, and World of Warplanes are now emulating.

												Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with Brink. Considering Bethesda's succcess in creating the Fallout series, I had high expectations for a Multiplayer FPS, and this game did not really meet them. Its challenging, but part of the game's logic is fundamentally flawed, making online games undesirable and the campaign impossible to complete. The challenge levels were the most fun I had with this game. Maybe next time, Bethesda will do better. *			"

												Brink is something of a confusing topic in the office. We're pretty split down the middle in terms of supporters or detractors, and there seems to be a common thread: Team Fortress 2 players, like the hardcore ones, will not like this game. Everyone else might enjoy it for what it is -- a squad based shooter that REQUIRES teamwork to succeed. If you play online, most people you run into will play really well, but there are a few players that ruin the experience. I'm going to go with a toss up for this one. If you and the rest of your baseball team sized group of friends want to get pumped up before a game or something, this might be for you. If you have a lack of friends who like to play fps games, or are already into TF2, pass.			"

												This game is a prime example of great ideas with very poor execution. The graphics, sound, and general game-play mechanics are fun overall, but the game structure, objectives, and storyline are extremely shallow. Maps are cool at first but feel repetitive after a short while playing. The biggest disappointment is probably the coop campaign, which feels like multiplayer with bots, both in its lack of direction or purpose and in its aimlessly inspired level designs. The $50 price tag is far from justified. I would estimate this game worth a paltry $10.00; good enough for the occasional distraction, but don't get your expectations up.  Score: 5 out of 10			"

Shouldn't have blindly trusted wolf:et creators. They did screw up this time. ;) I am not sure if they technically/legally can do it, but releasing the game for free wouldn't be a bad idea.

												This was supposed to be a good game. An objective based team multiplayer FPS from the developers of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars? It sounds like it should be the next best thing in online FPS gaming, but sadly, this turned out to not be the case. The art direction and the free running mechanic is pretty much all there is that's good about this game. Poor gun mechanics, poor controls, poor optimization, a community that was nearly dead as soon as the game launched, poor server browser, and practically no post release support all helped in putting Brink into an early grave. Gamers buried this one alive while it still had life in it, because there was just no future hope for this title. Seeing how Splash Damage is now developing a new free to play FPS called Dirty Bomb, the chances of this going free to play are basically zero, so this game is as good as dead now.Here's hoping that Splash Damage has learned from their mistakes with Brink...

												Let's be truly honest here.Sometimes, playing with real people tends to get on your nerves. Whether it be people who don't know how VOIP works or just idiots trying to ruin a game for everyone, sometimes you just don't want your mind to be muddled and just want to hunker down after a hard day's work.In the following paragraphs, I'm going to tell you how BRINK can give you that and so much more.BRINK has had a rather unsteady history. I was one of the few people who bought it at launch and actually experienced it's rather disastrous start.It was a mess. Massive lag hampered the game as well as netcode issues plaguing even dedicated servers. It also didn't help that ATI card didn't even run the game properly, and it even had problems on the Nvidia side of things!So BRINK's launch-that-was-not ruined its reputation with the community, and sadly, a lot of people abandoned it as a failure.I, however, did not. Determined to get the bang for my buck, I and many other souls soldiered on with the game. And that's where it started to show its greatest strengths both as a competitive and casual shooter. Let me talk about a few of these.For those like me, who are not interested in playing with real players due to the stress or those who just simply don't have good internet connection, BRINK still allows you to play the game the way it's meant to be played through a single player (or co-op) bot mode.Now I do admit, the bots were way underdeveloped when the game first released, but Splash Damage, even with the mostly negative reviews, didn't abandon the game and continued to patch it, which I believe the company should be lauded for.At the games current build, the bots are smart, strategic, and will keep you on your toes. Even on normal difficulty you see the bots employing new strategies to outsmart you. They will play the objective and they will play it well, and you can rely on the enemy team to keep up the tense firefights.In my almost 100 hours of play, I've seen bots use every ability available to the average player, even the ones you unlock at the highest level! These bots have come a long way from simple peashooters, and now are a decisive enemy that can be the fuel for hours of entertainment.Sadly, the servers have been long dead for this game for a while, so bots are the only option if you want to play this game. I find this to be a shame, since BRINK was an excellent competitive shooter to. I'll get to that in a momentNow you might be asking ""Why play a game with bots? Where's the drive to keep me playing?"" Let me show you.BRINK used a system called ""Mingleplayer"". What that basically means is that you can play the game however you want, without the game punishing you. Wanna just play with bots solo? You can and can still gain experience and levels! Wanna play the games as an ultra competitive shooter? You can do that to (at least, you could if the game still had servers. Though you could always copy the competitive format of the game into a custom bot game, a feature in itself that has given me hours of entertainment). BRINK rewards you, however you want to play the game, and that for me is it's biggest strength.Aside from that, BRINK made for an excellent competitive game as well. Way back when my online experience was almost entirely 5v5 scrims. That's the beauty of BRINK, it can be played both as a casual shooter where you join a server and blast away and as a highly competitive team shooter, voice comms and all. Each class (Medic, Engineer, Soldier, and Operative) had their distinct roles in the battlefield. Every class had its own skill tree and abilities, allowing you to customize to your playstyle. At the highest levels of play, all sorts of gadgets could be used from healing fields to UAVs. This gave BRINK endless replayability both at the lowest levels of play and the highest levels of play.So you might be asking, why buy a dead game? Well, you'll just have to trust me on this one. Splash Damage gave this game the support it deserved and it has grown beautifully into a hidden gem. I can guarantee you the bots will give you a run for your money and you will have a great time with this game. The game is a beautiful tragedy, as it didn't get to reach its full potential in its lifetime, but can still offer you countless hours of offline bot play. I heartedly recommend this game to anyone who has an itchy trigger finger, and wants something new in their fps library!So after a hard day's work, BRINK's got you covered. No screaming children. No Trolls. No idiots.Just you and the game.BONUS: The only fundamental DLC is Agent of Change, as it adds two new missions and several abilities and attachments, as well as raises the level cap. The others are purely cosmetic.Thanks for reading!			"

												Well, it's not particulary as 'good' as it's cracked up to be.  And the 'revolutionary' customization is essentially just a glorified 'Dress 'Um Up' kind of thing.  The single player campaign is basically just like multiplayer, but with AI bots that are dumbasses.  Quite frankly, the only attractive thing about it is the guns.  So, if you like  a halo-ish experience with petty customization but a little bit of shallow depth along the lines of gameplay; this is for you.			"

												""It's about saying, are you going to come in and play or not? Because if you're not, we're not going to accommodate you, to let you be part of and involved in this intimacy."" That's Splash Damage's Richard Ham speaking to my indie gaming blog this week on BRINK, his company's latest.And while the dimpled electronic polygons of BRINK do make for close encounters, Splash Damage's overtly sexual couplets provide a slinky analog to the visuals at play. In ""Container City"", an aesthetic marvel in its own right, they use frustrating gameplay to proffer a few grunts, howls, and moans. But again, what makes this all work so well is the remarkable amount of restraint and freerunning know-how these developers employ. This company has come a long way in that regard-- it's not easy to integrate the sounds of ""gun"" into ""game"" without coming off like the kind of guy with a favorite tree from which to creep.			"

												Don't buy this. Not now, not ever. Even though the main selling point is movement, maps don't reflect that, and you can jump higher in Battlefield Bad Company 2.The weapon balance is pathetic: Heavy weapons are useless, medium weapons are unnecessary and the only light weapon worth a damn is the Bulpdein.The maps are tiny and claustrophobic, even when the game tries to give you a big environment, there's no helping that feeling when you can only ever run along a few corridors in there. Despite the movement system, there's almost no vertical combat, at any given time, the most number of floors you'll see is two, and even then there's virtually no chance that being on either gives you much advantage.The UI looks like it was made by someone who'd only heard of an FPS once. Everything is opposite of where you'd expect and nothing looks explicitly like it should. The radar, in particular needs a border, and more flamboyant blips.			"

												Well, it's not particulary as 'good' as it's cracked up to be.  And the 'revolutionary' customization is essentially just a glorified 'Dress 'Um Up' kind of thing.  The single player campaign is basically just like multiplayer, but with AI bots that are dumbasses.  Quite frankly, the only attractive thing about it is the guns.  So, if you like  a halo-ish experience with petty customization but a little bit of shallow depth along the lines of gameplay; this is for you.			"

												It's not quite as immersive as I'd imagined, but it's a solid team-based, tactical, objective-oriented FPS that gives you control of characters that are SMART and capable enough to deal with that shoe box or wall in front of them.  The pace and tempo change often as you move from stalled battle fronts to breakthroughs or retreats.  Not perfect by any means, but being able to actually move through the environment instead of navigating around it brings a satisfaction that no other team based FPS can offer.			"

												This game is a nice time away from Team Fortress with neat customization for both characters and guns.  The classes are very different in their roles and functionality and the sound in the game is unique and in your face.  The visual style of the game is a nice touch with riot-worn slums and pristine modern establishments. I do recommend that you wait for a sale or when the free DLC comes out because the game is very low on content for a full 50 dollars.  If you want a fun team based shooter, keep an eye out for this later down the line.			"

												The parkour of Mirror's Edge without the fussy controls - movement is fluid, natural, and fun to use. Strikes fine balance between lethality and bullet sponges, headshots from a bolt action rifle can kill, but all rifles and weapons feel - correct, in a sense, of how it should work. Menu's are functional, but I would have prefered more thought to have gone into it's design. Single player campaign is directly integrated into multiplayer, maps form coherent storyline. Fun.			"

												EDIT:  I'm leaving the full review here, just so you can see, but I have to change to negative.  Brink itself isn't a terrible game (read below if you want to read why I think that), BUT it has no real community to play with and there are newer, better FPS games in all styles.  I suggest checking out Pay Day 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive (if you're not a big fan of the standard competeive CS mode, check out Deathmatch and Arms Race, so much fun).Original Review:  A lot has been said about Brink, and a lot of it has been negative.  I must point out that a lot of the bad press the game recieved on launch was due to technical issues on consoles, not on PC.  There were a few minor issues on PC, but all has been fixed with updates to the game.Upon first playing Brink I thought it was brilliant.  The objective system, which gaves you actual goals to accomplish instead of just capturing points, flags, or getting kills, was unique and made the first few hours of gameplay feel new and different, despite otherwise being a standard team-based FPS.  The parkour system is also unique and allows you to traverse levels in interesting ways that other FPS's never will.These combined, plus a neat art aesthetic and customizable characters, made me really enjoy Brink at first.That said, the game didn't really seem to last long for me.  Perhaps it was the fact that the multiplayer is essentially dead (due to the bad rep the game had on release), or maybe the objective system, though unique at first, in practice only seems adds a simple layer on top of ""capture this point"" mechanics after a couple matches.Maybe the gunplay just doesn't hold up as well to other giants of the FPS genre (specifically Battlefield, as that's what I've had the msot experience with).In short, if you don't mind bot games (or can convince friends to join you), this game is good for perhaps a few hours of FPS fun, but you'll probably get tired of it after 5 or so hours.  I'd say if it's on sale for five bucks, why not give it a shot?  But otherwise, you might as well avoid.Leaving this as a recommendation for the positives, and I would say give it a shot if you can get it cheap and especially if you have friends to play with, so it doesn't exactly deserve a no.

												While it is easy to find a review or detailed information on a game such as this one, it is no doubt the best option to try out the game to get the 'feeling' of how it is. Brink being an FPS game, is slightly different than other FPS games in terms of the following facts:1) Strongly focused on Team Work. If you like to work in a group and don't want to gun blaze into a fight and try to prove you are better than others (which is pointless), then this is the game for you.2) Parkour. David Belle's parkour makes its (probably) second return in gaming world. Being able to move around the environment using parkour is great but you should be aware of the fact that only Light Body and Medium Body types get to do them, as oppose to the Heavy Body types. The trade off lies in which weapon you can carry based on the body type you choose. 3) Get it if you are tired of playing mediocre game like Call of Duty. :D			"

												I'll be up front: BRINK's promises of extensive customization and a seamless singleplayer/multiplayer experience are just so much hype, thankfully only in very specific ways. The customization of the characters isn't as detailed and indepth as several on-hand video demos pre-release made it seem to be, and the Artifical Intelligence? They're useless on non-defense objectives for the most part, since offensive teams swarm too tightly and too furiously for your disorganized AI companions to be much help.However, BRINK's encouragement of objective focus rather than kill focused teamwork and gameplay REALLY help to make the ONLINE experience a joy: Players are more likely to assist and work together to achieve a goal than in most other team and class focused games I've played. SMARTS works great, and will be 'stolen' for use in other games, I suspect.My advice? Buy only if interested in the theme and style of the game.			"

												Endlich kommt es einmal nicht nur auf die K/D an. In diesem schnellen und Objecitve basierten Mulitplayer-Shooter ist Teamplay das A und O. Selbst der versierteste Schütze kommt nicht weit wenn er sich nicht nach seinen Mitspielern umsieht. Die Karten sind abwechsungsreich und spannend designt. Auch nach vielen Stunden entdeckt man noch neue Wege. Top: Was man offline freischaltet darf man auch online verwenden! Trotzdem kann man keinen Über-Char erstellen. Durch das (großzügige) Levelcap ist man angehalten herauszufinden welche Fähigkeiten zum eigenen Spieltyp passen und diese dan clever auswählen. Gelungen auch die Bots. Sie erfüllen Ziele. Sie verteidigen. Sie flankieren. Sie nehmen Komandoposten. Sie greifen in Wellen an. Sie legen gegen Ende der Partie noch zu. Sie sliden um Dich zu Fall zu bringen... Vor allem aber: Sind sie unterstützen Dich mit ""Buffs"" und das zum Teil deutlich effektiver als mancher Spawn-Chiller, den ich online im Team hatte :-)			"

												Perfect example of a game ruined by extented development time. Had they only stuck to the skinny character as it was initially planned, the game would have a focus on it's well made parkour rather than always picking the big slow guy with infinite health and good guns.			"

												Strong candidate for biggest disappointment of the year.  This game was poorly launched, deceptively advertised, badly made, and worst of all lacks fun.  Bethesda, Valve, D2D, and Splash Damage all failed to help me with issues, and Bethesda in particular sent a response I felt insulted my intelligence.  Overall, I'd recommend this punishment of a game to anybody who enjoys eating broken glass.			"

												Shift + Ctrl into your team-mates for hours of fun.In all honesty picking up this game is going to be somewhat of a gamble. If you liked quake then you'll probably get into this. There's been a lot of mad people reviewing this game, but the PC community seems to be liking it. Mostly.Unless you use an ATI card in which case that was just Splash Damage's way of punishing you.

												Putting aside the hatred for this game regarding initial advertising, I still found it very appealing. To this day, I enjoy a couple of hours of Brink every now and then. I only wish the multiplayer scene wasn't completely dead. This would attract more gamers, I'd imagine. The gameplay is standard FPS fare with a little parkour thrown into the mix. The basic plot is, well, very basic, but it's the audio logs you unlock through gameplay that is to me an allegory for human nature. Both the Security forces attempting to protect the Ark and the Resistance forces attempting to flee the Ark make so many errors and foolish moves. Through pride, anger and personal resentment, the two opposing factions tear each other apart when it was so easily avoided if either side had stymied their rage long enough to come to a reasonable solution. You are told how the Ark is falling apart because the resources that keep it functional are being used to manufacture ammunition to fight the Security forces, and how Ark Security is unwilling to venture outside of the Ark to find signs of civilisation due to an incident many years earlier which resulted in the deaths of an expeditionary team previously dispatched. All in all, the story is great. Neither side is good or bad. both are wrong and right in their own way and both really screw things up in their own way. As I said, an allegory for human nature. If you're interested in the single player campaign, I recommend it, but the multiplayer scene is long dead.			"

												This game was weirdly received so I'll try to provide some clarity. It's a good time if you wanna play a different shooter and mod a character and guns to fit the role you've chosen. The Lamented Features: The ""Campaign"" is multiplayer missions with bots. Challenges aren't a static difficulty as they will adopt a higher difficulty, causing some to be nigh impossible. Do them first on easy to ensure they're completed.Harder Bots have insane accuracy, requiring around the corner tactics, especially when grouped on an objective. Some objectives require time, and if interupted will be reset. The Sweetness:The Free Running is fun and useful. Character and Weapon Customization is really fun and strategic. I miss it. The Music is great. The Character Art Style is interesting, and well enough received it's in future titles. The Levels are cool looking, ranging from start futurism to busy slums.

												Der größte Dreck... In de Trailern wurde so viel versprochen aber ich kann davon im Spiel nicht wirklich viel wiederfinden. Dass der SP angeblich mit dem MP verschmilzt ist auch Schwachsinn, da man im ""Einzelspieler"" einfach nur mit ca. 8 Bots gegen 9 gegnerische KI spielt, gegen die man nur als völliger Vollspast verlieren kann. Was ich Anfangs noch gut fand waren die Level aus der Sicht der zu erfüllenden Missionen. Pro ""Map"" musste man verschieden Aufgaben nachgehen. Verschiedene Spielmodi wie CTF, TDM, VIP oder S&Z wurden einfach zusammen geschmissen. Wie gesagt anfangs noch recht lustig, nervt nach wenigen Matches aber krass. Ich könnte euch jetzt das Game noch weiter schlecht machen so von wegen Anpassungen des Charakters und der Waffe aber ich will ja hier keinen Rufmord an Bethesda begehen...			"

The AI is close to greatness, if not even awesomeness, and the game really enforces cooperation between the teammates. Such a cool game and the parkour-elements are spot on! More of that and it would get ridiculous and become a ""one trick pony"". Great game!			"

												This game is a prime example of great ideas with very poor execution. The graphics, sound, and general game-play mechanics are fun overall, but the game structure, objectives, and storyline are extremely shallow. Maps are cool at first but feel repetitive after a short while playing. The biggest disappointment is probably the coop campaign, which feels like multiplayer with bots, both in its lack of direction or purpose and in its aimlessly inspired level designs. The $50 price tag is far from justified. I would estimate this game worth a paltry $10.00; good enough for the occasional distraction, but don't get your expectations up.  Score: 5 out of 10			"

												Brink is an objective based multiplayer shooter that took me some getting used to. Most of my early hours, I was pretty much just killing bad guys while being completely lost on what the objectives were. Now that I have a few more hours under my belt and have gotten used to the gameplay, I must confess it's pretty fun. It's highly action packed, but the objectives are just not obvious to new players.The game puts significant emphasis on customization in both character looks and loadouts--for example being able to select two primary weapons is nice. The graphics are solid, the gameplay is smooth, and the character leveling is implemented well. It also throws in a decent storyline which is uncommon in these type of multiplayer games. But don't buy Brink because of its single player or coop claims. It disappoints unless you consider playing multiplayer with bots fun.			"

It promised, super nice movement possibilities and seamless multiplayer/singleplayer experience. Well... They did what they promised in some way. :DSingle/Multiplayer is just simply multiplayer with somewhat storyline, which you can play through with bots, too :) Storyline is a bit more than you would expect from MP game (which is good!), but not really a single player story.Movement capabilities are really there. It's like almost only thing that you can't do is climb tall vertical walls. The rest is possible. Of course, my playing style is more ""close and personal"", which caused me to choose Heavy body type which is... more...inert than Light body type... So, not that much climbing for me :DCharacter customization, level ups, upgrades, weapons, weapon customization, class based gameplay is very well tuned, too :) Even now from time to time I am enjoying it with my Heavy Enforcer and a Gatling Gun (or something it is called... Essentially, 3 barrel minigun :D )			"

It actually kind of combines both Battlefield and CoD, even a little bit of it's own special sauce. You can wall jump, different types of characters, slide across those boring chest high walls, and fart on them along the way. One problem though: graphics. There's something wrong with their faces, but it's not something a man with and editing program can fix to make their faces look less oval-y. With custom weapons, (slightly) underpowered grenades, and an army of a 8/10 grade AI by your side, you'll be the best cop/criminal to ever walk the Ark. Just don't think the bots are dumb, because they aren't, even on the easiest difficulty. I found myself throwing grenades and (unproffessionally) firing my gun everywhere because I was scared by how skilled they were. Then I figured out all you have to do is melee them, THEN fire your gun in their face. Mush all that boring review stuff together, and you get a 9/10. Good job, Splash damage and Bethesda. You amazed me once, let's see you do it again.			"

												I don't care what anyone says - I love this game.It's gorgeous in its unique art style, the gun play is unlike any other, and I find myself constantly coming back to this game as my personal favorite first person shooter in recent memory, and if it weren't for things liek Team Fortress 2 or Halo Reach, this would be my favorite first person shooter of all time.

												A break from your typical ""Modern Warfare"" styled FPSes. Solid gameplay, unique customization available, dynamic movement, all that whatnot. Overall a fairly enjoyable game, especially considering the fact that much of what was complained about after release seems to have been fixed (to some degree or another).  The only problem is the limited mapset and the campaign-only structure to the game.			"

												The thing about game reviews is, that they can seriously dampen the interest for great games that just happen to recieve mediocre reviews. BRINK is such a game. It's an FPS with a storyline (cutscenes and all) but it's actually meant to be played in co-op with several players. On both sides. And it works so damn well, with graphics that remind you of ""Waterworld"" and parkour elements that are even better than Mirror's Edge. And an emphasis team tactics, that actually matters. You like FPS team multiplayer games with a good storyline to back it up? Then I suggest you try out BRINK, preferably with a friend or two.			"

												Don't get it. It was probably good at some point, but is now unplayable.My first 20 minutes of gametime I spent trying to get it to work in the first place. The game apparently can't handle my GPU properly so it always crashed on mission startup when I put the resolution to 1920x1080. Had to put it to 1600x900... there's also no option (at least not ingame) to play in windowed mode, so that kinda sucks.Then I tried to play the campaign but either I am incredibly stupid or that only works online, too??? I was in a room filled with bots but couldn't move because my ping was over 500. The only thing that worked offline was the training...Recently I tried to launch it in Offline Mode... bad idea! It just didn't launch at all. So I went back to Steams default Online Mode and... somehow BRINK still won't start. I don't know why, but not allowing it internet access somehow broke it completely. I could probably try to verify the games contents to fix it, but what for, honestly?In short: Most of the time it will crash or not even launch at all, you can't play online because no body else plays it anymore in the first place and the servers are messed up, if you planned on buying it merely for the campaign: that only works via the potato servers as well, even when besides you there's only bots in the room. You can't play. You literally can't play. (Unless you wanna play with crazy bad connection, feeling like a toddler having trouble taking every single step. Which, to be honest, sounds like a somewhat fun description, but trust me, in a partially parcour based game toddlers just don't have it easy!)			"

For the time they spent on it you would think the could have at least had a better singleplayer campaign. But that wasn't the main problem the game just didn't have much replayability. People got bored of playing the same maps, doing the same generic missions. If they would have had more maps and missions before release that were more dynamic and interesting then this game probably wouldn't have been a flop. In terms of gameplay imo it was good.

												I totally wanted BRINK to be much more popular.  I loved playing it. As a huge fan of Splash Damage's Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, I was anticipating this greatly.  I loved all the mechanics, but I felt like it could have used a bit more polish before release.  I recommend it because I think it's a good game, despite the lackluster reviews it got. It's too bad it never caught on, because I would have loved to see where the story would have gone.  Story?  From a competitive shooter you say? I'm crazy like that.			"

												While it is easy to find a review or detailed information on a game such as this one, it is no doubt the best option to try out the game to get the 'feeling' of how it is. Brink being an FPS game, is slightly different than other FPS games in terms of the following facts:1) Strongly focused on Team Work. If you like to work in a group and don't want to gun blaze into a fight and try to prove you are better than others (which is pointless), then this is the game for you.2) Parkour. David Belle's parkour makes its (probably) second return in gaming world. Being able to move around the environment using parkour is great but you should be aware of the fact that only Light Body and Medium Body types get to do them, as oppose to the Heavy Body types. The trade off lies in which weapon you can carry based on the body type you choose. 3) Get it if you are tired of playing mediocre game like Call of Duty. :D			"

												I'll be up front: BRINK's promises of extensive customization and a seamless singleplayer/multiplayer experience are just so much hype, thankfully only in very specific ways. The customization of the characters isn't as detailed and indepth as several on-hand video demos pre-release made it seem to be, and the Artifical Intelligence? They're useless on non-defense objectives for the most part, since offensive teams swarm too tightly and too furiously for your disorganized AI companions to be much help.However, BRINK's encouragement of objective focus rather than kill focused teamwork and gameplay REALLY help to make the ONLINE experience a joy: Players are more likely to assist and work together to achieve a goal than in most other team and class focused games I've played. SMARTS works great, and will be 'stolen' for use in other games, I suspect.My advice? Buy only if interested in the theme and style of the game.			"

												Brink made it's debut as a fast-paced parkour shooter, and to this end it has been successful. Wall-jumping, vaulting, and sliding into enemies to knock them off their feet are all movement-based features integrated into the game. Players can also heavily customize their characters features, such as weight, tattoos, scars, clothing, ect. To a slightly lesser degree, they can also customize their weapons, adding muzzle brakes and scopes. The gameplay is fast, hectic, and the more you play, the more abilities you can bring to bear on the enemy. The environments are varied, and some of them can be quite beautiful, but aren't more explorable, or impressed upon the player, which is a shame, because some maps really have a lot of potential. To be honest, the story mode is quick, generates more questions than answers, and doesn't have all that great of a story in and of itself. You can take the sides of either the Resistance or the Ark Security forces, fighting each other for the fate of Ark. Nonetheless, story notwithstanding, the action is fast, gunplay better, and for sure this game is worth a try at least. Overall Score: 9.5/10			"

												The concept of this game goes beyond alot of most current day games. If this game was properly marketed I truly believe it could of been better than CS:GO. but sadly one of the most overlooked games. The game has great mechanics and encourages team play, the ideas behing it are simply great.Beware no one plays it any longer, it's impossible to find servers. I only found one test server trying to play online these days. It's a real pitty, this game had such potential to be such a great game :/ O well on to the next game!			"

												EDIT:  I'm leaving the full review here, just so you can see, but I have to change to negative.  Brink itself isn't a terrible game (read below if you want to read why I think that), BUT it has no real community to play with and there are newer, better FPS games in all styles.  I suggest checking out Pay Day 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive (if you're not a big fan of the standard competeive CS mode, check out Deathmatch and Arms Race, so much fun).Original Review:  A lot has been said about Brink, and a lot of it has been negative.  I must point out that a lot of the bad press the game recieved on launch was due to technical issues on consoles, not on PC.  There were a few minor issues on PC, but all has been fixed with updates to the game.Upon first playing Brink I thought it was brilliant.  The objective system, which gaves you actual goals to accomplish instead of just capturing points, flags, or getting kills, was unique and made the first few hours of gameplay feel new and different, despite otherwise being a standard team-based FPS.  The parkour system is also unique and allows you to traverse levels in interesting ways that other FPS's never will.These combined, plus a neat art aesthetic and customizable characters, made me really enjoy Brink at first.That said, the game didn't really seem to last long for me.  Perhaps it was the fact that the multiplayer is essentially dead (due to the bad rep the game had on release), or maybe the objective system, though unique at first, in practice only seems adds a simple layer on top of ""capture this point"" mechanics after a couple matches.Maybe the gunplay just doesn't hold up as well to other giants of the FPS genre (specifically Battlefield, as that's what I've had the msot experience with).In short, if you don't mind bot games (or can convince friends to join you), this game is good for perhaps a few hours of FPS fun, but you'll probably get tired of it after 5 or so hours.  I'd say if it's on sale for five bucks, why not give it a shot?  But otherwise, you might as well avoid.Leaving this as a recommendation for the positives, and I would say give it a shot if you can get it cheap and especially if you have friends to play with, so it doesn't exactly deserve a no.

												Don't buy this. Not now, not ever. Even though the main selling point is movement, maps don't reflect that, and you can jump higher in Battlefield Bad Company 2.The weapon balance is pathetic: Heavy weapons are useless, medium weapons are unnecessary and the only light weapon worth a damn is the Bulpdein.The maps are tiny and claustrophobic, even when the game tries to give you a big environment, there's no helping that feeling when you can only ever run along a few corridors in there. Despite the movement system, there's almost no vertical combat, at any given time, the most number of floors you'll see is two, and even then there's virtually no chance that being on either gives you much advantage.The UI looks like it was made by someone who'd only heard of an FPS once. Everything is opposite of where you'd expect and nothing looks explicitly like it should. The radar, in particular needs a border, and more flamboyant blips.			"

												Brink is one of the better squad-based FPSs to come out within the last year. The gunplay and character controls feel spot-on, and they're married with an elegant teamplay mechanic and fantastic graphic and audio design. Although the parkour is woefully underused by the players, mastery of this mechanic brings Brink up to one of my favorite shooters of all time. The parkour mechanic, like the Battlefield franchise's Destruction mechanic, will become genre-defining with time. Other shooters now feel incomplete without it.Unfortunately, there are some under-the-hood issues with matchmaking and high-end graphic settings. Brink is also a complete mess on the consoles. Despite these flaws, I still have more fun with Brink than I do with all other shooters save BFBC2.			"

												I really can't, in good faith, recommend this game to anyone.It's not because I thought it was poorly done, but because it became so repetetive so quickly; what was done was done well, (except for the length of the campaign, which I beat entirely in less than 2 days while in the midst of studying for exams).The game, however, is not worth $20.Honestly, I'd say $15 at most, and that's only if you don't mind the repetetive mechanics.

												Endlich kommt es einmal nicht nur auf die K/D an. In diesem schnellen und Objecitve basierten Mulitplayer-Shooter ist Teamplay das A und O. Selbst der versierteste Schütze kommt nicht weit wenn er sich nicht nach seinen Mitspielern umsieht. Die Karten sind abwechsungsreich und spannend designt. Auch nach vielen Stunden entdeckt man noch neue Wege. Top: Was man offline freischaltet darf man auch online verwenden! Trotzdem kann man keinen Über-Char erstellen. Durch das (großzügige) Levelcap ist man angehalten herauszufinden welche Fähigkeiten zum eigenen Spieltyp passen und diese dan clever auswählen. Gelungen auch die Bots. Sie erfüllen Ziele. Sie verteidigen. Sie flankieren. Sie nehmen Komandoposten. Sie greifen in Wellen an. Sie legen gegen Ende der Partie noch zu. Sie sliden um Dich zu Fall zu bringen... Vor allem aber: Sind sie unterstützen Dich mit ""Buffs"" und das zum Teil deutlich effektiver als mancher Spawn-Chiller, den ich online im Team hatte :-)			"

												Underrated game. Reinstalled this at a whim... had forgotten how good it was. Think Team Fortress meets Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The AI isn't as good as say Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but they are above average. It has a single player campaign which can be co-op'ed or solo'd. Playing online with hmans is pretty much the game's bread & butter. The game supports LAN and also allows the player to host a dedicated server. Oh, and the graphics still hold up well today; certainly hard to believe it's using the old id Tech4 engine (makes Borderlands 2 and Bioshock: Infinite look dated).Pretty much the quality type stuff you'd expect from Splash Damage. It's just a shame this title did not sell as well as everyone hoped it would. Maybe there's something to be said about console dumb-down...			"

												This game was weirdly received so I'll try to provide some clarity. It's a good time if you wanna play a different shooter and mod a character and guns to fit the role you've chosen. The Lamented Features: The ""Campaign"" is multiplayer missions with bots. Challenges aren't a static difficulty as they will adopt a higher difficulty, causing some to be nigh impossible. Do them first on easy to ensure they're completed.Harder Bots have insane accuracy, requiring around the corner tactics, especially when grouped on an objective. Some objectives require time, and if interupted will be reset. The Sweetness:The Free Running is fun and useful. Character and Weapon Customization is really fun and strategic. I miss it. The Music is great. The Character Art Style is interesting, and well enough received it's in future titles. The Levels are cool looking, ranging from start futurism to busy slums.

												I know a lot of people hated on this game when it first came out, and I can definitely understand how it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, but I really love it and I think people who are into similar games, like Battlefield or the Enemy Territory series (which was made by the same developer) could easily end up loving it too. I mean, come on! You can play eight-player co-op against bots! That alone has to be good for something! :) But seriously, with the free weekend and the ""complete"" bundle on sale for $6.25, why not give it a try?			"

												You will belive a man can slide.Brink, Despite the reviews, is fantastic. Free running around the dystopian enviroment as either the Resistance or da police, shooting dudes in the face with a wide variety of 24 diffrent very customisable weapons and equely customisable characters has never been executed anyware near as well.also, for ATI users, download that hotfix and turn on the multicore rendering stuff, or else your gana lag!

												Brink is an objective based multiplayer shooter that took me some getting used to. Most of my early hours, I was pretty much just killing bad guys while being completely lost on what the objectives were. Now that I have a few more hours under my belt and have gotten used to the gameplay, I must confess it's pretty fun. It's highly action packed, but the objectives are just not obvious to new players.The game puts significant emphasis on customization in both character looks and loadouts--for example being able to select two primary weapons is nice. The graphics are solid, the gameplay is smooth, and the character leveling is implemented well. It also throws in a decent storyline which is uncommon in these type of multiplayer games. But don't buy Brink because of its single player or coop claims. It disappoints unless you consider playing multiplayer with bots fun.			"

												The game is not♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it is the definition of mediocre. For everything the game does well (parkouring) it loses in its absolutely terrible map design, weapon ""upgrade"" (read replacement) systems, as well as its mission. Weapons are either ridiculously strong, or so weak as to be puny.The mission objectives system is nicely implemented but does not taking into consideration such things as ""that big♥♥♥♥♥♥♥wall in the way"". The missions themselves are likewise poorly constructed and suffer far too much from ""narrow hallway, open exposed mission area, and enemys spawn on top of your mission objective""It's never clear enough precisely what areas are parkourable and which areas are walls that you just can't touch.To give it, its positives the combat can be engaging at times - the character creator is interesting but as a point of annoyance - you can only create male characters. The entire game world is composed entirely of males.tl;dr - buy something else.			"

												Pros--Team based combat, similar to TF2.  -Very customizable weapons and armor-Good looking graphics-Devs are quick to patch & update thingsCons--very repetitive missions, not much of a map selection-slight imbalances in weapons (revolver is op imo)-leveling can be a pain if you just want to try out thingsOther thoughts--I was hoping for better.  The game is fun, but I grew out of it and quickly returned to COD and for team based I still think Valve's TF2 is superior.  Much more community based, so much more to offer in terms of maps and game modes, and honestly, we know TF2 is going to grow faster then Brink.			"

												I like this game. I like the dystopian future theme, the dual campaigns, the rewards system and customisation, the story, the look of the characters, the voices and the movement system. At first it took me a while to get into, but now I am eager for more.Sad truth, however, is there won't be more of Brink. Two customisation DLC's and one set of 4 missions (2 on each campaign), seems to be as good as it's going to get. I haven't played any of the online matches, although according to many reviews, there are rarely any, but that doesn't bother me. I enjoyed the single player mode and I really do wish there were more DLC's and content packages, as this game has wormed its way into my favourites. I enjoyed every single moment of the campaign and would gladly love to see more of it. In a nutshell, a good single player game with an absurd amount of customisation options.			"

												The parkour of Mirror's Edge without the fussy controls - movement is fluid, natural, and fun to use. Strikes fine balance between lethality and bullet sponges, headshots from a bolt action rifle can kill, but all rifles and weapons feel - correct, in a sense, of how it should work. Menu's are functional, but I would have prefered more thought to have gone into it's design. Single player campaign is directly integrated into multiplayer, maps form coherent storyline. Fun.			"

												I really really really enjoyed this undervalued gem from Splash damage. They dared to be different in a COD and Halo dominated world and it bombed. It is still one of the best team centric shooters out there if you can't find anyone to play with. The SP campaign is both fun (if you like cutscenes punctuate by mp type matches) and tells a decent story. This is worth picking up and playing with bots in sp just to see the art style and ejoy the manic action. Please buy this game and if you do let me know so we can play it!			"

												If you want a game that was super overhyped, was nothing like what was promised, and will make you quit playing within a week of buying it this game is for you. If you like lots of weapons that all feel the same, where it takes just running around spamming a mag at a time to kill people in cqb. Buy this game now. If you like all boxy room maps with no real imagination behind them, then this game was a match made in heaven for you. If all the ads and dev videos being rendered wasn't a hint enough for you that the gameplay wasn't going to be as promised, then check out the number of people playing now. If you want a multi player game that has no people playing it, then this game is perfect. The bots on your team have all suffered from blunt force trauma to the head so they act like a re-tard-ed puppy. I was stupid enough to buy this game full price, why don't you be a jackass and buy it too, so we can all have it uninstalled on steam?			"

												Another game I do not regret buying! Brink is sort of like a mixture between Team Fortress and Modern Warfare, with the ability to traverse the battlegrounds using Parkour. The action is fast and furious with an emphasis on completing objectives and assisting team-mates rather than notching up individual kills. You have the option of customizing your characters cosmetically and there is a simple and uncomplicated skill leveling system. There are just a handful of weapon classes so its not a diverse range, but each handles differently. Graphics are great! Maps look excellent and ""feel"" very natural, soundtrack is bloody excellent and evocative, adds a lot of atmosphere to the game, storyline and themes show a depth rarely explored in games. Voice acting is very good and creates very vivid characters just by that alone. Single player campaign is short, shorter than those of other FPS'es, and mostly for the story. A good team for multiplayer play is recommended.			"

												How is this♥♥♥♥♥♥still $50. The game tries to be TF2 and failed miserabley. You have to unlock 90% of your class abilites but unlock all guns and gun upgrades by completing some boring challenges that take an hour. Weapons are determined by body type not class, which really makes classes seem irrelevant. The Devs could of made this game way better by having no classes and letting the player chose the abilities they unlock.The graphics seem to imply some sort of cartoon humor but there is none. The amount of character customization is least lacking which is an outrage considering it's the the least game changing and most pointless part of the game. Parkour is pretty useless and irelevant unless you play with the light body type.The ""campaign"" is just multiplayer with AI. The free DLC simply shows the developers plan on following Call Of Duty's footsteps and selling updates for their game instead of providing them for free. This game is worth about $20			"

If you like TF2 and other shooters this is certainly worth a try! Super customizable characters and weapons, slick animations, crazy fast combat, and sweet graphics.			"

												I like this game. I like the dystopian future theme, the dual campaigns, the rewards system and customisation, the story, the look of the characters, the voices and the movement system. At first it took me a while to get into, but now I am eager for more.Sad truth, however, is there won't be more of Brink. Two customisation DLC's and one set of 4 missions (2 on each campaign), seems to be as good as it's going to get. I haven't played any of the online matches, although according to many reviews, there are rarely any, but that doesn't bother me. I enjoyed the single player mode and I really do wish there were more DLC's and content packages, as this game has wormed its way into my favourites. I enjoyed every single moment of the campaign and would gladly love to see more of it. In a nutshell, a good single player game with an absurd amount of customisation options.			"

												Play this game to realize why the Elder Scrolls series did not include guns... Being one of my top 5 favourite game companies I expected better out of Bethesda, however I suppose even the greats must release a turd every once in awhile to remind us they are human...With a game that is extremely visually appealing, but handles like a college kids half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥UT3 clone it show's exactly why the recent focus on graphics over gameplay will run the gaming community into the proverbial pooper...The run mechanics are clunky, the hit detection is lax, and the FOV often times left me feeling more like i was getting sucked back into the future than it was I was running at mach speed.A valiant effort by Bethesda, but for now I think i'd like to see them stick to swords and cat people... Also make a reboot of Daggerfall... cuz Bretons beat the pants off of Nords.			"

												Brink is a team-based first-person shooter set in a sci-fi universe. Players choose classes of characters to use in battle in a way very similar to Team Fortress 2, but with the additional player-chosen variable of their body being light, medium, or heavy weight. The campaign is nearly non-existent, with exhbition matches making up its entirety, and the online multiplayer consists of these exhibition matches but with players instead of bots. The maps are clunky and do not direct traffic well, and last time I checked the online community was waning. Overall, it feels unfinished.5.5/10Reasonable Price: $4.99			"

												Don't waste your money, even on sale. All in all you get only about 12 missions, 6 per story line, and only a few hours of real game play. The different classes don't get distinguished enough until you reach some of the very late levels, and you won't play the single player that long. Each mission you have to be the right class for the current objective or you fail as the AI hates to win. It forces wave-spawning, and if you miss the start of a new wave to spawn waiting for a medic, it takes another 20 seconds before you can do anything, and you spawn very far away. You use mainly SMGs, only 4 that are not among about 24 primaries, and side arms are 80% SMGs. Nothing is instantly different between the 2 sides so it's hard to tell what to shoot at unless its got 'enemy' spelled out above it.  The entire story is forced and not engaging. The free movement is fine but needs a different game. Multiplayer is the single player just without bots. This could have been a good game.			"

												It always seems like the games that are built up most are usually the biggest flop.I was looking for the next gen of fast-paced, class-based, objective-driven FPS. That is not what I got -- Game is nothing like what you would expect from the cinematic videos as shown on TV / various gaming sites.Most times you are playing with terrible AI bots. When you are playing with people... well, sometimes I think I'd rather be playing with the terrible AI bots.Extremely disappointed I was convinced (or just plain conned) into pre-ordering this. Of all the bad games I've bought (long list), I regret dropping $50 on this one to presumable play it for 2 hours and never touch it again.TLDR: DO NOT BUY - PILE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥STAINED♥♥♥♥♥♥TOPPED WITH SHITFLAKES.

												Even after 4 years BRINK remains one of the most UNDERRATED games of all time! I reccomend BRINK due to the fact that it's visual style is beautiful! The Ark which is the main setting for the game is full of minty fresh aethetics and designs! The game performs well, movement is parkour based so a lot of running, jump, sliding and wall running. Gun-play is smart, responsive and is rewarding, team play forces you to co-operate with your teammates to complete objectives and progress through the level. Instead of going for a basic team deathmatch or CTF ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, BRINK goes for a more objective based gameplay meaning the objectives are unique and are different for each map and team. The game features some interesting DLC that adds a couple of maps and character customizations and there are a lot of customizations on offer in BRINK!The community is saddly dead which is so unfortunate! Servers are non-existent and I see no-one playing BRINK either! This is a game really to enjoy the visual style and fun gameplay and pretty much nothing else! A huge shame!I still recomend BRINK though due to the amount of fun to be had whilst offline! An exelent game though rushed and killed expectations.			"

When things start to get exciting, they suddenly become tedious.BRINK had a lot of ambition. A parkour-driven first person shooter with on-the-fly objectives and a campaign that could be played online in both factions at the same time sounded ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic and should have been a recipe for overnight success. Sadly those joyous mechanics were not executed to their fullest potential and the online play was plagued with problems on day one. Now you are lucky to find anyone to play with and playing with the AI can be more frustrating than playing with some hacker ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ online.BRINK is not a bad game, nor is it a good game.

												Brink is one of the better squad-based FPSs to come out within the last year. The gunplay and character controls feel spot-on, and they're married with an elegant teamplay mechanic and fantastic graphic and audio design. Although the parkour is woefully underused by the players, mastery of this mechanic brings Brink up to one of my favorite shooters of all time. The parkour mechanic, like the Battlefield franchise's Destruction mechanic, will become genre-defining with time. Other shooters now feel incomplete without it.Unfortunately, there are some under-the-hood issues with matchmaking and high-end graphic settings. Brink is also a complete mess on the consoles. Despite these flaws, I still have more fun with Brink than I do with all other shooters save BFBC2.			"

												This game is not for everyone. Brink is a competitive first-person multiplayer shooter. It is designed to be played online with your friends and not as a singleplayer game, so make no mistake, don't play with bots! However, if you are looking for a multiplayer shooter that does not focus on kills per death ratios or killstreaks, then this game might be for you. Gamers looking for something different and especially fans of the developer's previous game Enemy Territory: Quake Wars will find a game that wants you to play cooperatively with your team in order to defeat the other one. Brink focuses on map-specific objectives that need to be fulfilled to win the map. So if you're looking for a shooter that pushes you so hard to play together, that you will sometimes curse your teammates for not helping you, this is your game. The most issues the game had at its release were fixed up until now, which makes the game highly recommendable to me.			"

Alone however this game falls a little short. Not as bad as put out to be, but not as good as it could've been.			"

												This is far from a recommendation. This game is a catastrophic train wreck; one of the worst games i've ever played. I got fooled by overhyped trailers and photoshopped screenshots and pre purchased this atrocious game for 50$. Its a crappy console port of the worst kind. The game is susceptical to horrible online lag, the SMART system should be renamed CRAP system 'cause its just plain stupid. Horrible animations, ugly graphics.			"

												Visually this is a cool game... but ultimately you'll get a few hours of very fun gameplay and action then the polish wears off and you will be back to playing Team Fortress 2 and next thing you know Brink is uninstalled to make room for TF2 updates.			"

												If you're reading this, please do not buy this game. It is a horrible amalgamation of pure excrement, piled high into a tower of babel-esq proportions. It is a monument to unfulfilled, great ideas, broken promises to customers, and just plain ♥♥♥♥ing over people by grabbing all the money they could before abandonging their game in weeks.I am so ashamed that I bought this game. Don't be an idiot like me. If I can convince even ONE person to not buy this game, I can die happy knowing I've made a difference. Someone is living a better life because of a review I put on steam.			"

												Game is practically dead as of 6/13/15 of this writing, AI is borderline broken. The game mechanics are just simply frustrating and overly repetitive with broken bots and guns that feel like shooting popcorn.Do not even consider playing this game or any of Splash Damage's other games. Dirty Bomb included.			"

												I'm glad my friend got this for me. This is a frantic team-based, objective-oriented FPS. Certain levels are a pain unless a team organizes itself. Would definitely recommend for a group of friends, rather than strangers.While this game is a XP-skill-unlock system, most of the ""goodies"" come early on, via solo challenges. With a 20% XP bonus incentive for playing online, you're bound to stick to online play for a couple hours at a time.FPS gamer difficulty level: adeptFocusing on team play above all else.			"

												This game is bad, sadly, like many others I bought into the hype and false advertising that the devs released with their claims of ""Redefining FPS"". Now-a days I only play it every now and then for a quick round because I lack any other modern FPS to get a quick fix with.The AI is terrible, the campaign is extremely short and poorly structured, the story is barely there and feels like it was tacked onto a series of pre-built objective maps designed solely for multiplayer. The asthetic of the game isn't too bad, some maps look absolutely disgusting and the characters look odd in customization, but when out in the field they seem to look quite a bit better in the proper setting. The character customization, although extremely limited wasn't a bad feature, though the way they abused their limited customization by adding DLC to offer more 'customization' was absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												(mini-review)I had high-hopes for this shooter, by the makers of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Instead, what I got was a game that was a complete failure from the get-go. Despite running on the Doom 3 engine (idTech 4), the game was a slow, stuttery, unstable mess. Graphical glitches abounded, with many ATi users reporting scan lines across their screen and sub-par performance to boot(I can attest to these glitches as I experienced both). Rather than fix the problem, Splash Damage tried to bury any evidence of complaints and only responded/fixed the majority of the issues after the potentially fun multiplayer component withered on the vine. The game is fixed now but no one plays it and no one ever will.Splash Damage lost all credibility with me. Developers, when will you learn that responsible ownership for mistakes will always gain you more respect that a brazen money-grab? Good luck making minigames.Avoid this title.4/10.			"

												A good game that's only let down by a couple of poor map designs and a lack of people playing the multiplayer.  Single player is pretty pointless, but if you manage to get into a fairly full multiplayer server this game is fun.			"
