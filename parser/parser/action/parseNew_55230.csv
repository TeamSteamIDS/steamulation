												Great game. There's some over-the-top action scenes, some absurd humor, but really nothing game breaking. Want a piece of advice ? The coop mode will make it even better !If you want some fun, alone or with a friend, this game is for you!You just have to know, this sequel is not as serious as the previous game, but again, Saints Row is not really about being serious. In my opinion, I think Saints Row The Third is better than Saints Row IV.			"

												I first played this game on a ""Play for free weekend,""... I think I played about the first five minutes, and then bought it- seriously it was that good. This was one of the only games that I actually tried to play slllooowwwwllly, because I wanted to ""savor"" the storyline. I would play 1 mission, then go on 5 or 6 sidequests just to make that main storyline last as long as I could. I love the voiceover acting, the writing, the graphics, the humor... where do I stop? Granted, the humor in this game is at times dark, and sexual... so just FYI, but if you're the person that enjoys a good ""edgy"" joke, you will love the witty banter between the characters in this game.A lot of people have tried to ask about the likeness to GTA IV... and called this a GTAIV copycat... well maybe... if you could say that GTAIV got an actual good port to PC, and maybe if you could say that GTAIV was actually funny... and maybe if the missions actually made sense and just walking around didn't absolutely frustrate the living Hotel Echo Lima Lima out of me. Also, a big part was the driving for me. GTAIV took the same car, and just copied it with different skins over and over- this game actually makes each car a little different, the handling, the speed, the features- and everything is customizable! You can put NOS on cars, change the rims, the decals, the paint, the color of the windshields... there are literally endless posibilities of driving around your pimped out car- also, it is so much easier to drive. If this was a GTAIV copycat, then SR did a MAJOR overhaul in the coding and scripting system for the driving because it is a breeze and joy to drive around in this game! :)Synopsis: Funny, Witty, Enjoyable, (Did I mention Co-op camaign?! Only 2 people though :Notice) you will laugh, cry and connect with the characters and be able to play it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and get it- you won't regret :).			"

												Saints Row: The Third takes place three years after the previous game. You are the gangleader of the Third Street Saints. The Saints are no longer just a brutal and effective criminal operation but now a fully-fledged media empire with their time split equally between doing dirt and setting up legitimate businesses and a popular line of merchandising.After a bank heist gone wrong, the Saints find themselves in Steelport, butting heads with a local crime group known as the Syndicate. From there it is the classic rise to power story.The appearance and personality of the Saints' leader is completely up to you, thanks to the character editor. You can make him or her look genuinely cool, or a complete abomination. If you want to change your look, or even your sex, visit a plastic surgeon in the city and change it. If you want a new outfit, there are shops full of every type of fashion imaginable.Missions place you in increasingly unpredictable situations. It starts out fairly low-key with a raid on a military base to steal weapons for the gang, but it finishes with an explosive finale involving tanks, jets and city-levelling explosions. In between, there is a zombie outbreak, a trip inside a Tron-like computer world and much more, it gets wilder and more varied.There is also an element of choice to the decisions you make. Certain missions see you choosing between two options that will affect the story, sometimes in quite dramatic ways.The game has a lot of replay value, after finishing the main story you are able to do a lot of side missions, e.g. car-stealing missions and assassinations.The best way to play Saints Row: The Third is to play with a friend. The co-op action and the careful attention to detail in the co-op mechanics are masterful. It is easy to drop in and out of a friend’s game and the way progress is tracked is very smart. If you join a game where the other person is further along in the plot than you are, you can still play a plot mission with them.The dialogue between the characters is consistently hilarious. The game is packed with in-jokes, meta humor and constantly swerves into almost surreal territory. The graphics may not be mind blowing, instead the game really shines with the sound. Everything sounds great from the gun battles to the snippets of incidental speech that you get when wandering around. The voice acting takes it up a notch though with some truly memorable performances. The best thing is the music selection though. A great selection of dance, hip hop, indie and metal are on offer from the in-game radio stations.Overall I think the game is fantastic. It just gives you so much to do and a lot of fun if you play with a friend. Saints Row: The Third is worth to buy.Sounds 10/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I knew nothing about the saints row franchise when I started playing this game. I expected to play a normal, gta-like video game with a character creation. Boy was I wrong. This game made me fall in love with the franchise, both new and old style, and you should do the same. I gave this game the custom nomination vote: ""I didn't expect this to happen"".			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Saints Row: The Third Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Sandbox; Action; Open-World; Comedy My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Sandbox gamers; Casual gamers REVIEWSaints Row: The Third is a masterwork of a game, and a quintessential specimen of its genre. There is a perfect balance of pragmatism and ludicrousness inherent to each and every aspect of the game. The mosaic of realistic and ridiculous themes is expertly crafted into one of the most enjoyable games in existence, let alone in the sandbox genre. All but the most extremely discerning gamers should be able to enjoy it.One of the first features of Saints Row: The Third that will jump out at you is the fact it is full of preposterous themes, demonstrated not only in the narrative and atmospheric elements, but also the gameplay itself. And so, you definitely aren't supposed to approach this game seriously. That becomes painfully obvious once you learn that you can hop out of a speeding jet and crash face first into the middle of a city with no parachute... only to bounce up and run down the street naked, caving in people's skulls with giant purple sex toys.Yet despite being a heavy-handed and purposeful parody of itself, the narrative of the game is actually entertaining and logically sensible (by that I mean it adheres to the logic of the gameworld, not real life). And the ludicrousness doesn’t ever get so totally out of hand that it starts to feel like a ”simulator” game; there is always some semblance of a purpose and direction. Saints Row: The Third is a good example of how a game doesn’t have to be serious, but also can have an entertaining and somewhat logical narrative.There is also a number of factors which add a significant layer of customization, progression, and statistics to the game— all of which contribute to increasing the overall epicness of the experience. For one, there is a wide range of customizing ability, from your character to your vehicles. Many hours can be spent just changing the theme of your gang. There is also a system of XP and level progression, which is uncommon in the genre, but synthesizes perfectly in Saints Row: The Third. You can use your level-ups to customize certain abilities of your character, and if you devote enough time, you can eventually make yourself invincible purely through the level system (not cheats/codes).Furthermore, the gameworld in Saints Row: The Third is a very enjoyable sandbox to play in, and there is a lot of potential for riotous fun to be had. The gameworld is large enough to be interesting, but not so large it becomes a burden to traverse. To keep you busy between campaign missions, there are dozens of side-missions of various gameplay styles which add pleasant diversity. Outside the primary and secondary missions, there are numerous minigames and challenges (stunting, base jumping, racing, streaking, etc.) which all contribute to creating an environment where you can spend hours of gameplay just messing around and having fun, without actively pursuing missions or progressing the game.And another amazing feature of this game is the ability to play the actual campaign in co-op mode.  Instead of just messing around in the sandbox with friends, you can actually beat the game together.There is also a lot of DLC, which ranges from cosmetic additions to full-blown extra campaigns. I would say it is definitely worth it to get the GOTY edition right from the start.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Take a moment to picture this scenario; you’re in a helicopter hovering above the roof a several-story tall penthouse that’s currently owned by a rival gang of yours. You then leap out, skydive downwards and release your parachute before finally landing and beating up everyone with a ten-feet long, pink♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And yet that’s only a sparse indication to just how ludicrous and over-the-top Saints Row 3 truly is. Of course, this should come as no surprise to anyone who played its precursors, but irrespective if you’re familiar with Saints Row’s crazy antics or not, the third iteration is unlike any other game this year – and it’s playful tone and hysterical characters will have you in stitches.Saints Row 3 still centers on a small gang of violent, yet eccentric criminals who go by the name “The Saints”. But after a ridiculously crazy opening, the Saints find themselves in the troubled town of Steelport  and are poised to overthrow a notorious crime syndicate called, well, “The Syndicate”. The premise is incredibly straightforward, but it’s the cast of characters and sublime dialogue that really makes Saints Row 3 so memorable. Riding shotgun with you throughout the game is a mash-up of crooks, gangsters, computer nerds and a pimp whose voice may or may not be auto-tuned. The story takes a while to get moving, but getting wrapped in Saints Row 3’s narrative is not mandatory in order to enjoy the game.In case you absolutely haven’t heard or seen anything with the name Saints Row on it — it’s a sandbox, open-world experience. You’re set loose in a madhouse of a city and free to tackle missions, side activities, cause some serious commotion or regain control over large chunks and city squares of Steelport. The game also features some fairly basic third-person shooter mechanics. There’s no cover system in place, but you can shoot up enemies with a massive selection of firearms and gadgets, perform dive rolls and rush in and take out enemies using hand-to-hand combat. Little has changed from Saints Row 2 in that regard, but the combat is still satisfying nonetheless.Saints Row 3’s design is heavily focused on advancing your character and your supremacy over Steelport, since completing missions grants you money which you can spend on a huge selection of attributes and skill-boosting upgrades. Also, completing vital story missions unlocks “cribs”where you can customize your load out and much else. This all feeds into the Reputation system, which allows you to level up and get access to more powerful abilities.Another strong component of Saints Row 3 is the mission variety. While some objectives boil down to kill x, escort z or defend y, there are still some very enjoyable missions and set-pieces that punctuate important story moments. You’ll get to infiltrate nuclear plants, man a good number of ground and aerial vehicles to carry out large-scale assaults, defend a freighter from incoming enemies and much more. The missions are mostly easy and feature a generous checkpoint system, and you can always take on a good number of side missions for extra cash and rep.The AI of your friendly gang members –aptly called “homies”– was one of the biggest complaints leveled towards Saints Row 2, and though it’s not perfect here, it’s still been improved significantly and gang members now drop enemies at a more consistent pace.Adversaries on the other hand are about as inept and dumb as they can be; not running away from grenades or failing to respond as you fill them with lead. To make matters worse, you face an extremely small number of enemies — there are standard goons, more armored ones, and gigantic, hulk-like enemies dubbed “Brutes”. As a result, the combat loses some its luster after a while, so the real variety comes from the vehicle or on-rails-sequences you’ll infrequently take part in.Saints Row 3 looks good for an open-world title, with excellent animations and colorful explosions – which is a good thing since you’ll be seeing tons and tons of explosions – and the game also has one of the deepest character customization editors I’ve seen all year, and your custom appearance is reflected to a hundred-percent in the cut scenes. The game also scales itself well to lower-end machines, and features support from Direct X9 to Direct X11.The world, however, still looks slightly dull here and there, and the physics are often sporadic and glitchy from time to time. Load times also come in a large abundance and on the whole, Saints Row 3 is pretty, but still has a few too many rough edges.With excellent writing, strong variety, lots of stuff to do and an incredibly fun and endearing attitude, Saints Row 3 is one of the most quirky games to come out in 2011. The combat could still be deeper and the AI is still noticeably weak and coupled with some technical deficiencies and a disappointing extra mode, Saints Row 3 strictly settles for being great, but it that’s more than enough to warrant a recommendation.

												Probably the best game I ever played in my life. Saints Row: The Third might look like other open world games but it has much more fun, possibilities, jokes, customization, and it also gives you the feel of power and control more than every other game of its kind. The missions are always surprising, you'll never know what's next: Helicopter flying, exploding things with a tank, shotting, hiring h*****s, etc. Just buy it and play, totally worth it.			"

All that i have to say is that this game is an awesome experience.Saints Row: The Third is an open world game set on the city of Steelport (a city based on New York), in you're the leader of a gangster band called ""The Saints"" fighting against the rival bands.I found many things that makes this game amazing: The big story of the game is full of hours of fun, it has action, drama, it's too hilarious, really i loved it ! The fact to customize your character as you want makes this game different from similar games. Steelport is a big city full of secondary missions, secret objects and many things that are going to made you sit on your chair more hours. There is a good soundtrack selection (Death Metal / Dubstep / Hip Hop / Pop / and the stinky latin music). Also there is a big system of customization of weapons, clothes, vehicles and more. You can hit cops and little old ladies with a giant purple♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Saints Flow ! DLCs makes this game more funny.In a few words: You're going to love it !10 / 10			"

												Saints Row: The Third. I thought it was a very good game. The thing that got me the most was the comical humor. The costumes and wardrobes, to the sexual references and balancing dead bodies with exaggerated weapon effects. I found this game to be a LOT beter compared to Saints Row and Saints Row II. If follows the time line, which is always a plus. The amount of things you can do, in my opinion, is much more and better than GTA. GTA is more on a serious note, which is good; Saints Row: The Third has some serious moments, but knows how to offer a laugh and good time with a balance.The Story Line is pretty simple and basic, but not as generic as you would expect. You have a mixture of things, from saving your Homies, to fighting Gangs, Police, Military, Politicians, Zombies and Aliens. The gangs, especially one in particular are trying to take turf. What kind of gang isn't? The Genki line I found the most fun. It's basically like a game show arena. You fight your wat through enemies as well as the environments. It's definitely rewarding in the end, but not as much as it should be. In the end, you begin to gather forces for a take over. A bloody, deadly and annoying battle takes place.The Combat System was very fun. Shooting duel pistols at enemies and watching them fly across the street. The Genki Mobile went shoots flames around all sides of the car as you drive, leaving a flaming inferno of destruction in your path. Falling from a disintergrating plane and shooting people as you fall with style. Fighting in wrestling rings with other gang members. Or you can do it with classic style by running them over with your cars and going on a shooting rampage. Some people may frown on it, but it is only a game after all. It could even relieve some frustrations.Didn't have much of an Online Experience. It's pretty difficult to find others willing to play or willing to stay. So, unless you have a friend to play this with, I would recommend that more. At least if you want the achievements that go with this.4/5 Singleplayer   2/5 Online/Coop			"

												Saints Row: The Third continues the story of Saints Row 2, but you don't have to play it to understand the story.Many years after Saints Row 2 the Saints are famous and gangs start envying them, thus they got new enemies.+ Character design+ Big city+ A lot of clothing+ Character customisation+ Homies+ Homes+ Gangs+ Humour+ Upgradable cars and weapons+ Territories+ Choices+ Activities+/- Character interaction could have been better.- Characters of SR 2 got a bit of a too big overhaul.- The violence oversimplifies the storyline sometimes.- No romances			"

												Tired of playing GTA? Then Saint Row 3 game for you!Saint Row 3 would easily be summarized as a ""frivolous"" GTA.You can do almost want you want in this game. Like drive around the city and listening to dubstep while driving like a maniac. Or just can upgrade your safehouse.In this game you play in 3rd person view. And protagonist in the game is youf. And you can create a character like you want. For exempel the you can be a girl or boy, small or thick? Yes, it is up to you to diside!And your character is a member of the gang ""The Saints"" who will try to conquer the city. But not everything goes as it should, and it gets other gangs against themselves that they have to fight to succeed ... And you follow along on their journey in the game. And I can tell you it`s a fun journey! In this game you will find both single player and multiplayer. And you will also find good graphics with relatively good animations.I give this game a 8.5 out of 10And you should definitely play the game if you want to play something fun!			"

												Crazy and non-sense open-world game, really funny in what it does. At first I thought it was just a GTA clone, but it has its reasons to exist.It has tons of stuff to do, with surprisingly enough variety, and basically rewards you for everything; a little bit on the easy side, but this doesn't make messing around less fun.From a technical standpoint, it has its problems, and surely is not well-optimized, but nothing so bad to totally avoid it.Co-op is surely the best thing this open-world has to offer, being it pratically the same game with another player, also, it's really easy to jump in.Reccomended if you want to have fun in a mad open-world game, preferably with a friend.

												Get yourself dressed, crazy, armed and ready for mayhem and total overdose.This is what happens when GTA meets pure comedy.Don't make the mistake to compare this with Saint row II and misunderstand the concept.SR3 is nothing like SR2 gang-war wise. Forget the dramatic gang war concept. Forget the GTA-Mafia mashed script writing. Saints Row 3 is action blended comedy with a dose of crazy and exaggerations, puns for movies and other games, sarcasm, and lots and lots of glamour.Voice acting is awesome. Graphics, effects and physics are satisfying. Story length is ok. And map size enough to host a bunch of events, side missions, collectives and achievement related goodies.Beat people to the death with a giant purple♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up.Also supports a well stable co-op mode.Totally recommended.

												Some sandbox games are well respected for their realism. After all, it takes a lot to create a city, populate it, give players a chance to live in a virtual parody of reality, and at the same time do so in a way that draws players in an makes them feel they truly are in an enclosed living breathing world. Well grounded characters have to blend together with a physics engine that makes sense, because players are always going to be searching for that one thing that feels too inconsistent with what we know about the world today. So it's fairly impressive how well Saints Row: The Third draws in players considering that every ounce of realism is tossed right out the door within the first ten minutes, giving players an amazingly wild ride that features some of the most memorable (and believable) characters you'll ever have the pleasure of playing with in a sandbox game.Don't get fooled by the fact that this is the third game in the series; even though the plot picks off right where the other games left off players are treated to a nice summary of the Saints' accomplishments prior to this installment. Having reached the height of their fame and popularity the local gang has become a bit full of themselves. They're now robbing banks with masks that look like their faces, cutting movie deals, and just generally getting used to the good life. This complacency eventually gets them into quite a bit of trouble, and soon the Saints find themselves in a new, unfamiliar city having to work their way back from the ground up.Apart from the main story being a little predictable, it's a fantastic ride through and through. Part of this has to do with how over-the-top the action is in just about every situation. Stealing UAV bombing drones, skydiving from helicopters to crash parties and freefalling from an airplane while shooting through falling debris to kill rival gang members in mid air. These all set the tone at an early point in the game that the action is going to be consistently over the top and the player will get the experience all the best parts of it. With the mind already suspending a lot of belief that any of these things could ever happen it's easy to believe that the storyline is just background fluff for the experience, but the character interactions are so genuine that it's hard not to really feel for the Saints' cause. There's absolutely no time wasted in any of the dialogue, no fillers with useless information, no string of swearing just for the need to be edgy, and in a world where players can dress up like vampire hookers driving a ice cream truck, while avoiding mutant hulks that throw people at you, being able to be to really connect with these characters so effortlessly is incredibly valuable.But thankfully the character design isn't the only solid thing in Saints Row: The Third. Combat naturally plays a large role in attempting to carve out a gang empire and that's exactly where the game becomes additively satisfying. Guns are just about everywhere and take up the usual role in any third person shooter. There are sniper rifles, rocket launchers, pistols, machine guns, and all of them are simple as pointing and clicking away. Then, of course, you have weapons like the laser guided precision airstrike gun that summons up sharks, or mind-controlling squid gun (which naturally shoots out a squid which takes over any potentially hostile NPC). The sheer wackiness of some of the weapons that players get access to is both shocking and hilarious, and it's clear that only some sort of genius could ever come up with the vast array of weaponry featured in this game.Melee weapons offer a little bit more versatility this time around, as some attacks can be used indefinitely, while others have limited use but offer special attacks like an explosive knockback. Melee itself plays another huge role in the game, and is arguably the most defining feature of the franchise. Fluid, over the top, and a lot of fun, melee moves mix up the typical shooting elements of the game to great effect. Drop kicking one enemy only to run over and take another as a hostage, all without changing weapons or being forced to handle different mechanics, makes tackling a large group of foes very easy. This is good, because players only ever seem to fight a small horde enemies every time.Naturally with weapons, cars, and gangsters come customization features, of which Saints Row 3 isn't remotely short of. Players are able to level up weapons, increasing both individual features and aesthetic looks over time. Vehicles on the other hand have just as many customization options as the player character does, and all of it is incredibly easy to control. Grabbing a car and tossing on a unique paint job is incredibly easy, and using cash earned in-game you can choose to tweak the frame of individual vehicles with little to no effort. Even those who are typically disinterested in visually tweaking cars should find that the quick and painless options offered make the process fairly fun.Character customization on the other hand is a completely different beast altogether. Outside of editing a characters general face, height, gender, voice and all the other usual suspects players are allowed to dress their characters to an amazing extent. Visiting clothing stores throughout the city will grant players the option of shopping from that particular style and anything from business attire, street clothing, bondage gear, or just plain strange costumes. The selection is fairly large, made better only by the fact that players will generally find these stores by bumping into them mid-exploration rather than simply searching them out by necessity.Another fantastic point of customization in Saints Row: The Third is how players are allowed to manage their in-game finances, with an offering of more than just customized weapons and crazy looking hats. Players can also purchase property all over the city that generates revenue every hour, or serves as alternative safe houses where players can store vehicles, weapons, or clothing. It's one of many different rewards for exploration that doesn't come in the form of finding hidden items.Graphically there's not too much to be dissatisfied with when it comes to Saints Row: The Third, as it's an open world title that does everything it can to absolutely minimize any loading times. Naturally entering a special vehicle segments or a special indoor building will trigger a bit of loading, but for the most part players should find the entire experience relatively seamless. The soundtrack is also well done, being a great blend of scripted talk show radio work, satirical commercials, and real music. Special missions will often come along with a predetermined soundtrack, which sets the tone fairly well as long as you're in the mood to Kanye West or some other rap/rock artist.Saints Row: The Third is, simply put, absolutely insanity at its best. While some sandbox titles strive for realism, or destructive scale, Saints Row: The Third instead takes a combination of all the features that have defined sandbox games as of late (driving, shooting, wandering large setpiece cities) alongside a blend of everything that defines how memorably wacky a game can be. There's very little in this title that wont satisfy most gamers, and that the entire game can be run through with co-op just adds to the fun. Getting every property, finding each hidden item, wiping out every gang and finishing every mission will naturally take a bit of time but the best part about Saints Row: The Third isn't about the hours you intentionally invest, it's finding out how much time you've lost having fun without ever realizing it.

Affable & liberating // Recommended for over-the-top thrillseekers+ Hilarious dialogue & general sense of humor+ Clear objective markers and GPS directions; you're almost guaranteed to never get lost+ Fantastic soundtrack; covering all major genres from screamo metal to hip-hop, the game boasts quality entries for each+ Decently large, open-world gameplay+ Story is absolutley, incredibly ridiculous in the best possible way+ Doesn't take itself seriously as a game; focuses on fun and replayability+ Missions deviate satisfyingly in gameplay; there is a wide variety of activities, from hijacking vehicles while in a helicopter, to jumping in front of moving vehicles to rack up insurance money+ Massive variety in character, weapon, and gang customization+ Visuals are adequate and stand up fairly well to today's standards+ All dialogue is competently voice-acted+ Side mission activities are a blast to participate in, and enjoy a healthy variance+ Fun and easy to mod- Fire zombies bug; in one mission where the player must fight a zombie infestation, often zombies will swarm the player and (none of the zombies being on fire) will set you on fire, resulting in a continuous replay of the 'I'm on fire!' animation (extremely aggravating)- AI for allies tends to behave poorly; your 'homies' will often walk out into heavy fire, forcing you to run out and help them (which is timed)LockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												I've never played a GTA similar game and i didn't expected much, so when this game was on sale i gave it a try.Playtime: 120+ hoursAchievements: 49/53 achievements (without dlc's)RequirementsIt dosen't need that much requirements to run stable, it never crashed (game crash). I had only one bug were i flew under the city till i respawned new, not bad. SoundPretty simple, good music and voice acting, also good radio stations with music (some aren't my taste in music tbh).GraphicThe graphic is surprisingly very good, a lot of details in the map or characters. The ragdoll physics looks real, such as the exploding cars with a lot of details.ControllingVery simple controlling and handling of the vehicles, nothing to add.Saints-Row GangYou are the leader of the gang, after the main missions you collect new friends, who you can call and which will help you (gun support or vehicle delivery to you).You can also hire up to 3 gangmembers who ran with you and give you fire support till they die, notable to say that when you drive a two seated car, the 2 remaining gangmembers will hijack a car or two and follow you, very cool.MapThere nothing much to say, there is a big city (nothing compared to Just Cause Maps) which are controlled by enemy gangmembers, your job is to conquer this districts and raise your might over the city (buying buildings, solving activities to earn more cash or more own gangmembers on the street), later in the missions the city is changing (no spoil :)) which is very cool imho.Upgrades and TuningWith enough money and the required respect level u can upgrade weapons, skills, gang stuff, etc. (first you are weak, but after the right upgrades you are almost invincible, no cheats needed).You can also pimp your car, with a lot of possibilities of spoilers, nitro, under car illumination (like in nfsu 2), etc.ActivitiesThats the joker of this game, it has a lot activities to solve, including Insurance Fraud, Trafficking, Heli Assault, Mayhem, Escort, Snatch, Trail Blazing, Guardian Angel, Tank Mayhem, Reality Climax (all of them got various difficultie levels). Finding collectible packages, sex dolls, weed, etc.Saints-BookThe Saintsbook in your phone has 3 quests to offer, all of them need a lot of time and effort:-Assassinations: You get details of the targeted person and you have to kill them, most of them require special conditions.-Car Thiefs: Simple steal the car the customer wants and bring them to the targeted location while the cops want to kill you.-Challenges: My favourit part of this game, there are a total of 41 challenges you have to master, some you get easily through playing, some of them needs more effort or grinding (run naked through the city or car surfing).Other Notable Stuff-A lot of dresses, from gang clothes to weird stuff.-You can hijack a vehicle fast with jumping through the front window, this always saves time.-Gangmembers can look like sausages or beer bottles if u want.-Fight scenes are very cool, many got special quick-time buttons like s, left click or right click.ResultDidn't expected much and got surprised what a lot of weird things this game has to offer, when you like games like GTA this game is the right thing for you, it has a lot to collect, explore. Playing with a friend results in more fun and some coop mission which needs to  I recommend this game.			"

												Saints Row: The Third is an over the top, open world over the shoulder third person shooter with strong action, good controls and some over sexualized comedy. There are plenty of giant purple bats, leather clad dancers, and awkward situations all done for the sake of comedy. You play as the head of a gang from the start, but really its a group of three tight friends that grows bigger to include a giant powerhouse, an ex FBI tech geek, a pretensions actor, a serious turncoat twin and an auto tuned pimp. These aren't just quest givers, you can call on them to help you on missions. When they're with you, they're smart enough to find cover in gun fights, take hostages and even steal a car to follow you when you drive off without them. When your ""homies"" fall, you need to pick them back up or lose the mission. There are frequent checkpoints, but with a game so fun, I don't mind if I die.The franchise really took a step away from being just a lesser version of Grand Theft Auto. They upped the gameplay and the comedy. Where GTA 4 turned gritty and real, Saints Row went the silly fun route. You can take hostages to use them as human shields. Improve your aim by crouching down. Head shot any enemy for an instant kill. Otherwise the enemies will spin around hoping to find cover and forcing your aim to follow them. There are multiple flying take downs and the animation seems outstanding for something that has so many of them.There is so much customization too. Everything from customizing your own look, to creating how your gang looks. If you want all thugs, go for it. If you want all space men or strippers. That's up to you. Their stats aren't affected. Its all just a look. Having your crew around makes an interesting mission even more fun. The whole thing is streamlined. Go to your PDA that will get a phone call sending you to a location on your GPS to start the mission. You'll find a wide variety in missions, fly to this location, take out a bunch of gang members, hop in a turret, drive through hostile territory, jump out of a plane ..... in a tank and shoot at people and other tanks as you fall. Then hop in a virtual world with a new weapon. Its always interesting and a few missions take place outside of the city in their own unique environments.Some missions end with a choice that really adds replay value. Do you get a one time sum of cash, or do you want a constantly generating smaller sum of cash. Do you want the aide of someone new or keep someone old? Even down to trivial things like discounts on car upgrades vs discounts on weapon upgrades or who you let live.The city of Steelport is a bright, beautiful, vibrant and gritty city. It all depends what area you're in. The industrial zone  has no lights, while the tourist part has beautiful neon lights. The city really lights up at night and looks amazing while flying. As the game progresses, the sights change. You'll see a sunken aircraft carrier, a plane tail up and much more to remind you of just how you've affected the city.Since this is a new city, you'll need to take it over. How do you do that? Participating in side quests like racing cars or a turf war with one of the three rival gangs in the city. You can buy stores that count to the take over percentage. There are even score based games like insurance fraud and mayhem that have you rag dolling into cars or destroying property. When you own a percentage of the city, you'll make money for it every real life hour you play. Outside of controlling the city, you can participate in assassinations, car thefts and hijackings with a passenger, then hold them until you get a ransom. Money for weapons becomes irrelevant. You'll always have more than enough ammo even if you never visit a gun store. What the money really goes to are upgrades. In the PDA menu you'll upgrade how much ammo you can have, what guns your crew has, your total health, how fast it regenerates, how much stamina you have and so much more. This is the expensive part of the game. Each gun has four levels of upgrade. The fourth level is always something silly like explosive bullets from a pistol.There are plenty of weapons in six major types, melee, small, sub machine guns, shot guns, assault rifles, misc (rockets), sniper rifles and four types of throwable things like grenades. You can only have one of each weapon type equipped at a time, but that's more than enough. Some missions require you to use a rocket launcher and it won't just give you a launcher, it gives you unlimited rockets. Its one of the joys of this game. High powered weapons with big effects. Once the STAG army shows up, there are some even more creative weapons like a force rifle that when used it pushes away enemies and fully charged obliterates them. There's just so much variety here, even a tactical missile strike, but that's not nearly as fun as everything else.Bosses are big brutes that can run right through you. They are pretty simple to take down though. Shoot them enough times and a quick button prompt will finish them off. The ones without guns will throw cars and benches around. The ones with guns carry flame throwers or heavy machine guns that thankfully jam. With them gone you can pick up their heavy weapons to use as your own, but the bigger the weapon, the slower you move. These weapons are worth the time for the power and fun they bring, especially the sticky bomb launcher.On top of that, you can climb into vehicles, cars, motor cycles, trucks, but better than that are tanks, armored SUVs, helicopters and some futuristic hover jets and cycles. The hover jets and cycles have two modes, jet and hover. Its perfect from a gameplay standpoint, go fast or hover so you can easily take out slow moving ground units and land on a dime. The vehicles with weapons are a lot of fun to shoot with unlimited ammo, but there are cool downs. Tanks that pancake cars. Missiles that lock onto things and follow them. Its very enjoyable.The characters in your crew are excellently voiced and your chemistry together really shines through. Sure they poke fun at one another, but they have some memorably fun times beyond just shooting things. Silly happy moments like singing to Sublime on the radio and Oleg revealing how he has met his intellectual equal while in a firefight. The bosses of the gangs are worthy characters in their own right. They really make cut scenes interesting.With you playing a criminal and all, there is notoriety in stars. The cops won't just chase after you, but the gangs and STAG army will too. Police will send helicopters with snipers. Enemy gangs will even setup roadblocks to stop you. It gets to a chaotic level sometimes when a gang and an army are after you. All three factions including your own start to fight in giant wars that can have dozens of people. Its amazing to be a part of. The game makes good use of big environments so you can flank your enemies and they can flank you.Saints Row: The Third is an amazing and fun game with enough DLC to choke Godzilla. Its mostly all just cosmetic stuff. The Complete Pack has been $5, there's no reason not to pick it up, but with its comedy, its just not for kids.			"

												Excellent game overall, the main story line took me around 15 hours to complete. Fair enough it's quite short but I'd much prefer it to be this short and amazing story rather than a long story and not as good story. One last thing I was slightly disappointed about was the fact I was hoping for 4 player co-op and it only has two player.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Saints Row The ThirdDeveloper:  VolitionPublisher:  Deep SilverGenre:  3rd Person ActionGeneral ImpressionSR3 is a departure from the relative seriousness of the previous two titles in the series. No doubt about that and it's a good thing too. Saints Row The Third can no longer be called by anyone, a ""GTA clone"". It has its own distinct style. A true sandbox open world, where you can have fun/cause chaos at your own pace without being dragged down by some ""gritty scenario based on real life gang warfare"". Nope, you can finish the entire game nude, speaking Zombie and wielding a huge ♥♥♥♥♥-shaped baseball bat if that's what you want. That freedom of absurd choices is what makes this game far better than GTA IV for example. The cars control way better than SR2 and the customization is as good as it gets in video games. Don't skip to Saints Row IV directly, even if they share the map partially. They have enough differences to make them both, worth a try.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics and soundtrack.+ Absurdly fun gameplay.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- A few glitches.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												8/10Similar to GTA style and very fun. I would call it more casual than GTA. But still, plenty of campaigns and nice graphics. Roaming around is never a dull experience either. Lot's of perks and fun things to do. Play co-op with one friend.			"

												Saints Row: The Third is one of my best experience. It doesn't want you to take it seriously, but have the most time laughing, having fun, and enjoying yourself. The character customization feature stand out. The City is a big place based on New York, and you will have hours to go exploring.			"
