												A short Action-Shooter in space (~4h to complete).No more, no less.Runs smoothly on my win7 64bit machine.I bought it for 1€ on Winter Sale, worth it.			"

												The game was awesome until we got to mission 21. The end was unfinished when the after objection was complete. Needs conclusion after this, their were no promotion, acknowledgements of any kind. Just nothing really.			"

												Better than the Strike Suit games, imo. One of the better space fighter combat games I've played. The tech is obviously old, but it runs super smooth, doesn't look half bad design-wise, and most importantly, is actually fun to play. I have some gripes with it: The friendly AI is only useful for distracting enemy fire, so in escort missions (of which there are sadly many) you're practically on your own. Buildings and other structures have invisible walls around them, so even if you think you're nowhere near it, you will likely still crash into it and explode if you get close enough. I have actually been killed by buildings more often than enemy AI. There is also a sky box, which is understandable, but completely unfair considering the enemy AI can go further past it than you can, meaning sometimes pursuing enemies is a drag, with you waiting for them to come back down so you can take them out. Most of these can be put down to the hardware limitations of the time rather than bad design, so I've given these faults the benefit of the doubt and just gone with it, which made the experience more enjoyable. Without taking the game seriously, I was able to have fun with it. That, in my opinion, saves this game.			"

												It's suppose to be a action based Simulation right? Well it's more a lowered down version of Free lancer, whats diffrent here you think? They take away all your freedom to do as pleased and instead you are forced on each mission but before you go out on mission you can choose which upgrade you want to get upgraded from the reward and the things you can level are Attack, Defence and Speed. You can to select easyli what upgrade to take and sometimes you get your weapon /sheild / engines upgraded. For being 3€ on steam it's not to bad... but I would recomand this game to people who enjoys being a lapdog and forced doing mission for upgrades.Oh yeah the lock on missels will miss 90% of the time so if you are lucky with it might hit.

												It's a very linear space fighter game wherein the general idea is ""crush kill destroy you are the STRONGEST IN THE UNIVERSE"". You get to upgrade your ship as time passes, but that's the only customization there is; minimal replay value due to exactly one campaign and no modding. Story's okay, voice acting's generally good but has a few terribad spots, mostly where the script obviously wanted characters to be interrupted but the devteam didn't bother making the pauses between different characters speaking have anything other than a fixed interval.Basically: It's good fun, and it's incredibly cheap at the moment (75 cents) so you don't really have that much to lose by buying it.

												How does one appropriately rate a game?  With Project Freedom, it was a difficult choice.Let's talk about the good things about Project Freedom.  It's pretty fast-paced, and the actual gameplay--space fighter combat--is quite enjoyable.  You have several weapons available, useful for different things.  Lasers are good for taking down enemy fighters.  Missiles and the plasma weapon are good for targeting large buildings on planets, freighters, and capital ships.  The gameplay itself is pretty good.But the plot is pretty simplistic (Human factions are fighting each other, a couple alien races show up and you ultimately have to destroy a huge station/space ship), there are no characters, and the bare bones upgrade system almost may as well not have been included--just decide whether you want to upgrade engines, defenses, or weapons, and the game seems to choose which particular sub-upgrade you get within the category of your choice.I can't remember any of the music, having now played PF twice.  Contrast this with, for example, Darkstar One.  Darkstar One really isn't a great game--but I can still remember the main theme music, and the quirkiness of the main and secondary characters.But, once again, the gameplay is pretty solid.  PF didn't really have major flaws--there's just not much meat in this package.  And in consequence, I only spent something like $3 or $4 on PF, and once I bought it, it only took ~5 hours to beat the ~20 missions.  So even if there are a few annoyances, and a general lack of interesting content . . . it won't last for very long, and during that time you have nice, fast-paced space-blasting melee.  And how much different is that from, say, Counter Strike?  Except, CS is replayable because it's multiplayer and has tons of maps.  So it was kind of hard for me to say No instead of Yes on this game.So I'll say this.  Don't go into PF expecting a whole lot.  If you're fan of space shoot 'em ups, go ahead and buy it, but make sure you don't pay much.  Go in, blast some baddies, and get out.  (That's what I did, yes, TWICE, since that part was pretty fun, and I kind of wondered if something might jump out at me the second time around.)  If you want something that's a lot more amusing, colorful, and enjoyable and has a decent amount of meat, buy Darkstar One, for example.  But I don't think your average player will find a lot of interest in Project Freedom.5/10.			"

												Surprisingly good for such a cheap game. The graphics can be awesome - if you're into Mars geography, you'll wet yourself. Gameplay is fine, it's a general arcade shooter - no targeting, just shoot in front of you. Friendly AI actually do their jobs, getting kills, getting killed, and engaging enemies you're not engaging.Plot, music and voiceovers should be taken less seriously. The finale isn't epic, but it's still a fun game for a couple of days.Space bits might reminder you of a stripped-down Freelancer (but it's a shooter, not sandbox), graphics might remind you of one of the X games, and the on-planet bits will definitely remind you of Rogue Squadron.P.S. Play on easy.			"

												I figured I would give this game a whirl since I'm a fan of old space games from the 90s era (Colony Wars, TieFighter, etc...) and was hoping this would scratch that itch. Unfortunately the controls are so abysmal (up front granted my time has been brief with the game..) it's quite off-putting. There are plenty of other free-to-play options that may be done better, and it's difficult to recommend this to anyone even for its severely discounted price. Quite a bare bones game. Oh well...			"

												This game seems really simple and there is nothing big about it, but I like it. I like it so much that I beated it, like, ten times or even more. Maybe it's quite beautiful views of space around, or fast paced combat, or simplicity of gameplay, I can't say for certain. But I definitely recommend you give it a shot if you'll see this game on sale.			"

												I really like this game, especially for its modding value. Sure, it's just brainless shooting, but at least its graphics are pretty good. And it runs on old graphics hardware too (albeit with low frame rates)! I'm making a mod right now, that's due in a few days. If you like to kill 20-minute chunks of time, and want a bit of difficulty, you'll like this.Public review update: I still enjoy this game. Yes, the story is shallow, voiceovers sometimes annoying, and the missions all playing the same, but if you just want to shoot some baddies in space, it delivers. Every once in a while the in-game banter is funny. If you like messing around with game files, the game is certainly moddable. I've completed my mod a long time ago (see here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/34810/discussions/0/882960308802221978/), and although the models are in a proprietary format, I think I saw some 3DS/LWO loading code, so it's probably possible to introduce new models.Go pick it up on a sale.

												Not worth a cent. Bad voice acting, bad design, weird controls. Allies seem to think that you need encouragement every time you kill an enemy ship such as ""Right between the eyes!"", ""Looks like we've got a new ace!"" and my favourite ""Nice shoot!"" (Not gramatically correct). I got this game as it was cheap in the sale but even though I only spent a a pound on it, I was severely dissapointed. I won't complain about any other of the sub-par features (graphics, physics, mesh rendering) as it is an older game, however if you care about that sort of thing then this isn't for you.			"
