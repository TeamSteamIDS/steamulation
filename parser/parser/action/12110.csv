It was a long time ago.2002. GTA: VC is coming out.This was a game way ahead of its time. If GTA III was, no doubt, a breakthrough, it wasn't that perfect.Vice City, on the other hand, was. The main change of time and place was spot on. Miami, 80's, blood, drugs, sex and rock'n'roll.With combination like that it couldn't go wrong, and it didn't. Polishing the predecessor's engine and graphics, VC expanded everything: map, weapons, cars, abilities and so much more. But the most important part was that it did it more subtle than San Andreas, for example.To have this kind of freedom and variety in the open world game was completely mindblowing 14 years ago.And I still think that this is and probably always will be the best GTA game for me.-Hey, member, member Vice City? -Mmm, yes, I member!The story is a classic from-bottom-to-the-top-Scarface-like journey. And although it's nothing spectacular, all well-written characters, funny lines of dialogue and memorable missions made it special.Just take a look at what kind of jobs were there and tell me you don't miss it:- Explode a building with RC helicopter- Dress as a cop and plant a bomb at the mall- Steal a ♥♥♥♥ing tank in a broad daylight from main street- Produce and promote your own porn movie- Jump between two skyscrapers on a bike- Fight off a french army on a boat- Join the gang, start a war, join the other gang, repeat- Buy an ice-cream truck and sell dope from itDon't forget the first massive Bank Heist with several preparation missions beforehand.♫""...keep feeling fascination""The absolute classic, Vice City will forever pass the test of time for me.Nostalgic, colorful, warm and welcoming city.Dangerous, unforgiving and corrupt city.City of love, hate, awesome music, politics, gangwars, drugs, criminals and ♥♥♥♥♥s.City of opportunity, quintessence of the American Dream.The city you want to come back to sometimes.Vice City.

												So, it takes a couple of fan patches to get working correctly for contemporary and widescreen set-ups; but, this game's pretty good fun.Great writing, goofy AI and humor, and arcadey gameplay.  Amazing '80s soundtrack.  Unfortunately, '80s Miami is brought down by really fugly graphics.Of course, buy on sale.

												Ignore my steam playtime, i've played this for hundreds of hours back in the day.-----------Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, released in 2002. It was set in 1986 in Vice City (Fictional name for Miami Beach, Florida, i guess it's not hard to tell). A game that is still one of the greatest games of this era, in 2003 everyone was crazy about it. You can judge if this is a masterpiece or not by just looking at it's popularity even nowadays, how many games that are 11 years old are still played today? Not many. The atmosphere you find in this game is perfect, your ears are delighted with great tracks from: Michael Jackson (Never liked him, but he had some great tracks), Megadeth, Anthrax, Cutting Crew, The Whispers, The Outfield, Bryan Adams, Iron Maiden, Loverboy, Slayer, Judas Priest, even Frankie goes to Hollywood, and the list goes on more of course.The graphics were absolutely amazing at the time of release. Gameplay was, and still is great, the mechanics are friendly. You ave a variety of weapons to choose from when it comes to slaughtering random people on the street, including hookers and old ladies. The cars you find in this game, are mostly sport ones, you also can find scooters and motorbikes.You play as Tommy Vercetti, a mafia member that just got out of the prison. You are involved in a deal that gone wrong and you need to find the people who 'backstabbed' you'. In my opinion, this is the greatest GTA game released, shame that GTA V kinda 'dodged' the actual GTA feeling there once was, but hey, we have to move forward!. I would love to see a GTA: Vice City remake, nonetheless.As for the technical stuff about this game. It works on Windows 8.1 flawlessly, without any compatibility options set, or any patch or modification. It recognizes new resolutions (1440x900 user here). A perfect game that gave me hundreds hours of fun many years ago.			"

												Vice City is probably the best GTA that has been made to date. Obviously, as a PC gamer, this opinion does not include GTA V as that one was never released by Rockstar on my favourite platform. I personally liked GTA IV a lot and the reviews on the latest installment were very promising - I just think Vice City was more captivating than the rest.Vice City looks dated, yes. Please bear in mind that this is an eleven year old game and considering the capacity of our smart phones this game is accessible as an Android application as the game's engine can easily be handled by our phones' hardware. Its atmosphere, however, is still captivating even a decade after its release so playing such an ""old"" game on a widescreen monitor with next-gen hardware is no shame!You play as Tommy Vercetti (voice by Ray Liotta) and you are in the '80s. You have cars, music and even film references from this era. Some scenes remind you of Miami Vice while others are clearly a nod to Pacino's character in Scarface. How cool is that?You have dozens of missions available. Some continue the main story while other are just side missions. Each includes a cutscene with amazing voice acting so it is a crime to skip any of the available missions. Oh, you don't want to do any of these? No problem: Vice City allows the player to just cruise in the city, steal cars, crash these cars, harass citizens (with these cars, too). You can drive a cab and earn some money at your leisure. Or steal a police car and become the terminator of vigilantes.There are tons of things to do in GTA. And while Vice City is certainly an outdated game nothing else out there can remind you how cool the '80s were than this piece of treasure.			"

Grand Theft Auto: Vice CityLong, long and long time ago, when i played VC first at my old classmate on PS2. I really liked it, the feeling and the gameplay, everything. Then its released to PC, my friend told me he want to try a game(because his laptop was too low to run this game lol) so i told him ofc he can play it. We installed it on P3 500MHz 256 MB ram and 16MB nVIDIA Vanta/LT It was so laggy, mayb 10-15 FPS, but we didn't care about it. Those good times was really great. I remember we played it more than 10PM and my friend's older brother came to say now you should already come home, hahaI played this game a lot. Vercetti character is the best. Vercetti: No sonny, i dont't have the money! Sonny: that was my money Tommy! My money!!! :DAfter many years i just browed eBay somewhy and i found an original 2003 boxed version of Vice City for PC for auction!Of course i won it! :33Now its on my desk with all of content! :) I love it! I REALLY PREFER THIS GAME TO ANYBODY! THOSE 80' years oh my god :DLOVE IT! "

												I should mention that i've played this a lot during the last couple of years. And i modded it A LOT.GTA Vice City is one of the best GTA games ever made! The setting is perfect, they got the feel of the '80s in there and all in all, it looks great, even today, after 11 years. There are TONS of mods for Vice City and people are making mods even today! Native controller support is kinda wonky but GInput's there to fix that. Just install GInput, get x360ce if you don't have a 360 pad and enjoy! Cars don't have enough polys? Xbox Cars to PC to the rescue! Road Textures too muddy for you? A lot of mods exist that fix that, but Miami Real Roads (By RWWPL @GTAGarage) is a personal favorite of mine. And the list goes on and on.			"

OverviewDespite its age, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is still an extremely fun game. I have played every GTA game to date and despite my love for Grand Theft Auto 5, I still prefer Vice City and in the paragraphs below I will attempt to explain why.A Good Starting PointI love GTA 3. The game has quite a lot of enjoyable gameplay and during my most recent playthrough, I didn't have too many issues (besides the races), which was fairly impressive for a game of its age. This certainly does nor mean the game is amazing. In 2016 the game is both a bit clunky and also lacking aesthetic wise. The game was a good starting point and a great transition from the 2D gameplay of old into the 3D realm we know today. I understand how revolutionary GTA 3 was, however looking back in 2016 with the incredible GTA 5 out as well as some decent competitors such as Watch Dogs 2 and Mafia 3, GTA 3 doesn't stand up as well as it used to. Vice City (in my opion) does.Standing Up to Modern Open-World GamesOpen worlds are getting bigger and bigger as both time and hardware move forward. In an era full of games with huge landscapes that take hours to explore, revisiting Vice City was very refreshing. It takes about 10 minutes maximum to traverse the map and that is without counting for the race cars which can be found around every corner. I feel I have to truly get into a game in order to play it nowadays. You can't just sit down, do a quick mission and then leave again. This is mostly personal but a lot of Vice City's charm comes with its simplicity, in my eyes at least. Of course, the game isn't ""simple"" as I put it but compared to modern open world games it's far from complex; thats why I love the game. It's so easy just to do a few missions, save and quit. I think if the game tried to be complex it would've been left in the dust as time went by, but the games simplistic charm is what truly makes it timeless.GameplayAiming/ShootingMy main quarrel with this game is it's aiming mechanics and this is stemmed from the lack of over the shoulder aiming. Shooting accurately in third person is a pain. Let's say you have someone directly in front of you that you need to shoot. You aim your crosshair at them, but due to the camera angle, this makes you look at the ground missing your target. Instead, you aim above the target so you shoot straight in front of you (in theory). You shoot into the sky. This is quite easily fixed by scoping with the Assult Rifles however that makes 2/3s of weapons redundant. This is mainly a sign of age, however, the Assult Rifles spoke of earlier are not hard to find.Driving/FlyingDriving is very smooth for keyboard and mouse and is both playable and enjoyable. The flying is rather hard to get used to. In the modern day, it is rather rare to use the num pad to control anything let alone something as complex as a helicopter. It is very hard to control at first, however, upon getting used to can be fun to use. Boats are ok but a bit odd due to the physics engine.PhysicsThe physics engine for this game is both a bit clunky and also glitchy due to its age, however it is rare to have an issue with it in normal gameplay. Cars occasionally slide upon collision and some bigger vehicles can seem weightless and tip over but these issues are rare.The Story and MissionsThe story follows Tommy Vercetti as he is forced into the crime underworld of Vice City, a Miami-inspired metropolis filled to the brim with gangs, drugs and greed. You, through the eyes of Tommy, rise up through the criminal world and slowly build your empire gradually making more and more money. Admittedly the story can be a bit cheesy and predictable but this fits the pumped up 80s action film tropes that this game likes to both mock and mimic. Most missions are fun and interesting. You can go from stealing a phone from a gang of chefs to blowing up part of a mall and attempting to escape with a 5-star wanted level. Of course, a few missions are difficult and require multiple runs, but that just adds playtime.The EndThank you for reading my review. At the price this game goes for, I would recommend you pick it up. Who knows you might just fall in love all over again. "

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City puts in the adventure of Tommy Vercetti who tries to find rich and prosperity in the infamous city of Vice City during the 1980's. There are a lot of similarities between Vice City's story and the movie Scarface; I'll let you see for youself.Unlike Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City is wild, colorful and of course, BAD. The world truly captures the 80's feeling, not just with cars, people or the environment, but with music. The first song you are guaranteed to hear, is Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. Other notable songs include Killed the radio star. Heck look at the tags for this game 'Great soundtrack', speaks for itself.Bottom line is, buy it, play it, love it.			"

The story is great, alot of funny and interesting caracters to meet, alot to explore in such a small map. a decent amount of car motorcycles and helicopters,only one plane though. you can expect a good 30-60 hours of gameplay depending on wether you 100% it or not. you can do a bunch in this game aside from the main story, tons of side missions, hidden packages and easter eggs. tons of classic songs too, great if your into 80's music. this is review is based off of years of playing this game not just 7.3 hours on steam :)			"

												I absolutely 100% recommend this game to anyone wanting to get into the older GTAs. It's a great starting point as it has better gameplay than GTAIII and quality of life features. It's story and presentation have aged like fine wine, the voice actors and performances are also great, and it was the starting point of where GTA started getting it's own identity in terms of presentation and stories.There is one huge caveat though, if you think you're going to just buy this game on Steam and enjoy yourself, you're badly mistaken honestly. Rockstar's previous efforts of putting GTA on PC were absolutely laughable in comparison to where they are now with GTAV, which is an awesome version of the game. Vice City is one of the most annoying video game experiences I've had just out of the box, so I've spent some time modding the game. My recommendation is based off my experience with Vice City with 3 Essential mods installed and honestly only buy this game if you're going to mod the game with these 3 mods.- Ginput (Fixes basic PC controls to a more modern/natural feel, as well as adds XInput functionality. ALSO WORKS FOR SA AND 3)- GTAVC Widescreen Fix (A quick internet search of this mod will bring you to the correct site where there is support for San Andreas, ViceCity, and GTA 3)- SilentPatch (Fixes a TON of issues, just download it)Vice City is an outstanding game that I think must be experienced in this day and age, it's outstanding theme, radio soundtrack and characters make it impossible to forget after experiencing it, and it's a stepping stone in Rockstar's legacy.

												Why would you want to play this old ♥♥♥ game when GTA V is out? Just kidding.Hi, I'm Dubgame. You may remember me from such reviews as ""Fallout: New Vegas"", ""Hotline Miami"" and ""Bad Rats"". Now I have been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for 12 years now and I cannot say that I am bored with it. This game is a proper classic! The storyline, the soundtrack, the memories, fantastic! For a game that was released in 2002 I personally think that it has aged well. If you have not played this game then there is something seriously wrong with you or you have been living in a cave since '02. This was made back when Rockstar cared about gameplay more than appearance. Once again friends, I thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules to read my review. I truly hope I have influenced your opinion of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.Yours in gaming,Dubgame.			"

												This game rocks, as you can build your own urban empire and build revenues! With this game you can almost do anything, as long you don't get busted by the cops that look like Steve Irwin, hehe! Some of the players favourite weapons like the Ninja Sword, Minigun, SPAS-12, MP5-A2 and M4-A1 are included, but no AK-47s, sorry! But you can download a Model Mod to change the Ruger into a AK47.The only thing that I find a bit disturbing, however is the stereotyping involved in Caribbean mob war fights - which some players may find upsetting or distressing.Also there a couple important notes to remember: if you don't want your Criminal Rating Stats to be ruined, don't use the cheats too often. And secondly download the X10 Draw Distance and DirectDraw Fix for this game. Try it!IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't save your saves from the Ice Cream Van Factory nor play with Frame Limiter Off, as those factors could corrupt your saves and Widescreen isn't supported for this Steam Version.http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=677http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=779 "

												Some time ago I was reviewing GTA 3 and said it's still a classy and enjoyable product, even by todays standards. Well, I wasn't lying, but I know that the industry have made a huge leap forward since the times of the GTA 3 release. Honestly saying, even the GTA V is not an absolute king of the day at moment. It's just a one great game from the row. But, it's a progress which is really much obliged for everything to the GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas games. Those titles are like cornerstones of the great skyscraper of the gaming industry and the milestones for its progress altogether.Oh, anyway, let's cut short to the game already, yeah?The top selling points of the Vice city, are - the spirit of 80's, with music, cars and everything, and the cunning story, with the main character who's not just some random guy like Claude from GTA 3 or people before him. Those things are good and touching even now. Jeez, I love the 80's! And I love the Vice City game!Yeah, by the time it was released, there was some more things to talk about. Like the weather visual effects, addition of bikes, and some more things - all of them was mind-blowing then, but seems standard issue now. Even the furious missions like ""the Demo man"", where you need to blow things with RC models, while using quite the challenging controls and time limits to do so - now seems as usual stuff as well. I bet many drone operators in the US who are using the real deal Predators somewhere in the Afghanistan, have started with the GTA RC missions...But, if you're now wandering, if the GTA Vice City is still an option to play, and what's for, I'll answer you: Yes, for it's the blast from the past, with the whole set of things we're love 80s for. And yeah, it's quite playable, after you tune yourself with controls a bit.So, my mark is 8.5/10, and I recommend the game for everyone.			"

												So you might be asking why review a game that originally came out in 2002/2003? Well to this day it is still my favorite game. Nothing has come close to beating it and i don’t think anything ever will. There’s been a lot of controversy over the years about the Grand Theft Auto games, and their potential effects on children; so, this is probably a bad time to mention that I first played Vice City when I was quite young. But onto why I love the game so much: it’s probably a mixture of nostalgia and obsession. I believe that it would be in my top 5 games that I’ve spent the most time on (I’ve probably beaten it 12 times), and it’s quite ultimately the game I am the most familiar with.One of the more-objectively strong reasons why I love Vice City over the other GTA games is that Tommy Vercetti, as a main character, makes the most sense. It’s out of character for the majority of GTA characters to run around on a rampage. Vercetti is a sandpaper-rough, heartless shell of a man: he only wants to get the money back that was stolen from him, and he’ll work with whoever he can to achieve his goals. Some people may see him as a bit of a shallow character, but I’d rather that over a bad-guy-turned-good, like a lot of the other main characters in the GTA series. It just makes no sense for Niko (from GTA IV) to mow down dozens of pedestrians, when a lot of his dialogue is about the horrors of war back in his homeland, and how he is coming to the US to make himself a new life. Plus he first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt i mean what is there not to love.Much like the cast of characters, the story of Vice City worked so wonderfully because the developers threw it all against the backdrop of the nineteen eighties, which was in itself just a rip roaring time to be alive. At least that’s the impression one gets from games and television. You know, if you ignored the cold war, economic recession and the bad hairstyles. Vice City won in my eyes as it was a straight up gangster story. It certainly helped that it was basically a retelling of Scarface. If you’re going to make an 80s gangster movie there’s no better source material.Now onto the most-subjective reason why I love the game, even more so than pure nostalgia: the radio stations, or more specifically: V Rock. I still have the entire audio file of the station on my computer, and I’d listen to it separate from the game. I listen to it while i’m driving around today so that must count for something. V Rock is still for me the pinnacle of in game music. As someone who wasn’t that into music in my younger days, I can thank V Rock for introducing me to the bands I would still be listening to today. 2 Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden, Bark at the Moon from Ozzy, ♥♥♥ On Feel The Noize by Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister, Motley Crue and many more. Classic metal at its finest. It was also hosted by everyone’s favourite radio host Lazlow, of Chatterbox fame.This isn’t to say that Vice City is a perfect game, but then again I personally believe that a critical part of loving something is realising that it’s not perfect, and being okay with its faults. The game has some pretty obtrusive shooting controls, because of the early lock-on mechanic. It’s the same sort of issue that the other PS2-era GTAs had. This makes the shooting parts of gameplay quite unnecessarily hard. Not that I dislike a hard game, but I want to at least feel as though I am in control when I am getting the crap shot out of my character. To summarise, Vice City is a great combination of atmosphere, story, characters, and soundtrack. If you’re only familiar with the Grand Theft Auto games with fancy graphics on current-gen consoles, then you really should give Vice City a try. You can thank me later.			"

												One of the best series of games I have ever played in my entire life. The game presents a wonderful story of Tommy Vercetti who framed by his friends goes to jail. Our adventure with main character starts after leaving the prison. The story resembles the movie ""Scarface"". There are many missions, outside the main thread we can perform many side tasks from playing with the guardian of law who must kills the villains , to the distribution of pizza or ""ice cream"".The entire map of the game is a great matched and explore it and look for the secrets hidden on the map gives us many hours of unforgettable adventures. Compared to the previous section, in Vice City we have a choice of more cars and boats, as well as motorcycles and helicopters. For carrying out the missions we get money that we can buy new weapons and houses. In this game, there are plenty of weapons to choose from a baseball bat to a minigun.The Radio Station has a lot of amazing music from 80’s. I have discovered many of greatest songs.The system of save game is well considered. In every house, we can save the progress.I went Vice City 5 times. Never get bored. At the end of the main story I have always tears in the eyes.I recommend this game.11/10 from me.			"

												First of all, I want to say this game is the reason I am a PC gamer.Vice City is based on Miami, which was a major cocaine trans-shipment point for South America at the time. This is further reinforced with its theme of the drug business and crime, as well as the presence of new upper-class businesses and residents in the city, with some of them likely to be funded by the drug business. Vice City is specifically located within the state of Florida.The game seems to keep the '80s atmosphere, which is a very important thing. Tommy Vercetti is the most Vice City badass protagonist, which is ready to kill and destory in order to become a leader. Everything is great about this game. The vehicles, the missions, the atmosphere, the weather... and so on.I could tell you a lot more things, but I don't waste your time anymore, and tell you dirrectly: Buy this now, and enjoy playing a REALLY GOOD game.

												""Welcome to Vice City, 1986. . . .""IntroductionGrand Theft Auto: Vice City. In a sense this is the game turned the franchise from a cult classic, to a game that everyone wanted. Since while in GTA, and GTA II, it was a top based shooter. There was no real story line, and general it was a cult game series. GTA III, it gave you a silent hero based in 2001. You suddenly were able to shoot in a 3-D environment, and had an actual story line. Well here in Vice City, they've take the formula that worked, and added more to it, so let's do it!Story 10/10The idea is you're Thomas Vercetti, a man who has just done 15 years in jail for ""the family"", your sent down south to buy some cocaine and get it back north. Well the deal goes south, and now you owe the 'family' a load of money, and you need the cocaine. As you investigate what happened, and you get your revenge. You'll see how Tommy changes in Vice City, from a hired gun, to something more. What I like about this story line, is that it's believable. Based on what I've found of the era (mid-80's), and the character profile we get of Tommy. Since if someone were thrown into his situation, with his connections. What he becomes is plausible, pending him getting arrested or killed. As a note here to the writers, they could've gone with some very immature humour, but when it does go funny, its done with a sense of class almost.Graphics 9/10I know some people are going to be screaming at me over this, since I gave the graphics a 9 rating over a 10. This game is 12 years old, and yes its aged well. I've seen modem games with worse graphics, at a higher price.Each gun, each car, even key people look unique. However, the problem is there are gaps where you see 'blue', and sometimes the details that separate two cars is so small you need to be the developer to see it. The other problem is running though trees, half the time Tommy is hidden from you. Which means you can't see him, and you see a 'blue' outline around the leafs.Sound & Music 11/10This is not a joke people. I am giving this game a 11/10 for music and sound. Since this is audio perfection. One of the reasons why I bought this game was for the in game radio. Besides the fashion, the radio music & chatter help set the mood for the game. You get an idea of what it was like to be in the 1980's. Where the cold war wasn't over yet, or how rap music was brand new. This is where you're going to get the real bang for your gaming dollar. Since I admit it, there are times I just load up the game, slap on a station as I do something else on my PC.Besides the music, you can listen to how a gun fires and you've got a good idea of what's being fired at you. Maybe you can't tell the difference between two Semi-automatics. However, if someone close to you is firing a pistol, and the guy next to him is using a shot gun. You can tell the difference, and when you're outgunned, that kind of information is handy.Game play 8/10I've got a few complains about the actual game engine per say. Sometimes the game lags for a few seconds when swapping radio stations, or exiting a vehicle. Other times, you can't see a 'target' circle on someone you're simpering, and when you pop off the shot it works. Who can forget that when firing from a vehicle, how there is no targeting circle. Its all guess and check. With the exception of when you're being driven by someone else.Now the beautiful part of this engine is how you've got to account for something moving. Most games if you're moving, you aim, you fire, you hit. In This game, you need to account for the motion of yourself, or the target, and sometimes both. The controls that are used are used in almost every game so the learning curve is not a long one.9/10			"

												So I have played through the story of this game 70+ times on Playstation 2. (i was counting I lost count after the 70th time). I own 3 different copies for ps2, Two copies for xbox original, 2 physical release copies for pc, I have it for android, and now I have it for steam. I have put hundreds of hours into this game if not thousands, this is easily one of my most played games of all time. This is the type of game I can pick up and start playing at any given time.I love everything about the story and the gameplay, lets not forget about that award winning soundtrack. It was amazing for its time, I still think it is great to play today. If you have the pc version make sure you check out the multiplayer mod for it https://vc-mp.org . its not perfect but its a great little time killer. If you can 100% complettion this game you are master at gaming. I very highly recommend this game to anybody especially if you are a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series. "

												Tips:Leave Frame Limiter ONTurn Trails OFFInstall a graphics overhaul modUse your gfx cards software crank up the antialiasingRevisiting games from yesteryear can often leave a sour taste in your mouth, but Vice City is a gem that will continue to please for years to come. I put so many hours into the PS2 version and I'm surprised at how many more hours I have put into it on Steam. The radio is fantastic, driving around and causing havoc is still fun. The shooting mechanics are rough and can make some missions frustrating, but I found things very manageable with 150 armour or health. My patience for games isnt what it used to be but I'm still having fun working towards 100% completion on this one.			"

												Good ol Vice City...This game in my own personal opinion is the greatest GTA title in the whole series. The Atmosphere alone tramples any GTA game past or present, the music, the characters, the setting, the story, the protaginist, the warm beaches, it's all wonderful. Tommy Vercetti is hands down the best character made by Rockstar. His story is actually believable too, not absolutley ridiculous and horrid like GTA 5's. And damn was the gore fun. Blowing off heads and limbs with your Sniper or Shottie was awesome. Driving around the warm streets of Vice City on a motorcycle or in a nice convertable never fails to bring endless joy to my heart. Really hope Rockstar comes back to Vice City and Tommy in the future, not to mention learn how to make good story once more. 10/10, this game is forever fantastic.			"

""Funny how?""Full of pop culture charm, sarcasm and blaring synthesisers, Rockstar's love letter to the likes of Goodfellas, Boogie Nights and Scarface really reflects the mastery of Vice City and the game's success. Voiced by none other than Ray ""Henry freakin' Hill"" Liotta, your journey as Tommy Vercetti through this '80s odyssey and crazed sea of neon lights, big hair and bright clothing features some of the best content that the GTA series has to offer.One of the reasons Rockstar Games continues to set and then decisively smash the standard for open-world wish fulfilment is because of just how brilliant their games are. Boasting an intellectual depth that far exceeds its critics, the GTA series in particular is yet to be equalled in humour and outright cynicism. I wouldn't be lying when saying that Rockstar continues to deliver some of the most relentlessly funny and cutting wit that's out there. I'll often stop playing to just listen and laugh at the latest crack at modern society. When there's better writing for radio station advertisements than the majority of real life television and cinema, it really shows just how great this series is. That's not to say that gameplay doesn't have something to do with it. The sheer amount of things to do, missions to complete and areas to explore here is astronomical, as is the case for the rest of the series. If you're looking for something to kill time with, then look no further. Old-school GTA has got you covered.Sure, the visuals have certainly aged, featuring blocky character models and low-res textures, but the rest of the game remains timeless. I’d wager that even the most stubborn of graphics diehards would soon become absorbed by the otherwise top-notch quality. With a tonne of varied environments and satisfying gameplay to boot, Vice City is just as good as it's modern counterparts. In the pre-San Andreas and GTA V world, there wasn't that much on offer in terms of the games we take for granted today, with most of the popular and ambitious titles back then confined mainly to the fantasy/role-playing market or the occasional narrative-driven FPS. Like the early days of cinema, crime was seen as taboo and highly controversial but - thankfully - titles such as GTA and Manhunt were set to change that, regardless of the backlash. A significant departure from the rather empty feel of GTA III, Vice City delivers yet again on what you'd expect from the series. The few noticeable flaws were mainly down to clipping or the occasional bug or glitch but nothing major. It's held up really well and remains popular for a reason. Whether stealing a tank from the military or attacking a fortress with a helicopter-mounted machinegun; from trying to hold out against the cops to being caught in a (relatively) high speed chase after a buggy while riding a bike with a blown-out tyre, this has it all. Better still? Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s ‘The Message’ was blasting all the while over the radio.Good times. All that and more awaits in Vice City. "

												5/5 Most of my playtime with GTA Vice City has been with the physical disc version (DVD ROM) and PS2 version. So my Steam stats don't reflect all of my experience with this game.PROS:+One of the funnest open-world/sandbox games ever made.+HUGE and diverse environment to explore!+Fully interactive environment.+Great variety in missions, both story based and side jobs.+Diverse choices of vehicles, weapons, and character skins.+Great story. On par with Martin Scorsese films, with a good dose of pop culture satire.+Awesome soundtrack, reflecting the 1980s setting of the story.+Memorable characters with excellent voice acting.+Modest hardware requirements: any PC built after 2002 or Mac built after 2008 should be able to run GTA Vice City.+Gamepad support, both Direct Input (Logitech/PS3/generic) and Xinput (360).+Windows and Mac versions included.CONS:-6th gen (PS2 era) graphics will put off graphics snobs.-No multiplayer.

												Damn, what a game! Personally, this one is my favorite over GTA 2, 3 or 4, mostly because of all this neon glowing bloom, expensive cars and bikes, and beautiful sunsets :). +Visuals: Back in 2003 this game was BEAUTIFUL, and still looks good for me, no matter what :) Each GTA is unique in its own way, and this one is just COOL, at least 20% cooler than other parts.+Soundwork: great radio stations!+Gameplay: A lot of arcade missions, a lot of bike racing stuff, a lot of money to waste on hookers, and a lot of side jobs to keep yourself entertained:0 You can even hose people down when you are in the fire truck. Enjoyable all around, really cool game, yeh. Interesting Campaign as well.Personally I would be happy if someday Rockstar add steam cards to this one so you could get a fancy wallpaper from 2003 :)p.s. small bonushttps://coub.com/view/d1u1u "

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is loosely modeled after Miami, Florida. You play as Tommy Vercetti, a Mafia hitman released from prison who returns to Vice City and builds a criminal empire. The soundtrack fit perfectly for the era the game was set in and was just a great mix of music. While the graphics are considered outdated by today's standards, Vice City was and remains one of my favorites in the series for the nostalgia factor. Originally released in 2002 on the PS2, and later in 2003 for Windows, it was considered to be the best selling video game of all time on the PS2. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was my very first introduction into the GTA Series. Back in 2004 or 2005, I had just gotten the new PS3 with the emotion chip, so I was able to play most playstation 2 games. There was a lot of controversy around Vice City at the time for the graphic violence and hidden sex scenes and everyone was anticipating the release of San Andreas, so I picked it up to see what the fuss was about. I must have played this game for days on end, it was such a blast. If you love the GTA Series, this is worth playing through at least once.			"

												Now, gamers and gentlemen, what you see here right now is ""GTA: Vice City"", one of the world's most epic PC game mankind ever created. The game's a open-world; you could go out and massacre everybody, destroy gangs, steal cars, and call in the FBI and the army and fight till the death. One of the new features is building investments, which is also a great feature that teaches you to stop wasting money on chicks and to get your head into the game. Great graphics for 2003 as well as the game engine. The story's is f*cking good; it's GTA. A 10 out of 10!			"

												I rarely wrote reviews to games. Because I can't really give out points that nobody said already.But I'm going to do it anyway.First off this game is brilliant. The atmosphere perfectly captures the 80's. It's like I'm in a 80's film. Yes Atmosphere is really what made this game great. Yes. However that's not the only thing that's great. It also has great soundtracks and fun mini games. What more could you ask for?Plus this is the first game I have ever played in my life. It made me into gamer. However this game does have flaws. The main one for me is that the game only runs when it feels like it. I had a tough time trying to make it work. And finally the flying controls are crooked beyond all belief but not as worse as San Andreas. (That's a story for another day)In conclusion this game is great. I recommend it. Buy it.			"

												GRAND THEFT AUTO: VICE CITYThe story of a real soldierUnlike his shiftless brother who did time for selling drugs, Victor Vance until the last moment tried to be in trouble with the law. He even went to the army, to obtain government protection, knowledge and money, which always lacked. But even this did not help him to avoid bad influence: doing another ""civil"" job of his commander, he violated the Charter and in a moment was outside the gate of military garrison.The prospect of washing the nights dishes in the restaurants did not suit him, so the route remained single — hires apprentices to local gangsters. But how can you take seriously these clowns? The first lives in the port hangar and drunken, and the second rat and a misogynist, and a third for hours talking about their genitals. The last straw was returned from prison lance caught shaped jerk: he immediately began does business behind Vick and communicate with corrupt police. Long endure such an environment was impossible — I had to take the command in his hands.In the brothel — in a helicopterVice city eighty-fourth is a reduced copy of Moscow of the early nineties, when the ""white"" business did not exist in principle, but the negotiations much to decide the fists and ""trunks"". Therefore, to build their own criminal Empire have literally brick by brick. Victor goes to the neighboring areas, captures the building and makes them his property, after having disposed of the former owners.After several hours of heavy activity, he becomes owner of several brothels and gangster dens and pairs of points on the sale of drugs, bringing considerable income. The process is no less amazing than the result — I feel like a young entrepreneur who works like a bee from morning till evening. And no matter what it does not built kindergartens and hospitals — market laws are the same for all undertakings.No, crazy action when porting from one platform to another turned into an economic simulator. Just in Rockstar's once dared to change some well-established principles, and the most striking example — a system of unarmed combat. If earlier the clothes that were only stupid to thrash arms and legs, Vic is able to conduct suffocating grappling and lock techniques of the opponent (due to military training?). Traditionally, when the desire on fighting and shooting may be time to close my eyes and instead, steal a fancy convertible, going to the waterfront to admire the red-orange sunsets, ride a jet ski on the water channel or to look at the city from the helicopter.So good games under the brand name Grand Theft Auto that are not forced to adhere to a strictly defined lines of conduct. Vice City stories respects tradition and relies heavily on the attention of the public familiar with the series. Terse and business Victor fits perfectly into the role of the godfather of the city, continuing the tradition of predecessors: he can work before losing momentum and in a big way to relax. Sorry, will shoot him in the Prime of life at the peak of fame. But the writers released him two years he will hold in his pleasure.The programmers at Rockstar Leeds to make the most of outdated engine everything: the picture quality here is even higher than in the original Vice City for the PlayStation 2. Even the wheels of the machines of steel volume, explosions are more colorful, and the animation movements are smooth and natural. Local radio stations for any musical taste and still pleased with the work of competent DJs. The rest of Vice city is mostly quiet and calm, as befits the relaxed southern city. Only the sound of gunfire and sirens occasionally break this idyll. The next ""Stories"" turned out to be perfectly optimized for the features of the platform: helicopters obediently ""float"" in response to the command, shooting at enemies easier mode avtopritselivaniya, and to steer the car even just at high speed. If here and there an accident, mostly the fault of other road users. Some missions seem impenetrable and can only be after a dozen fruitless attempts, however, after mastering all the intricacies of the task management clicking like nuts. However, neither one of them is not like another — and have the crowd of bandits to the ground to lay, and seniors home to deliver. A true Paradise for the budding gangster. This is not a standalone project, and another story on the life of gangsters that fit into the events of the series. Not just a game but a real world in which you want to return again and again.

												There's just something about Vice City that makes me love it, could it be wildly ignorant nostalgia, the phenomenal soundtrack featuring perhaps my favourite song of all time, the crazy cast of memorable characters, or even the many homages to 80's culture. It really is a mystery, but what isn't a mystery is the fact that this is one of the best Grand Theft Auto games to date. I honestly could not recommend this instalment more.			"

												""And I ran, I ran so far away. I just ran, I ran all night and day. I couldn't get away."" Vice City has it's charm in being set in the 80's. Everything you would expect from that timeline has managed to find it's way here: neon lights, hawaiian shirts, synthwave, everyone being doped up, etc. It looks great aesthetically. Riding a motorcycle and listening to 80's tunes with palm trees in the background is always enjoyable, including the 80's filter that was originally on the ps2 that helps give it a more authentic experience (it can be downloaded on pc with mods). However, after playing this for so long this title feels lacking especially when compared to the other entries. The map is very small and you can drive around Malibu in around 2 minutes. There aren't much attractions other than a dance club and the beach. The characters aren't that interesting and more-so try to fit the 80's stereotypes. Most missions are dull, they include tasks like checkpoints, driving around an 80's rock & roll band or killing someone at a golf course. It makes the character feel like a chauffeur, and the missions tend to have more style than substance. Also, the plot takes the character from faction to faction without trying to bring together a world with interrelated characters and stories, concluding to a rushed ending that comes together sloppily. It's still fun due to nostalgia and if the neon lights aren't a deterrence than Vice City should be enjoyable.			"

												My favorite game in the franchise. Instead of silent protagonist Claude, you are now playing as Tommy Vercetti, charismatic member of Italian Mafia, who gets out of prison after serving 15 years for multiple killings. Soon enough he gets involved in a drug deal gone wrong and determines to find out who was behind it while building his own criminal empire.Setting is moved from cold streets of Liberty City to more relaxed Vice City which is based on Miami. References to 80's culture are numerous - disco music, pastel suits, styled cars. The American crack epidemic, drug trafficking and organized crime that followed it are heavily represented in the game, which also draws inspiration from many movies and tv series such as Miami Vice, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Godfather and many others. I will mention some examples:Retired colonel from Central America and drug trafficker Juan Cortez - parody of Manuel Noriega, Panama dictator and major player in drug trafficking during 80's.Drug baron Ricardo Diaz may be influenced by Frank Lopez, character from Scarface who happens to be played by late Robert Loggia who did voice acting for Ray Machowski, corrupt police officer in GTA 3. Diaz's mansion is very similar to Montana's from the same movie. Betrayal and the same clothes also add to the full picture. Interesting thing is that he is voiced by Luis Guzmán who played Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, drug trafficker and one of the leaders of the notorious Medellín Cartel in Netflix original series Narcos. Diaz's physical resemblance and temper to him are rather substantial.Ken Rosenberg's appearance and behaviour are nearly identical to David Kleinfeld, who was played by Sean Penn in Carlito's Way.Lance Vance is voiced by Philip Michael Thomas who played Ricardo Tubbs in Miami Vice, which heavily influenced Vice City.Tommy Vercetti was inspired by Tony Montana from Scarface. Memorable shootout scene was also incorporated.Last but not least there is Escobar International Airport, no need to say anything about that one.Game introduces bikes which are way more fun to drive than standard cars and will probably become your first choice in exploring the city. Later you get access to helicopters which are easy to control and are much better solution when you need a quick way to certain place, or you just want better view of the city. Those who prefer adventures on the sea are not forgotten, you can also drive boats.Major gangs in VC are Cubans, Haitians, Vice City Bikers and members of Forelli Crime Family. All of side activites from GTA 3 are also present here. Newly introduced are assets purchases. They include strip club, taxi company, film studio, dance club, printing works, car showroom, ice cream factory and boatyard. Each of them has a number of missions attached, and once all of them are complete a given property will begin generating an ongoing income.There is nine radio stations in the game - on seven of them you will listen great collection of licensed music, while talk shows that contain lots of satire are on remaining two. Big step was made compared to previous title in quantity of material - there is over 10 hours of it compared to 3.5h in GTA 3.Voice actors lineup and their performance is phenomenal; Ray Liotta, Tom Sizemore, Burt Reynolds, William Fichtner, Dennis Hopper and Danny Trejo are present among many others. One person that you certainly don't expect is porn actress Jenna Jameson, who gives voice to appropriately named character Candy Suxxx.Like its predecessor, Vice City was given a lot of GOTY awards and achieved huge commercial success, over 20 million sold copies speaks for itself. I really liked main character, and hope that Rockstar will bring him and Vice City setting back in the future.			"

												Vice City is a brilliantly stylized game and was just spectacular to play when it came out.Of course it hasn't aged very well since 2002 but don't let that dissuade you. Since you've probably heard tales about it's amazing soundtrack of 80s Hair Metal and glamourous open world city. But your not liable to listen to me, and chances are if your reading this you probably already own it.			"

												GTA Vice City, a game created by Rockstar North (Edinburgh, Scotland), which was released a year after the release of GTA III, on October 2002 for the PS2, and later ported to PC in May 2003.StoryThis time around, the game was based in Vice City, which resembles Miami.You are playing as Tony, a member of the Forelli Family, which is based in Liberty City. The Don decided to expand its borders, so they give you huge ton of money and send you to Vice City to make a deal. Unfortunately, you get ambushed. All the money is lost and now you have to find a way to pay them back.GTA Vice City solved all the issues that the 3rd one had. They doubled the amount of vehicles[gta.wikia.com], songs in radio stations and weapons. They even added flyable helicopters and a plane to the game.The solved the issues with gangs being hostile towards you. For those that don't remember, 5 out of 7 gangs would be hostile towards you by the end of the game in GTA 3. It became really annoying considering that some gangs had shotguns which could blow up your car in 2 shots. Well, in Vice City, there would be only 1 gang that would be hostile to you.The plot itself is also very enjoyable, unlike GTA 3. It has a very cool feel to it, as if i am in some Al Pacino movie. Just watch a few minutes of it and you may understand why.

Comparison to its predecessor - GTA IIIThey added more game mechanics. You could damage cars with melee weapons, shoot the tires (the cops would even have spiked strips during chases), and now you are able to shoot through windows of a car, giving you the ability to kill the driver.They added the ability to wear outfits (some areas, like the police station can only be accessed with such uniforms).They added motorcycles.They added assets and safehouses which can be bought. Assets would have a set of missions that if you complete, you would get profit from. Safehouses would allows you to save your game and store additional cars in the garage. GTA III had only 3 safehouses, which are unlocked as you progress through the story. Well in Vice City, you get 9.They also added a few helicopters, and a plane that was actually flyable this time.The amount of weapons increased, usually each weapon tier would give you a choice of about 3 weapons. But the biggest change was the addition of melee weapons. Unlike GTA III, where you only had a baseball bat, in Vice City you get to play with katanas, chainsaws, screwdrivers, machetes, golf clubs and so on.Unlike GTA 3, Vice City featured a full map that you could view, and icons were visible throughout the whole game.They added the ability to crouch. Most of the time i see some one playing older GTAs, most of them never use that mechanic. Well, let me clear some things out for you. Most objects in GTA, even cars, are made that way, so that when the player crouches, it fully covers him. But when you are starting the firing animation, your character will rise a bit above his cover. So in a way, this is kind of like the Gears of War cover system.Now most people don't understand the importance of this mechanic. If you played GTA III, you probably know that there weren't a lot of shootouts. Most of the game, you are using your cars for your missions. Well, the crouching mechanic changed that, making at least 50% of game involve shootouts.If you really planning on completing every mission in the game, you need to learn to take cover.Do i recommend it?Well, this is probably the only game that is set in the 80's period. The songs in the radio, the cars, the city itself - the game is just so good at capturing the feel of the 80s. This is definitely a gem.As always, the PC port suffers with the same issues as in GTA III. Mouse problems and FPS locked to 30. Most glitches can be fixed with SilentPatch, which i suggest you install before playing.Other than that, this is the 2nd game of the GTA III era, which are all connected. And chronologically, plot wise, they are set in this order:1986 - Vice City1992 - San Andreas2001 - GTA III			"

												This game was the pinnacle of gaming for the 6th generation and has one of the best soundtracks ever. Only problem i hate about this game is that you're surrounded by water and you can't swim. Vice City has the best protaganist in the GTA series because Tommy Vercetti is such a psychotic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and has the best outfit of all the protags. That 80's nostalgic feel is what really makes this game shine and is perfect for a GTA title with the environment and music. I'd say this is my favorite GTA game because of its tight controls and its perfect story of cloning scarface and setting of beautiful Miami with the best soundtrack of 80s music with classic hits like ""99 Luftballons"", ""Out of Touch"" and ""Japanese Boy"". I never wanted to turn my radio off once the entire game because the soundtrack is so good. VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO  STAR! A masterpiece in gaming, it is worth every minute playing and very rewarding.DAD NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOUR STUPID VIETNAM STORIES!I, I LIVE AMONG THE CREATURES OF THE NIGHTI HAVEN'T GOT THE WILL TO TRY AND FIGHTAGAINST A NEW TOMORROW, SO I GUESS I'LL JUST BELIEVE ITTHAT TOMORROW NEVER COMESA SAFE NIGHT, I'M LIVING IN THE FOREST OF MY DREAMI KNOW THE NIGHT IS NOT AS IT WOULD SEEMI MUST BELIEVE IN SOMETHING, SO I'LL MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE ITTHAT THIS NIGHT WILL NEVER GOOH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH "

												Gonna keep this short and sweet:Plenty of great radio stations (80's pop, VCPR with Maurice Chavez, rock, etc) and the ability to use your own mp3s, as well.Really nice arcade-y vehicle handling and the introduction of motorcycles to the series. Feels great hitting a ramp while popping a wheelie on a PCJ-600 or off-roading on a Sanchez.Voice acting and script is a great cheesefest of humor and 80's mob movie cliches.Plenty of side-stuff to do if you don't feel like furthering the main story.Great game to load up just to ride around for a few minutes listening to the radio, finding secret ramps/packages, and just causing havok in general.Just overall an awesome game that I keep finding myself going back to whenever I get bored or want some mindless entertainment.

												Vice City is my personal favorite of all the GTAs and all 'round my favorite game of all time, and listen to me as I tell you why...  Back when all I had was a teeny-tiny, weak and slimy laptop, I would wait for school to end just so I could go home and visit the beautiful Vice City. During cold winters there would be nothing warmer than loadin' up my game and running 'round the beach, soaring the skies with a ""Zimmer"" or ruling the streets with a ""Cheetah""...  Vice City is a game done right! It doesn't seek to be more than it needs to be, as in: the story is perfect, to simply put it: nothing more - nothing less, the combat isn't as good compared to what games we have nowadays, but at least *I* had a hell of a time blasting ruthless gangsters with an Uzi from the window of my car, setting up bombs in a van and jumping out, as it would rush to the unexpecting law-breakers and go KA-BOOM! or going on a rampage and decapitating four men at a time with a single swing of the sword!  Vice city also lets you get into the whole island-resort thing by giving you access to boats & yachts with which you can feel the king of the island as you ride the waves with great triumph! You can also feel the city's night life as the neon lights fill the streets on evenings and shine bright all night long!  My advice to those who lost all hope of going on a warm vacation, to those who wish to be where the sun shines in the middle of winter: play Vice City, and aaall your dreams will come true!			"

												I loved this game, I must have several hundred hours on it, from playing it back in the day.However, the steam version is a headache and then some. Here’s some of the several troubleshooting issues you’ll have to go through.DirectPlay. Firstly, you’ll have to enable this, the path is Control Panel > Programs and Feature > Turn Windows features on or off > Legacy Components > Direct Play.Next, it’s not compatible with your OS unless your running 98 or XP, if so, you have more issues to worry about. Go to compatibility, select Windows 98, also, reduce the colour mode, along with the bits, alongside applying it to run in 640 x 480 resolution. Think you’re done? Nope. You just applied for a part time job as a computer technician. Next issue, it will ask you to insert the CD. That’s right, the digital copy you purchased, most likely for the main reason of having easy access to a childhood game, will ask you for a CD. So, the main way you’ll be able to resolve this is if you delete the audio folder in your steam apps, and replacing it with the CD versions audio folder, thankfully, I kept my CD for this part, if not, you have to illegally torrent the game, but if you do so, you won’t have the fun of troubleshooting. Don’t worry, it gets better, the game can now load and you can play it, however, the audio will not be compatible with the game itself, so you won’t hear anything. No awesome 80s music or Haitians dying in the streets. The final step, refund this mess that steam provided to you, with no warnings or disclaimers and throw that CD that you kept in perfect condition for the last 14 years at the wall.			"

												Played this recently on pc after playing it on the xbox in the good old days. Like GTA3, this game has replayability that the more modern GTAs just don't have. The main story is just long enough not to get boring and although there are a host of side missions they do not become overbearing or repetitive. The setting is the real star with the gorgeous weather efffect, interesting characters,  musical gems, and funny dialogue. o#only cons are the mapping of the keys to controller is imperfect, especially with regards to the gun fights and the buying of assets serve very little purpose especially if they completed late in the game. Defintely 9/10 for me.			"

												A sure-fire classic. It has great graphics, great music, fanatical voice talent, an intelligent plot, dynamic gameplay and a universe of models that will be hard to match.Vice City doesn't improve much on the few shortcomings of its predecessor. Fortunately, it doesn't have to.More interiors in Vice City would be welcome, but the city is huge with plenty of unique terrain. It's a little disappointing that jetliners and more planes aren't available, but the thrill of flying the Hunter and going on multiple Vigilante missions makes up for it.Vice City is one of those rare games that effortlessly combines atmosphere, engaging gameplay, and great graphics and sound to make a truly unique gaming experience.

												Vice City took everything that made GTA III good and made it better, while also adding in some (now basic) features that were absent in GTA III (most notably the lack of a map in GTA III). The game is pure style and is an homage to everything 80's and gangster. while it hasn't quite ages the best, it has aged better than III due to a better art direction. also the voice acting in the game is top notch (in my opinion) and i freaking love Ray Liotta as Tommy Vercetti			"

												After 2001's GTA III, Rockstar Games decided the next venue that we should visit in 2002 was Vice City. And damn! They delivered. GTA: Vice City was an extremely fun game which was built over the strengths of its previous installment but now setting the clock back to the 1980's! This change in the period of time allowed the developers to play more with the satirical comments and dark humour the series is known for. From Scarface to Miami Vice, from the drug trafficking to the strong presence of Cuban and Haitian gangs after the increase of immigration of people to Miami (I mean Vice City) It is all there. True to the series, the freedom is sort of there, but as well as it's 2001 counterpart you have to advance through the story missions to unlock the rest of the map. Either way, the city is beautifully rendered even when the technology which created this map is 14 years old! Nonetheless, the freedom to cause mayhem is there and nothing will stop you to blow some cars and use some cheats to get your weapon kits! Did you pack your swimsuit? Vice City awaits! 9/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.			"

												Having trouble with the game? Turn your frame limiter ON! It fixes about 8/10 of the common bugs.Grand Theft Auto: Vice CityVice City is a game from my younger years. I originally bought the game in a special edition set on a CD-disk. Along with a manual and a map of the Vice City. Though i never really got into the missions as a kid, i now decided to boot Vice City again and play the storyline on stream.I can say that Vice City has it's good and bad moments. Good moments as in the gameplay, the story and that pure feeling. Bad moments as in the sometimes poor performance, the bugs and the glitches.I was really caught into the story and have never inserted a single cheat. I spend more than 20+ hours on the game and managed to complete the game with all assets completed(which are side-missions) and had found 90/100 hidden packages. The hidden packages are rewarding and so are the missions. As you play you slowly become more powerful by the mission, yet you do quite some errands but fair is fair, most missions are uniqie, fun and challenging. Even though there is no difficulty,  I managed to struggle with the game for quite some times.The most annoying thing i experienced was the fact that people and vehicles literally vanish or appear out of thin air if you turn around. Scary it was not, annoying it was. Park your car, walk into an alley... come back and 'poof' your car is gone.Yet Rockstar is Rockstar and Rockstar wouldn't be Rockstar if they weren't adding easter eggs and those little secrets, mysteries and theories which just make me melt. During my game i have found quite some easter eggs. Not gonna share or spoil but trust me when i say that they are worth a chuckle and smile.I have played the game without cheats or spoilers and managed to get and take the most out of the game.I can happily recommend the game. It's one of the 'better' Grand Theft Auto games out there and is with that said quite a jewel. Just make sure you have your frame limiter turned on. It literally affects everything. Handling, the speed of vehicles (especially ships ) and much more.Oh and the music is gold. It will help you get that feeling i mentioned earlier!			"

												I have to say my 50+ hours on this game was very well spent. The only con is that the camera view can be further improved. Otherwise I would say 9/10. Worth the full price for a gem like this. You gotta love the 80s. And if you ever get bored grab a Hunter, have 5 stars, go to the beach and see the cops follow your death train.			"

												Vice City is the replica of the real-world Miami Vice. This game is much, much more coloured and full of life then it's predecessor.  The atmosphere is just stunning, it's easy to see how much quality and detail is packed in, the music the cars, the characters - everything about it is just stunning, even today.And while you may have played it and you know what i'm talking about, it just never gets old to get back to it, steal a tank, run around the city and destroy everything. Just as any GTA game, the sheer amount of madness you can do is impressive. "

												GTA: Vice City is a tremendous addition to the GTA series.Find yourself in a city full of riches, women in bikinis and fast cars!! This gangsta's paradise is the second 3rd person sandbox open world game of the franchise and it has lots of improvements to offer after GTA3 was out.Your main character is now voiced offering a great set of cinematic cutscenes on every mission that set a completelly new beginning on the sandbox mafia genre games.The humor levels are even more ridiculous now. From the characters down to the radio commercials. There are graphical and animation improvements (windows can brake, nicer explosions, better damage animations) and game play changes (you can now drive motorbokes, boats and planes and copters!). There's a better weapon variety and missions now start to include expanding mechanisms and better side quests!There's also more sexiness around, everywhere. More violence, more abd funnier vulgar language, more vehicle, more of everything.Only one con: you still can't swim :PRecommended? HELL YEAH IT IS. This is an addition a GTA collection should never be missing!No matter how old it is, if you haven't, play this game now!			"

												Miami Vice... uhh... I mean Vice City is a great game. I've always been a fan of the first generation of GTA's, but Vice City is by far my most favorite GTA. I've played this over and over again back in 2003 and now in 2017 it's still fun to play. The location, the colorful buildings and cars make it a great game to just cruise in your car and enjoy the view.I love that it's taking place in the 80s. It's like walking into the Miami Vice set, but now you can control the main character (Tommy Vercetti), who's voiced by Ray Liotta. Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) is the voice of Lance Vance, and the list goes on with famous actors like Burt Reynolds, William Fichtner, Luis Guzmán, and many more! I don't think GTA ever had a greater voice actor cast and I don't think they ever will again.The gameplay is also very good, with enough action, missions, and mini games, but you can also just cruise through the city and do whatever you want. Anyways, if you like the 80s and/or Miami Vice this is a must-have game to play! "

												Tommy Vercetti, a loyal former member of the Forelli Family, has just been released in 1986, serving 15 years for killing 11 men in the Harwood District of Liberty City in early 1971, earning him the nickname The Harwood Butcher.[3] Tommy's old boss, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions between the other Liberty City families and bring unwanted attention to his organisation's criminal activities.[4]To prevent this from happening, Sonny ostensibly promotes Tommy to a capo and sends him to Vice City under the guardianship of a crooked lawyer and Sonny's contact Ken Rosenberg to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals for Sonny, whose interest is to expand his family activities down the South and to overrun the Liberty drug market with the high-end cocaine from Vice City, hoping to create a monopoly on the Liberty City drug ring to establish the Forelli Crime Family on the top.[5]Soon, Tommy and his bodyguards are awaited at the Escobar International Airport by Ken, who gives them an info about the deal and takes them to the docks, where they are awaited by the Vance Crime Family, prominent drug kingpins of Vice City led by Victor Vance, who arrive in the chopper with Diaz. As they settle the deal, they are ambushed by several armed and masked men, who kill Victor and Tommy's bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, and as a result, he ultimately loses both Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. Ken drives to his office, while Tommy returns to his hotel.[6]When Tommy informs Sonny of the ambush, Sonny loses his temper and threatens Tommy with the consequences of attempting to cheat the Mafia. Tommy promises to retrieve the money and the cocaine and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.[7] Towards this end, Tommy meets up again with Ken at his office, who leads Tommy to retired Colonel and mid-level drug dealer named Juan Garcia Cortez, who was Victor Vance's contact and who organised the deal between the Vances and the Forellis. Cortez expresses regret about Tommy's bad deal and promises that his own lines of inquiry are being made to find out who masterminded the ambush plot. Tommy also meets Cortez's daughter Mercedes, who becomes Tommy's confidante shortly thereafter.While Tommy waits for the outcome of Cortez's investigation, he meets cocky 21-year old British record producer Kent Paul, real estate mogul Avery Carrington, and a mysterious man, who introduces himself as Lance Vance, younger brother of Victor and the underboss of the now-defunct Vance Crime Family, who wants revenge for the death of his brother and also wants the Vance Crime Family back on the map.[8]As time passes, Tommy befriends Cortez and begins to do regular work for him as an errand boy and hitman. On one such job, Tommy is called in with Lance to protect the deal of a drug baron named Ricardo Diaz during a deal with the Cubans, looking to buy some high-end cocaine. During the deal, Diaz is ambushed by a gang of Haitians, but Tommy is able to kill them and save the deal, as well as Diaz's life. Consequently, Diaz begins hiring Tommy for his own agenda. Tommy takes this work because it pays well, in spite of his distaste for Diaz. On another errand for Cortez, he plans to meet a French courier to retrieve missile chips stolen from the French government. The deal is ambushed by several French agents and Tommy later kills the courier, who fled the ambush with the chips, retrieving the items.Tommy learns from Cortez that Cortez's own lieutenant, Gonzalez, was partially responsible for the ambush on Tommy's cocaine deal since he is the only person besides Cortez to know about the deal, and Cortez asks Tommy to kill Gonzalez as a favour, since he was a man who he did distrust and was working behind his back. Afterwards, Cortez voices his suspicion that Diaz might have been behind the ambush. Tommy initially continues the status quo to prepare for his attack, but his hand is forced when Lance attempts to take revenge by himself and fails, forcing Tommy to rush across the city and rescue him from the junkyard in which he is held. With the die cast, the two move quickly to raid Diaz's mansion and execute Diaz. With Diaz dead, and Colonel Cortez fleeing the country to escape the French, the established drug empires in Vice City quickly crumble and Tommy and Lance personally take over, becoming Vice City's drug kingpins.Tommy becomes the head of his own organisation, the Vercetti Crime Family, distancing himself from the Forelli Family and Liberty City and more interested in personally controlling Vice City than being Forelli's puppet. But the more powerful and rich Tommy gets, the more Lance begins to exhibit paranoia and sociopathic behaviours, to the point that he begins to abuse his own bodyguards and constantly calls Tommy in states of hysteria, losing his mind over being just a powerless second-in-command as he was under his brother for the past 2 years. Tommy begins to suspect that Lance is up to something.Tommy makes alliance with Umberto Robina's Cubans against Auntie Poulet's Haitians, even though he is at the same time hypnotised by Poulet's voodoo into helping the Haitians as well. However, Tommy and Poulet part ways Tommy and the Cubans sneak explosives into the Haitian drug factory disguised in Haitian gang cars and blow it up, effectively ending the conflict and putting the Haitians out of business, enabling the Cubans to take over Little Havana. Umberto then becomes Tommy's partner. He also becomes friends with Big Mitch Baker, a leader of the biker gang and a Vietnam veteran, with both the bikers and the Cubans becoming protectors of Vercetti family business.As his drug business expands, Tommy buys assets in nearly bankrupt companies such as a car lot named Sunshine Autos, a cab depot Kaufmann Cabs, a popular night club called The Malibu, a local boathouse, a print shop, Print Works, an ice-cream company, and an adult film company, all of which he turns back into competitive businesses. He also becomes a personal bodyguard to glam metal band Love Fist, and pulls a major bank heist. He starts to control almost all the assets and ties of Vice City: Sunshine Autos as a chop shop, Kaufmann Cabs for money laundering, The Malibu Club for dispatching drugs, the ice-cream company for the production of drugs and the film company to control the underground movie scene.Eventually, the Forelli family discovers that Tommy has gained control over entire Vice City and without having sent a single dime back to them. Sonny is enraged that Tommy has become independent and is hustling him, and sends collectors consisting of high-ranking Forelli members to force money out of Tommy's assets. Tommy disposes of them, but after they injure the elderly operator of his print shop of counterfeit money, he decides to cut Sonny and the Forelli family out of his business, severing his ties with the Forelli family.An angered Sonny arrives in Vice City with a small army of mafiosi, intent on taking their tribute by force. Sonny and his henchmen soon arrive at the Vercetti Estate. Just as Tommy attempts to give them their tribute in counterfeit money, Sonny reveals he is the one who set Tommy up fifteen years before, sending him to kill the eleven men who were expecting him since he was feeling that Tommy would himself take over Sonny's business. Lance then exposes himself as a traitor, revealing Tommy's attempt to fool Sonny, and also admitting to informing Sonny about Tommy's activities in Vice City. Lance explains that he did it because Tommy started to disown him and didn't treat him equally, and wanted him dead so he could rebuild the Vance Crime Family and the fortune he had with his brother. An enraged Tommy starts a gunfight.In the ensuing battle, Tommy first chases, ridicules, and finally kills Lance, then storms downstairs, where he faces off with Sonny,			"

But the more powerful and rich Tommy gets, the more Lance begins to exhibit paranoia and sociopathic behaviours, to the point that he begins to abuse his own bodyguards and constantly calls Tommy in states of hysteria, losing his mind over being just a powerless second-in-command as he was under his brother for the past 2 years. Tommy begins to suspect that Lance is up to something.Tommy makes alliance with Umberto Robina's Cubans against Auntie Poulet's Haitians, even though he is at the same time hypnotised by Poulet's voodoo into helping the Haitians as well. However, Tommy and Poulet part ways Tommy and the Cubans sneak explosives into the Haitian drug factory disguised in Haitian gang cars and blow it up, effectively ending the conflict and putting the Haitians out of business, enabling the Cubans to take over Little Havana. Umberto then becomes Tommy's partner. He also becomes friends with Big Mitch Baker, a leader of the biker gang and a Vietnam veteran, with both the bikers and the Cubans becoming protectors of Vercetti family business.As his drug business expands, Tommy buys assets in nearly bankrupt companies such as a car lot named Sunshine Autos, a cab depot Kaufmann Cabs, a popular night club called The Malibu, a local boathouse, a print shop, Print Works, an ice-cream company, and an adult film company, all of which he turns back into competitive businesses. He also becomes a personal bodyguard to glam metal band Love Fist, and pulls a major bank heist. He starts to control almost all the assets and ties of Vice City: Sunshine Autos as a chop shop, Kaufmann Cabs for money laundering, The Malibu Club for dispatching drugs, the ice-cream company for the production of drugs and the film company to control the underground movie scene.Eventually, the Forelli family discovers that Tommy has gained control over entire Vice City and without having sent a single dime back to them. Sonny is enraged that Tommy has become independent and is hustling him, and sends collectors consisting of high-ranking Forelli members to force money out of Tommy's assets. Tommy disposes of them, but after they injure the elderly operator of his print shop of counterfeit money, he decides to cut Sonny and the Forelli family out of his business, severing his ties with the Forelli family.An angered Sonny arrives in Vice City with a small army of mafiosi, intent on taking their tribute by force. Sonny and his henchmen soon arrive at the Vercetti Estate. Just as Tommy attempts to give them their tribute in counterfeit money, Sonny reveals he is the one who set Tommy up fifteen years before, sending him to kill the eleven men who were expecting him since he was feeling that Tommy would himself take over Sonny's business. Lance then exposes himself as a traitor, revealing Tommy's attempt to fool Sonny, and also admitting to informing Sonny about Tommy's activities in Vice City. Lance explains that he did it because Tommy started to disown him and didn't treat him equally, and wanted him dead so he could rebuild the Vance Crime Family and the fortune he had with his brother. An enraged Tommy starts a gunfight.In the ensuing battle, Tommy first chases, ridicules, and finally kills Lance, then storms downstairs, where he faces off with Sonny,			"

												This is a much better game than GTA 3. The design of the missions remains of the ""try again"" false-difficulty type, however. This means many missions are impossible to complete the first time around, as you have to know what to expect beforehand. This completely ruined GTA 3 for me, but this game is much more enjoyable for some reason. Perhaps it is the fat that I have found a way around the 30 fps cap, running at a smooth 60. The missions seem better thought out, the action improved, especially shooting. However, the long and unskippable cutscenes at the beginning of each mission end up grinding on my nerves after a while, given that most missions need to be undertaken a number of times before succeeding. Overall a very good game, one that I have trouble stopping playing, even today in 2015.  Proof is, I have finished all missions, but still find it fun to do things in the world of Vice City.			"

												Vice City has since I played it for the first time on Playstation 2, been my favorite Grand Theft Auto Game.Vice City takes place in the 80s, where you are playing as Tommy Vercetti. Tommy Vercetti has lost a lot of money, and needs to get them back. He is starting to work for people in Vice City, so he can pay Sonny Forelli back.One of the things I was most happy for in Vice City was the music. So if you like the 80 and 90s music, you will like most of the music in Vice City.The PC version includes a lot of new features, here are some of them: Custom Resolutions 	 (Choose your own Resolution) Better Graphics 	 (There is better Graphics and also custom Draw Distance) Custom Radio Station 	 (Upload your own mp3 and make your own Radio Station) Frame Limiter 	 (By disabling Frame Limiter, you can play Vice City in 60fps)There is of course a lot of other new features, this is just some of them.Vice City is of course recommended, and is a game you must play!

I remember running over people on the beach with my buggy listening Michael Jackson and see the sun rising up then visiting the beach pool, jumping into it and then kill everyone in there.Oh and of course, the mansion, so beautiful, I remember running in circles in that maze and jumping into the little pools on the back of the house imagining that it was me on the game.The police and motard guy's dancing on the disco and me looking at them and laughing how they looked ridiculous. I had so much fun with this game that I can't describe every little thing, the good moments. Damn... I wish Rockstar Games did a remake of this game with next-gen graphics.			"

												This is one of the, if not the, best games in the series. It's my first GTA game and it's damn awesome. It sets a perfect mood of the 80's with the music, the cars, and other things. The map is decent in size and I still seem to find something fun to do everytime I put the game on. The story is OK, but most people only play this game to mess around in the sandbox (like me). You can buy properties after you finish the career, and some of them can generate money. There's a pretty good variety of vehicles, and the taxis, firetrucks, ambulances, and police cars all have their own missions, as well as a few of the other properties you buy (like the Ice Cream shop). There are also cool minigames scattered around the map, like racing an R/C car in  the sand. I wish that there would be more planes for you to use, since the only one you get is at the top of the endgame mansion. Overall, it's a real fun game, and I give it a 9.7/10.			"

It has kinda basic mechanics, bad graphics, old-tech-gameplay, but, I couldn't find any better atmosphere in any other Grand Theft Auto games. Florida theme, colorful world and enjoying gameplay makes this game beautiful. Everybody will enjoy from taking a sports car, switching to Flash FM, driving around city when listening Billie Jeans from Michael Jackson or spawning a tank and being a destroyer or buying M-60 with lots of ammo and being a badass etc...

												While obviously not as epic in scope as its sequels, especially given the smaller world, Vice City still manages to be a blast, with it's many missions, open world full of things to do and explore, and tons of 80's pop culture references, not to mention great voice acting and humor. It's starting to look a bit dated now, given that it's a little over a decade old, but this classic still manages to satisfy that criminal need to beat up pedistrians and blow ♥♥♥♥ up.			"

												I had this game when I was 15 on PS2, almost completed it but due to my file on the memory card being corrupted. I couldn't complete it.So I found GTA VC on GMG for £1.20 and the 15 yo self demanded it to be played and completed. It was hard to not look at it from a 2014 perspective, because I was playing sleeping dogs at the same which is far superior in every way.First of all, use cheats, otherwise you will run out of money buying armour and weapons all the time. Also, as it is an old game, there is no load option in the pause menu. You have to drive to your home to save or load a game, which can get frustrating every time you die or get arrested and want to save money by not spending it again on weapons and armour. The graphics are average, it is an old game so we will let that pass. The physics, however, are absolutely horrible, you fall immediately off a motorcycle from the slightest of touches; using planes and helicopters are a drag, and some cars are just impossible to drive with.OK, the game. Tommy Vercetti is your lead character, and he's come to Vice City to take it over. You do missions for various gangs, businesses, and mafia type bosses. One tip, after a while you'll notice you don't have any missions to do, even though the story is clearly not finish. You have to buy the printworks, and 5 other businesses (Not Homes!) and complete the missions for all of them. To know if you completed the missions, the businesses will generate money for you which you can collect often. DO NOT BUY THE PORN STUDIOS! The missions for that one are absolutely dire and no fun at all. Best ones are the Kauffman cab, and I heard the Malibu club is pretty good too.After a while you're old mafia boss comes after you and you have to kill. It's pretty basic mafia story that is clearly inspired by scarface. It's a good story and you do enjoy watching the cut scenes due to the array characters involved.GTA VC is still for me the best GTA game. The size of the  map was perfect and the story was pretty decent1The radio shows are also perfect, playing the best music that represents the 80s feel of the game.  Small things like physics of vehicals and graphics are a negative, but they won't be too much of a hassle. I recommend playing with a mouse just so you can shoot better. If you want to use a controller, I suggest you look online to find forums that help you with that as this GTA VC doesn't support controllers very well.Overall, I'll give this a 7/10			"

												The story didn't have enough explanation at times, and there are definitely other GTAs with more things to do, but GTA Vice City is a great, solid section of the GTA franchise.It's the 80s, the time of colorful pastel suits and track outfits that just never seemed to go out of style. The music industry was entering a new age with all of the technology, and the development of the metropolis became official. But what do I know. GTA VC had a lot of content, but compared to the other GTAs didn't have too much innovation compared to previous titles (and future GTAs for sure) but it was a solid, fun, enjoyable game. The story was gritty and solid, not the best by far but it is still great and important to the GTA universe as it's contribution in the Miami Vice department.In terms of personalization, there isn't much, but you get to be a crime lord, spending money on property and what not. While I think the future GTAs were better, as expected, this is still a classic you will have a hard time putting down.I played the crap out of this for years and have nothing but respect for the game, but if you aren't buying it to grow your GTA collection and be a completionist for the series, there are probably other GTAs you should be prioritizing first to maximize your experience.+Good weapon variety+Great soundtrack and radio stations, not that the new generation of Ipad kids will appreciate it though :(-AI made you want to throw up sometimes+Map was very beautiful...-... but the actual structure of the city was a mess-no swimming			"

It captures the 80's atmosfere surprisingly well, the soundtrack is amazing, the voice acting still manages to immerse you into the game and it's a noticeable improvement compared to Grand Theft Auto III (which I didn't enjoy very much, don't hurt me).It may feel aged, specially after coming back from playing V (like me), but it's still as fun as the first time I played it all those years ago.

												Vice City is, perhaps, not the most notable game in the GTA franchise. It could've been a DLC for GTA 3, but content-wise it's a full game of its own. It puts you in a world oozing of 80s pop culture, and you would have to be crazy not to love that. The game has some small improvements over GTA 3, and features some new stuff that vary from good to less good. It's easy to see that things started leaning toward a less arcade-like experience than GTA 3, which continued later in the series. For instance, the protagonist now has a voice and personality. The series gains some new grounds with Vice City, but it's pretty much on-par with GTA 3. It's not as revolutionary as GTA 3, but it's definitely a good game, and shows the direction the franchise later took. A positive recommendation from me.			"

												The middle child of the GTA PS2 trilogy, and a solid entry in its own right, but for some reason this one just feels a bit more of an afterthought compared to the other two. Objectively, it's better than GTA3 in most ways, but it's not the original, nor does it reach the heights of the third game - this is likely amplified because I came to this game after having played the other two. That being said, this game is an absolute joy to play, and anyone who has nostalgia for the 80s will LOVE the music.So, just like the other two, a must-have for any person looking to build the collection. If you're only picking up one GTA from this era, I would suggest getting San Andreas, but really, everyone should pick up all three.			"

												Of all the GTA games, this one provides the extra jolt of 80s fun. An enjoyably saturation of Miami Vice and every action flick of the decade, this game is an experience more than a sweat-pouring mission run.Sure, you could vent about some of the harder missions and dismiss its achievement in gaming history by quickly comparing it with the later run of the series.But before you do, steal a fast car, turn on the radio, and speed past the slowpokes as you take in that sunset.Then, play a little GTA Vice City. It's a lotta fun. "

												%100'ed this game in approx. 60 hours. So I know a lot of things about this game.First of all pros:+ Characters were... ummm, good.+ Music was awesome.+ Realistic driving handling.+ Nice atmosphere for its time.+ Acceptable graphics for its time.+ Good side-missions.Cons:- Missions were so unbalanced. Some of them were extremely easy, some of them were so difficult.- The game itself is unbalanced! You can die in 2 or 3 seconds if you are under enemy attack.- You'll come to a point where you'll need a lot of money. Yes, you'll stuck for having small amount of money...And also, %100 of this game is hard. Yep, this is really hard. This was harder than San Andreas for me.But overall this was a nice and fun experience for me eventhough I rage quit and screamed a lot. I can't believe myself how I missed this masterpiece.			"

												This game has everything gamers could ask for and then some. The story is one of the best ever, it keeps you interested till the very end making you play mission after mission as hours fly by. Striking drug deals, visiting strip club and shooting adult movies - the list of activities goes on and on. And once you've completed a mission you can just drive around and enjoy a simple but beautiful sandbox while listening to a great soundtrack with hilarious radio DJs and commercials (or jump into a tank or assault helicopter and have an hour or two of good old-fashioned genocide fun).

												Tommy Vercetti, a loyal former member of the Forelli Family, is released from prison after 15 years inside. His former boss, Sonny, ostensibly promotes Tommy to a capo and sends him to Vice City to act as the Forelli's buyer for a series of cocaine deals. When Tommy and his bodyguards arrive in Vice City, crooked lawyer Ken Rosenberg takes them to the docks; the site of the deal. They are ambushed by several armed and masked men, who kill their bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, losing the Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. After Ken returns to his office, Tommy drives back to his hotel and informs Sonny, promising him under the threat of consequences to get back the drugs and money and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.

												The game that introduced me to 80’s music. Hands down the best radio stations in any open world game ever. Anything that I disliked about this game when I was younger I grew to love as I got older. It’s a perfect game to me I love everything about it. I love the cheesy story, the ridiculous characters, and all the crazy missions. Vice city is so fun to drive around it’s so memorable. Sure there is the annoying mission here or there and it can be very frustrating to new players but because I played through this game so much I grew to like them and accept them as part of the game and the overall package.   10/10 (Masterpiece)			"

												My favourite out of the Grand Theft Auto series. The 80's style and excess, rags to riches, Scarface driven theme is a perfect setting. The radio is fun and nostalgic and helps set the tone as you go about turning the characters drug deal gone wrong to being on top of the criminal underworld of Vice City. In terms of how the game holds up 12 years after it's initial release. The graphics are quite rough but I seemed to forget after half an hour or so into playing it. The story is over the top but has Rockstars usual humour. The gameplay has it's flaws but the positives far outweigh the few negatives. The driving is simple and allows you to do movie-esque chase scene turns. The missions are varied enough that things don't get repetitive. 9/10			"

												A true classic. While I would not consider this the best in the series, it is definitely a fun game. GTA Vice City capitalizes on GTA III's mechanics, but adds a whole new story and setting with interesting characters and a fun plot. The game is buggy and annoying at times, and trying to beat the game without using any cheats to earn money is almost impossible, but if you do, it is completely satisfying. In my honest opinion, I recommend completing GTA III first just to make the whole game's experience a bit more familiar and easy. GTA Vice City is a classic and is always fun to revisit every now and then.			"

												GTA 3 is great, but GTA Vice City is greater. Vice City takes what GTA 3 established, preserved it, improved it and added to it. Taking place in 1986 Vice City, you play as Italian American mobster Tommy Vercetti. Immediately upon arriving in Vice City, a deal that was supposed to establish him in the city is attacked, forcing him to leave the goods at the site. The rest of the game involves rising up, killing the man responsible for the attack, obtaining a mansion, killing your former boss and ally, and ruling Vice City. Perhaps the best part of Vice City for me is the soundtrack. Containing many songs from artists like Toto, Hall and Oates, Michael Jackson, Laura Branigan and Foreigner, along with two complete talk show stations, Vice City will keep you busy in the audio department. Unlike the soundtrack of GTA 3 which mostly consisted of stereotypical late 90s pop music and typically left me only tuning to Flashback FM with its Scarface soundtrack, Vice City sometimes left me driving around just to listen to the great music or VCPR, its guests and its bitter Hispanic host, Maurice Chavez. If none of that fascinates you, the PC version supports a custom radio station. Just drag your .mp3 files into its folder, and you can drive to your own music. Sadly, due to the vast amount of copyrighted music, rights expire, and songs are lost. This song being Lionel Richie's ""Running With the Night"", which was present on the PS2 version but absent from the PC version. Compared to GTA 3, there is alot more things to have and to do. Motorcycles, helicopters and alot more boats are the firsts in the vehicle department. Many more weapons, like revolvers, chainsaws, hammers, combat shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and even screwdrivers are some of the new additions. A lot more is also added mechanic wise, like the ability to dive out of cars, crouch and aim properly are some new additions. Vice City itself is quite beautiful, with many neon, art deco buildings and skyscrapers can be found in the city. Most buildings in the game are just low res textures, but the interiors you could enter are beautiful, like the mansion, the hotel room, the dance club and the strip club. Perhaps the biggest change between GTA 3 and Vice City is the addition of a speaking protagonist. Not only does Tommy Vercetti have a lot more personality and charm, he is more likeable. Another addition is the ability to buy safehouses and businesses. In GTA 3, you are given a safehouse on each island but that is about it. In addition to being more convenient, the latter is also fun and necessary. After killing the man who set you up, you can buy up various businesses around Vice City, like a Car Dealership, a Boatyard, a Strip Club, a Pornography movie studio and a dance club. All of these businesses set up fun missions with them. For example, the dance club opens up a series of bank heist missions, the boatyard opens up a long stunt course, and the car dealership opens up a mission to retrieve certain cars on a list, which will get you both a monetary reward and a bunch of fast cars, like a DeLorean or a race car. There is alot more in Vice City that just have to be seen to be believed. Some features of the PC version include the ability to aim with any weapon, the ability to change the player's skin and, as I mentioned, the ability to make a custom radio station. For the money, Vice City is definitely worth it. Buy it.			"

												Back in the day, I probably put around 100~ hours (if not more) into this game on my old PS2 (May he rest in peace) Now, this review may be a tad biased, due to nogastalia, but let me tell you first handedly, that this is a good game. My second favorite GTA game didnt age terribly well, but there arent many open world 80s games, are there now? Without further ado, I will now make a Pros and Cons List to give you a better sense of the good, the bad, and the ugly of this game.Pros:Pretty good story, if not a little cheesyPlenty of properties to buyNice costumes for the characterLikeable PC80s vibes all aroundThe soundtrack is good, and has many licenced songs in it such as Billy Jean, and Video Killed the Radio StarDecent controls, they are by no means great, but they aren't to clunky either.Nice but repetitive NPC dialogSome really nice sidequestsNot many bugs/glitchesDecent weapons collectionCons:The graphics havent aged too horribly, but they do look very datedThe occasional bug/ glitch may still be foundyou lose all of your guns/ammo if you die/get busted :(Now, even if I rule out nostalgia, I will give this game a solid 8.5/10. The fun gameworld and story, paired with the soundtrack, make for a very good game. Some may not be able to look past its graphics, but underneath, this id a good game.TL:DR - ""Meh"" Graphics are over looked by the fantastic soundtrack and gameworld, and a decent story to go with it. 8.5/10			"

Steam really has to remove old games with game breaking bugs to force the devs to fix these games (some devs might just go meh though).			"

												A classic in which I STILL own for PlayStation 2. I do recommend this game, it doesn't get old. I've had a blast beating this game again & I'd do it again when seen fit.

												GTA Vice city is one of the most graphically advanced titles of its era, considering it came out in 2003, its graphics are stunning visually and ascetically. Its story line is interesting and always seems to keep you entertained and immersed in action, as the Grand Theft Auto series is renowned for, the Miami feel to the game, in where it is situated, gives it that beech going immersed experience. This game personnaly is a great title and i would reccomend to anyone wanting another take on the Grand Theft Auto series.			"

However, the map isn't particularly dense in detail and/or diversity (is almost devoid of any exploration other than the city), as it does not include terrain/landscapes, just city.

												I played this game for the first time on its initial release, and haven't stopped replaying it over and over again since... It's an amazing combination of RPG, adventure and anything you want it to be.  The graphics for when it came out and the general structure of Vice City could not be better, and the concept of course is, in my opinion, unbeatable.  This game offers so much and if you do not wish to do a particular mission, because you are bored of dying in it, there are always plenty of side missions, secrets and hidden objects to hunt down.  Or you can just drive around picking up prostitues and banging them in your car (perhaps then battering them to death to get your well earnt money back); whatever your preference, this game offers it all!  So get your gaming on, climb in or on and play!			"

												This game still holds up for fans of the series. A very good game, the only problem is the ending, the drawn out plot near the end slows down the gameplay a bit. Having to get multiple things from an auto lot to a dock, which is annoying, may put you off of finishing this member of the GTA family, but stick with it.Over all, a nice 7/10 rating.

												It's year 1986 and you playing as Tommy Vercetti, mobster and ex con who manages to screw up a drug deal in mostly sunny Vice City. Now it's up to you, how you will regain money and drugs that you lost. And most of all - do you have enough guts to become crime boss of Vice City? You can wander around in streets of the city, cause mayhem, steal cars, kill everybody you like with nice bunch of different weapons (including chainsaws and katanas), drive taxi or fire truck or deliver pizzas and meet new and mostly corrupt people. Atmosphere is cool as it was in ""Miami Vice"" and soundtrack is absolutely best in whole game series. More 1980's than decade was itself. Definitely a game you must have.			"

												Well i got my reasons why i think this is the best GTA ever and that's because it's tropical and color full. got a weakness for that in games. But beware that if you buy this and wants to play it on windows 8 and 8.1 you will get all bugs this game ever had and even more. let me tell you some of them they are pretty funny and still destroys the orginal feeling. the game is wonderful below windows 8 since the game is not optimized for windows 8 and 8.1 but here is the bugs i got:1. Animations plays really fast (smoke really much and the weather) the speed is like 100%2. many functions like look around the car seems to not be working either 3. and oh yeah saving, loading and complete a mission takes forever it load really slow takes 5min (not joking)4. and it render everything in one and begins lags at certain points.below windows 8 and 8.1 this is a really great game that doesn't have those bugs. but it's cheap at sales so if you don't trust me buy it yourself at a sale and test it for paying fullprice for see if i'm right is just stupid.

( Referencing to the helicopter mission in which you must move dynamite from one place to another for like 4 minutes, whilst you drive an Toy Helicopter that is beaten by angry construction workers and security guards but otherwise I can look over that.4/5 the level took me months to pass.

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. I have played many of 100s of hours since it's launch on PS2 back in 2002, I own it on pretty much all platforms now.The cheesy 80s, Scarface setting is what most attracts me about this game, I love the era even if I myself was not born in it. It's vivid colours and bright neon lights makes it very colourful, especially if you start painting you car with the blood of an unsuspecting pedestrian. This is a gory game, but it is comical. The story is great and the gameplay is a hell of a lot of fun. Graphics are top of the range but why does it have to be? The many collectables and side missions just keep you playing. Even when you've completed everything you still find yourself running around cauing chaos wherever you can. This is addictive.If you don't already own this game, WHY THE HELL NOT, TOMMY?			"

You know, in the cheesy one-liners and 80's music blasting from your motorcycle type of way.If you want a step away from Grand Theft Auto 4 or 5, or are just looking for some good ol' classic fun with a great soundtrack, look no further.

												[9/10] - I closely relate this game to Mafia II, only because of its ability to really make you feel like your in the times, in this case the 80's. For me, no other two games do it better. This was actually the first GTA title I ever played back in the day, and to this day is still my favorite. No description needs to be made about gameplay, it's fantastic and entertaining just like every other GTA on the market. But for those who have good taste in music, and want to take a ride in the classics, and really just want to feel like you're in one of the best decades ever, then this is where it's at. Not much else can be said except it's great fun, has a good story, and is completely addictive. PS2 is better in my opinion just for the controls, however the PC version looks much better.			"

												Its got an amazing soundtrack. Great game mechanics, etc...Its a GTA game, get it an dtry it out, I love listening to some Love Fist and driving a comet whilst being chased by the police and shooting them.Yes the game has some bugs that are almost game breaking and there are also levels that are so tedious that it is like trying to ask out a lesbian friend of yours to prom, but nothing is impossible and she says yes! ( Referencing to the helicopter mission in which you must move dynamite from one place to another for like 4 minutes, whilst you drive an Toy Helicopter that is beaten by angry construction workers and security guards but otherwise I can look over that.4/5 the level took me months to pass.

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a great game with tons of good missions, fun, secondary activities and you can buy properties to make more money. The games has references to multiple movies, tv show and american culture of the 80s like Scarface or Miami Vice. If you like GTA or new to GTA, this game is for you!			"

												GTA Vice City is a great game and maybe you've played it before on the PS2 or Xbox. This is less of a review and more of a, ""here's what you need to get it running perfectly on PC."" Because, by default, it doesn't support widescreen resolutions, you need to force v-sync, it has a number of bugs that can be fixed using a patch,Let's start with the controller. This modder, Silent, is a diety. They've done so much for the classic GTA games. They modded the GInput inputs for 360 controllers so that the 360 controller button will actually appear on screen, not to mention function since Rockstar really didn't bother with controller support for the PC versions. Also, the controllers can be set to the style of GTA IV gameplay. This mod has full support of other controllers as well, such as the Dualshock and most certainly Logitech controllers. I haven't tried the Steam controller on it though. Download it here: http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272, you'll be able to pick out Vice City from the options given. Once download, just unzip and follow the instructions.To get GTA Vice City working in widescreen, you will need to download a fix from ThirteenAG. It's extremely simple. Just download, unzip, and read the instructions. https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#gtavc You'll also see widescreen fixes for GTA III and San Andreas if you haven't gotten to those.To force v-sync, it's going to depend on whether or not you're using an AMD or Nvidia card. I have an AMD R9 280, so if you have an AMD card, you're going to want to access the Radeon settings, go to the gaming tab, find Vice City, click it, find a tab that says ""Wait for Vertical Refresh"", hit the drop down arrow, you want it set to always on. On an Nvidia card, you want to open the Nvidia control panel, go to 3D settings, find Vice City from the drop down bar, select it, scroll down til you find v-sync, and same thing, set it to always on.The SilentPatch is necessary if you want good lighting and shadowing. http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25368, you have your options to choose from the classic GTA games, but be sure to also download the DDraw patch from the same set of downloads. It improves the draw distance. Download both files, extract, and read the instructions.That should be about it. I hope you enjoy the game as it is quite a lot of fun. Brilliant soundtrack. Good story. Fun side missions (asset missions). Doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a solid 9.0/10			"

												Still one of the best in the series, the graphics of course are a little outdated from back in the 90s, but the game takes place in the 80s. Scarface fans will instantly recognize the story as this game was inspired by the Al Pacino film almost to a T. This is still and always has been a very nostalgic game for me and one of the reasons I developed a taste for 80s music. The game play is easy to learn and hard to master but once you get the angles for it, you can take on much tougher opponents using a bat and a pistol with hardly breaking a sweat.			"

												GTA Vice City - A true, timeless masterpiece, that has endured the test of time and is still one of the best games in the series.Just like all older games, this one does not strike you with stunning visuals, like the newer additions in the series like GTA IV and V. But graphics is not all about a game. GTA Vice City offers a great story, characters and the feeling of freedom in its beautiful open-world city, that only few other games manage to capture. The refferences to the pop culture of the 80s are to be found literaly everywhere in Vice City, which accomplishes the atmosphere of the 80s' Miami, which the game aims to recreate in its own unique style.  The style of the people that you see in the streets, the cars, the buildings' architecture and the scenery all help you immerse with the game and makes you feel as if you are watching a movie, rather than playing a game.The soundtrack that Rockstar have compiled is divine, topping even those from the newer entries in the GTA series. All the radio stations in the game are absolutely fantastic with songs from the titans of the 80s' musical scene like Michael Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Mister, Toto, INXS, Laura Brannigan and many others. Even if you don't like this kind of music, the game will make you fall in love with it. But there's more - the radio stations' DJs will make you laugh all the time with their comments on topics that satirize different aspects of the life in the 80s. And the commercials too!The story of the game is also brilliant. As if it is directly taken from a classical gangster movie. Filled with action, twists and many great characters you will be thrilled from the start and until the very end. But even after the completion of all the story missions you will have to spend many more hours if you want to unlock 100% of the game. The game will offer you more than at least 20 hours of sheer fun, but no doubt you will want to come back again and play it over and over again. But if you don't like playing by the rules, you will still be able to find lots of fun things to do. Steal a car, go on a rampage, attain a six-star wamted level and have some fun blowing up police and military vehicles and shooting SWAT teams with tons of great weapons, as they try to stop you.More than 10 years after its initial release GTA Vice City is still the excellent game it used to be. If you have not had the chance to play the game until now, do not hesitate and get it right away.10/10 points for an amazing game!			"

												I would still consider this to be the best GTA game to ever exist. GTA III and San Andreas are a close second/Third. I have easily played hundreds, if not a thousand hours of this game on PS2 back in the day. We need to get a new Vice City in scope of GTA V, NOW!I loved the story, the characters, the weapons, the vehicles, everything about this game I love. VRock is the greatest radio to ever exist in Sandbox video games. Gotta love the 80s baby!But of course, there is problems. There are missing features that were removed from the PS2 version to here. There is also control issues and graphical issues. Thankfully the modding community has fixed most (if not all) the problems and can play the game no problem. I'm running Windows 8.1 and ran the game fine without any modding.I probably won't play through the entire game again, as I don't have the time, but it feels great to re-live it and have fun.			"

And that's because it features a variety of music between Pop and 80's Rock !I'd also like to talk about the graphics of the game wich were pretty advanced compared to the release date in 2002 and the game released before it wich was GTA III.This game was the first in the GTA series to feature the following:-Motorcycles.-Helicopters.-And the ability to enter safehouses, and some of the shops and buildings.ProsAwesome lighting effectsNew Cars- helisOwn BusinessesHidden packages hidden all round the cityFunny scenesgreat story/diologueset in 80s in miamigood driving mechanicsSafe houses and buildings able to enterConsCant swim			"

Almost as good as San Andreas, but the downside to Vice City to me is that there is less interaction with the world such as restaurants, casinos, bars, etc. Thankfully though, this was all done in it's successor San Andreas two years later.

												It's the eighties, do a lot of coke and vote for Ronald Reagan.Almost everything about this game is perfect, even on PC. Despite being one of the earlier PC ports of the 3D GTA titles it's relatively easy to control. There's a surprisingly large amount of graphics options for such an old game and especially one to come out in this time period when consoles were king in developers' eyes, so kudos to Rockstar for actually thinking this out.I really think that the 80's are the perfect decade for GTA. The decade of decadence. Crime was getting more common, drugs were getting harder and easier to get, and the media was getting more violent. It was a time of total unhindered immoral activity. It basically screams Grand Theft Auto.The soundtrack is amazing. I'm really into heavy metal and new wave, so I'm very biased when it comes to this kind of thing, but trust me, there's nothing like running over pedestrians in a muscle car while listening to Iron Maiden's ""Two Minutes to Midnight"" or fleeing from the police in a taco truck while blasting ""Video Killed The Radio Star"" by The Buggies.There's a wide variety of melee weapons, and while the guns are nice I think the wide variety of weapons such as the chainsaw (straight out of Scarface) and a ♥♥♥♥♥ really set the tone for the game.Tommy Vercetti is also a great character. He's beautifully two dimensional and the writers didn't try to ♥♥♥♥♥foot around that. He's a cold blooded Mafia hit man who's been released from prison after killing 11 guys and he's still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. He's not an Anti Hero like Niko Bellic who's just trying to get the American Dream, nor is he an Anti Hero like CJ who's trying to protect his neighborhood from drugs and rival gangs. He's just a really bad guy. If you cross him, he will kill you. If you mess up a job he's on, he will kill you. If you don't pay him, you guessed it, he will kill you. It's that simple. His American Dream is making others' lives a nightmare.However, there are two things I don't like about this game though. One is the graphics. The models, especially the character models, are terrible. They haven't aged well, and the game was obviously made in 2002. This is especially noticeble when the various ""sexy"" female characters are onscreen, because while they are obviously human, they basically look like they had their breasts and hips glued on. The wacky 80's hairstyles have a simaler problem, as do the brightly colorerd clothes that the majority of the main characters (and Tommy himself) wear. They look as if they've been painted or nailed on to some kind of puppet or mannequin. I honestly think that the models in System Shock 2 looked better than this.The second thing is the lack of multiplayer. Add the fact that MultiTheftAuto is terrible and you have a huge problem. I understand that when Vice City came out, the main focus was on the PS2, which at that time still didn't have online multiplayer capabilites, so it is forgivable, but still, it's disappointing.Overall, I think this is the greatest Grand Theft Auto game out there. Yes, even better than San Andreas. It's just totally tubular.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice CityPositives:+ Perfect storyline, well made. + Amazing reconstruction of the 1980's with authentic music on radio stations, similar cars and clothing to the time period.+ Characters, especially the central one (Tommy Vercetii) are interesting.+ Large array of weapons to choose from, military grade assault rifles, pistols, a plethora of melee weapons, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, the list goes on.+ Open-world game where the only limit is your imagination. Mixed:~ Graphics are OK, the game is over a decade old now but still entirely 3D. Negatives:- Game can be viewed as short, takes around 20 hours to finish.Overall Score: 8.5/10Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a fantastic tale of the criminal underworld in the 1980's. Hugely entertaining game and well worth the price considering it's quite cheap nowadays.			"

												This game is like Grand Theft Auto except it's in the 80s. Theres a lot of music on the radio and people have hair. Some people have glasses and pink suits but it was normal back then. The graphics are really ahead of it's time (this game was made in 1988). Tommy Vercetti has a really cool shirt and you can actually make him steal cars which is pretty cool cause you can't do that in real life.10/10 probably the best game I've played this week.			"

												After playing GTA IV and GTA V, I had a problem going back to San Andreas. Something about it never seemed right. Vice City, however, it truly stood the test of time. I can still pick up this game and have a blast, going from mission to mission. While the story is not the most amazing thing in the world, it certainly offers enough to keep you engaged (at least the main missions do). This is a game I played a lot before I got my hands on GTA San Andreas, and I still find myself playing it on occasion.Do yourself a favor though, pick up the high-res mod to clean up the textures and get a proper fullscreen experience, and don't turn off the frame limiter. The game is funky about running higher then 30fps. (Though that can also be fixed with a patch)			"

												Be Warned: There are some potentically game effecting bugs, but if you can get used to them, then you will enjoy the ride.1. The horizontal mouse sensitivity works like normal, but the vertical sensitivity seems to be locked at warp speed.2. The aim when shooting guns is off where the reticule shows the bullets should be going (you instead shoot up and to the right of the reticule).But besides those 2 things its GTA: Vice City 'nuff said.So if you can get used to not looking up and down much (which isnt actually that necessary for most of the game), and can get used to the aiming no being centered where the reticule shows then you will enjoy this. otherwise, if you feel these bugs will ruin your experience dont waste your money.

												First half or something oughtta be one of the best storylines in any gta games period.Put you will rpobably get pms during th bank mission, the riding bike on roofs mission (Only of you are darksydephil, i beat that ♥♥♥♥ in one try).Amazing characters, even though alot of them gets too little ""screen time"" or whatever you call it, i don't give a ♥♥♥♥.Lance Vance is hilarious, the voice acting is perfect, and if you like sleazy eighties ballads, you brobably prefer not to leave a vehicle once you entered it. It's aging kind of badly, but hopefully we will get a remastered version in a few yearsThe biggest downside of this game oughtta be the vehicle function, Pretty much any quick turn with your car will flip you over. But the problem is that it sometimes even flips when you are doing slow turn aswell, its almost worse than the vehicles in gta 3.The flight  mecanics could be hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's childs play.My favourite detail of this game is that you can shoot someones head of with and automatic rifle or simply just shot if of with a catana like it was made out och foam. the head can pop off even if you hit thm in the chest, ♥♥♥♥'s hilarious, holy ♥♥♥♥.The last parts of the game could be compared with cancer, but it's okay, the rest of the game is like snorting cocaine.The ending was a big fat ♥♥♥♥ing aids infecting shit♥♥♥♥ of a disappointment, my neighburs had to call the law enforcement for noise complaint.Even though game could ♥♥♥♥ to o out of ten stars to 5 out of five stars.It's ♥♥♥♥ing unbalanced when i come to think of it.And the cops are so ♥♥♥♥ing random. you're in the middle of a mission in the middle of nowhere, shooting down enemies and suddenly, a cop hits you to the ground and you get busted and lose ALL OF YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥ING WEAPONS.But the game had a stripclub so ill give it five out of five.

												Vice city is honesty the best GTA made.Whenever I play it, I feel like I'm actually immersed in 1980s Miami.

												For many people Vice City is still the best GTA game today. I personally prefer San Andreas, but there's no doubt that Vice City is a masterpiece, surpassing San Andreas in both the setting (80's Miami) and music (fitting this setting nicely). Vice City improved on GTA III by adding a nice story with a better protagonist and side characters, expanding the soundtrack, improving the shooting mechanics, adding motorbikes and helicopters (now you have a Hunter to cause chaos alongside the Rhino) and a lot more side content with more rewards. It's also easier, meaning that you can have a good time for longer without dying or getting busted. The map also feels more well designed and consistent, and the mission variety is also nice. In the end, Vice City was and still is a brilliant game, among other GTA's and on it's own.Again, i recommend you to install at least SilentPatch fo fix bugs and issues, and the Widescreen Fix if you use a widescreen and GInput if you wish to play it with a controller.

												A Classic the only downfall is the end game which forces you to do alot of side content in order to progress. The only GTA in the trilogy where money matters and there is no money code. So spend wisely as locations will be expensive and you will need the money. Runs flawless and has good controls my only gripe is trying to use a save from the internet seems to not work like GTA II or SA.			"

Story is ok,you go through it easily,no mission is too hard except that one where you have to race that nerd guy in front of the club,where I recommend using slow motion cheat.So game is ok,I had lot of fun and lost nerves playing it,I have spent over 15 hours playing it,so yea,I recommend this game.

												My favourite GTA game by far. The combination of an 80s setting,great story(plus the amazing soundtrack)gives this game a never-ending charm. This is the only GTA game where I have just sat in my car and left a song playing. The soundtrack of this game is basically a ""greatest hits of the 80s"", so you could buy this game just for the soundtrack. Now, lets talk about the gameplay. While the game isn't too different from GTA 3, it has some notable improvements. Helicopters are now available to fly and the dodo from GTA 3 is now a proper plane. Motorcycles are also available. Aside from some new weapons, the gameplay hasn't changed much from GTA 3. The story takes elements from Scarface and Miami Vice to create a solid plot. The story has all the usual stuff you expect from a GTA game like betrayal and the rest.Overall, if you are a fan of the 80s or miami, or just GTA in general, then this game is well worth playing.

												Personally, this is my least favourite GTA game. That doesn't mean the game shouldn't be played, though. There are many improvements over the first GTA in 3D (GTA III), but I didn't enjoy this one as much.  If you decide to install the texture mod ""Vice Cry"" (which, by the way, it's pretty good) beware because it might randomly break your save files. After starting a new playthrough with the mod and playing for a week or so, I couldn't load my save file any more and I gave up trying to fix it. Just save in different slots so you don't lose everything, but otherwise I recommend installing that mod and playing this game. And, as always, the music in this GTA is outstanding (specially FLASH FM!). In fact, the music is so good that you'll reach your destination and won't get outta the car until the song finishes... and if you are not quick enough, you'll be stuck in the car listening to the next song too. Worth playing, even if it's just to see the evolution of the GTA franchise and experience the 80's through its soundtrack.			"

												If you haven't already played this game, where have you been for the past 15 odd years?! This is probably the GTA most people started off playing. The Miami elements of Vice City make this a particular favourite of the franchise. Again, it is your typical GTA game, going around  doing missions for people with shady characters, buying properties and shooting cops and gangs. Even today you can enjoy Vice City as much as any other AAA game. This game is proof that graphics are not everything. If you haven't already played this game or simply want to have a trip down nostalgia lane, then I would highly recommend this game! 9/10			"

												This game is by far the best in the GTA franchise and one of my favourite games of all time. I played it way too much back in the days (over 12 years ago as of this review) and since I now upgraded my computer I thought ""why the heck not?"" and even today this game still delivers! The soundtrack, ""Miami"", ""Scarface"", humour, memorable characters and so on. There is simply an endless amount of things to do in this game. I loved taking over the city and owning businesses, collecting money as well as messing around with all the side missions/collectables that actually gave me some useful bonuses.I played through this game in about 16 hours and loved every second of it. This is a standard that games of today never will reach again. I got the complete experience for less than ten euros while other games offer less than half the entertainment for 50-70€ (let's not forget DLC and season passes). Since the game is on sale at the moment I can warmly recommend it to anyone who is even the tiniest bit interested.Buy this game! You will not regret it! 10/10.Note! If you are playing this game on a high end PC you may encounter various bugs and glitches. 90% of them are hilarious but the annoying ones you can easily fix using google.			"

												This is the first GTA game I actually ever played, though it's my second favorite in the series. Second only from the length of gameplay though does it fall behind San Andreas, excluding that it has the best campaign of any GTA I've ever played. I remember when it came out that my desktop could barely run it maxed and now my laptop maxes it out with an Intel HD 3000. I decided to mod it up to modern expectations and after many google searches and overhauls I settled on Vice Cry as a base for expansion. Vice Cry tripled the view distance, replaced the meshes for the cars with the xbox versions (higher detail), applied a wide screen and resolution fix, and many other little things. It doesn't replace the Ginput system with the Xinput system (for 360 and PS3 controllers) but there were many guides to replacing it in the community guides that I found in a few seconds. If you can't get your mods running just use the old no-cd patch, name it gta-vc.exe, and Steam will run it fine allowing CLEO and dependent mods to run. NOTE Vice City modders prefer the 1.0 no-cd exe for compatibility reasons but I chose to use the 1.1 exe, no particular reasons, so either works if you have picky mods or crashing. ♥♥♥♥ cheats, get VC Dream and forget about them.

												AMAZING.Truly a masterpiece of a title. The amount of hours I've poured into the PS2 version is uncountable. On PC it isn't the best, but it's still a memorable, exilerating and alive game. Definitely worth a purchase for somewhere cheap like Green Man Gaming (where I got mine) The only issue is the bug where you have to fix your optimization, but there are tons of tutorials on YouTube. Plus, when I bought the game a second time from GMG, it worked somehow. Anyway, pick it up cause it is an experience you won't forget!			"

Just like Claude in GTA III. Other than that if you haven't played this I don't know what you're thinking. Do it.

												I love Vice City very much. It was my first in a long line of Grand Theft Auto games, and I couldn't have picked a better game. It sucks you in immediately with its music, sunsets, cars, music, and cast of celebrity voiced characters. It has just the right size of world to explore, from the beautiful sunsets of Ocean Beach, to the heavy Cuban and Haitian influence of Little Hati and Havana. Most of the missions have a laugh or two in them, even if some don't, you can just ignore it, chill out, and listen to the impeccable music on the radio. If you are wanting to play a Grand Theft Auto game, buy this one first. If you are looking for looking for a new game to play, buy this game. For any other reason at all, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.One of the best games in the 3D universe era of the GTA series. I used to play this game when I was younger. A portion of my childhood revolves around the classic GTA trilogy. When you're not on a mission, feel free to cause some havoc. Do whatever the hell you want without a care in the world, that is until the vigilance of the police puts a stop to your terror. The 1980's aesthetics and the overall atmosphere of the game are very pleasing to look at and the different radio stations you can listen to feature a lot of classic hits that are just wonderful to listen to as you play.I give this game a 9/10. Who cares if its graphics don't fit with today's style? Graphics don't determine if a game is good or not. It looks really nice, especially for its time, making its debut in late 2002. The early 2000's brought a lot of great games into existence, each unique and diverse in their own ways. GTA: Vice City has a lot of replay value with its various side missions, there's just so much you can do outside of the main story line. There's also 100 secret packages scattered throughout the world. Try to find them all, and you'll be rewarded handsomely with an arsenal of mass destruction and luxurious vehicles.My only problem with this game is that sometimes you can get stuck under a vehicle or rock and it's impossible to get out until you respawn or load the game from a save slot, and while there are a few other gamebreaking glitches, those only happen if the player makes them happen. Overall, this game is a bundle of fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't played a GTA game before or just for nostalgic purposes.			"

												This is a Great Game, Set in the 80's, It's an Old Game (2003) but it's one of the best GTA Games in my opinion.It's Great for Low End Laptops like Mine, One downside is it has a 30 Frames Per Second Cap, But honestly, that's smooth. I mean it's truly a fun game, and even though the graphics aren't great you can have a fun few days beating the game.I know I've said it already, but I love how it's such a fun game, yet the graphics aren't great, so it makes you run 30 fps on the cruddiest of computers.The 80's feel is nice, there are a lot of odd NPC's on the Street, and you can have a lot of fun playing this game.Cheat Code: I'm not going to get in to all of the Cheats on GTA VC, but one of the cheats I like is ""ILOOKLIKEHILARY"" it turns your Character in to Hilary King.

												This has to be my favorite game out of the 3D Universe in the GTA Series, if you don't know what 3D Universe means let me explain, Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto London 1961 and 1969, and Grand Theft Auto 2 are the 2D Universe, Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto Advance, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories are the 3D Universe, Grand Theft Auto IV, Grand Theft Auto EFLC, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, and Grand Theft Auto V are teh HD Universe. Anyway, back to Vice City, while GTA III was the first GTA I played and GTA San Andreas I played a little more, GTA Vice City is more fun for me. The story begins with Tommy Vercetti doing a regular drug deal with Victor Vance and Lance Vance for Sonny, Tommy's Boss, until Diaz's Men ambush them and gun down two of Tommy's body guards and Victor as Tommy, Ken Rosenberg, and Lance Vance all escape. Tommy breaks the news to Sonny who is angry and demends Tommy to get him the money back for the drugs, (Tommy dropped the drugs when Diaz's Men started shooting and ran away leaving the drugs) Tommy promises he will and the game really begins. All thoughout the game Tommy gets involved in a lot of fun missions, some of my favorites are when (Spoiler Alert Coming, Skip to Next Paragraph if you Haven't Finished All the Missions Yet!) Tommy and Lance break into Diaz's Mansion and gun down all of Diaz's henchmen and kill Diaz, when Tommy saves Lance from Diaz's Men  in the Junkyard which was one hard mission but gives you a sense of success after beating it, when Tommy and Lance dress as cops and plant the bomb in the mall, the Bank Heist, and the final mission where all kinds of stuff happens! The soundtrack is amazing! I mostly listened to Flash FM and Emotion but man, never once was there a bad song and I can listen to all of those stations even the talk show without getting tired of it like GTA V. (GTA V still has an okay soundtrack though but I really only liked Radio Mirror Park, Rebel Radio, and the Radio Talk Shows) You still can't swim which kind of sucks but they have added helicopters, motorcycles, and a sea plane since GTA III. The story is pretty good, the characters are what really made it for me though, Tommy Vercetti has to be my favorite protaginist from the GTA Series, wish he appeared in GTA San Andreas but oh well. Anyway, GTA Vice City is a classic and I hope GTA VI takes place in Vice City so we can experience an HD Vice City. It worked perfectly for me as I am using a Windows 8 Laptop and never really had a problem, but I played the Steam verison, obivously, so I can't speak for any DVD verisons or others. Hope you have a great time in Vice City! Video Killed the Radio Star!			"

												In my opinion, the best game of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Amazing story (If not perfect), fun and awesome gameplay and the best Radio Stations of all the world.I dance like a maniac while listening Radio Espantoso and, to that dancing, add awful singing skills with Flash FM. It was a great part of my life and I cherish it as one of the best games I've ever played.If you haven't played it yet, you should be ashamed.Note: Just like with Grand Theft Auto III, this game have some issues with Windows 7 (It's highly possible that with Windows 8/8.1 as well)I recommend that you check the forums to see the easiest solution to this problem.As I've said in my GTA III review, it would be amazing if Rockstar could release a patch supporting higher resolutions. I had to play GTA 3 at 640x480 (Yes, as awful as it sounds)But, please, don't let that issue to convice you the other way. This game is, in my opinion, the best game in the entire Grand Theft Auto series.			"

												If you cannot run this game, you should install a dual boot to a supported OS or something.I ran into a small issue with controllers, but I quickly found a nice solution on the forums, and the controller is working correctly now.Plenty of mods, not sure if I want to install them (I am more likely going to mod out SA or IV), but the game looks so much nicer just coming from the old PS2. I don't really need to explain the game, or go on about the way it changed the gaming world.My biggest reason to suggest a buy?Plenty of laptops will run this.  The hardware needs are trivial compared to todays machines.  I look for games that don't cost too much, and would play well on a variety of my machines, as well as allowing the possibility to add mods that would push the engine further.Plenty of PS2 era games are still amazing, and have that nice bonus of being playable on even low end setups (usually... god help you if your rig is less than this :/ )I digress, if you see this on sale, snatch it up.  I personally prefer this to SA, but SA has the land and the vehicles, so it wins every time.  The feel of Vice City is a much better game to me though.			"

												From 3 to Vice City even though this game was made in 8 Months after GTA 3 it is a much better game. The Vibe, Story, Graphics all of it sold this game for me. It is a fantastic experience. I liked the combat even though it wasn't too much improved from GTA 3. The Story is much better than 3 (The Main Character actually talks) and is a lot like the Movie Scarface. (Tommy Vircetti = Tony Montana pretty much)  The Radio has much more better tracks in my honest opinion.  (Even Michael Jackson is on the radio) The graphics were slightly better than 3 not too much improved but improved. The Missions range from assassinations to flying an RC helicopter or to being chased by a chef. Even if some missions are repetitive and annoying and if you fail it you have to DRIVE all the way back. The map is a 80's spoof of Miami, Flordia and it looks and feels fantastic. a All in all it is a fantastic experience and well worth the 10 dollars I spent on it. 8.5/10			"

												This is the first GTA game I actually ever played, though it's my second favorite in the series. Second only from the length of gameplay though does it fall behind San Andreas, excluding that it has the best campaign of any GTA I've ever played. I remember when it came out that my desktop could barely run it maxed and now my laptop maxes it out with an Intel HD 3000. I decided to mod it up to modern expectations and after many google searches and overhauls I settled on Vice Cry as a base for expansion. Vice Cry tripled the view distance, replaced the meshes for the cars with the xbox versions (higher detail), applied a wide screen and resolution fix, and many other little things. It doesn't replace the Ginput system with the Xinput system (for 360 and PS3 controllers) but there were many guides to replacing it in the community guides that I found in a few seconds. If you can't get your mods running just use the old no-cd patch, name it gta-vc.exe, and Steam will run it fine allowing CLEO and dependent mods to run. NOTE Vice City modders prefer the 1.0 no-cd exe for compatibility reasons but I chose to use the 1.1 exe, no particular reasons, so either works if you have picky mods or crashing. ♥♥♥♥ cheats, get VC Dream and forget about them.

												This game is still great to play, and will never get old for me. I don't really need to say much about it, except it has a kickass soundtrack, great atmosphere, and is really fun to play. I even like this one a little more than San Andreas because of the 80's feel it invokes.A couple of points down for the aiming which is a bit wonky on the PC (which can be fixed using a widescreen mod AFAIK) and the fact that Tommy, for being a badass and all that, can't swim. Just like Claude in GTA III. Other than that if you haven't played this I don't know what you're thinking. Do it. A special note about the whole trouble around this game's soundtrack and those of you thinking songs may be missing: Fear not. I bought the recent version of this game after it came back to Steam, and no songs were removed. It's all there. :)			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.One of the best games in the 3D universe era of the GTA series. I used to play this game when I was younger. A portion of my childhood revolves around the classic GTA trilogy. When you're not on a mission, feel free to cause some havoc. Do whatever the hell you want without a care in the world, that is until the vigilance of the police puts a stop to your terror. The 1980's aesthetics and the overall atmosphere of the game are very pleasing to look at and the different radio stations you can listen to feature a lot of classic hits that are just wonderful to listen to as you play.I give this game a 9/10. Who cares if its graphics don't fit with today's style? Graphics don't determine if a game is good or not. It looks really nice, especially for its time, making its debut in late 2002. The early 2000's brought a lot of great games into existence, each unique and diverse in their own ways. GTA: Vice City has a lot of replay value with its various side missions, there's just so much you can do outside of the main story line. There's also 100 secret packages scattered throughout the world. Try to find them all, and you'll be rewarded handsomely with an arsenal of mass destruction and luxurious vehicles.My only problem with this game is that sometimes you can get stuck under a vehicle or rock and it's impossible to get out until you respawn or load the game from a save slot, and while there are a few other gamebreaking glitches, those only happen if the player makes them happen. Overall, this game is a bundle of fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't played a GTA game before or just for nostalgic purposes.			"

												Great GTA. Must have for fans. I grew up with Vice City Stories and it is great to see the original Vice City. GTA: Vice City offers quite possibly one of the best GTA maps of the franchise. The game, in my opinion, seems heavily infuenced by the movie Scarface. Has a great selection of songs to listen to whilst taking over the city in an 80's Miami Beach environment. I can't English.			"

												This game is really awesome. Its set in early 90's miami-esque island paradise. You are playing as the main protagonist in a blue shirt named Vicecity. He is a really cool guy and wants to take over the city paradise, but he's dirt poor so he has to do bad jobs for bad people. he uses nuttertools to get his weapons. and leavemealone to get the police off his tail. But the guy- Vicecity has a problemo, he cant swim. Akshely noone in this game can! i rate it 5/7!!!!!			"

												This is definitely among the best games I have ever played and the best one in the GTA series in my views. This game has it all killer soundtrack, killer allusions, reference etc. to 80s media and Gangster/crime films of the era and before. Amazing voice acting from many talents and Ray Liotta from Goodfellas is the star of the show. There are many other high class talented film actors in this. Anyways Killer graphics (for 2002-03), killer gameplay mechanics etc. The story is almost identical to that of the one in Scarface (1983 version) featuring Al Pacino however it has those GTA elements to make it alot alike and different to the story. The story is a bit different and a bit alike but in a good way. This game is a must have for anyone who likes games and especially GTA fans.			"

												This is a nostalgia trip for most of us.  If you never played the PS2 era GTAs, Vice City is a good start since it's when they began cinematic story telling, and the main character (Tommy) isn't a mute like the protag from 3.  Vice City is on the smaller side, thankfully you have San Andreas if you burn through it quicky.It's ♥♥♥♥ing grand theft auto.  If you've ever wanted to go postal, steal cars, be a thug/criminal for day, this is for you.  If you're some puritan soccer mom, you might get butthurt.			"

												The second GTA game i played back in the day. Vice City came out on the PC in 2003, i picked it up and played it somewhere around 2005 to 2007. Quite possibly my favorite GTA of all time. Im a sucker for anything 80's so that further heightened the experience of this game. If you haven't played this one i would highly recommened playing it.The story is more intereresting than GTA 3 imo; it takes alot of cues from 80's films, and television. The aesthetics of the world really work in its favor and really makes you feel like your in the 80's. The various car designs, the npcs, and even the many easteregg references (Scarface mansion, Miami Vice music and cops) really addon to it.The gameplay is still the same from its predecessor. You have the ability to jump, run, sprint and crouch like GTA 3. There are new weapons in this GTA; compared to GTA3 having one set of weapons, GTA Vice City has atleast 4 sets of weapons from small to heavy.For the music you have yet again a really well picked soundtrack. You have a combination of 80's hip hop to Rock, to Newwave and Synthpop. The sound effects were well made for its time. As for the voice acting you have a couple of celebrities (Ray Liotta as Tommy Vercetti) Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds, Gary busey etc essentially a top notch performance and an interesting choice to have them voice the characters given their backgrounds.All in all, its well worth the money and its another great GTA experience.

												I'm giving this game a good review, only because it is a classic Grand Theft Auto game and deserves recognition. Other than that, it performs horribly on a modern PC. You can say I have high standards, but the outdated settings and bugs make the game unplayable. The mouse sensitivity is extremely high, to the point that turning it all the way down doesn't help, it's maximum resolution is about a quarter of any screen made after 2006, and overall the controls are awkward and irritating. I'm sure there are mods out there to update the feel of the game, but for a user who wants it to be working right out of the box, they'll find themselves largely disappointed.			"

												The game of my childhood and obviously the best Gta ever made. This game got all you want : a rich storyline, a game taking place in miami, a nice retro background, and high end graphics (when it was released).  This game really revolutionized the action and open world genre. Controls were better than Gta 3, physics were better than Gta 3, a real step forward.  The only Flop is that the steam version is trashy. Briefly this  game is a real gold mind for everyone that welcomes action and open world genre. A Guarenteed-Cult Game 10/10 "

												The game is fantastic but in the latest windows it needs some tweeking before you start.It also needs a seperate one off program to be able to use a gamepad the way it plays on consoles.While you can look around you while walking around, this is not the 360 free camera roam case while driving around. While driving you can only look forward, backward, left and right; but not around you! This is very limited.While the soundtrack is amazing and gives you that 80s nostalgia feel, it is somewhat limited/repetitive.I recommend this game and I rate it 8/10, but setting it up is a pain in the backside so I will rate it 6/10 just because Rockstar are a pain by not supporting their old games to make them compatible for people who buy it now.So yeah 6/10 or 3 out of 5stars. I still recommend it though. Try and get it in the sales.			"

												I never liked this game at first, I just wanted to get through all the classic GTA's before the PC release of GTA V. After all the fun was done with GTA V, I started to think back to the atomsphere and the world I had left behind in Vice City. Naturally I went back to it and I ended up really liking the game a lot more. The music, the world and the atomsphere all just meshes together well. The game can be a bit stubborn sometimes with the missions, but if you push through you'll be rewarded with a great story.The game is always and still remains a true classic. Worth a buy.			"

												Just the best game ever made by humanity. I like this game so much I own a copy on every platform this game was on. Multiple copies on PC. And if you were playing this game in mid 2000s the mod sciene was CRAZY giving the game that much value. Also if I could nominate this game for more that one category (thanks gaben) I would most definitely nominate it for The game inside a game award. You can do so much stuff it's amazing. 10/10 would nominate for GOTY if I was there to do that.			"

												Alright you sexy beasts, when you start up GTA VC, does it say ""error 640x480 missing""? Well then luckly for you I have the power of google. So first off you amazingly hot people, you gotta go to This PC -->  Local Disk ----> Program Files (x86) -----> scroll down a little bit and go to Steam ----> SteamApps -----> common -----> find your GTA VC file through all of your other sexy games -----> right-click the icon that says ""gta-vc"" or ""gta-vc.exe"" ----> Click properties -----> click compatibility ----> turn off  ""640x480 screen resolution"" and change the ""8-bit (256) color"" to ""16-bit (65536) color"". Now it should work. This only helps people with the ""640x480 missing"" thing. If this doesn't work, Google search the way that works for you.   <3			"

												Just the best game ever made by humanity. I like this game so much I own a copy on every platform this game was on. Multiple copies on PC. And if you were playing this game in mid 2000s the mod sciene was CRAZY giving the game that much value. Also if I could nominate this game for more that one category (thanks gaben) I would most definitely nominate it for The game inside a game award. You can do so much stuff it's amazing. 10/10 would nominate for GOTY if I was there to do that.			"

												I never liked this game at first, I just wanted to get through all the classic GTA's before the PC release of GTA V. After all the fun was done with GTA V, I started to think back to the atomsphere and the world I had left behind in Vice City. Naturally I went back to it and I ended up really liking the game a lot more. The music, the world and the atomsphere all just meshes together well. The game can be a bit stubborn sometimes with the missions, but if you push through you'll be rewarded with a great story.The game is always and still remains a true classic. Worth a buy.			"

												So my review about GTA Vice City, I played this game since 2006 or so, back in the day it was the CD version, you needed 2 CDs one to install and one to play. It was such a great experience. It really made fun. I would give this game a 9 out of 10! Starting of with the good aspects:+ The feeling: you really feel like you are in the 80´s + The Soundtrack: Driving down the Highway listening to For little diamonds.. so awesome..+ The Story: Based on Scarface and Miami Vice it was just awesome to play it for yourself and become a Drug Boss and Bankrobber, just awesome+ The Main Charakter: Tommy Vercetti, you play as a Killer, a Thieb etc. but you are still charming and always leave your note, you know how to make someone talk, but you also know how to talk to a lady (even though you dont really do this)+ The Side Charakters: They just fit perfectly :) So the negative aspects: -  Swimming and Climbing: You can´t do this you cant swim and you cant climbe/ take cover or something like this. How you could later in GTA San AndreasSo over all: If you are no little child and dont care about the graphics (they are still awesome for the time)and you didnt play this game yet go buy it and play it it is awesome and you will have a good time.

												The best GTA game, hands down. Well, unless V is good but after IV.. Anyhow, the game is great, it's funny, it's got a PERFECT 80's atmosphere, with probably the most kickass soundtrack in a game. The radio has some witty banter, but the music is the best part. The graphics are a little aged but you can install some graphical mods if you're willing to learn a little bit about modding. The game is best played with a controller, but otherwise, it's Grand Theft Auto, the story is the best out of all of them, it's got likable characters and movie references all around. Everyone says San Andreas and IV are the best, but I can tell you, anyone who has played Vice City will tell you different. Just give it a go, most modern computers can run it and it's pretty cheap. If you're a fan of the series, do NOT pass this up. No complaints besides maybe it could do with a little better kb+m support.  9.8/10.			"

												I love this game a lot, a favorite ever since I picked it up (2006), and I've played it a lot since then. I bought it on Steam two years ago, and I played it a lot, and I still am. I would recommend this game to any person who loves the GTA series.Best game ever 10/10 - IGN			"

												Even though Vice City has the smallest map in the GTA franchise, it makes up for it's lack of places to explore with an interesting story, awesome character, and over-the-top missions. Even though it has not aged that well, I have a lot of nostalgia for this game since it was my first GTA game. Grab you cocaine, it's time to go back to the 80s.			"
