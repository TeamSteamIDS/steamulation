												A flame that burns twice as bright, burns half as long. Tribes Ascend unofficially died within a year of its release, in large thanks to a very toxic community, but also thanks to a very dodgy developer. Some would say it was doomed from the start with the unrewarding unlock system, and its very liberal use of micro-transactions, but what really killed the game was the ""we didn't break through to a big enough market in the first year, so let's make something else"" attitude from the studio. Tribes Ascend was pushed aside, all future support and updates were suspended, with only the barest of support of some multiplayer-servers remaining to squeeze out any additional funds; And instead Hi-Rez focused all of their resources on the continued development and support of Smite - a MOBA game.Personally, Tribes Ascend was the best shooter experience I'd ever had; It was fun, it was exciting, and it was difficult - But pulling off a flag grab and then securing a capture was among the most rewarding things I'd ever done in a competitive video game. I played quite a few hours of Tribes Ascend, starting in late 2011 to somewhere in the middle of 2013 (though most of it done outside of Steam because of client issues), and I shelled out quite a few bucks too - not because I had to, but because I wanted the developers to know this was a game worth the money.But that didn't matter, and in the end Tribes Ascend simply went too fast for the devs. [VGTW]Update: Hi-Rez has revived Tribes Ascend, and are planning on making big, big changes to the game, most of them set to change the way the game is played. Whether this turns out to be a success, or another failed project on Hi-Rez part remains to be seen. But knowing that the community on r/tribes has been given a very large voice in all of this, I remain skeptical.			"

												2012: the year many tribes fans were dissapointed by the thought that Hi Rez didn't have the money to support this game further, and more so by the thought that SMITE was the real money maker. some folks thought that they were abandoning the game to milk the MOBA genre for money...in some ways, they were right. in others... well, that's the story of today.yesterday, the game had the aptly named ""Out of the blue"" update, which was being made behind the scenes with help from the Tribes community being the testers for... and oh man is it a doozy. everything is fine tuned, or changed up, aside from the maps, which only have the addition of 3 more to the roster, but they're still the same aside from the tweaks that affect the game with the update.the main thing you need to know is this: the old classes got kicked out. instead, it's simplified to 3 armor types that can pick and choose weapons and gear from thier weight class... if this sounds familiar, that's cause you're a Tribes vet. each of the 3 armor classes have thier upsides and downsides such as the tradeoffs of survivability vs speed, as well as what weapons and gear each class can use (heavies can't bring snipers, and lightweights can't bring heavy weapons or use spinfusor discs or discos/fractal nades). in addition, you can bring 3 weapons, but with another hitch: you are limited to bringing one of each weapon class. (heavies can bring 4 weapons total instead of 3, btw).TL;DR, this is the best chance to possibly get back into tribes, and give it another go... and before you think of it being P2W... the weapon upgrades are gone. when you unlock a new thing, what you see is what you get.PS: any exp and gold spent has been refunded, and if you have gold, you will have access to the entire armory.

												Great potential let down by a silly business model and lack of modding and map making support. The devs do not understand how tribes is played and delivered an unbalanced mess which, being tribes, is still fun to play but has no long-term legs. If mods had been a possibilty this could have been one of the best in the series, instead it is relegated to the f2p graveyard. Expect poor server performance if you decide to try this game out and inevitable server shut-down within a couple of years. Shame.Would have recommended this game 2 years ago but by now the Devs have dropped the game and killed the series unfortunately.			"

												Tribes, the definition of what I want to see in a game. The unique mechanics in this game are so original and flawless that it makes me weep for everyone who think each new call of duty is revolutionizing the FPS genre, or nearly any shooter for that matter. With tribes you need true skill to do almost anything in this beautiful game unlike some other shooters I know where spray and pray is just the norm. While that could mean a bit of a steep learning curve I guarantee you that your time will not be wasted learning this game, and you will surely understand from this from the brilliant ""cha-ching"" of your very first blueplate. This game is also very pretty if you can run it on the higher settings (unlike me) and the sense of speed as you fly through the terrain is unreal. Sadly though as I wright this review the developer, Hi-Rez, have completely dropped this game from their radar. It is no longer being looked after and the community is very small which is a shame with how magnificent this game is. Even though there is no campaign, no developer oversight, and hardly any people playing it this still remains to this day my #1 favorite game simply because of how perfect the core gameplay experience is and how unique this game is among the vast array of shooter that, to be honest, all feel exactly the same. Hopefully in the future there will be another addition to the tribes series and I sincerely hope that Hi-Rez will do it great justice and now that the company is out of its infancy will understand how to keep a game thriving. This game deserves so much more credit then it recieves, even if it recieved some form of GOTY award, it deserves even more attention. It saddens me that good games like this get shoved to the side and forgotten while every ""new"" COD gets so much attention even when it is doing the same thing over and over.What makes me most sad though is to anyone who would pick up this game today would not understand the impact this game had to some people in its prime, all they would see is hundreds of empty servers with what seems like 50 people online at any one time. Even though this game has admittedly gone downhill it will still remain as my favorite game of all time.			"

												Feels like a brand new game with this new update. Really fun and enjoyable experience now that there are only 3 classes instead of 9. I would say everything that was once wrong with this game is now fixed. Probably one of the best skill based shooters out right now. Totally worth a try if you enjoy a very fast paced game.			"

												Maybe you've heard the tales, of how Hi-Rez has abondoned their golden child. Whilst yes this is true, fear not! The gaming community has more than enough leverage to bring them back to this game and these are the reasons why. Don't worry there's a TL;DR at the bottomTribes Ascend is as unique as it gets when it comes to FPS. In Tribes the maps are so huge and its ski feature allows you to go so fast and at times you can sometimes feel adrenaline pumping through your veins. Add in the weapons which are mostly splash related and the only way to survive is to be moving. Stand still and you will die- not only does this make it the fastest pace shooter, it also means there will be no campers (except snipers, duh). The tactics, strategies and innovative ideas that spring up as to how to defeat the other side gives the game a lot of depth and lot of shazbots. To list all the features, I'd be writing a PhD, so to make my life easier, there's this: http://www.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/homeJust because the game appears dead doesn't mean it's not good already. Sure things will seem a little empty but if enough people read this and enough people get into it, I guarantee we can change things.All the classes blend together to create a synergy close to perfection and they individually cover so vast an angle that every class is needed and you will always see every class at work in a game. You won't see an entire team of Juggernauts because they'd be easily beaten by a nimble Pathfinder. Every class has it's pros and it's cons, and when put in a team form one mechanised unit that will steamroll the enemy. But you can also be flexible in that you won't have to stick to one class the entire time, you can switch it up. Sneaking in isn't working? Why not go in spinfusor toting and blow everything up? You don't have to invest too much into any one class and personally I find some of the starting weapons are amazing once you warm up to them. Spend hours trying them out. And if you like it, tell your friends to sign up, get the world united to bring this back, eh?And of course, there's the one quintessential aspect of the game I haven't explored a lot. The fact that it's free! This is a lifesaver for anyone-stingy or not and oh boy am I glad it's free. For such an amazing game, so unique and so complex I was dumbfounded at first when I found out it was free. There are those who say it's pay to win but don't take any of that nonsense. NONE of the weapons are ""better"" than the starting ones, they're all different and suit different people or different scenarios. For the one class you may prefer blowing people to kingdom come with the satisfaction of seeing the killing blow, having your enemies blasted out of existence with you a mile away or gunning them down while chasing them and see them try to escape. With the multitude of weapons and items available, Tribes offers you the chance to try them ALL out in the practice mode so you can set your sight on a new weapon and grind and shoot your way to the top with a goal in mind. And when you've gotten every weapon you possibly want, or every item there is available, you don't stop or run out of steam *badumtsi* because you're always trying to be the best and the adrenaline rush, the satisfaction of a Blue Plate, a headshot, a melee or anything is reward enough.TL;DR Not a moment in the game will you be bored and hours will fly by so quickly. So if you've played this before, but have felt defeated by Hi-Rez, get back on your feet or if you're completely new, go headfirst in and have a little faith. Login and start. Get your friends to jump in too. The more people we get, the more of the gaming community there are, the great ther chance of getting Hi-Rez's attention and bring this thing back. So spread the word, bring people into it, tell the gaming community and the world- even tell that random stranger on the road to. This game didn't deserve to end so quickly, so let's give it another shot. "

												There was a point where I'd recommend this game. It honestly pains me to see what has happened to it.I'd like to say I actually stopped playing Tribes for a long while. I heard they were updating it again, ignored it. Tried playing it again this January. I have a few words as a tl;dr I'll post here in the beginning and elaborate further down.tl;dr: ""What the ♥♥♥♥ was Hi-Rez thinking? This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing dying corpse of what it was!""Now let me elaborate. I'll start with some immediate key changes to the game that I personally do not understand why they changed.The ClassesGod just... what the ♥♥♥♥ were they even doing. This isn't neccessarily a 100% bad change but it's not good either.Before this game was changed a lot, you had three basic classes, each had three sub-classes of it. You have the light, medium, and heavy. For light you had the Pathfinder, the Sentinel, and the Infiltrator. Medium you had the Soldier, Raider, and Technician. Heavy the Juggernaut, Doombringer, and Brute. Each of these had their own specific set of weapons with a degree of loadout customization. To add to that there was this perk system which while it had it's own issues, is definitely better than what we have now.After the update, it was stripped down to ""Light"", ""Medium"", and ""Heavy"", all with their own loadout slots. The classes of before are all a legend of the past at this point. You could choose ""Light"", and give it any weapon & ability combo you want, which is one of the major downfalls of this game now. It removed the barrier between classes, or at the least severely lowered the gap. For reference, a Pathfinder trying to fight any of the heavy classes. It was possible to win this situation as the Pathfinder, but it would require concentration and the ability to out-maneuver the enemy. To any of the players playing post-update, they shall know that pitting a light against a heavy is a lot more ""even balanced"", in that the light class, if set up right, can easily dispatch a heavy when played correctly.This is one of the things that really set this game's base floor, was that the classes used to actually be different in ways more than just movement speed & health/energy. You could argue that weapons are still class-restricted in that only the heavies can get heavy variants of the weapon, sure. However that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things when a light class player could just give themselves a bunch of explosives, or design a class loadout specifically for taking out heavies.Bases. You know where this is going.What the ♥♥♥♥ was the decision making in this part? Seriously?Base upgrading has been outright removed from the game entirely. Turrets, Generators, Sensors. Nothing can be upgraded anymore. In fact the credit system was removed entirely. This pretty much makes playing technician exceptionally stale & boring. I have no inspiration to sit around my generator room for the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ match with an enhanced repair gun just to repair a generator stuck at level 1 for eternity every 30 seconds it gets taken down by a rush, because our turrets are level 1 and even the worlds fattest heavy class can just ski right past them. I really don't have much more to say about this. It's a bad feature removal and should be brought back.Removal of the credits systemAs mentioned above, the credit system has been removed. From what I've tried, the call-in system just doesn't work anymore, even though you can still equip the call-in markers, which no longer have a display or show how much they used to cost. Of course this doubles in with the removal of base upgrading.Weapon (de)balancingBullet guns have been turned into pepper spray. The shotguns may as well be literally shooting pepper spray canisters. Other weapons have actually received buffs and assorted miscellaneous changes, with other special variants also being introduced. Most of the new variants I personally think might have an interesting change on the gameplay, if only the gameplay of Tribes: Ascend was still the way it was. So unfortunately, they don't really do too much.Weapons have had inane changes to their stats that feel out of place, and alienate me from wanting to continue playing this game. Just the same as the developers did eliminate some of the weapons from the game that no longer exist.Closing notesI cannot recommend anyone this game in it's current state. It feels like they picked up a game they abandoned at one point, said they'd update it some more, and then just tweaked a whole bunch of stuff to see how the community would react and then never change it back.Also another huge negative from what I'm seeing in some other reviews and discussions, apparently people can no longer register to play Tribes: Ascend. So if you already have an account on this game, lucky you. You get to play it. Were you reading reviews to consider playing this game? Well sorry but you're out of luck. Even if you install the game, you apparently can't make an account from what I've read. If anyone can prove those dozens of claims wrong, by all means go ahead.On a final closing note, I genuinely hope Hi-Rez realizes this game is dying, with population numbers declining still. With hope they'll revert the game to the way we all enjoyed playing it.			"

												My favorite part is where no one plays this. EDIT 2: Apparently people can mark reviews as funny now.      Shazbot!EDIT 3 : ( Rephrased some words below, because for some reason people actually read it. )EDIT 1 ( MAIN PART OF THE REVIEW BELOW ): Since people actually somehow managed to find this review, I decided to put at least a little bit of an actual review in here. Not a detailed one because I haven't played the game for a long time, but my personal information about the game.(SIDENOTE: If you want a review that follows a linear flow of explaining information, this isn't the one. I mainly jump around from topic to topic, mostly because this came from the top of my head.)     ( Sorry random OCD guy.)Tribes:Ascend is a great game, but sadly, a lot of players are missing from the game because developers have moved onto SMITE and they abandoned this game a while ago.They have made some changes to the game though, that has varied since the release of Tribes:Ascend. One thing they did was cut back on the amount of grinding required, which was really nice for F2P players. The game certainly isn't pay-to-win, but it is deterring to see that a playstyle you want isn't available for you. Most of the default stuff are mostly usable, but I do have to point out that the other weapons are just more fun to use. ( And sometimes more effective. )The gameplay features high-speed combat, which will be very rewarding to those who value skill.Coordinated roles and classes give the game a nice feel for it's objective based gameplay, and offers multiple different playstyles. Supportive roles, defensive roles, and offensive roles are ALL viable, and they all help you win the game. There's also a in-game voice communication system that slightly helps with immersion ( if you're into that sort of thing. )There's also a few game modes ( many of which are probably dead. ).My personal favorite is Capture the Flag, because it requires a variety of roles by the team.Maybe you want to be the guy who grabs the flag at high speed.Maybe you want to be the guy who sits on the flag and laughs at the guy who just died because he rammed into you at high speed.Or maybe, you want to be like a sneaky ninja and blow stuff up. ( People included. )The amount of skill required in this game is more than any normal FPS. You can't just aim down the sights of your gun and kill a guy in 1 second. You need to actually try to kill him, because 95% of the weapon in this game are not hitscan, which means you WILL have to shoot ahead of a moving target and if you want your projectile to even land CLOSE to him.Experienced players will 'blue plate' someone. ( Blue plate is when you hit a poor guy directly with a spinfusor. )Newer players may find it easier to use rapid-firing weapons until they're ready to try out the Spinfusor.New players will also learn the term 'Shazbot!' ( Which will not be explained here. )There is progression in this game, but they unlock different playstyles and weapons, rather than directly upgrading your weapons. ( Not counting some of the other things you can upgrade, but let's forget about those for now. )You don't unlock a grip for your gun to reduce 15% penalty to accuracy, you don't get a scope and whatever, you'll actually want to unlock other classes and weapons. One of the classes has access to a fractal grenade ( the disco grenade ) and another class has invisibility. I'm not going to list every single class, but you get the point. Weapons play a large part of Tribes as well as the classes. While a technician can put down a turret, some guy on a hill can make it rain explosives on him and clear the objective for a friendly to move in.Sadly, you won't be able to unlock TotalBiscuit's voice unless you pay real money.Yes. His voice is in the game. You can also buy skins and stuff so you look different. Not like you'd show it off to anyone anyways.You can also get credits or whatever to buy resupply points and call in orbital strikes.Credits are only for the duration of the match, so feel free to call in the thunder.As for performance, I've always had a problem on low-end PCs, so this isn't really the game you want to be playing on a low budget, but you shouldn't really have any performance problems if you have a medium to high end rig. There's a few performance.ini's on the internet somewhere if you really wanna play this on a potato. Trust me, I tried, and I at least went fast enough to kill something.If you've read the original portion of the review, I joke about how no one plays this ( because no one does ) but that doesn't mean I don't want anyone to play it. If you have slogged through this thing that steam calls a review, give Tribes a try. If you like it, tell your friends. Maybe it'll actually have some people playing it. ( Yeah right. )			"

												A game with absolutely wonderful potential, a slightly less wonderful fanbase, and an absolutely horrendous dev team. Instead of balancing things, coming out with skins and new weapons was Hi-Rez's concern. And then, after saying they'll ""Look into"" custom maps, dev tools for the community, and other things, what do they end up doing? Dropping the game, for the 3rd person moba ""Smite"", which is beginning to suffer the same problems that Tribes: Ascend suffered in it's lifespan.

												I've been replaying this recently and loving it (I use the non-steam client) so I thought I'd repost this recommendation now that the character limit has gone. ======So far the best iteration of Tribes since Tribes 2. What's more its free to play so you've got no excuse not to give it a try.SkiingFor those who don't know the series Tribes offers team based gameplay with one of the best movement mechanics in arena style FPS called skiing.It combines physics, jetpacks, the environment and the skill of the player to have you rocketing around the map at the speed of sound and makes for some excellent chases in capture the flag type scenarios and great combat that has you estimating trajectories of projectiles and players to produce some of the most epic trickshots you'll see in any game.ClassesIt also has a really nice class system that has subtle class differences which are exaggerated by player role choices in game. The subtlety results in a much more natural role selection basic much more on strategy rather than the ""I'm playing the heavy-defender class therefore I only defend""Map DesignOne thing that also stands out to me is that I think the map design is beautiful for an arena game. While they do share some common features on the whole each map feels unique and have loads of great little details to bring them to life.FTPFinally for those who are nervous about free to plays being pay to win (as I was until recently) Tribes: Ascend feels like its got the right balance of paying giving you enough perks to make it worth it (which is important if you want the game to stay alive) but without being an essential element to play and kick ♥♥♥♥. Rather than money opening up bigger scarier guns, it seems to open up alternative roles to play within the game, all of which are available over time when playing the game for free.DownsidesThe only thing missing from this wonderful iteration of the classic franchise is the modding that came with Tribes and Tribes 2. I remember my brother and I having a whale of a time as kids playing with a lot of mods and user generated maps that added a whole ton of content to the game. While it's obvious why this can't work in a FTP game, it's a bit of a shame. Hopefully though, if HiRez studios are successful they'll be enough interest to keep them adding official content to the game to keep us all keen.How to try it?Give it a go! It's free. Sign up and download at https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥=1899863&utm_campaign=email and for those new to the series, or who just need a bit of revision there is a great inforgraph here http://puu.sh/w7SC which gives you a bunch of handy pointers to get you going!!!! UPDATE !!!It's a bit of a shame but the game has been pretty much abandoned by the dev's and from what I've read the community is basically dead. It's still free and it's still good when you've got a game, but be careful before investing any money into the game.			"

												Contrary to my experience, there seems to be a lot of people complaining about how this game is ""dead"", that there are no players anymore and that you will be somehow unable to install it using Steam.Pros-I have had no problems whatsoever be they technical or player-wise. The game even runs smoothly on my sub-par PC.Game still looks good on absolute minimal settings.Addictive high-speed gameplay.Makes you feel like a badass speed demon.A variety of weapons and classes to unlock, suiting any play style.Projectile based weapons make every shot a gamble and you feel awesome when you land one.Challenges- Learning how judge where your projectiles will hit is extremely difficult.You have to be able to think fast.The enemy team is somehow always well-organized and skilled, while your own team is a just a bunch of scrubs.At first you will get frustrated, but keep playing and you'll get better.Overall, I love this game. It's unique and ridiculously fun. Give it a shot! "

												Hi. I am a bit torn apart with this game. I'll recommend it but I don't like it. Let me explain.I used to play Tribes Ascend ALOT a few years ago. Then I let it go and went to play other timesinks and forgot my characters name, password and even the email I used to log on to my account with. So now that I heard that there was a new patch and people got interested into the game again, I gave it a chance again and made a new account. At start I felt like a dirty dirty man as it almost felt like sealclubbing to own scrubs under level 8, but I knew it wouldn't last forever and when I would get to level8+ matches, I would get my ♥♥♥ handed to me. Thats just how this game goes. At first I felt that the game was fun again (even thou there wasn't all too many players around), fast, furious and exciting. Hirez had reworked the game thoroughly and removed many aspects of the game and at first I had nothing bad to say about it. Untill it striked me in one game. Really hard. Back in the day when I played Tribes Ascend alot, I was the guy in defence. Keeping generator, turrets and radar alive. Giving inventory stations power and fending off enemies from flag. Using my credits to upgrade all those base assets to help the team. Giving the rest of the players a better chance to go and attack and get that flag to our base without fear of loosing our own base to the enemy. I admit that it wasn't easy at times but I was kinda ok at it and I grinded that engineer up to level 28 (50 is max). -Classes are erased and in their place are just light, medium and heavy loadouts and that's just fine for me. It just makes loadouts more versatile.-Back in the days the generator room was harder to get into and the generator itself couldn't be bombarded from outside with mortars from miles away like in some new maps nowdays. That just makes defending the generator so much harder.-The upgrade and credit systems are gone. So the base assets (gen, radar, turrets) will stay underpowered through the whole game and they can be nuked in a matter of seconds by anyone, but repairing still takes ages. -The perk system is gone. I liked perks. They made the game more versatile and gave player a way to choose his/her own playstyle. I liked to carry more mines and be super heavy or draw my weapon more quickly. I don't care if some or most of them are nowadays placed in the appropriate classes. It takes the diversity away from gameplay as everyone playing a loadout are exactly the same(except gun choices ofc.)-Vehicle heath reduced greatly.It just seems like the game is nowadays more about it's speed and only it's speed. Go for the flag/kill and everything else is useless and stupid. The game used to have loads of micro things to do and the game awarded players for filling different roles and now as the credits are gone you only get experience out of the combat. Now there seems to be only the attackers and flag cappers. Defense is useless. Many guns&gear are nowadays useless and even vehicles are pointless to get as they are so weak. In a really fast paced game a slow moving tank doesn't sound like really useful thing in the first place but it used to be a great way harass enemys defence so that the flag capper had easier time to do HIS job. And as the credits are gone and base defending is made nearly impossible, then why bother use the hard earned exp to unlock defensive guns or gear? And why bother unlock other guns to attack as there is a great variety to start with and it is a long way to master any of them anyway. Only thing that is somehow worth of  your money and time might be skins. Even exp boosters feel pointless now as it feels like there is so much less to do in Tribes Ascend(unless you get some satisfaction from gaining levels). But still. I think the game is very good and enjoyable for many people. It's still a great FPS. But not that great team fps so it's not for me. ps. sorry for bad grammar and misspelling, English ain't my first language.			"

												I used to play this game a lot.It even was, in fact, my favourite multiplayer.Which has sadly changed since the last update on the 8th of December 2015.It is undeniably a very unique game & most likely the fastest paced FPS in the world.What makes this game so gorgeous is not only its creativity with the gameplay, mechanics and weapons, but also a certain simplicity: There is a concept, but no campaign, no special missions. Just the good old gameplay you find in every server.FPS are naturally repeatitive, that's not a secret, but what is crucial is its capability to keep combats versatile and allow players to shape the battle for it to never become boring and this game managed to do this oh so well.What I truly love about this game is: 1) The quick progress.You are paid very well for your success and the awards you receive for certain actions are limitless.Just by playing for, let's say... 7-9 hours, throughout 3 days, for instance, you have already made some big progress.Some weapons might be very expensive, but everything is affordable. This is nowhere near being a Pay2Win game.And the levelling was also quite quick.You get to max out your armour, your weapons and gadgets after a few days of playing.But it always depends, it depends on how well you actually do... Good weapons don't automatically put you head-on with the pros & here's my second point:2) The importance of one's skills.No matter how many guns you have & how badass youn look in your fancy skins, you don't get to kill someone who's passing by at 350km/h with a spinfusor if you don't even know what you're doing.It really takes training to be good at this game & every weapon is unique and most of them, if not all, are really good in their own ways. But, of course, it also depends on the user whether it is any good.Maybe you like it firey, maybe precise, maybe heavy with a lot of lasers and light effects.And this has also something to do with:3) The weapons simply being unique.If you have played Warframe before, or any MMO RPG, you will obviously encounter weapons that are clearly & simply in every aspect objectively stronger than other ""low tier"" weapons. For instance, starting of with an apprentice staff in WOW, you won't ever be able to kill the Lich King with that thing. Or starting off with the Skana in Warframe, you will, at some point, receive the broken war & notice that every stat is just green and much higher when you compare it with the Skana.Not in mother♥♥♥♥ing Tribes, because these weapons have their own strengths. It's not like in Warframe, where you just have a stronger weapon to kill stronger enemies the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing way as ever; ""Click-click-Dead"" (And their powers are just fancier ways to get done with the enemies, let's be honest) In this game, you are everything that matters!Hell, you can even kill an experienced gamer with a n00b gun, if you know how to do it.Sure, some weapons deal more damage than others, but that doesn't make them objectively stronger!Some are explosives, other are rifles, some are disc shooters, some have splash damage, higher fire rates, and overall completely different projectiles and/or ways to deal damage!This is not about the guns, the armour, the vehicles, this is about you, the player, and how well you do with what you have to choose from!It took a lot to ruin this game for me and here's what it was:The update introduced some really interesting new mechanics to the game. The greatest being the completely free customisation, others being rebalanced weapons, new weapons and also, a bunch of new maps were introduced.The customisation is really exciting, actually.One gets to choose from the three armour classes and the rest is completely up to them, with some restrictions, obviously, and specification on the armour types.Look, I don't think it's good or bad. It is some progress, yes, but personally, I preferred the old system.It just felt right to me, it gave some feeling, meaning and life tothe classes, I'd say, and a role to the player using them.Those roles were renderred completely redundant after the update, though, because everyone was unique, which is obviously not bad, of course. It is something I love about the game Angels Fall First, for instance, where the customisation is just like that, but to me, it just doesn't fit in the game.Like I said, this is completely subjective.What is definitelly not subjective, but just straight up bad, useless, yeah even gamebreaking, is the removal of the Perks, some weapons and the levelling/upgrading system.Lordy, do I even need to comment on that?Starting off with the guns:I understand why some guns were balanced, some clearly needed to be.The Nova Colt, especially, I guess we all can agree.I hope, however, that none were nerfed that did not deserved to be nerfed.I haven't come across one, so far.I really love that they added new ones, but maybe the blinkfusors being available for all classes makes the game a bit unbalanced. Not too sure though.But actually removing some?I really don't see why they should.The ones that were removed seemed totally fine, at least to me.Ah yes, I remember, several class-specific guns were removed, for instance one the Raider used.Why would they remove that? The reduced freedom to choose only generalises the custom builds more.But the ones that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most being removed were the MKII versions of the start weapons.As you may know, every class receives a certain preset of weapons to use, until one earns enough to buy better equipment and every onne of those start weapons has a stronger version of them.Basically the exact same (mostly), but just stronger in several ways, mostly damage.Well, those were removed and that's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me.Because not only is that one thing bad enough, but also the fact that the levelling/upgrading system was removed!Renderring every weapon weak and sometimes useless.You know, you were able to upgrade your weapons by simply using them in combat and gaining experience with them, which made them stronger, but you were also able to pay to max it out.Welp, that is gone now and you might think... the most logical thing to do would be to leave them in the state they would be when they're maxed, right? Well, NOPE, cuz mother♥♥♥♥ing High-Rez nerfed'em all.You receive a weapon in the level 1 state and it stays like that forever.Look, they level up quickly and after a few days, ♥♥♥♥ing everyone on the battlefield is using maxed out weapons.It is fair for everyone involved and the ones using low-tier weapons aren't put into that much of a disadvantage though.Even if, they could still choose to join a noob server.Nobody would complain!So in the end, the weapons are only low-tier for like 5% of their time used and will stay maxed out for the rest of your life!Probably 90% of the guns used in a battle are already maxed out and nobody is really in a disadvantage.And nobody is used to using these low-tier weapons with lower damage, smaller clips, less magazines, shorter range and sooo much more, it's ridiculous...But the most ridiculous thing is that this also affects armour, packs and perks.The armours will stay that weak, the packs will stay as inefficient and so on...But actually removing the perks just made everything go to ♥♥♥♥.It used to offer SO much versatility and many special passive or active abilities to enhance one's usefulness in combat!Now nobody has any special abilities anymore, everyone is weaker, no more additional energy or less mass...But do you know how ridiculous it is to run around with just one ♥♥♥♥ing mine and having to constantly resupply because of the lack of upgrades and perks?That, people, is the most ridiculous part of it all, if you ask me.High-Rez, you broke the game.Thank you very much.

												I used to play this game a lot from 2013 to the end of 2015 and loved it, but I stopped, you might ask ""why did you stop?"". Well to put it in simple terms, this game was comepletely ruined when it got updated in 2015.It was a great game back then and it had a lot of potential, but unfortunately HiRez abandoned it, which seemed like a stupid decision to the thousands on thousands of players, but it made sense too since they were losing money. What really destroyed this game was its attempt to reboot it with a supposedly ""good"" update. But it was a complete flop, the update removed lots of our favourite weapons and merged all the original classes into just 3. Ever since that the game has gone downhill, I, as well as a lot of people I knew, left the game. All of this happened purely because HiRez didn't listen to player feedback, especially from the top and long-time players (I was Devilshouse - you may remember me).But one thing that can never fail to entertain in this game is the voice chat.

												Before launch, this game had me really excited, even became a ""VIP"" contributor (before this game hit steam +150 hours). It was tribes, but it didnt feel like tribes that much. The vast amount of automatic weapons was just mindblowing, in a bad way. It was like the devs was trying to make CoD on jetpacks. Some complained and some gave good feedback about various aspects of the game, but the devs just didn't listen. Even though the feedback was given by veteran tribes players! And now it seems like the game has been left to rot.It feels like a good genre has been touched by something foul and tainted.You might enjoy it, if you haven't played any other tribes games. If you have played tribes 2 or T:V, you might enjoy it for awhile, but in the end, it won't feel like tribes.			"

												I love Tribes: Ascend. It's a fast-paced first person shooter with good/ok graphics. The ""skiing-and-jetpack"" system is amazing, the weapons are really cool but slightly unbalanced (in my opinion). But..There are issues installing/starting/playing it. The developers have abandoned it, there are only 3-5 servers with players (worldwide). Many players are ""veterans"" so it's hard for beginners to get into. Very few are actually nice and it happens quite often that you get heavily insulted for killing them. I had fun playing years ago and even the past 2 months but I decided that it's just not worth it. I am tired of insults, bots, obvious hacking/coding and the community in general.I recommend the game but it's almost dead.			"

												Played over 1k h(wild guess,probably more) of this game just not on steam.I met so many interesting people,basicaly knew how every guy plays.BEWAREWhile playing this game you may get an adrenaline rush.This was a fast paced,team oriented capture the flag game.It looked and sounded amazing for a f2p.Yeah the game was a bit unbalaced but when you get better it really doesn't matter.If the team doesn't cooperate you lost no matter how good the players are individually .It had 9 classes so you get the point,as long as at least 5-8/16 players play their roles team can work.I won't even talk about the last ''patch''.Some people say this copied Halo but Tribes series is older than Halo.Some people say that this game is full of hackers, in over 1k h i met maybe 5 hackers(if even that many).Some people complained that the game is too unbalanced when in reality its just a lil bit harder to get into it than some more casual shooters.Oh yea btw the game is DEAD.Sadly the devs moved onto smite and abandoned one of the best (if not the best) f2p fps of alltime.Will forever remember this game and the people i played with even tho i'll probably never hear from them again...VGB my friends.

												I actually played a lot of this game when it first came out, and it looked to be going well for a while. HiRez were chipping in pot bonuses for tournaments, promoting the game on streams and such, it could have been good.Frankly the game had and has too many flaws to write an all-encompassing review including all of its many faults, but among the highlights have to be HiRez' complete lack of common sense, vision for the final product, and inability to listen to feedback from top players, even on trivial matters (I recall a forum thread pleading for replay-support, where some HiRez employee came in to basically say ""we could do this, but we won't""), the redesigns and gross mismanagement of classes/loadouts, lack of decent balance for certain weapons, the GOTTA GO SLOW, the menu UI, the game's performance, the grind, the lies, the microtransactions, the...really, it's The Everything.Then, years after the game had been aborted, they (I think it was like 1 rogue developer with community feedback and a lack of Jesus in his life) release a patch that is half idiocy and half comp mod, and now even the casuals who stuck with this mess for years don't wanna play the game anymore.If you actually want a history lesson on why this game is dead, here you go. It's a fantastic tale of incompetence.Despite all of this. the game could be fun for new players as a f2p title, if it had players. It doesn't.[steamcharts.com] For good reason. Even the very few players it has are undeserved and probably nostalgic/poor people.			"

												Hi-Rez has to be one of the shadiest game devs out there.  They have abandoned T:A to work on their MOBA money-grab, SMITE, full-time.  T:A is left in a bug-filled, unbalanced state.The Starsiege:Tribes Franchise was known for its high-skill ceiling, complex Flag-running tactics, sheer speed (thanks to jetpacks, rocket-jumping, and the ""skiing"" mechanic) and high-level competitive play.  Throwing the flag to a teammate while you're both mid-air, flying at high-speed along different vectors... the games were white-knuckle, high speed action.Once custom servers get up and going, and you can enjoy it the way previous Tribes games were meant to be enjoyed, then it might be a worth-while investment of your time.But don't give any more money to Hi-Rez.  They're shady as #*$&.			"

												It really pains my heart to have to review Tribes: Ascend like this.The core mechanics are quite solid and the skiing is undoubtedly the thing that drew me to this game the most. The maps are varied and distinct and make for some very fun team gameplay.But with Hi-Rez's discontinuation of support and the shortage of players, it's simply not worth trying out. You won't find enough people to play with to fill a team, and being on a server with one other person just isn't any fun.It's a shame because the skiing is definitely where Ascend becomes something of its own and not just another shooter, and it's sad to think that it will likely not appear outside of Ascend for some time.

												Hi-Rez installs their own root level service.  Remember the expensive class action Sony lost for installing rootkits?  Their shrink wrap EULA didn't save them.Hi-Rez advises people to turn off their UAC, anti-virus and firewall.  Is that advice bad enough to be held liable?  It's right there on their website.Hi-Rez installs Flash.  Did you see the latest list of Flash exploits?  Pretty much their entire history they've been enabling malware and exploits.Hi-Rez and anyone else who installs malware like programs and gives malware enabling advice should be suspended from Steam until they remove the offending code.  Repeat offenses should result in a ban.  That's what Apple and Google do to keep their market clean.For the record, I love Tribes 1 & 2.  Ascend used to be OK but had input lag even on a 4GHz machine.  Unfortunately, the new patch nerfs defense so bad it turns Ascend into a bum rush & spawn camping game like 99% of the other online games.  The armor configuration method is also incredibly bad, resembling a Towers of Hanoi puzzle to select the items you want in the slots you want with many classic combinations blocked entirely.  Many better configuration systems exist in other games going back to the 80s.  All they had to do was copy one.			"

You know a FPS game is going to be damn right amazing when you have a speedometer.This is my go-to game when I am feeling down or I'm raging from other games. Some people have CS, TF2 or Quake. I have VGS. The freedom of motion is amazing, and everything you're doing is so damn fun because of the fun mechanics.Pros:- free to play; great model; prices have been halved a while ago; ♥♥♥♥ING TRY IT- high skill roof; one of the hardest games to master those plates- skiing - my damn favorite mechanic to have in a game. Frictionless skiing.- jetpacks - goes hand in hand with ^ - all classes are fun- objective-based play; death stats and K/D ratio aren't even in the game - capture that flag with your team or go home- [VGS] commandshttp://www.shazinator.com/VSDD+VSTD+VDB+VDE+VNS+VBR+VBE+VGS+VGTT+VSAB+VTW+VGS+VGS+VSAB+VVW+VTN+VGS+VGS+VGQ+VSAF+VAW+VFF+VAD+VGS+VGS+VGTB+VSAF+VAW+VFF+VAD+VED+VFF+VNC+VDB+VGTG+VGW+VGCG- competitive- GOTTAGOFAST

Sadly not a single value of those will ever go up for me.Some may really like the changes the devs made, and others, like me, despise it because of how much flavor they removed from the game. I don't think merging guns and classes (not to mention a lot of nerfing) was the right way to bring tribes back to life.If you're new you may like it, despite the even larger learning curve and salty community, if you're a returning vet, prepare for a slap to the face.

(when you did contact customer support they referred to the game as smite)The only thing you could do is download the game.Why not work on Tribes Ascend instead?Tribes Ascend got Game Of the Year.And what did Smite win? Money?Has HiRez done something like this before?Yes. An even older game (but made with the same engine) called Global Agenda is more abandonded than Tribes Ascend. That game is an MMORPG, like Smite (hint hint)Then, after constant demands from the remnants of the Tribes Ascend community (mostly GOTY edition owners, but also those who liked the game a lot and whose game didn't stop working), HiRez comes out with the ""out of the blue"" update!First off, let's make the original Tribes games free!Too bad no one liked them, but yay!Next, let's change the liked class system with a system from the older games: light, medium, and heavy.Noooo! why would you simplify the class system (which actually overcomplicated it. Now there are a bunch of restrictions, like you cant cloak with the sniper rifle.)We did this by popular demand.What popular demand? Those who migrated to Smite or something?Oh, and all that money you spent on the GOTY edition and all of that gold/silver you used to buy weapons? We refunded it all back.Great, real great... Now I need to find the weapons I bought before... And they removed GOTY edition? why?We also removed a bunch of boring weapons and kept the OP onesWhy? My loadouts consisted mostly of that!!!We also added something called the ""all weapons pack""Oh, I see now... A variant of the P2W GOTY edition pack without the loadout, class, and perk unlock (which were removed or changed to make GOTY edition not much more than all weapons)We also added 2 new maps from previous Tribes gamesYay, although the previous games weren't that good...Thank you for playing Tribes Ascend, hope you enjoy the new Tribes, have a nice day, blablabla outro stuffReally? Really?NOW!Tribes Ascend has reverted to the remnant player community it was after the shutdown. With only a few servers with actual players, Tribes Ascend has only gone down. Nice job, HiRez.			"

This is the same company (Hi-Rez Studios) that made SMITE, and they totally dropped tribes. Servers are terrible, cant report cheaters, and even logging in, installing all that is a problem now.

												 BAD STUFF I really wanted to like it. I celebrated when the out of the blue update came out. but as like most greedy companies, high rez can't live with out monitizing the crap out of their game.  Where to begin, the community is toxic as hell. most people would complain ""wassn't tribes 2 and vengance the same way"" no where close as to how bad it is in this game. people slam and insult eachother other petty little things and complaints. even pointing out how stacked teams are will get you removed from a server, cause the vets have no respect for new players trying to get into the game.  speakign of stacking adn vets, the small community that remains with in the game is pretty much only one of two groups of vetern players. both of which regularly pile up on one team from what I'v watched. And pummel the other players on the other while insulting them, pretending their balls are bigger then the earth cause they are all on one team.  Weapon acqusition isnt too bad, but it plays in part with the whole ""Stacking"" deal. In old tribes games, you never had to unlock weapons. you joined a server, you set up your load outs and you go. no having to acquire 12000 points to buy your shocklance, no getting 8000 points to buy your mines to put down on the flag. its what kept the community freindly, I sucked to high heaven in tribes 2, but didn't matter to me. I had every thing in the game, there wassn't any thing I had to grind for? why get angery?  In tribes ascend how ever you haved to grind out XP to buy your weapons, packs, gernades, every thing except for vehicles. a patch after the out of the blue update made it easier to grind up the XP's tog et weapons but still with the need to win to get the best ammount of XP's leads to the enviroment between plays to be very toxic and not for those who were hoping to learn from teh vets. CAuse sadly it will most likely end with you getting frustrated and the vets just laughing and pointlessly seeking you out to kill you as well as slanderize you down to the personal level point of sayying things that are considerably in the zone of harresment.I want to see the game flourish, I really wanted to relive the glory days of tribes 2 and vengance but jsut high rez screwed it up to much, they should just stick with making MOBAS cause this tribes game is a stain on the tribes name. GOOD STUFF  BUT... not everything about this game is bad. the mechanics for stuff liek skiing, disk jumps and such are just gorgouse and fluid. and the graphics are actually not half bad for a tribes game... if only they werent wasted.  they did bring back old favorites fromt eh series, such as the original desighn of the spin fusor (But its called the ""light spin fursor"" and as the name suggest, its only for light armor), as wella s shocklance, plasma gun and relativly similar model desighn for the gernade launcher from Tribes 2. to add further to that they kept up the looks of blood eagle and diamond sword armor (if you don't know what I mean. go google what a diamond sword heavy looked like in tribes 2, then look at a diamond sword heavy in ascend)  for even more nestolgia they brought back a few maps from old games! Though when playing them youl be quick to notice... they shrunk a fair bit... (when did katabatic get so small?)   Do I recommend you play tribes ascend?    Despite they nestolgia they put back into teh game. no ...I can't bare to let the vets in that game but jerks to more people looking to relive their old days. you can play it if you really wanna try but be warned, the community is more toxic then chocolate would be to a dog. You wont hear me complain about the learning curve, all tribes games are like that. Thats what made them fun! but the whole having to unlock your gear thing is what disgraces the tribes name. made the players more hostile to people trying to get on their level. rather then just joking about and explaining how to they crazy stunts they do.

												This was my favorite game for the longest time. My PC never ran it very well, even on low settings. But I loved it. It's so depressing what happened to it. HiRez essentially disowned it and left it for dead. After that, the community plummeted and now there aren't many people playing it at all. ;(It was a very unique game when it was thriving. I had a lot of fun learing the classes, and perfecting my play style. I would love to see them make yet another Tribes game rather than trying to revive this one. They patched it(out of the blue), and obviously didn't find the community worth continuing with updates.In closing, I would've recommended this game when if was first released(as well as the first 2 years of it's lifetime). 100%However, after the amount of active players started to decline, it wasn't worth playing any longer. So I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.			"

												EDIT: My hours played does not match actual time played. This game was released on it's own launcher for quite some time before steam. Also note that this game officially has support of a dev team again and many changes are taking place.  I haven't had time to go back and try it again, but when I do, I will change this review.This game gives shame to the name Tribes if you have ever played the original version. Tribes: Ascend focuses on quick play snatch and capture mechanics with very limited ability to defend the flag other than chasing down the enemy constantly, which is very difficult due to the 10 second captures skilled players can do.In the original ""Starsiege: Tribes"", any player could set all the defenses with each team having a resource cap on the amount of defences that could be set. In Ascend, each class has their own defence abiliy and only 1 per player. So ASSUMING your team even sets down their defense ability, you have a very very small defense to block the enemy.Another problem I have is Starseige used to actually make getting the flag difficult by putting them IN buildings with many turns and hallways so a player could not simply fly past it and grab it like in Ascend.This game falls so short of actually being competitive it's just sad.

												Having played this a long time after the early 2012 hype, I can say that I see why people enjoyed this game - and why they left it. Of all the F2P games out there, the system in place here feels the most abrasive. So we essentially have a fast paced and highly competitive shooter (at least, on paper) with a unique concept, but we need to ""unlock"" classes and weapons? I haven't played any of the other Tribes games, but even so I felt like I was playing a game that is a mere shell of its potential - and seeing how the developer outright abandoned it for a soulless MOBA cashgrab, I don't see it ever changing. The worst part about this game is that there are some genuinely fun and well designed parts when you get past the layers of cash shops and leveling systems, much like a puppy trapped in a sewer. It's heartbreaking, and its why I can't even recommend giving it a small trial.			"

												Did you like Tribes? Did you like Tribes 2? Did you like Tribes: V- hahahahahah, no one likes Tribes: Vengeance. But you might like Tribes: Ascend. The fundamental mechanics(especially after the latest pair of patches) are very much Ye Olde Tribes. You pick an armor weight, you pick a weapons-and-gear loadout, you spawn, you use your jetpack, you ski, you eat a spinfusor to the face like thirty times before you remember that Tribes isn't like other FPS games.But then you get your first Air Mail or Blue Plate Special(mid-air kill), and suddenly you're having fun. Because suddenly you GET it. You get into five-minute duels with others, you grab the flag at 300kph(or stop a capper going at 300kph) and you GRIN, and suddenly it's 2am and you have to make an executive decision whether to go to work with five hours of sleep or play Tribes for another three hours and calling in sick.The only thing holding back Tribes: Ascend is really a few balance issues(Beowulf tanks are currently a bit pitiful and Shrikes could use a mild nerf) and some map design issues(on some maps, generators and base assets are very vestigial indeed), but you should still play the game, because on the good maps, you're really going to be having a LOT of fun once you get the hang of it.Plus, you know, the damn thing's FREE. Kind of hard to beat that price, especially since they stripped out the grinding aspects that usually come with F2P games.			"

Open source the game and go bankrupt please. You're gonna do it with smite when it stops giving money. The same way you did with tribes and global agenda.

												I remember using the separate launcher away from Steam, and logging in so many hours into this game. It's a shell of its former self now, however, with the removal of classes, removed base upgrades, the credit equips, bizarre weapon rebalancing, and now the inability to make a new account. Despite the last bouts of updates, Hi-Rez seems to have already abandoned this game a while back to focus on their more recents projects like Smite and Paladins. One can only hope that either a new Tribes game or the upcoming title Midair can recapture that wonderful, extremely fast-paced action I experienced several years ago.			"

												Gotta go fast. Achieve speeds of over 400 KM/H over the flag stand in order to achieve victory. Or spend the entire game sitting in the generator room as a fat ♥♥♥ tank farming easy kills. Or spend the entire game literally acting as a human meat shield physically body blocking incoming cappers much more talented than you without lifting a finger. Whichever role suits you best, this game is 10/10 casual and competitive gameplay. Does your team suck? Screw the objective and go kill people. Is your team coordinated and awesome? Use an extremely in depth built in system of communication in the form of chat trees in order to implement extremely precise coordinated offensive attacks to clear the enemy flag stand for your premier hero capper and shut out the other team. MLG 360 noscope blu pl8 specials. Clutch plays and genuinely ""OHHHHHHhh!!!!!"" moments are the norm in this game. If you like fast paced arena style shooters with unlimited skill cielings that revolve around movement, this game is for you. If you like to ignore the fact that you could be skiiing around at over 500 KM/H and sit like a god damn hen on the flag stand instead, this game is for you. If you want to disregard any kind of team based objective style gameplay and just kill people, this game is for you.			"

												I absolutely loved this game before the patch, the patch makes everything more confusing. I get what you tried to do Hi-Rez but you honesly lost me as a player with the patch. The bullet timings are improved in the patch and theres a lot more balanced weapons now. Rather than patch the game after 2 years and completely mess it up, shouldn't you have just made a new game?  It's about that time after all. If you liked tribes before you will still enjoy this fast paced shooter but to those that grew fond of the elements first presented in tribes ascend, this game will now just irritate you as nothing is even close to what it used to be. GG Hi-Rez, you lost me as a regular player with over 800 hours. The patch might just take some getting used to and I'm just salty cause it's not what I've wasted a lot of time and a few dollars on, but so far I am not impressed by what I see other than bullet speed improvements. Players get too many guns to the point where the classes are rendered useless and you can have a heavy armor with snipers and never know. It adds a whole new element to the game which is nice, but overall its just $hit in my opinion as of right now. I would still recommend it as there is still no other game out there like this, and being free to play it'd be dumb not to atleast try it.			"

												Surprisingly rewarding movement for its lofty nature. Tribes: Ascend will satisfy those who are apt to play it and gratify those who stay long enough to learn how to play it.Being that it is multiplayer Tribes: Ascend has netcode, and though all netcode is merely compensatory, which hinders this projectile-heavy game. Weapons fired in this game are delayed by ping and as such client-based actions do not determine the actions of the character leaving the player interactions with definitive inconsistencies.			"

												Tribes Ascend was an awesome game. I was playing it long before it made it's way onto steam but sadly Hi-Rez has decided to quit updating it in favor of Smite as I assume they figured they can make more money off that game instead. Although this game was free to play or as some say ""Pay 2 Win"" I'd have to disagree with the later part as the game required a good bit of fps skill to play and someone that just bought all the equipment could still be stomped on by a more skilled player.But with the game long out of date and less than 150 players active I'll have to sadly say I would not recommend trying it out now as you would have missed the ""glory days""			"

												First off, I may have 8.3 hours playtime on Steam, but I have well over 1000 hours outside steam that I've built up mainly from 2012/2013.Tribes Ascend has gotten quite a few negative reviews lately which I believe is very unfair. This mainly stems from Hi-Rez being very unpridictable and the playerbase seems to be worried they will drop the game at any time. This isn't going to happen. They released a major patch in December 2015 and have been patching since. They removed the starting grind and simplified weapon loadouts to make the game less complex. Tribes Ascend can be very difficult at first because there really is nothing like it (well.. at the time of launch there wasn't). The mechanics take an hour or two to get used to, and the maps will take some learning to figure out the best paths to take, but after a few hours you will without a doubt be captuing some flags.No other game has brought me more satisfaction of capturing a flag or killing an enemy. Because the controls are so obscure, when you master them and start kicking ♥♥♥, you really get a kick out of it. No other game will make me scream and shout with delight when it goes my way. Another fun part is that dying is okay. It's nearly important so that you can respawn and get a better path etc.Yes, the population on the servers is a litter lower than it once was but there are still plenty of new players with a strong core community. Tribes is without a doubt in my top 3 list of all time favorite games. I highly recommend you try it out.			"

												This is a fast past FPS game that requires teamwork, the game sets it self apart from other FPS games out there. You will ski around at speed outmaneuvering each other. Shooting requires a whole other way of aiming than any other shooter you probably know. You need quick reaction, intuition and a steady aim while you your self is on the move. This game is easy to play, but freakishly hard to master. Early on you will be steamrolled all over the place by the skilled players (even on lowranked server due to high-ranked players re-rolling to play on low ranked servers). It will be frustrating, but with a bit of practice you will learn how to move to prevent being trashed all the time. Movement is really, really, really, important.Btw, Did I mention how important movement is to survive in the game?Standing still will turn you into mincemeat in no time (camping = death).In the normal random game you can do whatever you like, more or less, but if you join a “PickUpGroup” (play a pug) game, you will be put in the setting of competitive gaming. It is recommended and a ton of fun. They will teach you how to play properly. Just tell them that you are new and need to learn ;) Try it out. It is worth it.The downside……Hi-Rez got greedy. When their DotA clone turned profitable, they removed all support for Tribes. The game is now dead in the eye of the maker and only the players are left to fence for them self. And because of this, the game is in a decline and will die out sooner or later, depending on how stubborn the game-community is.  "

												I first played Tribes: Ascend 3 or 4 years ago on its official site I got hooked to it pretty fast and it even became one of those games that you could play and forget a little thing called the time. The game is really fast paced for those of you that have not played it reccomend that if you are the type of gamer that can lose there temper very easily on an online game and you like to blame it on lag then this would not be the game for you simply cause most of the players Have mastered the tragectory system meaning that they could probably predict where you are going to land or where you are going to run or ski off to and shoot a grenade at your feet from across the map. Now when i stopped playing this game my old computer fryed itself and i nearly got completly got engrossed in consol games and had completly forgot about tribes until a few days ago but could not remember the name at all until a friend that played it before said it was on steam. Now while i was downloading this i thought my preowned Toshiba laptop that i got for less than £200 wont be likley to handle this at all well tribes proved me wrong it has never lagged on me at all so far and i find that outstanding considering that TF2 lags all the time until ive been on the server for a few minutes. I feel that its unfortunate that the communilty of tribes ascend has remained so small cause if it got pretty big we would be looking at one of the biggest free to play fps games competing alongside tf2 which wasnt even originally free and many more. Ive noticed that they have only updated  a couple of times since they brought the game out to the online comunity and ive also seen people question or speculate on it but i say where did they need to improve. Now i noticed that they reduced the blast radius and damage of explosives and I would suggest a tribe customization and that would represent the players clan. But please HiRez Studios if any of you read this review please only take the suggestion if there is a boost on players in the steam and web community. I cant really think of anything bad about this game other than the auto balance system for teams i often find myself killing allot in one game then getting killed all the time in the next match I feel that this might be the only thing that could be driving people away from this game.

If you like guns, skiing, and much killing and respawning, then you'll want to give this a play.8/10 for the idea, 2 off for needing a little polish.10/10 when I remembered it has jetpacks.			"

												It's good again guys.Quick Pro-Con LostPRO:-The movement. I mean god damn, does it put games like Titianfall and the latest cawadoody entry to shame. The entire game is played with an exo-suit that makes you feel like you've got an ACME rocket-powered skatboard welded to your feet at all times. With the hilly structure of nearly all of the maps, it's like the worlds most dangerous skate park - but with guns and Capture the Flag.-The weapons. Don't expect too many traditional pew pews in Tribes. This game is fought primarily with high-velocity explosive frisbees. Spinfusors are the name of the game, and learning to use one is easy, but eyeballing the trajectory, distance, and speed of your enemy as they go screaming across the map and scoring a hit is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to master. Weapon variety is enough to keep you happy, and each one has it's own little purpose.-The classes. Old Tribes players will disticntly remember nine in total, but with recent updates it's been shaved down to three; light, medium, and heavy. Don't worry, this is probably my favorite new feature, as it allows more creativity in creating them. Classes are simple, light means go fast, heavy means big armor, and medium is a balance between the two. With the new additions, you can really carve out your niche in the match. Want to have some heavy offensive ordinance AND be able to deploy a turret now? You can. Want to carry a crossbow and a Jackal at the same time? No more class restriction on that. Chaingun AND Heavy spinfusor AND Fractal Grenade? Yep, that too. The sky's the limit.-The graphics. Not on par with a triple-A 2016 release but still really pretty if you crank everything up to max, and can still be set low enough to play on a toaster. The gameplay is the focus here.-It's free. What more could you want?SO-SO-Cannot be played through Steam, so your favorite dank meme name is a no-go.-Serves can get a bit underpopulated, but that's not bad in my opinion becaue you see a few famailiar faces from time to time.CON:-Learning curve is a bit frusturating. 20 hours in and I'm still getting my behind kicked.-May be dead as a doornail in a year or two.-I can't think of anythig else.

												You should play this game just to experience what is it like: going 400 mph with flag while being chased by half of enemy team.+ Greatest and most unique shooter you ever play; Deep mechanics, it have its own tips and tricks; Great and balanced classes; Awesome and smart developed maps (except one, ♥♥♥♥ing Blueshit); Still breathing servers- Devs have abandoned game, so no support and updates; High cost of weapons and gear (but now they reduced prices all around like -75%); Game filled with veterans, so expect having ♥♥♥ problemsTry it, you will lose nothing. You may play regular like me and fill those empty servers, maybe this will attract attention of devs and they'll revive this great game.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is a really good game, and since it is Free To Play, you should really just try it out.Its biggest flaw, is the system of microtransactions, as the game seems to strongly urge you, to spend real money.Nevertheless you will be able to get significant enjoyment out of it, even if you don't pay.The most important thing about Tribes: Ascend, would be that it is a very skill-based shooter, comparable to Counter-Strike, as it is sufficiently easy to learn, but extremly hard yet rewarding to master.

Quite a few different game-modes.  And 9 different classes to play as.  9!  3 heavy, 3 medium, 3 light.  My favourites are the infiltrator (light) and the doom-bringer (heavy).

												In the beginning (2012) there was hype for whatever reason.Tribes: Ascend was DOA out of beta.It had been slowed down, perks were never considered for balance issues, weapons were released (practically weekly) too often and without any sense of incorporation in to the already existing product and were altered from being overpowered to useless in their short lifespans.Then 2015 ""Out of the Blue"", which is more like ""Out of the Beta"" since the game is now truly 'out of beta' considering that the ""OOTB patch"" is the ""Definitive Incarnation"" of Tribes: Ascend.The games speeds were sped up across the board... In the sense that everyone can go fast, even heavies.Now everyone has the broken perk 'Survivalist' so you can play Quake style TDM 'camp the healthkits' in every game mode and there's a large chunk of players who firmly believe that the game being slowed down like this is just the single most eSports thing to happen to T:A.Also with 'Survivalist' integration you have infinite ammo management added to your list of things to do as a player which is supposedly not ""Crutch"", because being able to endlessly fire weapons adds a lot to online FPS games. It's not like managing resources, like ammo, and health, and energy, and shields, really adds any depth to a game.Can't spell ""Fun"" without 'irony'.			"

												This game is more or less dead by its own devices and abandoned by its developers. It had a horrible F2P model (which got changed WAY too late in its life), balancing that is anything but (automatic weapons being the biggest offender in killing player interest), ""classes"" that are poorly defined to the point that they are almost indistinguishable from each other, and honestly just doesn't really offer anything that you probably haven't experienced (likely in a better form) from its prior incarnations, or other shooters for that matter (old school or *modern*) It had potential, but this potential was never really developed.EDIT 9/22/15: And I wouldn't hold out hope for the balance patch that is supposedly in the works that was supposed to have come out back in 2012.

												(NEW) Game is playable again! Classes and perks stripped down to three basic classes: Heavy, medium and light, all basic weapons available at master level. The specialty weapons are unlockable with xp or gold as usual, but they're no better than the standard weapons, just specialized. If you spent xp before with your account, it has been reimbursed due to the heavy changes to the game.If you're having trouble running the game through steam, run the highrez installer in the tribes:ascend exe folder, let it uninstall then run it again to reinstall it in another folder preferably. Now you can run it through steam!(OLD)People seem to confuse ""pay4lazy/aesthetics(which are pointless as a tiny spec) with pay4unfair advantage.You can say this game is pay2notgrind, but that's boring. Paying unlocks all the perks, classes and weapons that are unlockable anyway by fighting matches. When you git gud at this game,  no paying idiot will ever be a match for you.			"

Unfortunantly this is not what makes a good person shooter. In fact the visual crap and doo-dads actually got on my way in combat. We know everyone ignores visual effects after about 10 minutes into the game anyways.Level design. Most of the levels are too close together. I suppose they HAD to do this since a larger map on high graphics would bring most pre-2010 video cards to their knees.Balance and gameplay. The weapons are ALL over the place and the discfuser and showcklance are on the back burner in leu of the plethera of submachineguns and assualt rifles. This is not Call of Duty, this is Tribes where aiming is HARD and predicting where you target is - is paramount. Did not seem a Tribes game to me at all. What happens when you make certain weapons really easy to use and really easy to get kills with is that the hard core, GOOD players leave the game entirely and the inexerienced kiddies and man-children move in. Then they brag about how they so owned you with a SMG from 130 meters. Yeah, it's like that.Beta Tester support. Let's face it, Hi-Res spent most of their time on Smite and left Tribes:Ascend out in the cold. When Beta Testers spent up to $50-$60 on buying suits and weapons (something that should have been FREE), one year later Hi-Res crapped on them when they said ""Everything unlocked! Sale for $20!"". Yeah, I felt cheated after spending $50 in Beta unlocking HALF THE STUFF. Final note:I LOVE the Tribes game series. Starsiege, Tribes 2 and maybe even Tribes Veangeance (if only for the really single player campaign) are close to my gaming heart. What Hi-Res did this franchise put the nail in the coffin of this game concept that had so much promise.Hi-Res did to Tribes what George Lucas did to Star Wars.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is a good way to waste some time.  It has complex and interesting maps, and while there is a steep learning curve for weapons in the game, it's far more rewarding than in other games to get a kill.  Sadly, it is clearly a game developed around microtransactions, and it takes an absurd amount of time to get that one weapon you've been eyeing.  Due to that fact, the majority of players have moved on from Ascend, and it's slowly fading out.  While not a bad game in its own right, due to the recent lack of players and neglect from the developers, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Pollished, it would be a geat game! But as many other reviewers have pointed out, Hi-Rez Studios has stopped updating and patching it. It would probably be okay if they cut their work-force into sections, working on different games rather than just one, but they seem to want to throw their assets all at their MOBA (Which I think is sad that it's not on Steam... I actuall could use my wallet here for ""skins"" and gods...)My recomendation: If you're giving it a shot, go ahead! It's still a fun, yet frustraiting game! However, I would caution you to play a ""hat sim"" or other arena shooter that is actually maintained.			"

Controlling the massive speeds of 200 Kph is intense at first but soon becomes second nature as your main focus is blowing the heads off enemies using multiple different guns.

												Download it! It's free and it's the best CTF you'll find anywhere.The unique part of this game is skiing (making the ground frictionless), a rechargeable jet pack, and weapons you shoot inherit your velocity.  All of that combines together to make just moving around the map fun and gives the most dynamic game of CTF around.Also, the developers just started supporting it again after almost 3 years so consider it un-abandonned as of Dec 2015 since most reviews point this out.

Sadly this game was dieing after the first year.I havent played recently but the last time I did I waited in lobby with returning friends when we were the only people on map for each map besides the odd person who joins and insta-leaves which made playing kind of fustrating when I never could play with all my friends just against half of them all the time.Overall I had a blast it was such a fun game with unique style & movement I loved almost every minute of playing this game.

												Tribes used to be good. But Hi-Rez is absolutely frickin' terrible and manages to utterly destroy everything they get their stupid hands on. After giving up on the game years ago, I come back to give it another try- and am met by an Engrish-plagued launcher that tastes like malware, and find the game has regressed back to the kind of interface and responsivity of something from the 90s. It's ♥♥♥♥. After struggling to get my graphics settings to stick after being dumped into an 800x600 fullscreen window, I jankily get to the server browser to find an entire FOUR games with people. None of which will let me join.Tribes is dead, Hi-Rez needs to go out of business and sell their old stuff to people who give half of a crap.			"

												A completely awesome shooter. I've played hundreds of FPS shooters and this is one of the most fun. Do not be fooled by the large number of people badmouthing the game because they're angry at Hi-Rez (the developer). The game is super fantastic fun and has recently begun being supported by Hi-Rez again, as well.Ultra fast paced, frenetic combat on visually stunning maps. Do not miss out. When it's even free, this is some you HAVE TO play. Welcome to the fun. :) Be warned, though: Most of the community is people who've been playing the game for a *long* time and are *extremely* good at the game (no, they're not hacking, they're just that good!). It's probably the most skill-based, most challenging FPS on the market.			"

												This game was good when it was still under development.However, it seems that the Developer Hi-Rez Studios has abandoned it as it was not really economically supporting the company as it didn't had a consistent number of players.Erez Goren himself once said on Reddit that Smite brings in more $$$ for them and that's why they chose to stop development  for Tribes which is very sad and disappointing especially for the Loyal Players and VIPs who've supported them for a year or more till Smite came out(and development stopped.)Tribes: Ascend is now left in a really unstable and bug filled state(with quite a number of hackers and an Asia server shut down - Singapore i believe). Stay away from this game and do not, i repeat, do not buy the GOTY Edition if you played this game before already or not cos' there aren't many servers to play this on anyways(30-40 servers/day, many empty).Boo to you Hi-Rez, for ruining the fun for many Tribes: Ascend players in favour of a ""money-making, cash cow"" game.Signing off,HunterSlayer "

												It's Tribes. If you loved the series, you'll get some mileage out of it. But for everyone else, the time has already passed.The game mechanics are solid, and it's still very much an enjoyable shooter. If you do get into it, look for the GOTY pack on sale, as it'll give you more than enough content for your money, and is much preferred to the grind or solo purchases.That said, HiRez dropped support for this (among their other games) to focus on Smite, their new money-maker. While I can't entirely blame them, it still sucks. And with Tribes, it shows... the servers are mostly empty (though you can usually get a few games in without much wait) and there are no more updates.While a lot of fun at its core, due to the ended support, lack of care from HiRez about the game and grind needed to get into it... for all by the most desperate for some Tribes-y action (I think there's an original Tribes resurgence, so go look at that instead), Tribes: Ascend is sadly a pass.

												Tribes is a Free2Play First Persion Shooter with a unique gameplay twist: the main means of transportation are your jetpack and your ski. Yes, you read that right: your (energy-) ski! This aspect defines the entire game and poses the main difference to other games. The Tribes series was always centered around the gamemode ""Capture the Flag"" and offers fast and frantic battles, where aiming is as important as maneuvering the terrain:

There are 9 different classes (light to heavy) with class-specific weapons, items, perks and killstreaks. Most weapons shoot explosive rounds, which are quite useful for highspeed battles. The light classes are the fastest on the battlefield and are designed for attack maneuvers, while the heavy classes are mostly designed for defending your flag / base / domination-spot. There are also 3 different vehicles that can be bought with points (from kills and objectives) on some maps. The video below shows some weapons in action:

												Ignore the time I've played this, the amount of hours I've put into this game is mad.  Its an amazing game, with one major flaw.  The Developers.  Hi-Rez don't care about Tribes anymore, and probably never did.  What you will find if you play this is a ""skill-based"", unbalanced, massively unfair, OP auto, not rewarding of the skillful experience that will just frustrate you.  It was good once, but now Tribes is at an ""okay"" at best.  New players and T2 fans, I would not recommend.			"

												This is an amazing game, extremely balanced and fair. Its F2P system is absolutely functional and logical, as it easily allows for the more determined players to have access to all weaponry by merely playing it without grind, yet, if haste is needed, Steam offers the Game of the Year Edition which unlocks everything and is pretty cheap, and once in a while it can be acquired for a ludicrously low price due to the famous sales Steam is known for. I don't have the proper words to convey how great this game is: it's unique, SKILL-BASED, requires precise team coordination for competitive matches. This is a masterpiece and its originality sets it apart from its own genre. It's a must for FPS lovers and hardcore players that value practice and skill.			"

												I had never played any of the other games in the Tribes series when I decided to play Tribes: Ascend.I had no idea what to expect.I had heard it was pretty fast paced. I was wrong. I had heard it had a steep learning curve. I was wrong. The fact of the matter is that Tribes: Ascend might just be the most frantic, fast-paced FPS experiences you will ever encounter. The learning curve is not just steep, it is like a big wall that goes straight up and then (due to the massive amounts of gravitational pressure) bend backwards at the top. At least that's what it felt like to a newbie like me.They say that the best things in life are free. Tribes: Ascend is pretty darn fun, just get it. "

Safe to say its got the same problem which caused me to quit in the first place, once you get to level 10++ you get dumped into the ""Big Boy"" zones.Here you will get your butt kicked and handed to you by people who have no life (they get so salty when you managed to kill them in some way) and have been playing this game for ages. The balence in this game is awefull to say the least.It strikes me as very poor when you are level 11 and paired against people who are 40++. New players will enjoy this game at the start but around lvl 10 will drop off.Some players are aslo cheap as ♥♥♥♥, by partying with a low level player then barge into the lvl 1 ~ 10 games and wreck everything including your fun.

												This is a game of motion, where every strategy employs a method of movement.  And what movement it is: sliding down hills, soaring with a jetpack, strafing over the landscape.  It is easy to enjoy, yet rewards skill.  The pace is as fast or slow as you choose to play it, with weapons for the ponderous and nimble.  Furthermore it is free, and the graphics are lovely.  The balance is well struck, and you can easily earn new classes to play that expand choice via specialization rather than simply increasing power.  I love it.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is the most pure representation of the Tribes experience since Tribes 2 perfected it back in 2001. Almost every single part of the experience has been tweaked and improved, classes reborn and expanded, maps detailed and sprawling. You can ski like a master within minutes, but perfecting your routes, jumps and jetpack tactics are still the aim of the game.			"

												This game, although no longer being updated by Hi-Rez, is one of the best FPS titles on the market. It has high quality graphics, 9 different classes, and a free to play system that is less Pay-2-Win than most.Pros:-The game looks great-Tons of different weapons and items to unlock-No Storyline so maximum replayability-A community much better than COD or those types of games-Gameplay that is often based on skillCons:-The system may not be Pay-2-Win, but paying for the Game of the Year gives noobs an advantage over other noobs because certain unlockables are straight upgrades.-The classes are NOT balanced. Certain classes are ridiculously strong while others are borderline underpowered. That being said, a pro can make any of these classes work but they would do better using a good class-Although generally based on skill, some of the more overpowered classes simply rely on pressing a button to win-Weapons are not balanced either, with stock weapons that aren't even used.-Unlocks cost an exceptional amount. Certain unlocks that are required to play a subclass (Chaser on Pathfinder for example) require you to earn over 40 games worth of exp.That being said, this game is still a great FPS, easily kicking COD and those cookie-cutters right off the map.

												One of the most awesome FPS games to come out in a long time. It has Jetpacks, that should be enough to convince you for starters, but if it's not, then it's also one of the only games where almost none of the wepons are hitscan, everything fires actual projectiles, even SMG's, so you have to lead and predict targets adding a much needed boost to skill ceiling and satisfaction on success that FPS games have been lacking lately. Nothing beats the feeling of landing that long range mid-air spinfusor shot. You can also get a bit of a boost to unlocking stuff by liking tribes on facebook and signing up for the game using a refferal link like https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥=1322159&utm_campaign=email to get you some bonus XP at level 6 (and me too). The game has enough depth that I would reccomend making use of the skiing tutorial and target practice in game. Come play so I have fools to shoot!			"

												I've played a variety of competitive multiplayer shooters throughout my gaming life and I have to say that Tribes: Ascend is easily my favorite of them all. The main attraction is their ""Capture the Flag"" mode, which is the most intense game of CTF one will ever experience due to the game's unique playing style: a mix of futuritsic ""skiing"" or ""gliding"" over vast mountainous playing fields at high speeds. Combine that with precise and challenging shooting at the correct angle and direction to hit the other opponent and finally the correct tactics and timing for offense and defense between your teammates and the opposing force. To top it all off, the game also has excellent graphics, sound, and a fairly large multiplayer community. The game is free to play and upgraded weapons and other items can be unlocked through normal play time, but you can unlock things early through their online store. If you're looking for your next great multiplayer shooter that will challenge you a little more than the average Call of Duty or something similar, then this is your game and it wont cost you a penny! My only major gripe with the game is that they made the red team's armor look very menacing and cool where as the blue team's armor is sort of ""light"" looking like padding on a soccer player or something. As a result, a lot of players always play as the red team because they hate the look of blue team and the games will often be in favor of the red team... I really wish the developers would have made red and blue armor look the same to avoid a problem like that... sort of like what Valve did with Team Fortress 2 where both red and blue teams look the same, just different colors. Still as an overall package i think the game deserves a solid 8 or 9 out of 10.			"

												This game is free to play. I generally hate free to play because ""free to play"" usually means ""pay/grind to win"". As a long-time tribes fan (since tribes 1), this put me off almost as much as tribes:vengeance did. However I gave it a shot.Its actually VERY good. It would be perfect if it wasn't F2P (I would gladly pay full price upfront for all content) but the F2P here isnt that intrusive - you can get by decently without much grinding.This game IS tribes. The jetpacks, disc launchers, and voice binds. Flying over hills at ridiculous speeds and landing a midair hit on someone is really.♥♥♥♥ing.satisyfing. The adrenalin rush of being the flag carrier with 5 enemies chasing you at crazy speeds; it was a dopamine/nostalgia overload on my first play.In hindsight, this game needed to be F2P/grind based in order to build a large enough community to keep the servers worth playing in. I only wish they added more CTF maps.Definitely try this out (or you're missing out).			"

												Well what is there to say about this game? Sadly sice the game of the year edition was released this means one thing; cashing out. I doubt there will be any new major content or new maps to be honest. But should you get this game just cause it is addicting and pretty fun to play. There are some horrible disadvantages to this game:If you're a new player good luck ranking up cause most likely you'll be going up against more experienced playersRanking up is slow and pretty tediousIt is kind of a pay to win game (Pay money and unlock weapons much easier/ faster)Some of the weapons which are ungodly on the battlefield require 20,000+ xp or an easy 250 gold (Pay to win here)Very challenging and aiming is pretty dificult at the startHave to buy classes with 4,500 xp (4,500 xp is not hard to get)Now they are great redeeming factors to this game:Super fast pacedChallenging but really rewading when you land awesome mid airs on players moving faster than vehiclesA good variety of weapons, perks, loadouts, and specific play styles to classesClasses are fairly balanced (But with right weapons, player, and perks; classes can become unkillable and really broken)Vehicles to add something more to the gameMaps are awesome and layed out pretty nicely (In CTF a team can have a slight advantage depending on team or ""tribe"")The serversFor me servers have been decent and I haven't had too many issues. Occasional lag spikes and rubber banding but thats something we have to deal with anyways. Oh yeah there are different ranked servers. Novice for the lower levels and regular for the higher players. Higher leveled players cannot join Novice servers unless they join a friend through the in game social system. Once you ""leveled out"" of the novice servers welcome to dealing with level 30+ players and you'll be fairly miniscule compared to them. When you are ""too good"" for the Novice servers that is when the game falls of a steep cliff and die. Most servers are sadly empty so good luck finding any action. Novice servers are the only ones that have players in it, but remember you're leveled out.So should you get this game? If you really like fast paced challenging gameplay then pick it up. The thing is though early game will be painful as you will be left with weapons that very ""basic"" and aren't good or bad. Aquiring weapons, classes, perks, and anything will take a long time. Servers are nice, but the leveling and ranking involved with joining is stupid.I like this game and I still enjoy it today.  "

												I remember playing this game all the way back when it was in beta and I bought a supporter package for it then. I was also quite good at flag running then, unfortunately I am now trash and the game is very different from what I remember. But the things that haven't changed is the fact that it is a fun, fast paced, unforgiving, strategic shooter with loads of rewarding teamplay involved. I was glad to hear that the game is on it's way back from death. It was a noble thing for the developers to do even though they don't stand to make much money out of this. Although some people have mentioned lack of servers, those must be old reviews while the game was still abandoned as I had no trouble finding servers in the US. Since the game is free there is really no reason not to pick it up and try it at the very least and I would recommend doing so.			"

												No more updates, why? to make more smite related things because MOBA is the new black and they desperetely want moneyThere's always a freaking ""Hi-Rez Patch Service"" that you have to disable to not be monitored by this amazing Hi-Rez, it's supposed to be some sort of anticheat that searches in your RAM to find hacks and stuff like that (although I've seen cheaters anyway...), this process starts along with windows and cannot be killed, you have to disable the service so they stop searching in your computer, also this service does not uninstall after uninstalling Tribes Ascend.The game is a pretty good idea but sucks at balance. Being called ""the fastest fps"", that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, everyone's a freaking juggernaut wich is a tanky class with low mobility, tons of damage and giant blast radius (yes, it's also a tank, makes a lot of sense, right?), I actually tried this class to see if there was some skill involved and I admit the low mobility is quite a problem but with the high damage and blast radius... pfft, I fired several shots randomly at the air and managed to kill people without even knowing they were there.The fastest class can be easily killed with one shot by mid armored classes and it's not really that hard to do (the heavy armored classes blow on it and it just blows up). I used to play this game before it came available on Steam, slowly realising how bad it was, pretty good ideas, good mechanichs and at least I had no glitches but the community sucks with people camping in base, juggers spamming giant bombs on little spaces with infinite ammo (since supplies are too close to generators) and some cheaters that can't be kicked or reported (so that ""Hi-Rez Patch"" or whatever is completely useless and no, you can't play without it)			"

												Tribes: Ascend is probably the most fun you can have with online multiplayer. It's consistently fast paced and furious, with players zipping around on jetpacks and various destructive vehicles such as hoverbikes, tanks, and fighter aircraft. There's a wide range of classes with different roles and functions, heaps of weapons, and enough maps and game modes to keep the action fresh and interesting. If you're a fan of online multiplayer and you haven't checked this game out yet, you are letting yourself down. It's free to play, so you've got no excuse. Seriously, stop reading this and download the damn game!			"

												If you like speed and want to improve your hand-eye coordination by attempting airshots with projectile weapons at 150 MPH...this is your game. Its F2P mechanics aren't as fair as those of TF2, but are not pay-to-win by any means. Most FPS fans should try this one.			"

Do not let outside impressions fool you into thinking it's a hard game to get into, Tribes: Ascend is the embodiment of a game that is ""easy to learn but hard to master"" and the first genuine triumph in the free-to-play space...!

												This game is a fantastic combination of teamwork, 3 dimensional movement, precision aiming, and skill. It is exciting and worth a try as a free game. Be mindful that you will probably get wrecked for your first few matches until you develop a sense of how to move, shoot, and be aware of others.It is very high skillcap and enjoyed an eSports following after launch. However, the skillcap also makes it very frustrating to learn and requires a lot of practice (and innate skill) to become truely exceptional. The community, more often than not, can be harsh and critical of new players, even in the low rank servers.Despite the tag, the game is not ""Pay 2 Win"". Every weapon, kit, and class is unlockable and upgradeable through XP earned during play. It will take a long time, but the 3 initial classes (Pathfinder, Solider, and Juggernaut) are the most effective once you learn to play them. Paying money for Tribes gold is really only necessary if you want special skins or voice packs.Unfortunately the game is ""abandonware"" and won't continue to see the developer support. Hi-Rez has moved on to their new MOBA game Smite in search of microtransaction profit and has minimal staff overseeing this game.Be warned that the developer's customer service has a poor track record, even for loyal players. HiRez runs an anticheat program as long as the service as up that will detect ""undesireable software"" running on your computer such as Cheat Engine. Even if that program is not affecting/injecting code into Tribes, it will be sent to the servers for a very quick IP ban and permanent ban on your account. These false positives are almost never reviewed seriously and bans are maintained indefinitely with curt/generic responses to your complaints. The ""undesired software"" is not explicitly defined and you should use caution when playing while running any software that may affect your game (or any other game - example: ENBInjector for Skyrim originally caused false positives).I recommend this game as a free diversion and exposure to my favorite style of FPS, but caution you not to spend money on it. This game is unlikely to see any major support from Hi-Rez Studios.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is the most pure representation of the Tribes experience since Tribes 2 perfected it back in 2001.

												RE-REVIEW:Tribes: Ascend is the picture perfect example of free to play gaming. Beautiful graphics, one-of-a-kind and completely original gameplay and a wide variety of unlockable weapons for each of the games nine player classes (Pathfinder, Sentinal, Infiltrator, Soldier, Technician, Raider, Juggernaut, Doombringer, Brute) come together to create a gaming experience that nobody can afford to miss. It's originality can be attributed solely to it's fast paced gameplay, Highrez boasted that it is the worlds fastest first person shooter, and they aren't just saying that for sh*ts-n-gigglez. The high-speed skiing mechanic may appear daunting to first time players, but a simple level-up and matchmaking system ensures that you are matched with players of equal status. And for the record, yes, it IS completely original. Some idiots may be out thinking that it's a ripoff of Halo (see: overrated garbage), but simple facts show that the first Tribes game was released a good two years before Halo was even concieved. However, for all it's originality there are some significant drawbacks. It is as some friends of mine called it: A system hog, and it is NOT recommended for use on machines with minimal RAM, low-end graphics cards and puny processors. As well, to acquire the unlockables you are heavily encouraged to buy them with Tribes Gold, alternatives exist in the form of in-game XP, but the grind to afford one of them is in laymans terms, hell on earth. While it has it's flaws, Tribes: Ascend is an amazing game, and if you're desktop clunker can handle it, give it a go as it is the best F2P game I've played since TF2.***UPDATE***Sadly, HiRez seemingly deemed Tribes: Ascend no longer to be worth their attention, and as a result Tribes has suffered an untimely and unfortunate early shelfing. Making it perfectly clear that they'd rather work on Smite because THAT game is such a blockbusting smash.(I don't have any qualms about the gameplay of Smite, only that it seems to be jumping on the MOBA bandwagon due to the popularity of Valve's Dota 2)			"

												This could be your next romance. :)In 1999, which is 15 years ago now I played Quake 3 Arena for the first time, Unreal Tournament wasn't as fast, but also fun. Though Quake really managed to invoke a strong love for fast / dynamic First-Person Shooters in me back then.Tribes: Ascend doesn't exactly feel like Quake 3 or UT, but it's close to it, and like others pointed out: it's an awesome multiplayer FPS that somehow didn't get too popular, although it's freaking mindblowing with all its SPEED. :)Grabbing the flag or fragging an enemy while skiing or flying next or above him with 150km/h is certainly fun playing the light Pathfinder class.

												Tribes: Ascend is a free-to-play game (though money is needed for some features) which surpasses all expectations one could have for a shooting game. Most shooting games put the players in a slow-paced environment where the desire to move quicker than 7 mph is not an option. In this game, if you're moving slower than that, it's because you're standing still.This game requires a good aim, reflex, tracking, and anticipation. Most of your gameplay will require that you anticipate. There are enormous hills all over the place, and between the ""skiing"" and jetpack abilities, there's really no way you'll have to NOT anticipate before shooting.It also features several cameos and essences I really enjoy, even one relating directly to Sonic the Hedgehog (the best video game series ever). Several voices and  statements and whatnot from prior games were dragged into this game, and better yet, you can control the exact statement you use, unlike previous games in the Tribes series.As a First-Person Shooter game, I give it a 10/10, hands down. Most shooters I play get around 5/10. As a video game altogether, I give it 9/10, graphics and physics and originality and whatever else factors all considered. From a PERSONAL standpoint, I give it a 6/10. It's something I like to play, but not very often. Games are meant for fun, aaaaaaaaaand that's how I tend to rate games on a personal level. This game is a LOT of fun, especially to someone who hasn't played a Tribes game in 9 years or so when they find out this one is free. VGW			"

Leading targets, strafing, keeping the target in sight, you'll never have problems with it again. If you're up for a challenge, get this game!			"

												Switching to Steam version, thought I'd drop an opinion here.This game is fun in itself, and different from most bland shooters. You go fast, fast, fast, and you shoot high explosives. And I'm afraid that's where praise must end. HiRez doesn't give you anything noticable that you can get shortly, like in Blacklight Retribution or Spiral Knights. Instead, all upgrades are crutch weapons, things a class NEEDS to operate properly, after weeks of saving up from wins. There are severe class imbalances, such as Doombringer being useless overall and Infiltrators' capabilities of killing you instantly from their cloaks, and so on. It's something to play. It's very pay-to-win, free players mostly being cannon fodder. Until these issues are fixed, I wouldn't recommend paying a cent.It's still fun to play on occasion, hence why I haven't deleted it yet.Edit: As of 12/13/2013, I haven't played this game in, what, a year or so? If what I read is true, they've abandoned development and the game is still subject to some very serious balancing problems, especially in that new players simply can't compete. But really, the only reason I updated this was to change the recommendation from yes to no now that Steam has a system like that.			"

												Edit: DO NOT GET THIS GAME. As of last year, Hi-Rez has stopped all support for this game, and no longer updates nor polices it. The legitimate players have long since quit en masse, leaving only cheaters and hackers to fill the now-sparsely populated servers. I've been meaning to edit this review for a while now, but I've been putting it off for later until today. Hi-Rez has abandoned one game after another to focus on their newest cash grab (at the time of this writing, they're working on Smite).Tribes: Ascend is the fastest FPS game in the market. Everyone is encased in highly mobile power armor that lets them fight at blazing fast speed on the ground or in the air. In this game, a character running and gunning at 100 kph (62 mph for my fellow Americans) is considered slow, and skilled characters can engage in 250+ kph (155 +mph) firefights. To further complicate things, there are very few hitscan weapons in this game, and all of the automatic weapons are projectile based. A fast-paced game with a high skill ceiling.I recommend buying the 90-day XP booster, which is on sale for 1600 gold at the time of this writing (October 22, 2012). A VIP account (one that has paid anything) gets +50% XP. The booster doubles your XP on top of the +50%, for a total of triple XP (+200%) for 90 days and +50% XP once it wears off. You also get a bonus 1,200 XP per day that the XP booster is active, giving you even more XP to spend.Also, on Facebook, you can get 250 gold for liking it.			"

												EDIT: The Out of the Blue patch has improved this game immensely, bringing it more in line with Tribes and Tribes 2. However, there still are some balance issues, but much more concerning is the still-dwindling player base. Hi Rez has shown they've not completely forgotten about the game, but now they need to show they're commited to actually making it a good one. Check out all the new changes, and keep an eye on the game. Hopefully things continue to improve.An interesting title that's more a mixed bag than anything. Flashy graphics and unique mechanics provide lots of fun, but the massive xp costs for the countless amount of unlocks turns what would be a solid FPS into a frustrating grind fest. Not to mention, the learning curve is extremely steep; between learning all the weapon behaviors and skiing, there's a rather large barrier of entry for a newcomer. However, the DOTA- and CS-like difficulty is compounded by the xp grind and feeling of helplessness against those who have arguably ""better"" unlocks and more time with the game. Granted, mastering skiing and grinding for the unlocks will certainly keep you coming back, the former being genuinely fun and the latter having the same addictiveness for completionists.The classic F2P microtransation system really forces you to start pumping money in to bolster your arsenal. You'll have so little if you solely unlock through grinding that you're likely to never know what you actually prefer otherwise. For those inclined to do so can use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Tribes Gold in-game. This allows you to unlock weapons, classes and perks much faster than by grinding alone.However, putting money into this does leave a bad taste in your mouth. The game does feel like it's slowly expiring, so spending money on the myriad of arguably better and/or necessary unlocks also quickly kills the desire to play. Having dropped $20 in my 30 hours of play has left me little fulfillment. More often than not, I'll want to play, but the sense of aversion due to the xp grind and complete chaos in pubs keeps me from hitting the play button now.Hackers are both stupidly obvious and game breaking. One will ruin a game entirely; ironically, this is usually the best way to grind xp. Furthermore, despite the potential for large and hectic matches, even the normal 12vs12 games feel sparsely populated, every player preferring to go at it lone-wolf. This frequently results in both team having one or two players with better unlocks capping uninterrupted or camping your generator. The only time it feels like people are truly working together is when it's hardcore players stomping your team.Vehicles also don't seem to be touched at all, another disappointment considering the amazing potential they can have. The vehicle pad screams for more attention. Of the three (yes, only three - that doesn't even fill the list space!) vehicles you can purchase during a match, two are bland, expected additions that most games in this genre will have. The Grav Cycle is the best of the three, but still pales compared to other vehicles seen in FPS games in the past decade.I find myself picking it up every so often because despite its issues I really do want to enjoy this game. As you perfect your skiing and get better at predicting shots, there is some degree of redemption afforded the game? Those one-in-a-million shots are extremely gratifying, and high-speed chases are thrilling. Unfortunately, for a game so young, it seems to be suffering from the same fate many significantly older games are: a dwindling player base and no new official content. While Tribes fans may be able to look past the flaws to play a game bearing the series name with a modern paintjob, after a certain point the enjoyment of mid-air spinfusor directs simply can't produce enough draw to boot the game again. Whether that's after 5, 50, or 500 hours is dependent on how much you like the franchise.Sadly, Tribes: Ascend is only really recommendable to the intensely curious who won't mind the grinding and frustration or the long-time fans who'll buy the GOTY version. For a game with so much potential, it really feels the weight of its awards have crushed it. It's had its 15 minutes of fame and has ceased being profitable for the developer. Without a support team to keep it patched, hacker free, and fresh with new content, Tribes: Ascend is simply crumbling under its own weight.I love this game but it hates me. The Tribes franchise deserved better.			"

												I Really hate to see games that have so much potential and fall flat on its face. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea for this game, I really do. And for a while that game worked and had a big following, But Hi-Rez have completely ruined there own game in this case. First of all, the graphics feel like last gen graphics (Even on max settings) which isn't good seeing as how the game is only a year old, next you have bad texture pop in, lag and environmental glitches. All of which could have easily been fixed with patches and routine updates, but Hi-Rez have stopped updates for this game to focus on SMITE (Ironically, its suffering the same fate as Tribes: Ascend). But if you're willing to look past the bad graphics (Gameplay over Graphics) the game does work, skiing, vehicles, jetpacks etc. work like they are supposed to, however trying to get accustomed to using them well in a game is impossible, because the community of new players is dead, leaving only Tribes veterans, that will wipe the floor with you giving you virtually no chance to improve at your own pace. and to make matters worse, the training section is a joke, they have a few options, basic skiing, free roam, practice with bots (F.Y.I. the training with bots isn't a full match like you'd think, its just the bots running back and forth in set direction or not moving around at all) or watching youtube videos explaining the classes. To me that is just lazy. And even thought they have servers of novices only, nothing stops a level 32 veteran from connecting to the server and demolishing all the level 1-7 novices; once again stopping all progress to get better at your own pace. All in all, don't get this game, it was great at one point but unfortunately we are all a year too late from it heyday. the only way I could recommend this game is if you're a tribes veteran, which most of us are not			"

												Sort of nice. I liked the original (for me Tribes 2) more as this one is a bit dumbed down classes and customisability wise but it still fast paced and relatively fun shooter. Bcos of the f2p model, though most good things are locked when you start but if you find class you like the essential can be unlocked with few hours of gameplay.

												A free to play, play to win game.I use to play Tribes back when it first came out around 2000. It had awesome gameplay, and a ton of mods that kept you interested. There was no leveling up, everyone had access to the same classes, weapons, and accessories. You played to win, and the community was amazing. The game had it's own in-system IRC chat, where you could get help, have fun, or even get recruited into a tribe (clan). They had rankings for the best tribe for each mod, which were determined by scheduled matches. Tribes was my first online gaming love. Unfortunately I don't think I will ever find that level of awesomeness again. Franchise has just seemed to go down hill since the original. This latest installment makes me sad. If you want to play on a versatile and competative level, like the original offered, you either have to spend money, or grind days, probably even weeks, worth of gameplay to get enough exp to achieve it. Also, the support for the game appears to have totally vanished.  "

												This game was a beauty. I spent a lot of time playing it with my friends, enjoyed every minute of it. A year or two ago as of this writing, the developers moved on to Smite, and more or less left this game alone without any modding or map support. The community has diminished, although there are still a few places you can go and have fun. Give it a try, maybe someday HiRez or whoever owns the Tribes franchise will make another.			"

												TL;DR (even tho this isn't long anyway): Tribes theoretically is a waste of time on the long term, but you should have at least tried it and seen the awesome, unique mechanics this game introduced. If you've got time to spare and feel like playing around for a couple hours, this'll do great. You might get disappointed/sad once you realise how much ♥♥♥♥ the devs did outside of gameplay.Tribes probably wrote the saddest FPS story I've witnessed.It's so sad, I'm not gonna make a long explanation out of it. It's a story of how the most promising and fun gameplay concepts got overshadowed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev decisions, especially outside of direct gameplay.My actual recommendation: At least try this game, if you haven't. Why? Because you should have seen it. I don't think it's an actually recommendable game on the long term, but compare this game's gameplay to a lame ♥♥♥, boring CoD or whatever (those kind of shooters where the concept clearly is ""shooting > strategies""). Tribes does have a strategic part to it, but the shooting part is done in such a unique and fun way, it's ridiculous. Whenever I play a FPS that's promoted as ""fast"", fun or individual and I try it, all I think is ""well, it's not Tribes"". Hardly any game has similarly entertaining and unique mechanics in it. Balance issues, a kind of p2w system, no mod support and updates that didn't add ♥♥♥♥ to the game make me not want to play this anymore, but I'll never forget the ♥♥♥♥ing sick concepts and potential this game had.

												It's a little less entertaining now, to say the least.The developers no longer support the game, the community (not all, but most) is entirely too aggressive towards one-another, and the learning curve to enjoy the game properly is too steep for the average individual to even want to try playing.I can still say it was one hell of a lot of fun while it lasted, just not as much as it was in 2012.

												It taste alot like Tribes 1, WOOOHOOO! Anywy, so if ultra high speed, 3D (flight) combat, with high explosives, sounds like it might be your thing, give it a shot. Also good if you like freebasing adrenaline.UPDATE: Sadly, I eventually foud the constant re-balancing and introduction of new stuff to aquire to be tiresome. The free to play model seems to work against a game like this becoming a timeless classic like Tribes 1. While I am very happy to have gotten to play it when it first launched, and it's first year, I can't really recommend it anymore.			"

I felt like Hi-Rez were the wrong people to gain access to the Tribes IP, other FPS-Z developers could have been making this game enjoyable for a longer period of time with more and more updates, but Hi-Rez gave up on this game, and moved on to a 3D-MOBA. Also, the fact that Hi-Rez haven't opened T:A for modding surprises me, since old Tribes could be modded till your heart's content.

Not a ton of players, so you'll constanly be playing w/ the same players in Arena. (Oh, and don't be surprised by all the Assault Rifle type weapon spam.)""This is a quote of my original review. I have not played for quite some time and there is a reason for that. I absolutely loved the original Tribes, so I had no problem supporting the game through micro-transactions. However, when you do so, you don't expect what the developers of Tribes: Ascend did. Little by little I spent a decent chunk of money on new items as they were relased, whether it was IG currency saved up or using RL funds. I supported the game.However, the developers released a package in which you could unlock everything currently in the game for one astronomically low price. This is an insult to anyone that has been devoted to the game from the start. At the time I had every weapon, minus two or three that had literally just been released. In turn, this means that new players that have just purchased the game have better gear unlocked then I do, in one fell swoop.I lost all faith in the developers after seeing this package and felt nothing more than having been used.

So unless you are just very gifted at this game or plan to pump a lot of time into getting better its not worth it. There is no casual community. Bots could improve the experience a lot, as it is a fun game. Having more casual players would be good too but I couldnt say how to do that.No matter what you do DO NOT spend money on the in game gold. After a couple dozen hours I have been able to unlock anything that I really wanted. None of the unlockables are even that good to be honest; which is a good thing to me because buying victory seems cheap.TL;DR: Community is small and skilled and there is only PVP. Most players will prob just get farmed for exp by elites.			"

												A solid fast paced FPS that is by far the best CTF game mode in any FPS ever. The speed and intense gameplay are second to none, and the game is utterly mesmerising to play at a high level. The game however has suffered from the developers decision with additions that destroyed a lot of the games balance and ruined many of the classes roles. Before then abandoning it for another IP they had also been creating (SMITE). This is a sad thing due to the potential the game had right from the start. With a solid base like it had at launch the game could have well been one of the premiere competitive FPS games out there. With a large playerbase it fundimentally was already there, but the poor balancing and choice of weapons fundimentally ruined the game and it's current state is not much fun.I'd like it if HI-Rez actually did come back and resolved the games concurrent issues and took it foward. That or another company got the rights to the Tribes brand and developed it. I'd gladly drop more money on this game any day, if it was developed with the proper care and attention to the game itself.			"

Tribes is one of those hidden gems, highly underrated. And there is nothing like the feeling of capping the flag at 250+ kph. Truly spectacular.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is probably the most fun you can have with online multiplayer. It's consistently fast paced and furious, with players zipping around on jetpacks and various destructive vehicles such as hoverbikes, tanks, and fighter aircraft. There's a wide range of classes with different roles and functions, heaps of weapons, and enough maps and game modes to keep the action fresh and interesting. If you're a fan of online multiplayer and you haven't checked this game out yet, you are letting yourself down. It's free to play, so you've got no excuse.

												This game, had potential.The main flaw is literally the F2P model. Obviously they have to make money somehow, but all we end up with is a TF2 style game with lots of pointless classes that u have to level (and then comes the requirement to pay to compete). The game in my opinion would be better with a single class, the pathfinder as it's fun and requires skill to use and can complete all the different objectives in the game, such as flag defense and offense.The addition of generators and turrets that need repairing is really not that useful. The tech spends most time repairing (it takes 30+ seconds to repair) but it takes 5 seconds to destroy by the ""infiltrator"" (aka spy) class which can remain hidden for a fair time. So, it takes the tech 1 min 30+ to repair what took the spy class 15 seconds. Eventually you feel it's not worth the effort anymore. Sometimes you can spent ages having a battle with the spy or 2, not even getting outside of the generator room the entire game.The heavy class, can sit outside the range of the turrets and destroy them from long range, obsoleting the point of turrets. Another flaw that makes the tech slightly redundant.The soldier class has a thumper (aka a sort of grenade launcher) and IIRC a machine gun, making it way stronger than the pathfinder, at least at lower levels.The problem with all the other classes is they are too imba and don't require skill. Unfortunately you can find yourself being pummelled by someone who has a weapon with a higher dispersal or a rapid fire weapon, such as SMGs or even chain guns (machine guns).There is in fact, no need to go faster in this game because the strongest and most imba classes are the slower ones!This game will never become big because the ""levelling"" element makes it unsuitable for competitive play and the lack of a level playing field, where the difference is in the players skill.

Full auto derpscan weapons ruin the experience somewhat but overall the game is a fantastic blast of shooters past. Fast, fun and hard.Sadly, Hi-Rez pretty much destroyed the game they created. Stopping support for a game that had not long launched in favour of (yet) another MOBA game. No more updates, no more content and thanks to ever decreasing player numbers almost no-one to play against.Disappointing and a real shame. Needless to say I won't be touching any Hi-Rez products in the future since there's no point playing a game that a company is easy to abandon. This could have been something special, but instead Hi-Rez killed it before it had chance.So long, Tribes.			"

												I bought the closed beta in October 2011, and having never played any of the original tribes I was hooked. The game was a whole different ballgame than what I've played in the last 15 years. Having come from military shooters, with the exception of some co-op and TF2, I was looking forward to the projectile game as that's all I cared for in TF2 and I never got big in to quake either back in the day. When T:A went F2P I -- like most closed beta -- had high hopes it would be 'the next big thing' but boy we were wrong. As time went on and the game expanded you realized the developers had no idea about anything at all. Map Designers had no logic in their design, no maps made sense as to where you may find assets / repair guns / vehicle pads / inventory stations. Some maps do not even offer vehicles (not talking ones with them disabled). While it's not terribly hard to play the maps a few times and learn them you'll find yourself irritated so much with the fact there's no standardized design for maps. Suiciding will become your friend.After you make peace with terrible map design (to be fair 20-33% aren't too bad, but all lack consistancy you'll find in every major fps) you'll come to realize that the weapons are super inbalanced. The game started off with pretty much projectiles, save the inf (no one used it) and soldier AR. As time moved on everyone got machine guns. This was a big blow to the game in term of longetivity and probably is the main reason it's died. Not only were none of the maps designed with such weapons in everyones hands (no cover to hide from the literal 1-5k bullet spam per 20 seconds) but using a [timed] health regen system on top makes regending impossible unless you camp your base (which is why all pub games are defense).Anyone who has time logged knows autos are super easy to use, because they have no recoil, no spread. The only one which is implemented in a great way is the pathfinder lar -- because it's limited to 3 shot burst , and with a from-beta-possibly-alpha bug of dry firing you can bank on the person missing a few shots from it not actually firing.So on top of horrible map design, and imbalanced/spam weapons not compatable with map terrain or the health system you'll find a few other things that are a bit messed up like the snipers. You'll come to find out about this game there's a few things: Hi-Rez thinks the 2% of people who pug (or ""compete"" if you want to call it that) are the only people who play here. if you've ever seen a 'competitive' tribes game you'll see 2 things: endless auto spam, and cappers so terrible that the best strategy is to 'punt the flag'. It's why competitve t:a never took off and the only people who play(ed) it are people who can't let go of the game. Oh yes, back to the pug voice dictacting the game flow. So one thing you'll know if you've been around a long time is that snipers are terrible. Terribly easy to play, terribly imbalanced, and have absolutely no place in this game as it sits. They, like most things, were added because 'chasing is too hard for the autospam/flag punting 2%'. I put only a few dozen hours in to sentinel if that and I could consistantly hit the top 5 clans in the game (s1-2) @ 300-400 sanics no problem. The problem with the sniper isn't the 1-3 shot ability; it's that the class generally isn't in any danger because they camp far back. T:A was supposed to be about action, not d stacks and sent camps because no one can catch the flag guy (too logical to fix cap speeds). On top of this, you have numerous bugs still existing from beta, and many of the glitches such as rock bounces added as 'features' due to , again, the 2%. -- This was when I quit.Now, 3 weeks ago I started playing again with a friend. Sad to say, it got worse. If you're lucky you'll find 5-10 servers with people on them, only to find 1/2 of them are level restricted to 1-10. So you fight over queueing in to 1 of 3-4 servers with the same people. All of them spamming automatics endlessly and spamming the VGS system. You'll see pubstar cappers ending games in 5-0s trying to look good but failing to realize the entire t:a population of < 500 people aren't too interested in capping a flag. Yes, I know, it's CTF. But that's because no other servers exist, and the only TDM I saw was 1-10 restricted.So, that about sums up this game. It's totally fun to tinker with casually, but it's never anything to take seriously. The developers used it as a cash cow to fund their next game then dumped it, no mod support even as a thank you. They quit supporting it in June 2013 so it is what it is and that's not much.I still enjoy tanking auto noobs and blue plating people but you'll find yourself wondering why the same people you see in every server haven't learned how to shoot a projectile well by now.

Along with compounding factors of no replays or ways to make tournament lobbies or proper matchmaking the devs bailed out in favor of SMITE their current sweetheart.This game is pretty fun I guess, but it's hard to enjoy it when there's so much obviously broken about the game and the devs have confirmed they will never update it ever again.

												Tribes Ascend is a brilliantly fast but not fast-paced shooter that requires accuracy over awareness. The map is extremely open and you feel really bawesome skiing and jetpacking your way extremely quickly through an enemy fort. This is really tricky to stop but also satisfying, and you don't just have your fast battles requiring accuracy. When you try to shut down the enemy generator to limit their powers, that means that you can have the normal types of battles you are used to, and you can use the slower more explode-y weapons. The vehicles some say are underwhelming, and that depends on how they are priced. There's the slow tanky beowulf, the fast motorbike, and the shrike, which is your flying vehicle that is not for everyone. The call-ins are probably better. You can make recourse drops and also call in slow but extremely powerful strikes from the air.			"

												A fantastic take on the FPS genre. While CTF dominates the gamemodes, it is in no way boring or dull, as the unique system of movement and variety of classes allows for constantly interesting and fast-paced gameplay. With the first patch since two years announced a few days ago I hope this game improves even further and that the community's size increases. A must play game, very fun and entertaining.			"

												While far from perfect, everyone should play this game at least once. It is unlike any other multiplayer game I've ever played, in a good way. It's fast paced, but also slows down at times, depending on how you choose to play. The combat is easy to learn but hard to master, which makes for a game worth playing over and over. It is far and away my mo0st played game on steam, and for good reason.			"

												Very fun, it's a shame that the comunity for this game has been dying for awhile now. A combination of the lack of new content and FTP aspect (though the pricing/structure are quite fair imo) seem to be responsible for this. While this game did change some things from previous Tribes, I think that Hi-Rez did a good job keeping most things faithful to the series. There are still a good number of players on servers, but it has certainly passed it's most active/best times. Hopefully this will not be the end of the Tribes series.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is a strange case. The game was wonderful once, even I have to dare to call it an example of the perfect FPS. The main game mode was capture the flag and it had a small variety of weapons, including the spinfusor. The spinfusor projectiles could inherit the speed of the user, leading to a desicion from the player: do they go fast and make it more difficult to hit things or slow down and be more difficult to hit. As such, a typical game would be: Defenders set up minimal defences Flag cappers gain enough speed using skis, jetpack and boosters to get past the automated turrets and opposing players Flag carriers cap flag by going fastThe game revolved around the skiing mechanic, in which one could go fast by activating skis down hill but had to use a jetpack uphill. This led to the game being FAST. About a year ago, the developer introduced a speed cap for flag carriers, a change to how inheritence of projectile weapons was calculated, a buff to the heavy classes and then suddenly stopped development of the game altogether because they wanted to hop onto the MOBA bandwagon. I apologise to people who only just heard of this game but it's too late, it's dead now. If there was more marketing other than none whatsoever or it went to Steam earlier maybe people would have jumped on it before it died.STAY CLEAR OF THIS GAME AND ANYTHING ELSE THE DEVELOPER MAKES, THEY ARE GREEDY SCUMBAGS.

												One of the most awesome FPS games to come out in a long time. It has Jetpacks, that should be enough to convince you for starters, but if it's not, then it's also one of the only games where almost none of the wepons are hitscan, everything fires actual projectiles, even SMG's, so you have to lead and predict targets adding a much needed boost to skill ceiling and satisfaction on success that FPS games have been lacking lately. Nothing beats the feeling of landing that long range mid-air spinfusor shot. You can also get a bit of a boost to unlocking stuff by liking tribes on facebook and signing up for the game using a refferal link like https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥=1322159&utm_campaign=email to get you some bonus XP at level 6 (and me too). The game has enough depth that I would reccomend making use of the skiing tutorial and target practice in game. Come play so I have fools to shoot!			"

												This game is a free fast-paced FPS with mostly ballistic weapons and awesome movement mechanics including jetpacks and a complete friction loss from the ground. And because gliding + hills + speed + ballistic weapons = hard to hit, this game is difficult. And awesome.Now to get a little more precise, the movement can be compared with the little iOS game tiny wings, where you slide through the little gaps between round hills and fly around as fast as you can, but this is 3D. The weapons are mostly in one of these 3 categories: Explosive weapons fire slowly, have rather slowly flying projectiles with splash damage and extreme damage on a direct hit, while bullet based guns (autos) fire rather fast flying little projectiles dealing high damage per second if you manage to hit all shots and the usually weakest but easy to aim hitscan weapons, which work as all guns do in ""modern shooters"". You point at an enemy and when you click, they die.As you may have guessed, to be good at the game you should be able to handle guns from the first category, which are the way it's meant to be played and the only real honorable option (Debatable, I know, discuss it on reddit or whatever). The fast movement is hard to control in the beginning and hitting fast people with ballistic weapons can be extremely hard. This is what puts game's skill ceiling so high.The community is not as big as it used to be, by now the game is slowly dying ( http://steamcharts.com/app/17080#All ). Still, there's always enough EU servers filled to join in a suitable game for me, so I will be enjoying the game for a long time. The good players are friendly to each other, the few toxic parts of the community are found in low-level servers and quit plaing sooner or later. Your first matches will be on these novice servers, although you will soon reach level 10 just to be thrown into games with the seasoned veterans when you know little about the game but the basics. This makes it even harder for new players.So, to come to a conclusion:The game is awesome, but difficult.We can use more new players learning with each other instead of getting wrecked by pros, so give it a try.What you can have for free is one of the best multiplayer shooters out there.Prepare to get owned! Don't be frustrated, it's bound to happen.Continue playing and think about what you do, learn from the enemy and you will get better.Have fun!			"

												It's pretty good after you unlock your first two classes, but before that (and even after), the game is extremely hard to master, as everyone else has super upgraded weapons, perks and other stuff. Vehicles can be acquired by spending ""XP"" earned in matches (XP resets every match). This game is good enough that I still play it, but IMO, the match-making should be better. I keep being set into games that have people that are 20 or something ranks ahead of me.Good points:-JETPACKS!-Unique Ski mechanic that lets you fly through the map barely touching the ground.-Great inertia/velocity physics-Requires skill-Recent update made things cheaper-Interesting weaponsBad points:-Dwindling population-Terrible, if any, matchmaking-Requires skill-Things are still pricy-Lack of support from the devs (they've moved on).Misc. points:-There are almost no hitscan weapons, meaning you have to lead your shots and use your brain to calculate/anticipate/predict where your enemy will be by the time your shot reaches them.-No ADS. It's either zoom or hipfire, much like Halo.-If you don't ski and/or use your jetpack, and play this like CoD or Battlefield, you're gonna be dead quick.-The maps are large, so you'll need to use your enhanced movement to get around quicker.tl:dr: Much better than Smite, although the developer has abandoned the game.

												Basically a futuristic competative FPS with huge open maps and everyone on skis.  Its a FTP + microtransaction driven game and playable without those.  Its a fairly unique take on the genre, with a variety of classes each with their own use.  The game's graphics aren't that good so it runs fine.The problem is that the dev has basically abandoned the game in favor of their new FTP moba.  There's a modest score of not-well-balanced maps and some of the classes can be frustratingly imbalanced on some maps over others depending on microtransacted equipment (which would otherwise take a fair amount of time to grind out).Don't play it.  There are plenty of other paid FPS games you could purchase and get more out of, unless you're craving something Sci-fi in your competative FPS or have an empty wallet.			"

												This game, although no longer being updated by Hi-Rez, is one of the best FPS titles on the market. It has high quality graphics, 9 different classes, and a free to play system that is less Pay-2-Win than most.Pros:-The game looks great-Tons of different weapons and items to unlock-No Storyline so maximum replayability-A community much better than COD or those types of games-Gameplay that is often based on skillCons:-The system may not be Pay-2-Win, but paying for the Game of the Year gives noobs an advantage over other noobs because certain unlockables are straight upgrades.-The classes are NOT balanced. Certain classes are ridiculously strong while others are borderline underpowered. That being said, a pro can make any of these classes work but they would do better using a good class-Although generally based on skill, some of the more overpowered classes simply rely on pressing a button to win-Weapons are not balanced either, with stock weapons that aren't even used.-Unlocks cost an exceptional amount. Certain unlocks that are required to play a subclass (Chaser on Pathfinder for example) require you to earn over 40 games worth of exp.That being said, this game is still a great FPS, easily kicking COD and those cookie-cutters right off the map.

												RE-REVIEW:Tribes: Ascend is the picture perfect example of free to play gaming. Beautiful graphics, one-of-a-kind and completely original gameplay and a wide variety of unlockable weapons for each of the games nine player classes (Pathfinder, Sentinal, Infiltrator, Soldier, Technician, Raider, Juggernaut, Doombringer, Brute) come together to create a gaming experience that nobody can afford to miss. It's originality can be attributed solely to it's fast paced gameplay, Highrez boasted that it is the worlds fastest first person shooter, and they aren't just saying that for sh*ts-n-gigglez. The high-speed skiing mechanic may appear daunting to first time players, but a simple level-up and matchmaking system ensures that you are matched with players of equal status. And for the record, yes, it IS completely original. Some idiots may be out thinking that it's a ripoff of Halo (see: overrated garbage), but simple facts show that the first Tribes game was released a good two years before Halo was even concieved. However, for all it's originality there are some significant drawbacks. It is as some friends of mine called it: A system hog, and it is NOT recommended for use on machines with minimal RAM, low-end graphics cards and puny processors. As well, to acquire the unlockables you are heavily encouraged to buy them with Tribes Gold, alternatives exist in the form of in-game XP, but the grind to afford one of them is in laymans terms, hell on earth. While it has it's flaws, Tribes: Ascend is an amazing game, and if you're desktop clunker can handle it, give it a go as it is the best F2P game I've played since TF2.***UPDATE***Sadly, HiRez seemingly deemed Tribes: Ascend no longer to be worth their attention, and as a result Tribes has suffered an untimely and unfortunate early shelfing. Making it perfectly clear that they'd rather work on Smite because THAT game is such a blockbusting smash.(I don't have any qualms about the gameplay of Smite, only that it seems to be jumping on the MOBA bandwagon due to the popularity of Valve's Dota 2)			"

												This could be your next romance. :)In 1999, which is 15 years ago now I played Quake 3 Arena for the first time, Unreal Tournament wasn't as fast, but also fun. Though Quake really managed to invoke a strong love for fast / dynamic First-Person Shooters in me back then.Tribes: Ascend doesn't exactly feel like Quake 3 or UT, but it's close to it, and like others pointed out: it's an awesome multiplayer FPS that somehow didn't get too popular, although it's freaking mindblowing with all its SPEED. :)Grabbing the flag or fragging an enemy while skiing or flying next or above him with 150km/h is certainly fun playing the light Pathfinder class. Well, I guess even a static player with a sniper weapon (class: Sentinel).YAY, finally a worthwhile multiplayer FPS "

												I've spent over 500 hours on this game, having had no experience with the previous games in the franchise, and I can say one thing about it that I'm completely sure of: It's very, very good.Hirez made a fantastic shooter, that, in spite of its high critical acclaim and praise, never managed to secure an audience large enough to merit its continued development, and caused it to only exist as a ""live"" game for a year after coming out of open beta. The studio got a lot of flak for moving its focus over to another risky endeavour, which is the MOBA Smite, which paid off after Smite saw a lot of commercial success and propelled the studio from a small 20-man staff to employing over 80 people. I recommend playing Tribes: Ascend without hesitation, as it is the best online shooter I've ever played, and in spite of some balancing issues, and lack of studio support, I will continue playing for as long as the servers don't burst into flames and die, at which point the game will probably die too. Go in, have fun, shoot people, and try not to rage too much when hyper-skilled players gun you down with automatic weapons 4 times over. It's a lot of fun if you play it for fun.			"

												Tribes Ascend tries to revive and renew the long history of tribes games. However the game is quite dumped down and does not really deliver. Tribes was always a ver niche game and got its experience from mechanics that are not really compatible with the broad mass of players (it was no game you could pick up easily). By triing to make it mass compatible it is loosing much of its appeal and uniqueness.However , after abandoning the game for 2 years, HighRez is making an effort to renew the game. Lets see how long it will last and whether they can make it tribes again.Recommended because of hope dies last.			"

												Actual gameplay:  11/10Other crap that comes with that:  0/10This game is made by hi-rez, a company with a history of creating and abandoning their games after a couple years or so.  They ditched global agenda for tribes, then ditched tribes for smite.  So essentially it has gone un updated for years causing the player base to be very low and the cheaters to be somewhat common (It won't ruin the experience but you may see one every few days,  just switch servers).Conclusion:   Possibly best game I have ever played, insane skillcap, insane speedcap, weapons mastery unlimited and super rewarding, but at this point its hard to start getting into it because of the lack players and dev work.  Even though My steam profile doesn't say it I have played over 1000 steam hours of this (they reset when I reinstalled it) and an unknown number of hours playing it off the non steam launcher.  If this series was rebooted or the game was updated I would certainly get back on it but until then ill stick to other stuff.			"

												Ok. I haven't played this in a long time but this is my idea of it. Take Battlefield 2042 + Quake multiply by Halo + F2P + GOTY = Tribes Ascend.A fast paced that I think takes out Nexuiz right out of the GOTY edition. Tribes GOTY edition is a really good deal. Think about it. spend hundreds of dollars buying one by one or get the game and GOTY Edition and win. Tribes like TF2 but  more fast  paced and NO VOICE CHAT = NO SCREAMING KIDS! :D			"

												This game is a fantastic combination of teamwork, 3 dimensional movement, precision aiming, and skill. It is exciting and worth a try as a free game. Be mindful that you will probably get wrecked for your first few matches until you develop a sense of how to move, shoot, and be aware of others.It is very high skillcap and enjoyed an eSports following after launch. However, the skillcap also makes it very frustrating to learn and requires a lot of practice (and innate skill) to become truely exceptional. The community, more often than not, can be harsh and critical of new players, even in the low rank servers.Despite the tag, the game is not ""Pay 2 Win"". Every weapon, kit, and class is unlockable and upgradeable through XP earned during play. It will take a long time, but the 3 initial classes (Pathfinder, Solider, and Juggernaut) are the most effective once you learn to play them. Paying money for Tribes gold is really only necessary if you want special skins or voice packs.Unfortunately the game is ""abandonware"" and won't continue to see the developer support. Hi-Rez has moved on to their new MOBA game Smite in search of microtransaction profit and has minimal staff overseeing this game.Be warned that the developer's customer service has a poor track record, even for loyal players. HiRez runs an anticheat program as long as the service as up that will detect ""undesireable software"" running on your computer such as Cheat Engine. Even if that program is not affecting/injecting code into Tribes, it will be sent to the servers for a very quick IP ban and permanent ban on your account. These false positives are almost never reviewed seriously and bans are maintained indefinitely with curt/generic responses to your complaints. The ""undesired software"" is not explicitly defined and you should use caution when playing while running any software that may affect your game (or any other game - example: ENBInjector for Skyrim originally caused false positives).I recommend this game as a free diversion and exposure to my favorite style of FPS, but caution you not to spend money on it. This game is unlikely to see any major support from Hi-Rez Studios.			"

												Oh gods Tribes Ascend. This would be one of the best games I've ever played if it weren't for the ridiculously high skill requirement. It isn't even a learning curve, it's a time commitment. You have to first get a feel for Skiing - the primary means of getting around a map - then you have to learn how to use at least one of the game's weapons, all of which are hard to use. Mastering one of the game's weapons is akin to earning your 5th degree black belt, both in terms of effort and timecomitted to it, as well as the effectiveness that results from your mastery. I have yet to come close to even becoming adept with one of the weapons in this game. Another thing is that the lag, even though it is miniscule and very well covered up by lag compensation, will MESS WITH YOU. A 0.2-second delay in firing your Spinfusor means the difference between scoring a direct hit and accidentally killing yourself in the explosion. Another thing is that the class balance is a bit off-kilter; Medium and Heavy classes can easily travel 9/10ths the speed of a Light class, and their weapons can one-hit Light classes with splash damage. Whereas, the Light classes have to score nothing but direct hits to even come close to leaving an engagement with their lives. It's not a huge issue; the Light's job is to run around sewing chaos, not engaging directly, but it can get under your fingernails when a misfired shell kills you instantly after you walk out of the spawn area.Besides that the game really is deservent of the title of ""The fastest FPS on the market."" With practice, you can easily reach racecar speeds of 300 KPH on a regular basis; I've seen some people get up to a supersonic 600 KPH when they try. The skill-based weapons are both rewarding and aggravating at the same time; you can go an entire match without a single kill or assist because of how bad your aiming skills are, and the next match you can rack up 10 mid-air kills with grenades. It's entirely dependent on how good you are, how bad the lag is, and whether or not the gods of hilarious killshots are on your side. The team balance isn't stellar, but there is at least an algorithm that exists to balance out teams. All of the gamemodes are stupid fun, and teamwork does matter even if you hardly ever get it. This game is a proponent of the ""Awesome Moment""; you know, those time where there is 1 minute left in the game, you're playing as Pathfinder, the most fragile class in the game, and you skii into the enemy's flag room, kill 3 guys in one shot, grab the flag right before the enemy team captures theirs, kill the flag carrier and return your flag, skii all the way home dodging missiles and AA fire as you deftly slide up and down ramps and hills, and just before the game ends, you cap the flag and tie the game. Much Shazbot will be heard.			"

Hirez no longer does a lot of development to the game, it takes a very long time to find a game if you are in a party with friends, takes some time to rank up to unlock new gamemodes.  Over all this is a fun game to play and there are a lot of choices to go with for your different classes.  So if you are looking for a good free future like FPS then this is for you!			"

												tribes ascend was intended to be a rebirth of the legacy that existed in Starsiege tribes, and tribes 2, now, anyone who experianced Starsiege tribes in it's prime loved the mod community far more than the base game, tribes ascend, has become what the base game SHOULD be like, but keeps itself closed from being anything more by not allowing any modifications other thna what the original devs put in... even requireing microtransations for server hosting, all servers in this game are running off microtransations, hi-res seems to have dubed  themselves through wht releasing new content with the ""Game of the Year Edition"" giving all content, the game isn't pay to win, but will require you to put some good hours in and proper spending of your points to get a good setup. a good game, but could be so much more, fun community and not for the novice fps player			"

												Since HiRez *FINALLY* released a patch for this game, after two whole years, I figured it was time to patch my review.  While everyone figured they abandoned the game (which, they pretty much did for a while there), they came out of no where with this new patch.  And it puts the feel of the old school Tribes games back in.  Gone are the individual classes, back with just the light/medium/heavy sets and customizable loadouts.  There's been a slew of quality improvements as well as a couple new maps.  I definitely feel like I'm playing a graphically and mechanically updated version of the beloved Starsiege Tribes from the late 90s, which is fantastic.  A lot of F2P games get you with their IAPs and P2W, but even HiRez has admitted they're not going to make money off this patch.  They've basically given the old players everything in the game completely unlocked.  You shouldn't spend more than $10 on the game unless you're just impatient, as it appears everything (except armor skins and voice packs) are unlockable via XP.  I can't not recommend this game to fans of the FPS genre, because the bottom line is it's just that good.			"

												A great game.HISTORY:Tribes is an old franchise that goes all the way to 1999 with Starsiege: Tribes. It differentiated itself from other futuristic shooters by having wide open maps, vehicles, class system (similar to what Battlefield 1942 did 3 years later) and jetpacks. Then later on, Tribes 2 came and further expanded on the idea, adding skiing (which is one of the few cases of a bug becoming a core feature of a franchise). It was well received and a couple of years later, Tribes: Vengeance came out and it was the first attempt to try streamlining the formula, however it wasn't well received by fans. And so, Tribes IP languished year after year, at one time developer called GarageGames (who made Fallen Empire: Legions, heavily (by heavily I mean almost completely copied) inspired by Tribes) bought the IP with the intent of remaking Tribes 1 for their InstantAction platform (which might be defunct now), til Hi-Rez bought the rights and set on to develop Tribes: Ascend.BASICS:Tribes: Ascend can be best described as ""Battlefield meets Halo, fast-paced"". It is a first-person shooter which pits teams Blood Eagle between treacherous Diamond Sword, each team can have max. 14 players with 3 armor classes in disposal. It is very team-oriented (as you might've noticed) and each player needs to accomodate and communicate between teammates to win. It's not as easy to learn as other games in the genre, you need to have at least some knowledge of the game, but it is gratifying as you soar into the sky with your jetpack and then ski 200 km/h (or is it mph), get into duels and so on.GAME MODES:There are many game types you can play, however the main type of Tribes: Ascend is Capture-the-flag. Each team fights for other team's flag and 5 captured flags end the game or if the time runs out with the score difference of two or one without other team holding the flag. Team Deathmatch is also widely played and recommended for newbies to try out. There are other game types like CTF Blitz (changing flag positions), Arena (akin to Quake's Clan Arena)... The maps are gorgeous and vast and the action feels really good, with plenty of weapons to wield (which need to be unlocked though).PROGRESS:UPDATE: Completely overhauled experience system. Now it's far easier for newer players to learn the games because pay-to-win elements have been unlocked. Grinding has been removed, everything not cosmetic is unlocked from the start. The whole loadout system has been rebalanced. So kudos to Hi-Rez.CIRCUMSTANCES:The community playing this game is rather small. Hi-Rez cut support for the game a few years back because it was ""complete"" (even though there are still bugs that need some work, Hi-Rez mismanaged the game and consequently many players have left the game, but with the rebalancing I highly recommend that you come back.CONCLUSION:+ Fast-paced action+ Beautiful maps+ A rather successful attempt to modernize the Tribes formula+ Not pay-to-win (anymore)- Small number of players for now- Not as easy to pick up as other FPS'sMy rating:8 / 10P.S. After you play few matches to get a grip on the game, I suggest you to head over to tribesascendwiki.com and tribes.wikia.com for class guides and other information and check out playapug.com for finding pick-up games (organized, but casual games).

Tribes takes a minute to get used to, but once you get down the basics of skiing, you end up having a blast. And it only takes a few rounds to get used to the physics. Tribes is one of those hidden gems, highly underrated. And there is nothing like the feeling of capping the flag at 250+ kph. Truly spectacular.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is probably the most fun you can have with online multiplayer. It's consistently fast paced and furious, with players zipping around on jetpacks and various destructive vehicles such as hoverbikes, tanks, and fighter aircraft. There's a wide range of classes with different roles and functions, heaps of weapons, and enough maps and game modes to keep the action fresh and interesting. If you're a fan of online multiplayer and you haven't checked this game out yet, you are letting yourself down. It's free to play, so you've got no excuse. Seriously, stop reading this and download the damn game!			"

												Legendary Quake-alike action shooter with great movement freedom. Ski like a wind with speed over 200 m/h or fly up the sky with your jetpack. And in the same time make your enemy regret that they were born. A lot of futuristic weapons give you a opportunity to live through a great fight. No more easy kills. No more lame matches in which you fell asleep. Your skill is everything here. Predict your enemies moves and make him pay for betrayal. Defend bases, flags, points. Destroy enemy lines, steal their flag, kill them. You choose who you want to be. 9 different classes. All unique. All deadly. And all ready for a fight. Easy lvl-up system ensures your fast grow. A lot of psychos that will be your ally our your prey. Say goodbye to realistic and boring FPS and relax in a First Class futuristic action shooter.			"

												It just hasn't been the same since Tribes 2. Ascend has been really dumbed down. No more painting mortar shots for teammates. Only 3 vehicles. Weird classes (multiple classes in each ""weight class"") that can be further customized with gold. Gold can be purchased and XP can be used to unlock most things (some things like servers can only be rented with gold) but you will need 100,000 XP for most weapons making it impractical to earn. If you really want to play Ascend you will have to pay at some point. Decent attempt at bringing back the classic Tribes - it's not the same though!Update (12/19/14): They have released a GOTY edition/DLC that has all the unlocks. That is the only thing worth paying for - and only if on sale for $19.99. I would check to see how many servers are alive first though.			"

												This game is past its prime, due to HiRez stopping support, and a dropoff of the playerbase, but over all, its still interesting, and worth checking out.  Its got an interesting mobility system, unique and interesting classes with their own unique pros and cons, and a lot of guns that just fel good to use. I'm not much of a first person shooter person myself, but if i had to describe it simply... Its like a first person arena version of warframe with a cool momentum movement system.			"

												Incredibly fun, and with the new update it revamps the class system to be more like the previous entries in the series, doing away with the class system and instead adding customizable loadouts you can change up with each of the three armor types, Heavy, Medium, and Light. Nothing feels better than a Tribes game, the mechanics really have not been replicated by any of other series i can think of and it stays unique to this day. Skiing and the twitch combat coupled with the massive enviroments makes for just a really ♥♥♥♥ing good time in terms of gameplay.			"

												   The sense of achievement and closure for theoretical physics that came with the brilliant success of the classical field theory of electromagnetism was short lived. The new technology invented out of the mathematical unification of electricity with magnetism produced copious data about the nature of matter and light that snapped all of the mathematical threads that physicists had just succeeded in tying down.   And after this new data was unraveled and understood and explained using mathematics, the unified worldview of classical theoretical physics became split into two very different views of the universe -- the particle view and the geometric view.Particles and waves   The first sign of trouble was when J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897. Experimentalists began to see data that suggested a model of the atom with negatively charged particles orbiting around a positively charged core. But according to Maxwell's equations, such a system should be physically unstable			"

Imagine having to play an old fps game such as quake, and at the same time you have to keep an eye on the topography of the map so you can ski to gain enough momentum to escape your enemies.  There are so many different fun ways to play this game.

												This is my second favorite shooter of all time. The high speed of the players, combined with all the weapons having travel time, makes for some very difficult shots. The adrenaline rush of this game is very exciting, and the satisfaction of pulling off that impossible shot is rewarding. The graphics are beautiful, with Ultra settings rivaling top names graphics. On lowest settings, an AMD A8 mobile APU can run it with ease. The gamplay is very good, as i mentioned before. There are several classes, including assault rifle, sniper, and several other classics, along with unique classes. The classes are customizable to a certain degree. This multiplayer in this game is great, and I'm not experiencing any lag at all.A lot of people are saying this game is dead, but that's the farthest thing from the truth. There's still a small community of us who still play and enjoy this game. Yes if it were opened up by the developers or the P2W features were removed it would be way better but this game is still incredibly enjoyable as-is. Definitely recommend this title.			"

												Tribes Ascend is one of my all time favorite games. It may have all the evils of a FTP but it is still an excellent game. Few things can match up to the feeling of a high speed flag grab, or the satisfaction of a blue plate special. The weapons have enough variety to give everyone something to suit their playstyle, and each holds its own key to mastery. Though not as flexible as mumble or teamspeak, the in game quick-chat system works well to connect players together. The games classes are all unique and fun and give a great variety of ways to play. No class has ever been OP it has always been the weapons. From the thumper to the faze rifles to the MIRV, there has always been a weapon that HiRez has milked for cash; This is the primary source of frustration in the game. The game has strategy speed and skill requirements of any good shooter and though difficult to aproach can quickly become a favorite. I personally do not own the GOTY edition so I am not sure if it levels the playing feild or effects matches that much. Tribes Ascend: Even with its shortcomings and faults is an amazing game and I hope to see a sequel in the near future.			"

												Tribes: Ascend is an excellent game. Though i don't play it much, the mechanics are really good on the way you soar through the air and ski as if the floor is ice. The creative ranking system and weapon unlocks make the game more achievable as you feel the sensation of the game.10/10 would play again. Thanks Hi - Rez			"

												This game was great when I used to play it many years ago. The game itself provided such a unique experience. I am currently reinstalling it to see if the reviews are true that it no longer works. If it does not work, I'll have to change this to a thumbs down.-Edit: So, I just tested it out and had a lot of issues with it. While trying to log in, it said that it didn't have connection to the server. After trying about 20 more time, I was allowed to log in. All of my unlocks were gone, but i had a ton of experience to use to unlock things. I decided to try to explore a map by myself to refamiliarize myself with the controls before trying to get into a real match. While trying to figure out how the loadout stuff works now, I ""lost connection"" with the sever. Again. The odd thing was that after it kicked me back to the log in screen, it advertised that I could buy some sort of pack that would give me double experience. Wow. I have a feeling that this was not simply ""losing conneciton"". After trying to log in 30 or 40 more times I gave up. Every time that I did iit said that it did not have connection with the server.Sadly this game will probably never recover from this... Anyway, Because of my recent experience I have to downvote it.			"

												I can't say if it's better or worse than the metric on which all class-based multiplayer FPSs must be based, TF2. It's a different creature. What makes TF2 great (besides the solid gunplay and hilarious...everything) is the balanced, nuanced interplay between classes, playing to their strengths and weaknesses. What makes this game great (besides the solid gunplay) is the amazing movement system, which lends a ballet-like surreal quality to everything you do.  It's hard to ski down the slope you spawned on, then alternate between skis and jetpack all the way to the center, never dipping below 80 mph (and maybe shooting someone if you find time), but when you do, there's nothing else like it. In most games, I usually play a mid-to-long range explosive projectile person (in the American Revolution, for instance, I'd operate a cannon, and bazookas are a man's best friend), unless the core gameplay suggests something different. Tribes is like that. No way in hell I'm choosing anything other than the Pathfinder class.			"

												A shooter reminescent of older Arena shooters like Unreal Tourney or Quake, mixed with a class based shooter like TF2, Dirty Bomb, or Overwatch, all tied together with a delicious, adrenaline lined, and frenetic obsession with speed and flag capping. If you like the team oriented action of games like TF2 and Dirty Bomb, and you also like the speed of sonic the hedgehogs, and if you seriously miss older style shooters like UT or Quake, this game is a great way to scratch that itch in a time when those kinds of games are harder to find. Just be warned, the learning curve is very much there; learning to either lead a shot on a Spinfuzor or a Sniper Rifle, or learning how to Jetpack and Ski to effectively capture a flag will take a while to work out if you don't feel confident in you're own abilities. But Bottom line, this is a shooter that feels like it has the grit, backbone, and level of respect belonging to older shooters, while mixed with the technical wizardry, accessibility, and just straight-up fun of more modern shooters.

Its not worth your time. Developers copletely ♥♥♥♥ on it in players faces. If you are looking for extremely similar game, wait untill Midair is realesed. On top of that, the company started working on this game not too long ago, as soon as Midair got some pre-alpha footage.Coincidence? I think not. It just shows how big of an giant tick this company is, trying to get money no matter what. I've played ~700 hours. It was worth it, but not anymore. In fact, I would have probably played this game more if devs did not continue to work on it. Now I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.

												An Honest review...While I have so far reasonably enjoyed this game, it still has flaws that I want to point out. They aren't too game changing but it pulls me away from saying this game is brilliant. This is just my honest review and it is certainly no hate to the game, I still recommend it.I admire the creativity. I really enjoy skiing, though the original control layout is a little odd. This made me relize that this wasn't just a Halo emulator. I'm not too much of a fan of the jetpack but I think that'll just take getting used to or I just don't like jetpacks at all since I hardly ever use them in Halo Reach and Halo 4 either.The game plays like a good FPS, far better than the quality of the CoD series but it isn't quite up their with my favourite FPS' like Halo and Half-Life but hey it is free.So now I am on to the negatives. I'm sorry fan boys but I want to be honest here. Firstly I personally wouldn't say it quite meets up to the fast gameplay.Yes you can reach high speeds while skiing but even times like that are limited. You probably travel a lot faster in this than in other FPS' but it isn't displayed in a fast paced fashion so you don't feel it. Half-Life feels faster, TF2 feels faster and those games don't advertise their games as fast.That isn't too game changing but it wasn't what I thought it would be. The gameplay just isn't good as the ""reviews"" say so. It is still fun but I don't like the spaced out approach they used for a ""fast paced"" game.Also you need almost sniper precision when using an assault rifle... BUT HEY!The game is free and reasonably fun, how can you go wrong? "

												I would like to start this by saying that the game isn't bad in regards to controls/graphics/stability, but this games multiplayer (literally all there is aside from training) is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. If you are okay with playing a game with a steep learning curve, against players you realistically shouldn't be gaming against as a new player, and people that honestly have such a high level of skill it is atrocious they were matched against you? Feel free to download this game, and play it to your hearts content cause that is what you will get.Tribes: Ascend doesn't have an intelligent matchmaking system, it matches anyone against anyones, and doesn't really have a way of matching new players against new players cause FOR SOME REASON no one thought of doing that. Each time I have played this game, which is far more than my steam profile is probably going to display, I have gone up against people that are FAR beyond the skill level of my fellow new players.Despite the fact I have tried to take the time to learn this game, oh lord have I put in the effort to master it, it is realistically impossible for me to do so under the stress of playing against people FAR beyond my skill level, especially when it tends to be an entire team of skilled players. The only way I would EVER go back to this game is if they put in place a system, which a lot of multiplayer games have in recent times, that places you against people at your own levels while restricting people of a higher skill level. They could even add in rewards for people as they go up in the ranks, into higher 'tiers' of skill, and also give an incentive for not making a new account to bypass the tiered matchmaking. Until they do something like that, which I doubt they will since this game doesn't seem to have seen an update in a while, I am never going to install it again.TLDR: Matchmaking puts you against people far beyond your skill level, this game honestly sucks entirely for that reason, and I would only come back if they had a system in place that put you against people at your own level.

												I only recommend this game to people who have computers that run games very well. This game is really fun and long gameplay span. Controls are easy to remember but hard to learn. I also reccomend this to people who like good long paced, fun, FPS shooters. I really like the amount of choice u can have in the game. I think you have 9 classes and over 100 guns to choose from. I love this game and i think you should try it out.			"

												Hirez has shown they are capable of being a very good company. A year ago if you asked any tribes player that a full update would take place with class changes, weapon and class balancing, new maps and new weapons you would have been seen as crazy. The new update is by no means perfect but is one well done.This game is very much worth it especially to new players. Despite its steep learning curve the community is well accepting of newbloods (new players) and offer multiple mumble servers in many that allow players to learn the ropes and take part in more competitive play.

												If you're looking for a game that isn't bland, go find something else. Having played for only a few hours I pretty much beat all  the features, quests and got a few achievments. Basically, you just spawn in an arena, and you surive.Everyone just uses the same gun. The only thing interesting about the game was sliding and leading shots with a plasma rifle. There are 3 main classes, and other than the sliding, there isn't much to do except just slide around the map looking for noobs. A below-decent game with little to do. Unless you plan on paying, which yields you only a few items which you can toy around with.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game is really fun, its a nice new takes on fps games, its fun. But theres some problems that I just can't look past. The Thumper is rediculously overpowered. It isn't even funny, noobs come inwith a weapon that can decimate a vetern squad. It's sad.The spinfuser isnt much better, but atleast you have to aim to a certain extent. The vehicles arent nearly as awesome as Id expect them to be. I can take a tank down no problem as a juggernaut, and its so damn expensive. Shrikes   aren't any better. Grav cycles aren't terrible, they're cheap, go fast, and do plenty of pewpews, but they might as well be made from wet paper. Generator room camping is quite the problem, Ive had it where 3-4 people fly into my gen room, and hold it for the entire round, crippling my teams ability to attack/defend. The issue here is that theres too much cover inside of the generator room, the enemy can use it just as well as allies. Of course, it's been a good year since I've played this, and if its changed, I'll go ahead and update this.			"

												Review time!I will preface by saying that I have played this since beta and I am a huge fan of Tribes. And just because I want to have more people to shoot at, I'm going to recommend this game. I will go into flaws though and what some players who haven't tried this yet may want to keep in mind.Tribes Ascend is a weird tiny beasty... It is a solid game overall, but frankly, HiRez dropped the ball pretty badly. They stopped development on this game completely. They did this in order to pour all resources on Smite, and despite doing something so ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" to a rather unique game that only needed a tiny bit of love they also ignored the cries to let the community mod the game. So this means that the main reason the older Tribes games are still around is totally non-existant here. There are no new maps, no new waepons and definitely no new updates coming.What this means for new players is that they are pretty much getting a ""complete"" game, whether the game itself is complete or not. This is not too bad, to be honest. I can't quite say that it is balanced, when it comes to weapons, and you will most certainly get wrecked by players who played this game longer but I think that is the charm. There are no totally overpowered weapons (even though the sniper rifles and some other weapons can get really annoying) and this is mostly down to how the weapons work. It takes time to get good enough with a weapon to even hit players. It takes even longer to get a Blueplate with a spinfusor (hitting a person in the air with a spinfusor weapon) or just hitting people with the automatic rifles. For me that's what the charm of the game is, there's a lot to do with how good you are at it.Another thing to note is that this game is all about teamwork, you need people to defend your base, some to attack and disrupt the enemy defence, cappers to get the flag and chasers to chase the enemy flag carrier. Ofcourse, this is the optimal setup and doesn't always come into play on pub servers, but sometimes it does. And this is another charm of the game itself, if you are bad at shooting at people, then maybe try your hand at capping the flag. Or if you can't ski that great, can try vehicles or being a juggernaught bombaring the enemy base from far away.All that is all good and well, but the fact that the game is ""dead"" for the developer is a huge blow. And while I would recommend this to any player who wants a fast, skill-based shooter, I would also say that you might get pretty bored because there's no chance of anything new added or any of the totally crappy maps being changed for the better.

												First of all, let me say something, this game is BEYOND fast paced. The game has a rather unique princible of the ""Frictionless suit"" Using the suit you have to keep up momentum, or be a sitting duck, it also has a rather steep learning curve in regard to constantly having to head your target and maintaining a constant grasp of where you are in the map and what you have to do, making this game a MUST TRY! The game has dazzling graphics, an intense playstyle and an active community. BE PATIENT WITH THIS GAME! This is not a game you just pick up and play, take the time to learn it! 9.5/10			"

												This is a great free to play game, its very fun and bug free. I do have a few problems.1: VERY VERY VERY steep learning curve. The movment is very fast and all weapons have a projectile speed. You will have to master your predictions of your projectiles to get a good shot.2: Slow progress. Leveling up is slow and hard. A game usually lasts 20 minutes to complete and usually dosent give you much experience.3: It requires a HiRez account to play and that always takes time to get started.But other than that I do recemend trying this. Also your starting items are very good and are mostly meta so you will not be out guned.			"

												This may be free to play, but that dosent mean its a bad game, i am sure it would have sold well as a full price title as well.If you like FAST shooters, like Quake or the original Tribes, this is for you.If you like to have a competitive enviroment in your gaming and dont want to play something that is ""easy"", give this a try, its challenging to master (not that i would ever be able to master it).The classes are uniqe in their roles on the battlefield and all have a purpouse.The gold you can buy & the ingame shop are unintrusive and it is NOT PAY TO WIN.The leveling up mechanics are overall okay, sure there is grind, but that also keeps you playing as well.Overall its not only free but also fun to play, so give it a try =)			"

												ive had a weird relationship with this game. over the years ive played it on and off all the time, and let me say this i liked it always, however i never really got good at playing it. so i never really was able to compete with the really good players on a skill based level, however what that ment for me was just that instead of outplaying them i had to outsmart them which was defenitly not impossible, so in the end do i recommend this game? even with all the long time players that will borderline murder you in the 10+ servers? yes. but only under one condition: You have to have a friend that plays this game and who is good at it, so you can play together. trust me this will make your expierience soooooo much better even when playing against long time players.

												This game is like, just, I,So like, you're going REALLY FAST and then you're all like PEW PEW with an exploding laser but you shoot it RIGHT UNDER YOU so it explodes and launches you so your go EVEN FASTER, and then you try to shoot someone, but they're also going SUPER FAST but in a different direction and you can barely see them because people go so fast they're actually measured in SANICS unfortunately, like, 1/3 of the classes are not built purely for going fast, and it really messes with the game. Also sometimes there are flags and teams  and deathmatches. Still, I highly recomend it. If you spawn a tank on top of another tank, it does a backflip, so that's pretty cool.

												The game itself is very solid and ans some amazing mechanics. The skiing and combat is fast paced and action packed. The main problems lie in the learning curve and the cheaters. T:A offers a tutorial area and guides to get you started, but really you should just play to see what works for you. If you want to do something faster or better, there are YouTube videos of how to do it. Hackers. They're not maggot-infested in the servers but they are a reality. Kicking people is very hard because 80% of the players in-game must agree, and no more than 2 people can vote no. Hi-Rez has 100% completely abandoned this game to work on Smite. There is no longer any form of tech support or patch fixing etc.  If you can work through the learning curve, and find games without hackers, then it's a solid game for those with the patience to play it. However, you're looking for a fun new fps to get into, look away. This one comes with a lot of early game stress and frustration.The F2P model is pretty good, everything in game can be purchased with in-game credits. Premium currency can buy the same weapons and upgrades, but these are balanced and not game-breaking. Everything in this game has a counter to it.			"

Hi-Rez took over the development, having never made a first person shooter before, and turned a unique shooter style into a bad Halo/CoD mix, with jet packs. Pay to Win is ridiculous, with guns taking twenty or thirty hours to ""purchase"" with in game currency.

I tried even using the snipers because I love sniping. The one sniper I had took away my fuel to do damage. SO I could barely escape from fights. ALSO it has no AOE dmg in a game where everyone is a ♥♥♥♥ing sonic clone and goes fast as hell. I don't want to be a bandwagon and follow everyone using the op weapons, but if you want to progress, that's your choice.

												I believe that tribes ascend is a wonderful game. I've tested it on an old laptop with a i5 3210m CPU with Intel HD 4000 graphics and found myself playing the game at around 30fps, with some drops to around 20fps on the odd occasion and on medium graphical settings. This shows the game has been well optimised for lower end computers and can be playable for many people who own either a high or low end PC or laptop.I like the fast paced game movement style, really gets me tired of the normal walking speed on games like battlefield, COD and other first person shooters that are similer. I like the variety of classes and weapons and although you can pay to claim weapons at an early stage, I think that earning them gives you proudness over what you have achieved. I highly recommend this game to all that enjoy zipping around and blasting men in metal suits out of the sky above you and think that although this game has been around for a long time, it still claims a place in the best PC games out there.

												WARNING: DO NOT JUDGE THIS REVIEW BASED ON HOW MANY HOURS I HAVE, I DOWNLOADED THE DRM FREE VERSION LONG BEFORE I FOUND TRIBES ON STEAM. I've played this game for the longest time, making it one of the first pc games I've ever played since joining Steam. It provides a fast paced combat system, only alloting for quick reflexes and a sharp mind. Due to that, for beginners, especially now, the learning curve can be quite steep but it is well worth it. The graphics are pretty good for a f2p game, however a few graphical glitches can occur on certain video cards that may as well break the game, however it is nothing a little bit of tweaking cant fix. The soundtrack isn't the best I've ever listened to, put it puts a nice tempo into the game. However, it requires alot of concentration, so it is not for those looking for a fun casual game; making playing with friends very tedious. Overall, its a good game that shouldn't be missed or traded in for something like SMITE >:S. Stupid devs.			"

												In a nuttshell.If you like tactical shooters, this is not for you. It may be advertised as such, but the game seems to abandon tactics and just shoves pepper up every a-hole. Your biggest 'skill set' in this game is the lack of ability of your oponent to track you properly.If you feel like frantic rushes and spray and pray type of gameplay, this is your thing.			"

												I have got to say as an original starsiege triber when this game first came out I was pretty pyched for the series getting a redemption after the fiasco of tribes 3.  As updates came pouring in the game kept getting worse and I simply started thinking of it as Call of Duty: Tribes.  The recent patch though has put it all back to the original starsiege and tribes 2 type play.  I gotta say kudos first off for admitting to the mistake of the direction the game went, and even bigger for fixing it and making it far more inline with starsiege and tribes universe overall.  Thank you.  Now all I need is a poop pack mod to add funky music and sound bits everywhere lol.			"

												What if I told you there was a game that had a unique travel mechanic called skiing and team based battle matches? Well, this is it. Ascend is definitely for those who want to play Multiplayer.  With it being free-to-play the microtransactions can cause pay to win problems. The game is definitly more fun with friends.  Pros:  Decient Multiplayer Experience  Decient number of Classes/Perks  Character/class EXP persistance between matches  Weapon Upgradability  FREE-ish (Ingame microtransactions)  Fast adrenaline pumping action via unique skiing-mechanic  Arena maps with different game modes (CTF, Team death match, etc)Cons:  No SinglePlayer (No Offline, minimun free account required)  Pay to Win (Unless you're good enough)  Things bought with ingame currency is WAY to expensive vs the real money alternativeFinal Suggestion:  Try it out!!

												Honestly, I'm not completely sure why people are calling this game an abandoned project. Sure, the devs may have quit periodically updating the game, but to be honest, there arren't really any updates needed. This game was good-to-go the second it hit the market. So if you complete something and then not change it, are you really abandoning it? (I'm not meaning to get deep there. :p)As far as servers go, don't think for a second that that there are none. There are LOADS! On top of that, there are different types of servers for every gamemode. You have your Official Servers and your Community Servers. The Officials are pretty straight forward, they're what you'd expect an Official Server to be like. The Community Servers on the other hand are a whole nother story. Some are normal, but others have crazy modifications, like free vehicles, and Orbital Strikes that only cost 1 Credit (You get about 2-500 per kill).Not that it needs to be said, because it should be painfully obvious to anybody even looking at the previews for it, but this game is amazing. On top of that, IT'S FREE!!! I don't see how anybody can complain about a game that is this beautifull and free. If you download this game, I promise, it will slowly begin to consume all of your online life. The adrenaline rush you get in your body as you take the enemy flag while you're flying at 300 km/h is shocking. You'll simply feel your heartbeat in every part of your body. That feeling alone should be enought to make anybody get this game. Even though I only have about 70-80 hours in on this game, they have been the best hours of any game I've ever played. If I had to give an example of a similar game, it would be a combination of Halo (I know, this doesn't come close, but just the look of it reminds me of Reach), and Call of Duty (Yuck) or Battlefield (Better). The shear fast pacing in this game will make anybody want to play it for hours on end.Thanks for reading, and I really hope you at least TRY the game. I mean, it's free. If you don't like it, just delete it. At least all your friends that will still be playing it can't say you didn't try it.			"

												Although the ""skiing"" system is original and quite interesting, a lack of better class equality and much better graphics (because the graphics of this game are of cube 2 level, and that's a bit of a shame for a new PC game), coupled with a few bugs and annoying glitches like the fact that spawn points are completely random it seems... All in all, you can try this game if you want, well it's free after all, but in my opinion, if you want a really good free FPS game, go play Planetside 2 which is on a completely other level. (well it's not really the same budget to start with).My final rating is 4/10, because it's not because a game is free that anything goes, even if there are some original points and ideas included in the package, I don't consider it to be enough to get more than that rating.
