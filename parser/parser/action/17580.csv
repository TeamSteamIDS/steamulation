												ATTENTION ALL NEW PLAYERS: Due to a new SDK, Dystopia will crash when you attempt to join a new server. To fix this, go to your library, right-click on Dystopia, and go to Properties. Once there, click on the Betas tab. In there you should see a drop-down menu asking you which beta you would like to opt into. Click on it and select ""Previous - The previous release"". This is the only way to play Dystopia for now. An update fixing this issue is in the works. Please be patient everyone.			"

												Ok, this game is UNIQUE, unlike you or snowflakes. Nothing plays like this game. It's objective based and takes place in 2 dimensions. In the physical world, you get all sorts of very cool futuristic weaponry and abilities like radars, sonars, invisibility, medical implants, heat-vision, etc. You can throw spidernades, direct rockets in your enemie's face, rocketfist their ♥♥♥, mow them down, desintegrate, electrify, bomb, chop them down as a bunnyhoppin cyberninja, whatever! And you can hack into the virtual world where you rocket jump, run like sonic and get into wall-running MLG-pro psychedelic laserfights.Everything is fine-tuned, there is voice commands, the weapons are a pleasure to use and the way the mod plays is simply beautiful. Also, the music is pretty boss. It makes all the cyberman-shooting look cool.			"

												It may come as a surprise to see that I have, I believe, no hours in Dystopia. Yet, I'm writing a review for it. This is because I played the old version of Dystopia, before it had a store page. Dystopia is an incredibly important game to me, in that it is the game that got me to play PC games. Before Dystopia, I didn't know that PC was really a gaming platform. I remember being at my Mom's boyfriend's house, and hanging out with his child (who was almost twice my age) and watching him play it. I was blown away by the futuristic look of everything, and all the little secrets he knew about in the community-made levels. Not to mention, watching him hack whilst in cyberspace just seemed incredible to the eight or nine year old me. So, I wanted to play it. So I got Steam. But I couldn't play it, because it wasn't a stand-alone game. It was a mod. So I needed Half-Life 2. But I couldn't run Half-Life 2, and by proxy Dystopia, because my PC was trash at the time. Finally, I obtained a PC that I could play Dystopia on, and... it was dead. Hardly anyone played it. The game had died by the time I was finally able to get around to playing it. So there I was, 11 or so years old, unable to properly play the game I had up until then so longed to play and I thought to myself, ""Well... I guess I could try out this Half-Life 2 game. Maybe it will be alright. The guy on the cover looks like a nerd though...""So that's why Dystopia is important to me. Not only did it get me to start playing PC games in general, but it got me to start playing PC games on what is perhaps the greatest game of all time. So, even if it's still dead, I have to thank it for that. And maybe, just maybe, some day it will be revived and I'll be able to -really- play the game.			"

												When I browse around for a game or mod with this type of setting (sci-fi, cyber punk, future fantasy), i see so many games that look pretty with hyper-stylized artwork. The character models seems to be a mash up of every sci fi flick + anime/manga ever made. They come complete with a trailer that was cut and directed by/for an audience with a mental maturity level that never advanced beyond grade school. I am impressed by their focus but I have been repeatedly disappointed by such lack of effort when it comes to game play. I present to you Dystopia, a diamond of a game hidden in the endless sea of mediocrity. This game is OLD, however, it hasa aged quite well. Developed many years ago for the original source engine, and has since been updated to the more current engine.It is hard to ask for more depth in Dystopia's game play. A Wonderful mixture of intense combat and teambased strategy. Pick your class of combatant and fight in meatspace (physical world) with a powerful and diversified arsenal. Modify your current loadout with balanced system of cybernetic implants that can give you huge bursts of speed and jump height, or give you predator-style optical stealth camoflauge, or thermal vision to track heat signatures of stealthed enemies, or.. the Cyberdeck implant.The Cyberdeck implant is the real game changer. Not only do you fight in the physical ""Meatspace"", the cyberdeck implant allows the user to ""Deck"" in to Cyberspace of a terminal that gains access to something in the Meatspace such as thermal turrents (see what i did there?), control power or unlock doors and paths to certain objectives, enable a fusion ray to vaporize enemies in its path, or even launch a nuke to end the game.Cyberdeck users dont have it easy though, because if you can deck in, so can the enemy. Combat your enemy even in Cyberspace over the controll of the terminal, and Cybercombat is a whole different ball game..So much depth, so many variables, so many scenarios each map presents. This game is ripe for eSport, as the community hosted its own Dystopia Global League (DGL) many years ago, only to fall due to lack of exposure and player base. The developers and the core community is quite small but extremely loyal and supportive. I am proud to be one of those that has contributed to the development of the game (albeit just a small monitary contribution).I wish this recommendation entices you to try Dystopia. You will definitely enjoy it as I have for nearly 8 years now.			"

												When Dystopia came out in 2005 as a mod for the then brand-spankin'-new Half-Life 2, the screen shots looked cool enough that I decided to use a gigantic chunk of my internet's monthly download limit (gg, Aussie internet) to give it a try.What followed absolutely set my personal bench mark for online FPS games for the next decade. It may be just a mod, and it may have been released by a small team- but make no mistake. 10 years later, there hasn't been a single multiplayer game released that even comes remotely close to touching Dystopia in terms of how good it is. Halo and CoD with their multi-million dollar budgets? Get that ♥♥♥♥ out of here. It's not even on the same planet, and I say that as a player of both. That this mod died out never having recieved the attention it deserved is one of gaming's biggest unknown tragedies. The split objective system which sees each team attempting to take objectives in both the real world and the cyber world requires a level of coordination and teamwork that no FPS has even attempted to recreate since. You can dominate on the field as much as you want, blasting the other team to kingdom come as soon as they respawn- but unless you have a guy in cyberspace that knows what he's doing to get those doors open for you, you aren't going anywhere near the objective, sorry. The thrill of successfully sneaking behind enemy lines to find a hacking terminal that you can use to quickly unlock an unwatched backdoor or call an elevator to let in your friends with the big guns is a huge rush. The class system lets you choose from a standard 3-class list (light, medium, heavy) each with it's own possible loadouts. Maybe you'll be a light cloaked stealth guy with hacking gear. Maybe you'll be a walking behemoth with a rocket launcher on one arm and a pneumatic fist to punch people's heads off on the other. The weapons are balanced nicely and there's no 'perfect' loadout that trumps them all, it's just important to have the right one at the right time. Dystopia remains to this day the only game I would unflinchingly give a 10/10. Download it. Tell your friends. Bring it back.			"

												I seriously need to start playing this again.. hell, we all do.I helped test this and was a huge part in building the competitive community by founding the first league.I built 3rd party maps (Dys_Parallax and Dys_Well) and spent hours upon hours hanging out in IRC.Why did I do this? Because games like this only come along once in a blue moon and this was one of the best communities that I've ever had the honour of being a part of.. yeah it had a steep learning curve and the community became a tad elitist over the years, but it still remains one of my fondest gaming memories of all time.Now would somebody please start working on a Dystopia 2.0? :)			"

												Maybe, quite maybe the best game I have ever played. the game is very diverse with multiple different paths into a fight or down the map, you can choose to do anything you want in this game. the teamwork dynamics in this game are outstanding if you and small group of tight players can hold a large group of players back for several minutes and completely disrupt their flow and do the opposite when attacking albeit much harder since they have strength in numbers but nonetheless it is still possible. Case in point... Pipe Smokin Yeti's made the impossible possible with this game, holding objectives for 20 minutes, single players holding and killing all or 4/5ths of the team and weakening the last few. then we go into the weapons! like most futuristic games theres always some ""weird"" guns but they are awesome, an Electric ""flamethrower"" where you can charge a plasma like ball and litterally whip it around corners and the ""Smartlock"" pistols that shoot a tracer round and locks the pistol to that target and with 2 guns you can hit 2 contacts at once. I could continue but its best if you just try this game before it is lost to the ages of ""MODS"" still cannot believe it isnt in the free to play section. Sadly this game is dying and most likely wont see the light of day again or see the thousands of players engaging in cyber combat again. "

												Dystopia is the best source mod ever made.It is a high-skill caped game which requires both teamplay and tactical awareness.The 16 different primary weapons provide a fresh experience which sets the game ahead from other tactical shooters with standard gunplay , e.g. Counter-Strike. The official maps are very unique and can provide thousand of hours of fun.There are also a lot of custom map which bring variety and new concepts. Since neither the developers nor the custom map makers did suffer from any boundaries set by the marketing department to their creativity, the results are simply awesome.This game is insanely fun and challenging on public servers, but also works as great in 5 vs 5 clan matches.

												It doesn't get any better than this.Each map is unique in its setting and objective concept (the cyberpunk theme of the game is greatly enhanced by excellent skybox's and background noise that draws you into the level). They require good team co-ordination in order to win. Especially since aspects of the objectives take place in 2 parallel worlds that affect each other in real time [Meatspace - physical world: similar to most fps with a cyperpunk theme (weapons like laser rifle, tesla rifle, ion cannon), 3 class types (v.balanced) and deus ex like implants, inc increased speed, thermal vision, medic, stealth(invisi). Cyberspace - think system shock 1 or tripping on acid: req decking implant; deckers speed thru cyberspace hacking objectives, adding security and fighting off enemy deckers in low grav/high speed combat using in essence quake railgun, lightening gun and rocket launcher.]The game does have a high learning curve, there are game guides on the community hub: http://steamcommunity.com/app/17580    If you have questions when your in game most players will answer them, generally speaking the community is pretty friendly.If you find that you keep going on and servers are empty recommend you join this group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dyspugs   Matches are organised and announced through this and sometimes when public games are going on there is also an announcement to indicate a server is populated.This game last had a major update at the end of 2013.Get this game! its free and when balanced and people play as a team it can be extremely exhilarating far more so than most generic fps' I have played.

												I started playing this game in 2006, and stopped a few years ago so this review is maybe a bit dated. I've played a lot of games like most of you so I have some reference. This was the most fun I've ever had in a FPS, let alone game, ever. I can't even think of a game that was more fun than Dystopia beta U4-U5 or comes even close. Before steam started tracking play time, I must of had at least 500 hours in this game. I tried explaining to someone how fun this game was a few days ago but it was just lost on them. As previous reviewers have stated there were certain elements to the game that made it so fun like sneaking into enemy base and backdoor hacking to turn the turrets on the other team. Or trying to sneak in while invisible to press first objective switch in vaccine. It was just so thrilling. This game required team work to win but was niche enough to have a great community of players who knew what they were doing since this was back in the day before mods were so streamlined though steam. Which ment that it was a 10 v 10 of players who knew each other and knew how to play the game which made for really fun games. The maps were very well designed too (I played vaccine for 6 months as the only map in the mod at the time).Even the weapons and body mods were unique and fun. The laser rifle required you to hold it down to charge it and release when you wanted to shoot which made it really balanced, Same thing with the other weapons, they were really gratifying. For a mod in 2006 that had invisiblity, thermal vision, healing, leg jumpers, etc made by a random devteam, the whole game seemed very balanced within the first 2 updates, given the amount of upgrade and weapon variations.  I'm probably just rambling on in this review because I really can't pinpoint what made this game so great. There's a hundred games like it but still nothing that comes near it. Maybe it's just nostalgia about a simpler time with games but I hope not because that would mean that I will never have as much fun as I did back in 2007 playing video games. I'm downloading it now. I don't think so sista			"

Now you may be full of rage thinking: ""Peter! it's ♥♥♥♥ing Half-Life! how dare you speak words of heresy against our all mighty internet god Gaben!"" guys, I love HL like everyone else, but if you are subscribed to the Source engine group on Steam look at the long ♥♥♥ list of Half-Life: 2 ""mods"" I'm tired of it.  It's like Halo, I'm sorta Halo'ed out ever since H4 and in my personal opinion it sucked. So now that I am done lighting the internet on fire. What is Dystopia? it is a small free to play class based game set in a cyber punk future. You can join two factions: Punks, VS Corps  in other words the classic Red VS Blue  But this time it's a bit different. Now you can choose implants that will boost your abilities in combat or hack(deck) computer terminals on the map supporting your fellow soldiers virtually without getting messy in reality.  they call it ""decking"" in this game, and Starwars calls it ""slicing"" it's all the same thing anyway so who cares?  Hacking: there is a slight difference between Dystopia's hacking and other game's hacking. Hacking in games generally result in being a little mini-game  take Dead Space or Mass Effect's hacking for example  you instead enter what is called ""Cyber-space"" while in this instance you fly around tunnels getting from place to place looking for the enemy's security controls. If you have played System Shock: 1 it look's a lot like that minus the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls of SS:1. But there are two things you must worry about while in Cyber-space: the enemy team's hacker, or the enemy team all together back in Meat-space. Your body in reality is completely defenseless so make sure you have your team covering you while you hack. You should also watch out for enemy players within Cyber-space defending/attacking the objective.Implants: you're probably thinking ""F2P+implants=P2W business model!"" this game is 100% free. And before you ask, yes, implants are surprisingly well balanced  something other games can't seem to pull off yet this under played F2P game on Source is able to...Hmm, perhaps it's time to look at your game's balancing system eh?  When you first enter the game you will be given a step by step menu, for instance: Choose your faction, now choose your class, select your weapon of choice, now pick out which implants you want. You can select a number of implants depending on how many points you spend this can also be changed at any point within the match.Classes: there are a total of 3 very simple classes all three can be customized with implants and weapons. Starting with the Light: fast, heavy hitting, can't take ♥♥♥♥. The class makes a good medic if you installed the healing implant or a decker since he can get in and out of situations easily assuming you installed the decking implant along with stealth. As for his weapons the shotgun and the melee weapon is all you need since both of those weapons are incredibly strong  it's been debated if the melee weapons within Dystopia are ""OP"" since they can wipe out all three classes with few problems other than range situations  Medium: the medium armored class is slow (but definitely faster than the heavy) and useful for defensive/offensive situations. In other words he's an adaptable class. Equiped with a selection of weapons such as the Grenade launcher, Assault Rifle, Scout Rifle, and that shocky...Orby thing I can't remember the name of....It's useful when dealing with heavies, that's all you need to know (don't judge me bro!)Heavy: the heavy class serves as a tank, soaking up damage for the other two classes while dishing out massive blows of destruction at the same time. It's only flaws are lack of speed and no hands  ""I have no hands, yet I must fap"" -DrCat 2015  the heavy cannot deck like the other two classes making him primerally a defense class. He has the option to only choose 3-4 implants (depending on what you installed) and his weapons of mass destruction are: the chaingun, the rocket launcher, the rail gun and the shotgun/grenade launcher claw of robo fapping.Final verdict: And that's pretty much it! my only gripes with this game is: no player model customization, lack of weapons, (because there just needs to be MORE GUN!!!) and the sad limit of only a couple maps. However it's well balanced, has a nice funny community and it's just generally fun with anybody. You will of course meet some dumbass kids along the way  god knows I've been accused of somehow ""aimbotting"" or switching god mode on even though I die as much as they do...  My score for Dystopia is a 7/10. It could have been an 8/10 if there was UGC (User Generated Content) and the servers weren't so lifeless like they are now. But despite that it's free, it's fun, and there are still some players who play this game. It just depends on what time of day and how long you are willing to wait until people notice there is someone on a server.Another thing I should tell you is; the dev's seem to have quit all development on Dystopia...So it's kinda dead in the water unless someone picks it up or buy's the IP (if it's even available.) If I knew more about Source engine I would love to remake this game, but one can dream am I right?			"

												Okay. This game is amazing the only problem with it is the lack of community players, so if you own this game tell all your friends, groups, whaterver the hell to go play this game right now! The game is fun basically you have 3 classes but they wont always be the same, you focus on different play styles with only 3 classes, for example light is stealth recon and CqC, medium is explosives sniper and medium range, heavy is well the juggernaut and kicks meatbag ♥♥♥. just PLEASE play this game.

												I thought Dystopia was cool before it won an award.Dystopia might be the single most complex multiplayer shooter I've ever played. 2 teams of cyberpunk badasses duke it out in a series of immensely complex objective-driven attack/defend maps. Explaining any one of them usually requires 30 minutes and a couple of whiteboards. Explaining some of the weapons requires a notepad. Explaining how something as simple as the respawn timer works still involves a lecture and a couple of diagrams.Back in its heyday, there were maybe only 1,000 people in the world who actually understood enough of this game to be able to play it. I know more than that are capable, and I'd love to see it re-emerge.			"

												Dystopia is a team-based, first-person shooter video game. The gameplay of Dystopia is objective-based, in which both teams fight against each other to complete a series of objectives within a set amount of time to win the round. As either Punk Mercenaries or Corporate Security Forces the player will fight through the physical world to gain access, via jack-in terminals, to cyberspace. Various things can be done from the cyber-reflection of the map, ranging from opening security doors, disabling cameras, turrets and more.The graphic is not the best for these days, but it still looks not bad.Dystopia is a fun, highly customizable first person mod with great team-play in an interesting cyberpunk themed setting.Sounds 6/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												This one goes right to the top of the ""All-Time Best Futuristic/Cyberpunk FPS"" list. Despite not building it from scratch and using a very high-quality tool already available in the market, the Dystopia (amateur) team managed to replace virtually all of the artistic assets and core aspects of gameplay on Valve's Half-Life 2 Source graphics/physics engine. Released for free for the first time in 2005, Dystopia delivered an ultra hi-tech, fast paced FPS that takes you into a heavily computerized post-modern world.The game takes place in 2069 and depicts a world dominated by megacorporations. In its universe, players are spawned as combat clones and fight for two warring factions, either as oppressed renegades (Punk Mercenaries) or private security contractors (Corporate Security Forces). Punk OrganisationsThere are many of them, each with its own agenda and modus operandi. They are essentially any group operating against corporations. While not necessarily outlaws, the vast majority of punks are wanted by governments or corporations around the globe. Punks are organisations of people that can be hired for mercenary missions and/or that operate outside of the ""normal boundary"" of the law. These groups range from highly trained special forces to the local mafia's hitmen. Any form of contractual mercenary force, operating without proper documentation, is illegal in almost all modern countries. Discovery of a contract can be disastrous to both the client and the punk organisation. This leads to many clandestine meetings in back-alleys between corporate and punk representitives. It is dangerous to make connections with a punk organisation, not only because of legal reasons but also because of the unpredictability and secrecy of the groups. Hired Punk factions can be allied with a rival organisation of the client. Revenge killings are not unknown. Double-crossing is also disastrous, occuring when a Punk faction accepts contracts from opposing forces, and secretly sabotages both, while taking both payments. CorporationsThere are tens of thousands of registered corporations around the world, operating on different fields of industry and following distinct guidelines. Some are huge like WalkTek or DataTrust. Most single corporations are owned by other, larger corporations. It's tempting to say that in 2069 the Mega Corporations have taken all the power from the world governments, but this is not entirely true. The relationship is usually symbiotic and governments are completely dependant on corporate trade, technology and security to maintain their peace and economy. Without the corporations, many nations would literally wither out and die. At the same time, corporations have no desire to govern. In fact much of their strength stems from not ruling. They, instead, delegate this task to the governments of the world, which maintain the social order and public infrastructure necessary for a stable economy. The governments create a place in which the corporations can thrive.

Along with the backstory and highly detailed environments, one of the great features you'll notice as soon as you login to Dystopia is a kickass soundtrack by techno artist Bioxeed. It really adds up to the immersion.The primary game mode is asymmetrical and objective driven, one team holds out while the other fights against the clock. Players battle against each other in both the physical world (known commonly as meatspace) and the virtual world (cyberspace), with actions in one having an effect on the other. Every map contains a sequence of objectives. Each of these objectives is unique, located in its own area, and associated with multiple interactive devices. The offensive team must complete every objective on the map to win a round. Because of cyberspace, each environment is dual-layered and demands coordinated action from both teams. Cyberspace is a three-dimensional manifestation of computer networks, a second world sprung from technological advancement. Deckers use cerebral implants to leave their meat-sacks behind and fight over the tangible, digital realm. As avatars, they traverse the memory of servers, execute programs (up to 13 of them are available), align with different protocols and pass through data links. Servers contain nodes that house the control panels of crucial devices. Programs let players interact with these nodes, dissolve opposing avatars, and accelerate their own movement.Bloody carnage fills meatspace. In this future, organizations get away with murder, but for clones, respawn technology means death is temporary. Keeping the enemy dead and teammates alive requires superior aim, tactical positioning, and communication. Loadouts are fully customizable, and with every respawn comes a chance to change armor class, primary weapon, and implant selection.Light, Medium, and Heavy Augmented Armors are available - each have with their own unique strengths and weaknesses with varying amounts of health and armor. Choose up to four primary weapons and further customize your selected class by equipping different class based special abilities - implants. Classes with more armor jump higher, have more health, and have more powerful weapons. Classes with less armor are smaller, have more implant diversity, move faster, and have shorter respawn penalties. Each class has different weapons, and every player respawns with a primary weapon, a melee weapon, some grenades, a machine pistol and some ammo. There are 18 destructive weapons in total, 12 high powered primary weapons, as well as special dispensers that resupply ammo for them and the machine pistol.You can choose between 14 cybernetic implants to customize your loadout. Active implants drain energy, and are triggered by the player. They won't work without enough energy. Passive implants do not drain energy, and don't need to be triggered. They can all be temporarily disabled by the blast of an EMP grenade.There are two implant groups: head and body. Lights and mediums have a different number of head and body implant slots. Players may change implants each time they spawn. There are 14 official maps and a large amount of third party maps in Dystopia. Players are free to develop and submit their own, however they must ensure they integrate well within the game universe, and that they're the highest quality possible. To see a walkthrough for a map, you can navigate to its page and click the ""Walkthrough"" link. These walkthroughs help familiarize new players with the relatively complex map gameplay found in Dystopia.Dystopia's team oriented gameplay is extremely suitable for competitive action, and teams have continued to form and participate in Dystopia’s clan scene since the mod's release. A persistent statistics tracking system keeps track of every players combat stats across all active Dystopia servers. Several tournaments and leagues have been organized, and the developer tries to keep the game competitive and balanced with each update.Team Dystopia is an amateur team that has worked their asses off on their spare time to create this highly detailed, immersive, futuristic, action-packed cyberpunk multiplayer game. It's completely free to play and they're even working slowly on an Unreal Engine 4  Dystopia 2 [dystopia2.com] upgrade, so go ahead and assume the role of a heavily-augmented combat mercenary armed to the teeth with the latest in combat technology, or a twitch-reflex cyberdecker rushing to infiltrate cyberspace nodes!

												It's okay and has some replay value. It has a variety of weapons and abilities. Not to mention that when you're hacking devices, you don't just push buttons to capture nodes like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you literally enter cyber space and jump around and shoot at your enemies with energy beams until you snuff them out of cyberspace and or when you find your objective. My only problems are that there aren't alot of matches. It's just Red attacking while Blue is defending. Kind of like a reverse Team Fortress 2. Maybe if the creators added diferent types of matches, like Capture the flag or something else than just attack/defend, it would have a lot of replay value. Another thing is that some of the 3 classes are (at times) overpowered. Like if you play as the heavy, you have a grenade that, when thrown, will walk to the enemy and detonate. And at times, the classes feel useless like how certain, important abilities like hacking and healing are only available to the light and medium but not available to the heavy and you need those abilities to win the round. On the brighter side, It can be fun and can be creative most of the time. The weapons are really fun to use like the homing rocket launcher and the telsa gun and many others. Overall, It's not bad, it just needs improvement.			"

												So the other day I was playing Dystopia and there's this one map with a core that the punks are trying to destroy because it's full of cool stuff that the corps needs to take over the world or something. But anyway Bunnies was on and we were shooting our teammates (like you do) but then suddenly I dawned on me that it was just like that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where the aliens were trying to steal the Enterprise's (D that is) dilithium because they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would do anything to get that precious dilithium. (Star Trek Voyager sucked, by the way.) Anyway, Data was like ""I'm going to hack you, bad guys"" and Picard was like, ""Oh man I am so diplomatic"" and distracted them with diplomacy while Geordi and Data kicked cybernetic ♥♥♥ in the background. That's what I've always loved about The Next Generation. It's really the best Star Trek. Remeber that episode where Picard gets stabbed through the heart? Amazing.			"

												First off, Dystopia is not a stand-alone F2P game, but a mod for HL2. I have played Dystopia since 2008, back when the community was way more lively than now (it's dead already). I'll never forget how fun it was to mess around with the ""perks"" you could pick for each character; no single player had the same playstyle as another. That's what made the deathmatch part so fun. Then they added objective based gamemodes. Which made it all the more fun, and didn't stop people from randomly killing/TKing eachother.Dystopia has a special place for me, placing it as the first online enabled game/mod I played extensively (aside from CS 1.6), which led me to where I am today. It's just as amazing as Fortress Forever was. Shame the HL2 MP mods are dead. Someone needs to man up and revive the community already!			"

												A little known gem, Dystopia is a futuristic Source mod that has some serious polish and flair. The premise might be a little bit of a cliche, but the gameplay is anything but normal. There's three classes, light, heavy, and medium, and they can each pick perks... a big one of these is the hacking skill. By hacking into the network on a map, you become a 3d ghostlike avatar inside the network, blind to the real world. Inside the network you'll fight to change things in the environment - open doors so your heavier armored friends can go kick some ♥♥♥, for example. Enemy hackers will of course be fighting for the same thing, and hack fights can be pretty intense. One neat  perk? Wall hugging makes your run faster.I like this mod. It's a damn shame few people play it these days.4/5			"

												This is the best team based shooter I've ever played by a cyber-mile.It's everything you wanted from a cyberpunk Assault-mode shooter including the one thing that none of the others ever seem to include. You know, the thing that makes it a cyberpunk shooter? The matrix.Dystopia's matrix is essentially a bouncy Q3 style arena shooting mode, but if you know cyberpunk you know that controlling cyberspace can have a dramatic effect on the way the meatspace objectives play out.Whether you're opening and closing doors, turning automatic turrets on and off or realigning a gigantic ♥♥♥♥-you mining laser to blast a tunnel into the next area (and vapourise anyone caught in the corridor at the time) the cyberspace objectives themselves are usually tempting enough to be worth scrapping over.I haven't played in anything resembling a serious business organised fashion pretty much ever, and I don't think it ever really caught on well enough that there's still any pub servers you can just drop in to  mess around casually without some LR pro who never stopped playing coming by to wreck everyone and scatter them to the four winds in five minutes.Still the best, though. And to think it was a free HL2MP mod.			"

												Dystopia is a great FPS experience. It combines gameplay in two different worlds (cyberspace and normal). It offers a unique opportunity to gain team advantage by hacking enemy security systems. This mode (game) has only few cons its not much friendly to new comers and has bad advertising, cause nobody knows about this brilliant mode. For me its absolutely one of the best modes ever made (with natural selection).			"

												The very best mod for the Source Engine. I wish the community did not die out, or I wish this could have a revamp from a large publisher to establish a new community. I have not since found an FPS that satisfies the gamer in me like Dystopia did. None has been as challenging, nor anywhere near as rewarding. The learning curve is high, which scares away most gamers, but this game trumps all. The teamwork and synergy required to complete objectives is unmatched. I miss the Dystopia glory days.			"

												It has aged, obviously, and the fact that you find 1-2-3 servers full or not shouldn't hinder you if you bring along friends.I would recommend it, even if it obviously has some horribly wrong things of its time (like making virtually impossible to conquer an object if someone is defending it, even if you kill them, it still requires time which actually your energy won't have, and while you wait for your energy to replenish, the enemy has respawned) but it's a really funny game and never heard of it until today.Made 5-6 games and I really liked it, if I had a bunch of friends which I didn't know what to play, I would probably choose this, or Swat 4			"

												Dystopia is a free to play fps and rpg MOD this is not a standalone title but a mod..... but does that mean it is bad, well no. You see that Dystopia has a great potential of being a standalone with maybe a sequel. The only things that I wish were out would be avilibility to make maps (if you go to hammer in the game files you can make lost coast maps with Sourcetest) straight forward objectives that can help people who just started (people like me) and I also would like some kind of a guide since I did not know how cyberspace worked also a story mode. All in all it is a very decent mod that I recomend even if it has its flaws and is almost dead. It has a wonderful loving comunity a nice OST and it has a very good atmosphere that actually shows off something futuristing (unlike CoD) so my rank for this game is a 7/10 -Pixel The Skunk			"

												Dystopia is the best Cyberpunk themed multiplayer FPS around and it is completely free! Not free-to-play, just plain old free. Just click to download and that is it.It has a unique gameplay experience of being able to fight in the physical world (meatspace) as well as in the digital world (cyberspace).Co-operation and teamwork are essential if you want to succeed. It may be an old mod (originally released in 2005) but it still plays very well.The system requirements for it are low so you don't need the latest CPU or GPU to run it.I may be a little biased being a Puny Human, but also from being a tester for Dystopia :)			"

												I used to love this game, back when v1.0 came out and the original developer team was supporting it, it was really amazing, never played anything like it in terms of gameplay, and still haven't to this day. While the game is still awesome, the new dev team are kind of snobby and are not very active with this game anymore, sadly. The last few patches was some pretty basic music and art and some gameplay updates to the developer's and their friends favorite weapons, which in my honest opinion should have been nerfed (lr, tesla ball). That's my opinion, but for whatever reason no one plays this game anymore, you're lucky to find a server(with people in it) at any given time. The gameplay was amazing, but my favorite part was probably the ranking system, at one time during 1.1 I was ranked #3, in the world. I wish more games would institute a global ranking system, it drives you to play.			"

												This game used to be real fun ages ago. Since then it has changed a lot, but I still like it, although I have not played it in years before recently. There are only a few players who play this, just as many as there are servers - I have seen only 10 online altogether.It has a strong team strategy element to it, and the learning curve is steep. Do not be disappointed if you do not get the hang of it - it takes some time and knowing the maps helps a lot, as always.It runs very well on vintage hardware.			"

												Well, they were right, Valve broke it, but reverting to the previous version took care of that.  I tried the tutorial but some abilities (boost jump for instance) didn't work no matter what key or mouse button I mapped it to.  thus I was unable to even finish the tutorial.    I'll come back to this one another time.    The only reason I'm giving this one a down check is that there's no neutral position to take.  I can't recommend the game, but it isn't bad or broken enough to give a truly negative review.			"

												Dystopia is a game I really wanted to try out, but I was unable to for several reasons. It's a mod for Half Life 2, so you need that game in order to play it. After buying the complete Half Life game pack during a Steam sale, I downloaded the mod because I actually wanted to play it; I thought the concept was pretty cool. But I couldn't. Attempting to start the tutorial caused the game to crash. This happened every time. I figured I should just skip the tutorial then and learn as I play along, but even that didn't work. Attempting to either join or create a server caused the game to crash. The really unfortunate thing is that even if the game didn't crash, I still wouldn't get to play it because nobody else seems to be playing it; the player base seems to be dead.In conclusion, this is a game I wanted to play but couldn't, and its playerbase seems to have died off. Therefore, I can't recommend this game at the moment. What a shame.			"

												Well, it's properly dead now I must assume.On paper this looks like an interesting little time waster with a lot of ideas however I can only speculate if it actually ever worked. I spent a while bouncing around the vast emptiness contemplating my existence in an uncaring world and then uninstalled it again. I feel like I was parsing the outskirts of a foreign city for an obscure little sushi place only to finally find it abandoned with the smell of wasabi still lingering in the air.What a shame, it seemed like a good companion-piece to NeoTokyo and in contrast seems to do a lot more with the whole cyberpunk aesthetic than just putting an invisible cloak in counter-strike. Maybe I'll take another reek in the future but right now this game is deceased.			"

												Hello Fellow Dystopians,I can't recommend this game. It's free so it didn't hurt to try, although I can not in good knowledge write a bull ♥♥♥♥ review that approves of this game. The problem isn't so much with the gameplay, it's more with joining servers. I've tried on several occasions to join a server and it didn't work and it rather just closed the game.

												Couldn't find a friend's custom server & we spent an hour just to try & make it work so we could all play. Even a friend of mine did port forwarding & found the server but when we tried to join it(despite using the right password for the password protected server). It came with the error message saying we can only join a Lan game from a local server.In all honesty, making server should have been more straight forward & easy to find, rather than being a chore & has made a very bad impression on me as whole just to play with friends.  Very disappointed.The only thing I managed to play was the tutorial which is pretty sad that I couldn't play with my friends & resorted to playing ZMR which is easy to make lobby compare to this game.Save yourself the frustration & don't bother downloading this game to play it because you'll regret doing so.

												In many ways Dystopia feels like a HL1 mod. It's clearly old, the maps are dark, the sounds headache inducing, the gameplay is reminiscent of Quake and Unreal Tournament... It's from 2007 and feels like it was meant for HL1.Game is so blatanly unbalanced I was asked not to use one of the weapons because it was considered overpowered.Matches oftenly got to a point where every team was so set in their positions it wasn't possible for any of them to get a definitive edge, thus dragging the game way longer than should have been. This is because of the map design and of how respawn works in those games. If you want to see respawn done well see League of Legends and Dota 2.The level design is often terrible. Many chokepoints will just result in a 20 minutes struggle between the two teams with no clear winner. The lighting is either too bright or too dark, most of the time creating a contrast higher than acceptable. The layouts can be quite confusing as they tend to be really open and identical corridors don't help.As for the sound the footsteps of the heavy class is too loud, too clunky, too abrupt, etc not to give me a headache, making it impossible for me to play the class for long.Given such major flaws I cannot recommend this game to anyone but to the most curious and to game designers because it's easier to learn from a bad game than from a good one.

												this game is bad. It offers no tactical value whatsoever and the tutorial is worthless. It only teaches you a small number of things like how to use the 'hacking' ability to enter consoles and how to boost jump, which are NOT available all the time, you have to select these things as ""add ons"" or ""implants"" when you select your class and weapon. There are a lot more add ons that they don't even teach you about and in the tutorial you don't even fight anything, they don't teach you anything about the guns and the descriptions in-game get cutoff when they're long. The weapons have multiple alternate fires that they don't tell you about.this is almost literally a quake arena game but in super-slow motion and with melee abilities.

												For starters, the shootouts between teams with customizable implants are complex. Personal invisibility, heat-vision, cold-suits, Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor all add to a complex network of tactical choices. On top of that, there is a parallel fight taking place in cyberspace that interlocks with the map objectives, alternate routes and turrets. If you like the mind-games that are played in high-level Counter-Strike matches, Dystopia builds out a toolkit of trickery for you and your team to employ.			"

												Dystopia is a fairly run of the mill Cyberpunk FPS but with a few really neat throwbacks. Fundamentally, it's a gibson novel, in FPS form (Much like the Tom Clancy games) however, this does it right. There's no ""Well do I really want to"", no, Pick a side, start playing and have as much gorram fun doing it as possible.There's a few things that to this day still don't really feel polished about the mod though. The gameplay can sometimes feel a touch random, and there's such a limited player base the stratification is much more pro/not-pro than in multiplayer FPSs that have had a wider exposure.Still, the game is fun and definitely plays the appropriate omages to the Cyberpunk genre.

												I used to play this game back when Half Life 2 mods had to be downloaded and manually updated from ModDb. It was a great experience.The gameplay was truly one of a kind. You'd play with powerful teched up classes, fun and unique weapons, as well as fight in cyberspace. That was a unique part of the mod; the cyber battlefield, where you had to hack as if you were beating information out of a computer. A team needed to work together well in the physical and cyber battlefields in order to be successful, which made the gameplay even more action packed.This mod has died out after many years. I hope that like Insurgency, this great mod can get a much needed rebirth.			"

												This is a really good mod for an extention on Half-Life 2, yet Dystopia has nothing to do with the story Half-Life what so ever.  The gameplay is slightly different from the original gameplay of Half-Life 2, the graphics are newer looking even tho this game runs on the same engine Half-Life 2 runs on, and the music is perfect for the games enviorment.  It's an ok FPS game it's just this game is a multiplayer and it dosn't have any players playing.  I still recommend this game to you and your friends to play, It's worth a try.			"

												For starters, the shootouts between teams with customizable implants are complex. Personal invisibility, heat-vision, cold-suits, Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor all add to a complex network of tactical choices. On top of that, there is a parallel fight taking place in cyberspace that interlocks with the map objectives, alternate routes and turrets. If you like the mind-games that are played in high-level Counter-Strike matches, Dystopia builds out a toolkit of trickery for you and your team to employ.			"

												Probably one of the best mods I ever played based on the Source engine.You can be a hacker for your team and take over control points or turrets.You can be a heavy and break through enemy lines.There's more, I promise, but it doesn't really matter anymore. Here's why: Nobody really plays this game anymore. The community just isn't interested in playing this game for one reason or another. I'm not going to speculate on why.If you can find a group of people to play with and want to try a new class-based objective FPS, then you should try this one.

												A unique cyberpunk First Person Shooter based on the same game engine as Valve's Team Fortress 2 and Portal. Players join up with corporate security forces and suburban terrorist groups in this nightmareish look into the future of military cybernetics, where man has melded with machine and become one with the weapons of war.Dystopia allows players to wage military actions across urban battlefields in a bloody rampage of shattered flesh and steel, with a simultaneous struggle occuring inside the electronic networks of company mainframes by systems crackers, all combining for an intense, multi-layered, team play and objective based thrill ride.Three degrees of remaining humanity shape the player experience, allowing players to further tailor their gameplay through a selection in personal cybernetics and an arsenal of experimental firearms & close combat weapons.

												Fantasic quality for a free mod. If you like first person shooters then it's worth a go just for the 'meatspace' side of things alone with some fun weapons and implants to play with in a great looking ,well themed environment, but if you like cyberpunk, even more so. Decking into cyberpsace adds a extra level of play to the whole thing and coordinating with teammates in the real world to time attacks etc is fantastic, all the while trying to watch your own (virtual..) back for enemy deckers trying to knock you out of cyberspace or (re)hack something you've just captured and protected. Frantic, but one hell of a lot of fun to play. "

Decking into cyberpsace adds a extra level of play to the whole thing and coordinating with teammates in the real world to time attacks etc is fantastic, all the while trying to watch your own (virtual..) back for enemy deckers trying to knock you out of cyberspace or (re)hack something you've just captured and protected. Frantic, but one hell of a lot of fun to play. "

												A very well made HL2-based mod, it definitely changed up the team-based FPS genre in a time where we needed something fresh. Unfortunately, lack of exposure and a niche community in a game with waning support contributed to the game's significantly reduced player-base, which is fatal in a team-based game like this. There just isn't enough interested in playing.Each weapon favors a significantly different loadout and playstyle, and everything has it's place with very little fluff. Each ability adds uniquely to a series of very well-constructed objective take-over maps, each with their own way to attack or defend the objective. The most unique element is how Cyberspace is handled as a physical 3D place, where there is no real up or down, throwing you down long winding tunnels that you have to control to maintain your speed, all while combatting the enemy jacked into the other various Cyberspace terminals in order to assist securing objectives in Meatspace. This is done in many ways, for example by toggling a turret's targetting system to the other team, and then reinforcing it with various traps so the other team can't just instantly retake it.Please play it :P			"

The concept and gameplay is great also. The only thing is, there are practically no people playing this game. I mean maybe if your lucky you will find 3 or 4 other players on this game, but thats about it, and thats if your lucky.

												This game has a few problems. It was made before Orange Box engine and is only a mod, so the lag compensation can be frustrating due to the fact that the developers can't fine-tune the netcode themselves. It has a really steep learning curve, and until recently the tutorial was ineffective for teaching. It's still not perfect, but much more workable. Its graphics and environments are involving and colorful, and the backstory is really evident in everything. I love the cyberspace element, and there is actually some kind of skill in cyberspace too. Cyberbattles are unlike anything I've ever seen, and it really adds a good layer of complexity to the game. As for the normal FPS element of it, Dystopia has some very unique weapons, some of which may not be perfect but overall are quite balanced and the developers clearly care about good design in that regard. This game needs love, and this game needs more of a community, but sadly that probably won't happen.			"

												I have five hours of playtime and already this game is blowing me away. With weapons that work well and combat that always leaves you guessing who will win, this game is as close to perfect as I've ever seen. Objectives are generally fairly clearly marked, maps are well-built, and abilities are well-balanced. It's a beautiful game, and I love it. Can I give it a fifteen out of ten? Is that okay? 'Cause ten isn't enough. This game is great, and you should be playing it.Please note that the learning curve is pretty steep, but it's not a high-skill curve: it's mostly a matter of getting accustomed to how everything works. However, the community is usually very helpful and will typically answer any questions you may have.The issue is that usually there are very few players on at a time, and the playerbase is a whopping 947 players at the time of this writing.

												Dystopia is a fairly run of the mill Cyberpunk FPS but with a few really neat throwbacks. Fundamentally, it's a gibson novel, in FPS form (Much like the Tom Clancy games) however, this does it right. There's no ""Well do I really want to"", no, Pick a side, start playing and have as much gorram fun doing it as possible.There's a few things that to this day still don't really feel polished about the mod though. The gameplay can sometimes feel a touch random, and there's such a limited player base the stratification is much more pro/not-pro than in multiplayer FPSs that have had a wider exposure.Still, the game is fun and definitely plays the appropriate omages to the Cyberpunk genre.

												A fantastic objective based game based on William Gibsons Neuromancer,easily one of the best FPS games out there.Each map has a side defending and one attacking.There are objectives that members of each team must fufill in order to advance their spawn points,and some may even be taken back and forth.An understanding of how cyberspace and meatspace reflect on each other is important as well.Deckers(hackers) can jack in to Jack In Points,bringing them to control of their cyberspace avatar which has health equal to the deckers energy pool.Attacks/getting attacked in cyberspace drains your energy pool faster,and getting forcibly ejected is somewhat harmful.The deckers main objective is to navigate cyberspace and to open doors,toggle defense turrets,and set off traps in meatspace so their team can advance,or prevent the enemy from doing so.Implants are customizeable and more implant space is available to the lighter classes.These are essentially superpowers like Stealth,Silencer,AoE Health Regen,Sound Wave Triangulator(see footsteps through walls),Superjump,Cyberdeck for Decking,etc and really add a nice spice to the game.Its also fun to jump onto a deckers head while hes hacking,and superjump his head into the pavement.That said,the combat is brutal and intense,with unique and creative weapons like the Tesla Rifle,the formidable Basilisk,or my personal favorite the Smartlocks. The maps are well thought out and have high replay value.Thats why,in my personal opinion,Dystopia is a game that should have been included in the Orange Box,and does not get enough press for how fantastic it is.

												<salt>♥♥♥♥ TOPE! <\salt>amazing, this game really needs a larger player base. the gameplay is wonderful and fairly balanced.ive only played for less than a day and i can fully recommend this....your still reading this? go on and get fighting meatbag!:Dtl;dr: play the game when there are large amounts of players on a server and you'll have fun, don't do that and you'll hate it. unfortunatly because of the games small community there are small amounts of people, with usually 2 tryhards/way too good players in a server at any given time.I'm still giving a good review because I hope this will help the game get more players that ARN'T TRYHARDS!EDIT: I am on the fence about reccomending dystopia because of specific players in the community. It is not that they are bad sports or anything of the sort. Rather, it is that they are too good at dystopia. Without the buffer of a large community the the tryhard who have played since day one are up against the people who havn't dedicated years of time to the game. IT IS NOT FUN. however, WHEN there are players acting as a buffer (ie- a server has a large population) it can be more fun. The game can be fun if there is a large playerbase. There isn't anything wrong with the game! The issue is that the community has died out, but its still great!PROTIP FOR IF YOU DO PLAY DYSTOPIA! FOLLOW THE DYSTOPIA STEAM GROUP!

												One of few classic Source mods on Steam that is still updated, or even available to be played. As the playerbases of most other multiplayer Source mods dwindle, this game has managed to keep a few players more active and dedicated than even the players who're keeping Zombie Panic and NeoTokyo alive. I'd recommend installing this game just to check out the devs' rather incredible work, as well as to see just how good those last few players have gotten. Seriously - if they'd invested their time into a game such as CS, I have a feeling that they'd be doing quite well for themselves.			"

												A unique cyberpunk First Person Shooter based on the same game engine as Valve's Team Fortress 2 and Portal. Players join up with corporate security forces and suburban terrorist groups in this nightmareish look into the future of military cybernetics, where man has melded with machine and become one with the weapons of war.Dystopia allows players to wage military actions across urban battlefields in a bloody rampage of shattered flesh and steel, with a simultaneous struggle occuring inside the electronic networks of company mainframes by systems crackers, all combining for an intense, multi-layered, team play and objective based thrill ride.Three degrees of remaining humanity shape the player experience, allowing players to further tailor their gameplay through a selection in personal cybernetics and an arsenal of experimental firearms & close combat weapons.

												Pretty good cyberpunk multiplayer game, one of the rare few that gets the whole cyberspace vs. meatspace thing correctly. Controls are a bit janky on some maps though, but that comes with the ""mod"" territory.Biggest downside currently is lack of public servers (currently only two US East ones and one janky EU one) and lack of players. If you're interested in playing the game, check if some of the authors on the ""most helpful reviews"" list are currently playing; usually servers are empty, but if you log on at the right time, you can easily get a 6v6 or more going. If the game is crashing for you, make sure you go into the game's beta settings and switch it to the ""Previous"" setting.			"

												One of the best games ever. Simple way to describe it is a futuristic tf2 like game. If this game had a price tag and valve license years ago and was on frontpage it wouldive sold like mad and rivaled css in popularity. Its a shame to see age take this away. Hopefully we sometime get hl3 and a new engine and a remake licensed version of this game. Valve should have bought the rights to this or cut a deal it wouldive been loved by anyone it actually got in front of. Amazing game very creative mixed fps genre, objective based shooter.			"

												I used to play this game back when Half Life 2 mods had to be downloaded and manually updated from ModDb. It was a great experience.The gameplay was truly one of a kind. You'd play with powerful teched up classes, fun and unique weapons, as well as fight in cyberspace. That was a unique part of the mod; the cyber battlefield, where you had to hack as if you were beating information out of a computer. A team needed to work together well in the physical and cyber battlefields in order to be successful, which made the gameplay even more action packed.This mod has died out after many years. I hope that like Insurgency, this great mod can get a much needed rebirth.			"

												This is a really good mod for an extention on Half-Life 2, yet Dystopia has nothing to do with the story Half-Life what so ever.  The gameplay is slightly different from the original gameplay of Half-Life 2, the graphics are newer looking even tho this game runs on the same engine Half-Life 2 runs on, and the music is perfect for the games enviorment.  It's an ok FPS game it's just this game is a multiplayer and it dosn't have any players playing.  I still recommend this game to you and your friends to play, It's worth a try.			"

												Great game, unique gameplay. Two sides with different targets makes for intriguing gameplay. One team caps a point and moves on to the next objective. But watch out for the backhackers who can reclaim the earlier target.Join the Dystopia PUG group and be notified when a new game starts.I played a few days ago, and the server was full (8x8) thanks to the Dystopia PUG announcement.Check it out!
