												Bully. It's GTA, but without blood and deadly weapons, and instead of playing as an adult man, you play as Jimmy Hopkins. A 15 year old kid who's aggressive and a fighter, but not truly malicious. He only gives people what they have coming to them.Bully takes place in Bullworth, a town in New England. Your mom, well, Jimmy's mom, drops you off at Bullworth Academy. A boarding school. The school is full of bullies and corrupt teachers and it's up to you to put a stop to it.The game's storyline will guide you through six chapters (There are 65 missions, the sixth chapter is an endless free-roam chapter, giving you the chance to complete non-storyline missions and to collect collectables.) Each of them takes place in a different weather season. The missions vary, it's never the same. One time you're cleaning a rat infested library and the next time you're helping a teacher escape from a psychiatric hospital. As Jimmy, your main goal is to bring peace to the school by helping and befriending the four school cliques: The Nerds, the Jocks, the Bullies and the Preppies.Of course you'll have to go to class. These classes are: English, gym, geography, math (ew), music, shop, art, photography and biology. They are simple mini-games which become noticeably harder every time you attend them and make progress. You'll also have to deal with a time schedule. You can skip class, but you won't get any rewards if you do so and prefects will chase you down and send you back to class if they catch you.Jimmy, your character, is highly customizable. You can buy clothes, change your hairstyle and more. You can even buy a bike, a go-kart or a scooter if you save up enough cash. Money can be earned by either taking a paper route, doing missions for townies or students or by completing storyline missions. You've got weapons. No, they are not guns and no you can't kill people. There's a super slingshot, you can use firecrackers, stink bombs, eggs, a bag of marbles, a bottle rocket launcher and so much more. You can also pick up one of the many objects around you (umbrella's, vases, bottles) and use them as a weapon.Interacting with your fellow students is fun too. You can talk to them, give cute presents, put them in trash bins or lockers, steal their books, take their pictures for the yearbook, punch them in their faces (aka bully them) and if you feel like it you can make out with a girl or a guy. The game has a very impressive map size. You can explore the entire school, the school grounds, the town, a fully functional theme park, an industrial park and a few more awesome places. There are many collectables scattered around the map too.Bully may be pretty good, but it's not perfect. The graphics are rather outdated, the sound isn't that amazing, the controls are a bit clunky at first and there are some bugs. But don't worry! It doesn't kill the fun. Bully is an amazing game and there's much to do. And for only $14.99 - £9.99 - €9.99, it's certainly worth it. I highly recommend this game. "

												I love Bully. It is my favorite open-world game and is my favorite game of all time. I love Red Dead and GTA, but not everyone has been a cowboy or a criminal, but everyone's gone to school. You may not relate excatly to Jimmy but you will relate to him more than John Marston or any GTA character. Also the level of customization is something I havent really seen in any other Rockstar games, making Jimmy your Jimmy and interesting. I have played this to death, and you should too.			"

												One of the best sandbox-style games I've ever played! Bully beautifully weaves tweaked Grand Theft Auto gameplay with the universally relatable life story of young Jimmy Hopkins. The setting of a fictional New England boarding school and the nearby town of Bullworth are perfect for this kind of story, following Jimmy as he faces the same challenges that every kid faces growing up, like keeping up with schoolwork, fighting back against bullies, experiencing your first kiss, causing chaos through pranks and hijinks, and finding acceptance between various cliques and social groups.The writing is brilliant, supplying a colorful cast of characters, missions, and story arcs. Including Jimmy himself, all of the NPCs seem practically handcrafted with the amount of personality and detail put into them. Each character has a unique model, and their own unique set of dialogues and animations. On top of these fantastically created characters, the plot is just as good. I was immersed into a world that I could have sworn was from an 80's Hollywood flick, drawing inspiration from coming-of-age tales like those of Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Catcher in the Rye. With such a wonderfully realistic world full of jocks, preps, nerds, and other odd townfolk, I almost wish that my own school days growing up were as interesting as those of Bullworth Academy.The gameplay is just as entertaining, using similar mechanics to GTA, such as a wanted system (called Truancy, of course), a combat system filled with a diverse array of punches, throws, and weapons at your disposal, different vehicles, mini-games, and other various activities and collectibles for completionists. As usual, there are missions given by various NPCs, some advancing the main story, and others being small side activities. Camera angles can be strange at times, but I've never experienced any gamebreaking issues with it. Overall, the gameplay has enough variance where it doesn't get too repetitive, and it strikes a nice balance that makes it both interesting and easy to pick up.Compared to other open-world games, Bully is by far my favorite. One of the few titles I've been compelled to complete 100%. If you're looking for something different in the same vein of games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and the like, I highly recommend looking into Bully: Scholarship Edition. You won't be disappointed.			"

Posted: January 8, 2015
												Welcome to Bullworth Academy. You play as a 15 year old thug of a kid named Jimmy Hopkins in this third person open world beat-em-up. Sure you get plenty of weapons like the slingshot, eggs, stink bombs that prevent enemies from attacking, firecrackers, a potato cannon and even a bottle rocket launcher, but you'll be spending most of your time brawling. The game is Bully, but you're more of an avenging angel. Sticking up for the weak, but following missions from pervert teachers, and the local crazies. Its the characters in Bully that really make the game stand shoulder to shoulder with Grand Theft Auto games. There is also plenty to do outside of the story missions. Bike races, collect-a-thons, arcade games that are worthy of their own games, classes that are really mini games that will unlock things for you and even a camera so you can take photos of every dumb thing you'll see. Instead of mayhem and murder like the GTA franchise, Bully is more of criminal mischief and knocking people unconscious. You don't even brutally win fights, enemies just fall over. You can finish them off with a childish noogie, putting them in a headlock and spitting on them or one of the many other silly ways.The game plays similar to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas meets the Warriors. You have jump and run buttons. An attack that you can hold for a strong attack. A target lock on for projectile weapons. If you don't have one equipped, it becomes a block button when you're not attacking. A free aim button for your sling shots, eggs and so on. A grapple button for when enemies block. You can shove someone when grappled. A taunt button that you can also take them down if grappled. Its a nice simple combat system. A local bum will teach you better attacks when you find and bring him radio parts. Your wrestling coach will teach you grapples in class. The items in your inventory are easy to select on the fly. You can also pick up things like bats and bricks to use and throw. You can even make peace by talking or bribing your way out of things. When you need health, just drink a soda or find some food.The game is broken up into chapters, the first chapter takes place exclusively in the academy, but chapter two opens the gates and lets you into the rich side of town. Chapter three unlocks the poor side of town and chapter five unlocks a large industrial side of town. There's not only a sense of progression from parts of the town opening up, but the game takes place over a year and you'll see the seasons change. You'll participate in Halloween, slide around in the winter and see spring return.Each chapter focuses on a faction and there are plenty of them. Nerds in green, bullies in white, greasers in leather jackets, preps in aqua berry and jocks in blue. Each faction has their own turf at the academy, and outside the academy as well. There are even factions outside of academy that will rise against you. All factions have a respect level for you. The less respect, the more likely the members will chase after you wanting a fight! Story missions will always change a faction's respect for you. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.Since this is an open world game you'll be doing a lot of traveling. The main way is by foot. You need to mash the run button to go fast. The enemies all run as fast as you do, but luckily they have stamina and Jimmy doesn't. You quickly unlock a skateboard that sits in your inventory. Its much quicker, but can't go upstairs without a sweet jump or over muddy terrain. There are also bikes, but the bikes feel few and far between. You can throw someone off a bike and steal it, or you can buy a bike, but then it sits in a garage, making it useless when you need to visit a garage in town when you're at the school most of the time. Other than that, you can ride lawn mowers and mopeds. It all feels like a balance. To get speed you button mash. If you're on a lawn mower you're stuck going slower than walking. If you're on a moped you need a helmet or the cops will be after you.Speaking of laws, there are plenty. You have typical laws against violence, but there are also truancy and curfew laws too. The game lets you know what your offense is on a three step 'wanted' level. When your wanted level hits red, then you can't struggle against the authorities. When they catch you that's it. On campus there are perfects, that act like the police. They'll bring you to class if you're truant, chase you for a dress code violation like wearing a chicken head and stop you from bullying. Sometimes them bringing you to class is more efficient than running to it. When you're in violation, you'll see not only the authorities highlighted on the mini map, but their vision cones. The game makes use of stealth on some missions, but for the most part, its just avoiding the gaze of the cops and perfects. You can even hide in lockers, the trash or dressers in the girl's dorm.The game is really set to a timetable that can sometimes break the flow. You wake up in the morning and have two classes in the day. You need to find a bed to sleep and if it gets too late, Jimmy will fall asleep where he is and wake up the next day. You can skip classes, but then the authorities will be after you. I felt stuck and forced to partake in the mini games. I want to point out that the class mini games are entertaining and some are educational, but having them forced upon you when I'm trying to do a mission seems a bit much. You can learn things from the game. Such as the flags to different countries in geography, a boggle like make a word with letters in English and even how to dissect animals in biology. I'm not saying this will replace schools by any means. There are also typical timed button press mini games that are less impressive. The game offers a wide array of mini games, even games that parody other games, such as Paperboy, Punch Out and dodge ball! There are even random people that will give you side jobs, like throw 3 nerds in lockers, deliver 3 fries, collect 5 crabs, and so on. All fluff.The money feels useless. You can spend it on weapons, but why bother when he has an arsenal in his dorm room from completing mini games? There are expensive clothes to buy and tattoos, but why bother other than for cosmetic reasons? Sometimes the game forces you to dress a certain way or get your hair done at the barber shop. You can't buy real estate, even if you can clear out a gang hideout to make it a new save point safe house.There are dozens of characters in the game. In fact every random person has a name and schedule. You can even take pictures of all of them for the yearbook. Most of the characters are downright evil with a few exceptions. Garry, the over the top villain with an eye scar that lies to cause trouble. Petey, the short effeminate best friend. The drunk Santa. The alcoholic English teacher. The two timing dame that uses men. Russell the big dullard so dumb he calls himself Russell. Its all done in a tongue in cheek 1950s stereotype. The game feels very 1950s even with its awful happy beach guitar riffs. It didn't take me long to turn turn the music down to 10%.I managed to sink around 17 hours into this game, but I've gotta be honest, I wanted to be done a long time ago. I just spend too much time traveling and wasting too much time doing mini games. At some point I stopped going to class just so I could grind through the missions efficiently. Then the missions started getting further and further. Consuming more precious time that Jimmy is awake during the day. Doing missions back to back so late just means that Jimmy would fall asleep on the street. There are also a few game breaking bugs that would cause the game to freeze or downright crash. Not frequent, but at specific points. I still recommend the game for an open world mischief sandbox that lets you do wedgies, throw firecrackers in toilet and slap kick me signs on people, then watch them get beat to a pulp.			"

												I love this game! Probably the best Rockstar game I have ever owned and played. Has an amazing story that just keeps getting better and better. Great characters, can connect to mostly all of them. Very nice gameplay. I enjoyed playing this and would play it again in a few months or so. I never got bored of playing this beautiful game. This game takes place mostly in Bullworth Academy. Playing as the main character, Jimmy Hopkins, a 15-year old teen who  fights the bullies, and saves the weaks. Taking over cliques and bringing peace into Bullworth. Now these are my Pros and Cons. Pros: Amazing GameplayNice weaponsSaving LocationsGood MoralityGreat CharactersGreat StoryVery Interesting and FunnyAddictingChallengesTrust and RelationshipsDialogue = AwesomeCons: (OPINION)Crashes once in a whileFreezesGames would not saveA tiny bit of a delay in dialogueAnyway, I would definitely recommend this game! :D~Kibbles			"

												Definitely in my top 10 favourites games. Ever.I can spend hours and hours in this and never get bored.It's good on any platform (speaking from experience e.g. Wii, PS2, PC, etc), but a warning, surround sound seems to be a bit messed up on this, so make sure you set your audio to 2.0.Other than that, it's not a half bad port. The framerate is capped to 30, but understandbly so for a console port. It can be uncapped with mods. The pc controls still work fluently once you know them well, and can easily be rebound for preference. Though, I do recommend using a controller for a better experience.So much love, care, and effort went into this game. It's so great.			"

												I have played this game fully on the PS2, Xbox 360 and I now bought it on PC.As far as the differences here, the graphics, load times, and overall enjoyment on the game are quite higher than 360 and Ps2 for obvious reasons. However, that being said, this game is capped off at 30 FPS unless some modding is involved. From a game back in 2006-2008 days it's not surprising though.This game is very fun, it's refereshing compared to GTA, imagine GTA instead of Guns you have sling shots and stink bombs, and instead of car jacking you have bikes and skate boards.The game is rich and very open world later on in the seasons of the game.There are many fun interesting missions in the game just like GTA.The premise of the game is a troubled kid was sent to a reeform school and is forced to take over and unite the school, removing all the ""Clicks"". Each season involves a click, from the bulies to nerds, to preps, its a long fun game that is well worth the money.This falls under the old GTA system that requires a save after the missions no check points are really there, so failing a mission at the end means re-doing the entire mission.Music used is fitting along with the sound effects.This has controller support for the 360 and Xbox One as well.Graphically speaking this is the best version but its still aged, however pretty good for its time.Overall I would say definitely worth the money. An A+ rating from me.			"

												Bully, otherwise known as Canis Canem Edit on the PS2 version, is the one Rockstar game that really, truly, honestly stands out. Think of it as a sort of GTA, but as a school. Sure, you don't jack cars and bang some hookers, but you do ride around on a radical skateboard and shove fat kids into lockers. Pros: +Pretty good graphics, overall.+The classes (minigames) are totally awesome! Scholarship Edition adds some new ones, like Geography.+You never see ANY duplicated NPC's standing next to each other. Completely awesome.+Tons of depth. Every single NPC has a name. ALL OF THEM.+The characters are bright and colorful. Everyone loves Mr. Galloway, and everyone hates Mr. Hattrick.+The storyline is great! I love it, and it was very carefully written.+You can kiss girls (and boys, if you're into that) for health, which really gives an authentic high school feel.+RADICAL SOUNDTRACK! Shawn Lee is a beast!+Very lively city and school. You can see people getting chased down by cops/prefects, random fights, some kids pulling pranks. Very alive. Sadly, with every game, there are cons. -Nerd Challenge for me is truly frustrating, as ConSumo is kinda difficult.-Frame rate is only capped to 30 frames.-Cameraman is obviously on drugs, as sometimes the camera freaks out. I literally failed a mission,  Comic Klepto,  just because the camera went spontaneously and very quickly kept flipping back and forth, left to right. I crashed into a wall and failed the mission. All within 20 seconds. Camera is a little janky.-Once you're done with all the classes, missions, and have everyone's respect to 100, it kinda feels bland and empty.-Having low/negative respect with a clique can get pretty annoying, as they always pummel you wherever you are.-Prefects will constantly yell at you for being tardy to class, even if it's 1 second (in game minute) off.Bully, gets a  8/10! Definitely worth picking up. Get it now!			"

												Bully is one of my favorite video games. I love the town, the characters, the gameplay, and most importantly the story. Unfortunately the game does not run well on Windows 10. With constant crashes, I often found myself trying to get to the nearest save point after every mission so I wouldn't have to replay it. The game has crashed on me at least two dozen times during my playthrough. I have had to replay several missions and redo several classes because of this, making the experience unappealing. On top of that I have experienced several graphical and audio bugs in the game.That being said, the game is still amazing. If you're a fan of Rockstar games, this is one you should check out, especially if it goes on sale. It's hard to dislike this game even with all the issues I had. I kept going back to it. However, I recommendation saving very often because it is a nuisance when you have to replay a couple of missions because the game crashed. I played this game several years ago when it first came out. I was young at the time so the game seemed difficult. When rebought the game on Steam this year, it was a lot easier than I remembered. Most of the missions can be completed in under 20 missions. I even completed some in less than 10 minutes. Some of the classes were harder than some of these levels. This does not mean the game is bad.One of the best aspects of Bully is the story. To not ruin too much of the story, it's a typical coming of age/trying to find your way kind of story about a high schooler named Jimmy Hopkins. He goes out of his way for nearly everyone in the game. His ultimate goal is peace amongst the groups in school. I highly recommend this game and you should check it out if you have the opportunity!			"

												Bully is a great game and if you havent checkd it out what the hell are you waiting for ? in Bully you play as a teenager named Jimmy Hopkins. His mother and step father goes on a honeymoon leaving Jimmy to attend the Bullworth acedamy, meeting a kid named Gary who wants the school all to himself and of course hes gonna use you for his plan. Overall this game is great The combat feels smooth and the gun combat does feel smooth. The only real problems i found were sometimes the controls felt a bit stiff and the sound issues do ruin the game a bit. The game also has bonus collectibels, side quest, classes to go to, drivable bikes and skateboards and many more things in the world of Bully. Overall this game is fantastic just a few minor glitches but definatly you need this game in youre collection i give Bully 8.5/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												It's rare that a developer goes from making an adult game about crime with very adult themes, to making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example, Bully is a open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play and much more to just find and explorer. The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions, like the Jocks or the Nerds, and the more you do with them, the more reputation you gain, which in turn effects how other people treat you around campus.The combat is also very similar to GTA, but instead of machine guns and rocket lunches, you are playing with slingshots and stink bombs.There are also lots of things different about Bully that really makes it feel like you are back in high school. It feels very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. You have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class. All of the classes have their own perks, for instance, completing one class will show you where all of the collectibles are on the map.Unlike the protagonists in GTA, Jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep, so if you are out past 2AM, you just pass out on the spot which can make some nigh missions feel a little too time restrictive but adds to the challenge.I did't have any technical issues with Bully like a lot of people complain about on this port. Overall the game is well made but parts of it seem kind of repetitive, but I still think this is a fantastic game.			"

												Hell of a lot of fun. One of the few sandboxes that I've actually finished.Bully takes place in the town of Bullworth in New England, possibly in 1970-1980s. That's never been made clear but nevermind. You're a boy that's basically dumped into this boarding school by your mother. You have to gain respect among your new mates while avoiding getting to trouble with the teachers. Basically GTA with criminals replaced by nerds, jocks, greasers and rich inbreds and police replaced by teachers, but there's more.The town itself is also part of the game world and it offers the player lots of optional missions and some larger story missions also take partly place there. Every day you have lessons according to your curriculum and it's up to you if you are to attend those or just play hooky, go have fun and risk the punishment. The lessons provide you some nice bonuses upon completion (especially chemistry), so it pays to take the classes and if you're quick, you have time to go downtown at the end of the day anyway.The game is heavily story-driven, but it's a fun experience and you do have all the time in the world to grind yourself silly before advancing the story if that's your idea of fun. Only the end felt a bit rushed and way too much of wish-fulfillment fantasy, but it isn't a deal-breaker. Bully is a very fun romp that feels like a game version Animal House, if Animal House took place in a boarding school instead of university. The game also reminded me somewhat of the old Jennings book series, if that is at all familiar.Bully is frequently on sale and for a couple of bucks/euros you really can't go wrong if you like sandbox games at all. The game is a console port, but it works fairly well. The controls may seem weird at first if you're using keyboard, but they're easy and responsive once you get used to them.			"

												Oh man this is game from my childhood. One of the best rockstar games in my opinion. Hell who doesnt want to run round a school kicking the crap out of bullies. This game is effectively GTA set in a High school. Graphicaly this game is pretty good (giving how old it is now) but as with most rockstar games, the assets are really low poly with really good textures on them. 7.5/10If you have never played this game, you MUST buy it. Its one hell of a game.			"

												Bully is a game made by Rockstar, the development studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series. One of the many differences with GTA and this game is that instead of having deadly weapons you'll get weapons to prank and bully every kid in the block, the violent is toned-down too which is quite understandable since the game is set in a school setting.The game takes place at the fictional New England boarding school, Bullworth Academy and tells the story of mischievous 15-year-old Jimmy Hopkins as he goes through the hilarity and awkwardness of adolescence. Beat the jocks at dodge ball, play pranks on the preppies, save the nerds, kiss the girl and ultimately navigate the social hierarchy in the worst school around. Bully is divided between six chapters and many different missions which takes place in certain weather season much like Mafia II. As Jimmy Hopskins, a 15 year old mean bully, you are free to roam around the school or complete your classes like what normal student do or do what you do best, skip class and bully.There is no denying that the game is a console port but a well-made one. The controls is a bit weird but you'll get to it eventually once you get used to them. The game is a bit repititive but that's just a minor problem I had with the game.			"

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is a Rockstar Games production, which originally was released for the Playstation 2 in 2006, and for the PC in 2008. You play in third-person as Jimmy Hopkins, a scrappy, teenager who attends Bullworth Academy, a school of bullies. You join and fight for different groups such as; Jocks, Preppies, and Nerds, and complete missions and objectives  to help bring peace to the various factions within the school, as well as the town of Bullworth itself. The story is interesting and portrays Jimmy as a protagonist and at times antagonist as well. Bullworth is a fictional town, which is supposed to exist somewhere in the Rockstar created Grand Theft Auto Universe. The game comes with a single player mode, competitive multiplayer, as well as various mini-games. The Scholarship Edition uses a newer game engine than the original, and feels a lot like a GTA game at times. Graphically speaking, it is a 2008 game, so it's 8-years-old right now, and it looks like it, but it is still fun to play. The PC port feels different than the original PS2 version, and seems a little off, but that could just be because of the different engine used on the port. It's still a fun game and if you enjoyed the original, you should enjoy the PC Port as well.			"

												Bully is an open world school simulator of some sort where you bully people. Well no, Bully is like Grand Theft Auto, except you play as a 15 year old academy student who is placed on the worst school in the country because his mom and stepfather decided to go on a honeymoon, and they needed a place where they could set him off.In Bully you're set to do typical favours and missions to earn status around the school so people won't be bullying eachother anymore, and as far as that goes; not so well. So while you're on your mission for success in school, you still have the normal school courtesy to go to classes, skip classes and you will be punished to do school chores around the place.During free roam, the game allows for a ton of stuff you can do outside the school after doing certain missions, and it is in great fun to do so collecting odd things to get some random stuff.PROS:-Great soundtrack-Long and fun game-Has things to do when you get bored of missions-Freedom to do what you want-Fun side activites-Fitting atmosphereCONS:-Few bugs here and there-PC controls are horrying, get a controller if you have-PC controls are bad-Did I mention PC controls?'All in all, I would rate this game 9/10.

There's just constant crashes, i've tried every fix and unless you limit the game to two cores and run at 800x600, all you're going to do is crash.It's very unfortunate, but unless Rockstar actually does something to fix this, I can't reccomend you buy it.

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an edgy, unique and highly colorful RPG from the golden age of gaming. This game oozes character, charm and is an absolute classic by Rockstar Games, the lords of open world games such as GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas. The gameplay is fast, satisfying and the environment of Bullworth Academy and surrounding areas is seamless and very well constructed. The world is a perfect size and travelling on your skateboard or bike feels smooth and enjoyable without feeling like a chore at all. The soundtrack in Bully is simply sensational. I have almost 25 hours in the game and I still hear new tracks that come up in different missions and they capture the mood perfectly. The graphics aren't entirely horrible for a 10 year old game either - it has native 1440p support and there are excellent guides that help you remove the 30fps cap and add nice graphical overhauls like SweetFX. Crashes can happen although I didn't have many. Save when you can! Definitely a must play for any Rockstar enthusiasts or fans of old school open world games such as Psychonauts. One of the most colorful and individual games I've ever played. Play Bully! "

												Should not be sold in its current state. Many will claim the fixes to get this running on newer operating systems are trivial, but there are numerous, they're not guaranteed, and no one should be forced to go through them. Many will claim ""it works fine for me"" which is the most unhelpful statement in all of PC gaming when it comes to the numerous different configurations. But the fact of the matter is, possible fixes include:1. Running the game in Compatibility mode for Win XP SP32. Running as Admin3. Limiting CPU Affinity to cores 0 and 14. Limiting your system's usable ram to 2GBAnd the list goes on with all kinds of remedies to get this working. Grand Theft Auto 4 was patched very recently as of posting this review, it is not impossible. Until then, for all intents and purposes, this game should be taken off this platform.			"

												Bully aka Canis Canem Edit,I First played it in 2006 when I was 8 and I still play it till this day. It's one of my favourite games of all time.A lot of people call this a GTA type game without as much violence and I would sort of agree to some extent.You cannot steal cars or shoot guns, weapons vary, you can use for example a slingshot or firecrackers, my favourite is the spud gun. Travelling is not bad nor good, you can get around on either your Vespa Scooter, Skateboard or bikes.going to classes in this game is actually fun, my favorite is music and shop, in shop for example you work on bikes and if you get the bike fixed you get to keep it so instead of buying bikes you can unlock them.The community for this game is great, people still make mods for this game which is fun for doing playthroughs.One of my favorite things about this game is the background music/score. Rockstar Games did a really good job and it fits the game perfectly. Story in this game is interesting, the opening cutscene explains why Jimmy is at this school so I won't spoil anything or say anything else. Tl;dr,,1 of my fav games of all time, sfw gta type gameplay. good story and music/background score.This game for it's normal price or even better on a discount is worth it. pray for bully 2.			"

It has a much more toned down violence compare to the GTA series, just from fist fights to sling-shots, and etc. Graphics are dated but gameplay is very fun. Not only that but the game also contains many great and memorable soundtracks.			"

												Ok. Bully. Where do I start with this game... particulary the Scholarship Edition.Well for starters, Bully (also known as Canis Canem Edit) was first released in October 17th 2006. Damn, the game is almost 10 years old... anyway, it was released on that date and at the time, only for the Playstation 2. It was published by Rockstar Games and developed by Rockstar Games Vancouver. 2 years later, an updated version of this game was released, in March 4th 2008, with the title ""Bully: Scholarship Edition"". It was an updated re-release that pretty much corrected a few bugs in the game and added new content and characters.I'll start with the story, here. The game puts you in the shoes of a 15 year-old boy named Jimmy Hopkins, who has been expelled from a lot of other schools in the United States for many reasons. We're talking about stuff like foul language, disrespecting staff, violence, etc. And as a result, Jimmy's mother and his new stepfather (whom we never really learn much about in the game) drop him at Bullworth Academy, while they go away on their honeymoon. Now, Bullworth Academy is probably the toughest school in the US, as it is full of bullies. And not just the students. Being aware of this, Jimmy prepares himself for the worst as soon as he sets foot inside the academy's grounds. From that point, you start meeting the rest of the game's character who... honestly are pretty good characters. Whether they're relevant to the story or not, you can interact with everybody. From fellow students to prefects to teachers. How you approach every single character is entirely up to you. The first three story relevant characters Jimmy meets are two fellow students named Petey and Gary, which are like... the opposite of each other. Petey's a bit of a shy kid while Gary's pretty much a sociopathic bully who wants to take over the school. The third character, who is like the very first you meet is Dr. Crabblesnitch, who is the principal at Bullworth.Like I said before, the academy's full of bullies and the students aren't the only bullies in there. So expect crap from everyone. Even from the nerds.Now, onto the gameplay. It's nothing different from almost every other sandbox game. Although Bully has its own unique features. But it's pretty much a huge world to explore both inside and eventually outside school grounds. Like I said, Jimmy can interact with pretty much every other NPC in the game. How do you approach people is entirely up to you. You can either try to be nice or be straight up nasty and show people who's boss.Since this is pretty much GTA inside a school, you obviously have classes to attend to. 4 of them are part of the Scolarship Edition. There's English, Chemistry, Biology, Music, Art, Photography, Math, Shop, Geography and Gym. And some of these classes are worth attending to, for some good upgrades. I don't recommend them all, unless you're trying to go for 100% completion.You also have lots of different collectibles spread throughout the academy and Bullworth Town, which once again you can try getting for 100% completion. I believe some of these collectibles reward you with stuff, too.The game is also long as there are plenty of missions and side activities to do. I did a mix of both story missions and a few side activities, which caused me to have like 29 hours put into the game. But you can probably register a lot more if you complete every single side activity, attend to every single class and pass and look for every single collectible.Last but not least, the graphics. Safe to say they did improve with the Scholarship edition, compared to the original release, back on the PS2. I personally think they look good enough for a 2008 re-release. That's all I can really say. Unfortunately I can't play the game with everything maxed out. And I'll soon explain why.Despite Bully being a great game, the PC port has a few flaws, which can make it a little unstable. First of all, I don't think it's possible for the game to run at 60 FPS in any computer. I've seen it on my computer and on a friend's. Both decent PCs. Second, the game constantly crashes on you, making you lose progress if you haven't saved in a while or if you're in the middle of a mission or a side activity. Third, I strongly recommend playing the game with a controller, if you have one at your disposal. The game... works well with mouse and keyboard, but the controls feel a little weird. So if you can, use a controller.Now while I may have mentioned a lot of pros about this game, the few cons I pointed out make it difficult for me to recommend this game for the PC. Since the game runs a lot more smoothly on the Xbox 360 and probably on the Wii, too. It's also available on PS3 and PS4, but it's Bully, not Bully: Scholarship Edition. So if you can, get it on console. If you're not able to, go with the PC version and do your best to be patient with the game.And with all of that pointed out, I say it's time for the final score. I personally give Bully: Scholarship Edition a 7/10. It's a great game with a great story, great characters, plenty of stuff for you to do and a big world for you to get lost in. But it doesn't get a higher score due to its problems on PC. If it wasn't for that, I would gladly give this game an 8 or a 9.So with that, I say go look for Bully. Hell's it's right here on Steam and it's not too expensive of a game! So go look for it, buy it and enjoy it. And don't let yourself be fooled by the title. While the game's title may sound like it's a bullying simulator, it's totally the opposite!			"

												Bully came out back in 2008, and yet I have more fun with this game than I do with a lot of games that came out around this time. This game in it's purest form is Grand Theft Auto but with children. Guns are now slingshots. Stealing cars is now stealing bikes. Hookers are now giving girls flowers to get kisses. I love this game, i'll give it a 7/10.			"

												ok, this is becoming a huge problem. Of course it works fine on windows 7, but we NEED windows 10 support. I am honstly surprised I made it past the entire game. Too bad I had to save every 10 seconds so I wouldn't lose my data. Bully is an amazing game, which is why I bought it, but rockstar needs to improve their PC ports and steam needs to pay attention to old games and their problems. A simple update to fix this issue would be just fine. I want to play this constantly, and I do, but I hate havoing to re open steam, click on Bully, wait for it to load only to be greeted by the re occuring ""Bully.exe has stoped working"" It sucks even more when you get past a hard mission or class and almost make it to the save location and the constant error pops up, stopping you in your tracks. I've gotten very far, and I don't want to restart, so please for the love of the community add windows 10 support.-love, everyone with a windows 10 computer.			"

												A timeless classic. The game world is not as big as most GTAs, but believe me, EVERYWHERE there is something interesting to do; long after you end the game and reached 100% completion, there are still tons of funny mini-games to do - besides the usual free roaming, which unlike GTA actually gets better when your wanted level arises. Go buy it, now.			"

												First of all we should give credit to Rockstar to make such a classic instead of bashing on it for not having features of recent games. I'll be talking about them but in the end I didn't mind them.This is a console port, and also at least 8 years old, so you should except crashes some odd bugs and glitches and the fact that a controller suits this game the best but it is possible to do with k&m only do not set the punching button to your mouse because it can get stuck into punching. A glitch I had while playing was while fighting the nerds and someone was holding firecrackers and he threw it next to me and we both spazzed as if we got electrocuted and both 'died'. This was one of the funniest glitches I had in a while.The AI in this game is pretty entertaining and shows how AI have evolved in the last 8 years. You notice random falling and puking when playing and also when you interact with some of them they tend to run away. Just like in real life! The girls are also fun to mess with but if you mess too much they'll stand in between your fights making you get busted most of the time.The story is pretty interesting, you are a nobody and you are forced to make an empire out of the school to stop bullying and then in the last chapter it all shatters and you have to show them again who's boss. They really portrayed most of their antagonists as douches who search for power which seemed a little repetitive to me. The map is used to it's fullest which I enjoyed, although transport wasn't always as convenient. In some missions I really had to pray to RNG Jezus because some really relied on RNG to succeed. I absolutely didn't like the asylum missions, they were so annoying to complete, glad that one of them is a side mission. It showed that the checkpoints sometimes were very off, in the side mission once caught it was mission over back to the school for the mission, and the other one dragged you out of the asylum once caught which made little sense to me.The game has a lot of side features which were worked out very well. You could follow classes, mandatory but who cares, and they gave you items or bonusses once completed correctly. You can collect rubber bands, smash gnomes or graves , or collect cards. And there are certainly a lot of combinations of clothing to try on once unlocked.The game had a wide variety of music and even different battle music depending on which faction you were facing. The music itself is actually pretty decent although no singing it's mainly good instrumental. The game also relies on stereotypes for their humor which they also pulled off pretty smoothly.All in all a good classic of Rockstar with a decently long story and worth the play for the price it asks. But keep in mind every 4 months or so it holds a 75% off sale on april, august and december.			"

												I'm not recommending this on PC, I'm recommending this on one of the consoles, just be aware that it's bugged on all systems, but it suffers most on PC.Canis Canem Edit, Or Bully is a good game. It is Rockstar's most unappreciated game. It is brilliantly paced, has excellent writing, has surprisingly solid gameplay mechanics, looks decent for its age and has great characters and voice acting. It's splashed with Rockstar Games humour, and is more than mini-GTA.However, the PC version is a poor port. The PC controls are a mess, so you need a a game controller to have effective control in all situations. It's also locked at 30 FPS by default, although there is a crack that removes the frame limiter, but to use this, you need another method of keeping the frame rate below 60FPS, or else it will run too fast.And after all of that effort, if you have a new system, during some instances of running the game, it will stutter, and nothing can stop the stuttering other than restarting until you get lucky. My old system got had zero stutter after Patch 1.2, and the 60FPS fan patch, but my new, more powerful system almost always stutters, I have to restart and restart until it decides to not stutter. It can run with no stutter, but it's a matter of luck.Because of this, I recommend buying it on console, specifically XBOX 360 or Wii for the additional content that is also on the PC version. This game is worth playing, but the efforts to optimise the game on PC are terrible.This is a modern classic, but the awful porting drags the entire package.			"

Anyway i digress this game in my opinion is pretty much GTA for kids just toned down and also has the most creative and arttactive plot, people who like running around in a sandbox world in a school enviroment.. then this is for you also i recommened this to GTA FANS just be aware this is nothing like gta but contains most elements..EXAMPLES: GTA has guns, Bully has the spudgun,potato launcher and slingshot.....GTA has wanted levels, Bully has a trouble meter so go ahead and purchase this if you'd like also prepare for a few game crashes here and there so save like a MOFO XD.........Bye!

Rockstar Games, this game got a lot of fans and it would be very sad not to see a sequel of it. Please, make us happy soon. Just inform us that you will be soon starting to make its sequel. Please, we would all become very happy. I will even try to be the first one to buy the sequel. You can even make a prequel of it. Anyway, thank you for this great game.			"

If you want run it at Windows 10 without crashing , go to the local folder of the game (Usually: Steam/steamapps/common/Bully Scholarship Edition) and right click on the Bully.exe icon, choose the compatibility mode and set it at Windows XP service pack 2, then check  the ""run as administrator"" and run it, it should be fixed and you can enjoy one of the funniest game ever!! ;)			"

												Although very simple and easy for today's standards, this game still holds up as a fun pastime. The story of a rebellious 15 year-old in a hostile school/city had several hilarious moments; the cutscenes introducing the missions are wonderful in their debauchery, as usual with these Rockstar open world games. Of course, it's more innocent and less violent than the GTAs, which was a nice change. I didn't strive for doing every optional quest, so I finished the game after a little more than 15 hours, completing almost 68% of the content; but there's a lot more to do if you want to explore the whole map or engage in the several minigames.

												Let me get the negative out of the way first. The controls are very clunky and counterintuitive at times, which is sorta to be expected from a Rockstar game ported to PC. Expect to tap the Alt key quite a bit to run. The game might get a little buggy at times, like getting stuck getting on bikes or in cutscenes. For some reason there's a 30 FPS cap, but there's a modded version of the .EXE that raises it to a nice smooth 60 FPS. But some missions get bugged in the 60 FPS version, which is annoying. That's the bad stuff.Now the GOOD stuff: Pretty much everything else. The in-game universe is very lively; no two students or people look exactly alike (even though you may see them repeat inexplicably), and they all have different personalities and voice actors. You get everything you'd expect out of a game that lets you play as a bully at school: wedgies, Chinese burns, stuffing peope in lockers, swirlies, ""Kick Me"" signs, stink bombs, you name it. There's a decently sized open town to explore outside the school as you progress, and a nice selection of weapons to unlock as you go. Once you get the hang of the controls, the combat is fun and satisfying. But I think the best thing about this game is all the awesome music you'll hear. The game even comes with the soundtrack. A good game overall, priced reasonably well, and definitely worth checking out.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Basically, this game takes Rockstar's GTA open world sandbox style of gameplay and applies it to a high school setting. It doesn't quite have the length or scope as a Grand Theft Auto game but I think what it offers fits the style of game.The porting job is really bad. And at times it almost makes it unplayable. The controls are very awkward to use. It's hard to target someone when you're trying to fight them. The mouse becomes way too responsive when you try to move the camera during certain activities like riding a bike. And the mini games in class are often cumbersome when using a keyboard. If you think you can't get over these problems then this game is probably not for you. But if you are a slightly more patient and forgiving gamer, then when you stick with this game it might actually surprise you how fun it can be.Overall: this game actually pretty fun and entertaining.

												**In this review I won't be putting preformance issues when playing on Windows 10 into consideration****Huge fanboy review**Whenever someone asks me what my favorite video game is I point to Bully. My dad randomly bought me the original on the PS2 as a surprise birthday gift when I turned 8. I didn't think much of it and played it with the kids that showed up to my birthday party. The original Bully on the PS2 was not much different, but the Scholarship Edition available on PC and Xbox360 make the game even better than the original. To start off, Bully has the best soundtrack I have ever heard, it fits so well with the cliques in the school, the classes you attend, the school itself, the overall ambience and aesthetic of the game. The story may seem a bit corny but it is a T rated Rockstar game. Pretty much every chapter in the game is designated to one clique whether it be Bullies, Jocks, Greasers, Nerds, Preps, Dropouts, and finally non clique (which don't really get their own chapter). You have an in game time in which you have to attend classes, sleep, shop, etc. The classes also help you progress through the game unlocking special abilities and weapons for attending. These include Chemistry, English, Art, Gym, Biology, Music, Shop, Photography, Geography, Math. With each having you attend 5 times until you finish the class. All these things I mentioned make the game just so mezmerizing to me. I can't explain how much love I have for the style this game gives. Simple things  in this game just make me go insane, like the Carnival's freak show, the unique textures, the way how a light buzzes as you are running to your dorm way past your curfew, the police sirens that can be heard in the distance as you are roaming the school doing tasks for other students, I almost feel insane on how much subtle things I get so aroused by. Honestly I can keep going on about the things that just make this game so ♥♥♥♥ing perfect but I'm getting tired and its 3:21 AM.  I give Bully a 10/10, Ten years of my life have passed since I got it when I was 8 and it still stands as my favorite game ever made.			"

You get to bully the crap out of people, beat them up senseless and throw marbles at grown ups, what else can you ask for?

												I'll give you a quick break down. Dated Graphics, repetitive missions and funky camera controls. Those are really the only negatives about the game. I think the game is great. The missions could be a bit more diverse, but you can't get what you want always. Go play a demo or something. The game is really worth €9.99. If you're on the fence, get off. Try the demo if you're really worried, but how can you go wrong with a rockstar game at that cost?			"

												The 30 hours I played this, was fantastic. Im impressed with the graphics, impressed with the fighting, impressed with the story. And as a GTA player, I like to return to this and just relax, not stealing cars, killing everyone, etc etc, I like to just play Bully because of its originality. and recently I heard there coming out with a bully 2! I'll keep my hopes at a minumum, because, usually if it takes them this long to do it, they are gonna be in the GTA V mood, and add in alot more. Like maybe hes in his late 20's now annd he startes stealing cars and all that crap. But, not many games are based in school anymore. Alot are now just TURN SHOOT RUN DOWN A HALL SHOOT LOOK LEFT SHOOT TURN RIGHT SHOOT, WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND GET A 5 KILL STREAK! WE WIN! Thats why I like bully.			"

												funny game lol definitely would recommend. People who has windows 10 would experience in game crashes and its very annoying if you don't save so i'm writing down a guide on how to stop the crashes.1.First you want to start the game.2.After opening the game, you should open your task manager.3.Look for details and find Bully.exe4.Right click Bully.exe then click the Set Affinity 5. You want to Uncheck everything except CPU 0 6. After doing so, you could close the task manager ang go back to your game. Hope this guide would help.  :)			"

												You play the part of a school kid who isnt willing to learn, after being sent to a school you hate, you meet up with a few friends and try to take over and move up the ranks.The game is played out in the style of GTA without all the cool stuff, graphics are not brilliant but it is an old game, good for its time.You may get really bored at the start of everything as it takes a little time to get interesting, the place opens up as you progress through the game and you get to explore a whole lot more, this is when it gets fun, theres so many silly mission you gotta do and tasks to make you laugh, aswel as the classes you have to attend meanwhile, and as you run around the school and streets you can cause alot of trouble, which is the part everyone loves.The basic story is you gotta try and be king of the school, the biggest badest bully, but theres someone who stands in your way, so you gotta slowly make your way to the top by completing alot of tasks to lead you there, its all pretty easy and theres plenty of hours to keep you occupied (around 15hrs for the main storyline).Overall not a bad game really, lots of fun once you get into it, maybe best buying at a discount price just to make sure you feel you got your moneys worth, as this might not grow on everyone, worth a shot tho.

Overview:Bully is a not so famous game from Rockstars repertoir, where you take the role of a teenager Jimmy Hopkins as he is transfered against his will at Bullworth Academy, after being abandoned by his mother as she goes in her honeymoon with her new husband. Labeled by many as ""GTA, but in High School"", and I can see why that happened. You could make connections between the two concepts, such as street gands being replaced by student factions, and you being free to cause as much mischief as you want, stealing cars becomes stealing bikes and so on. While this is an old game and unfortunately a not that well polished console port, it certainly has that Rockstar imprint on it and it is a worthwhile experience.The Pros: Open World - The game features a small, but spacious town full of things to do, customizations to get, items to collect and so much more. All this while respecting the school schedule or suffering the concequences. You are also free to cause problems, fix them, just have fun or romancing with the ladies. Character Development and Great NPCs - I always expected from Rockstar this kind of character progression and NPCs. You start out as a social outcast, who hates everybody and eventually build your way up the social ladder and become everyones favorite. About the NPC's some would say they are quite bland and exagerated, though I think that was exactly what the developers aimed at. There are several major groups: The Bullies, the Nerds, the Greasers and the Preppss. All of them so evidently and heavily stereotyped, it is meant to make fun of them, and I would say it is the perfect combination between cringing and laughing. Realism - While the games graphical capabilities aren't someting to behold, as its an old game and *ahem* a console port, the game makes up for it in the details. You fail school if you don't get to classes, you get punished if caught outside past curfew or not wearing the school uniform to class, almost every action you do will raise or lower other factions respect towards you, and many more details.The Cons: Console Port - While I'm not trying to bash or blame consoles here, because this is just a mere port, navigating through the menus is done only via the keyboard, some binding being rather... unintuitive. Sometimes the loading screens will cause the game to crash while rendering at 1080p. Compatibility Issues - Usually this shouldn't be a concern. I managed to play this game rather well without (many) crashes in Windows 8.1 x64, but sometimes the game can be unresponsive on launching and many small bugs that Rockstar never adressed. It's not that bad that you can't deal with it or fix it yourself, but I would have expected more from this game.Conclusion:Is the game optimised? No. Can it get a tad repetitive? Yes. But is it fun? Hell yes. I recommend this game for any nostalgic Rockstar fan, and for everyone that wants to reimagine their highschool shenanigains as a unfortunate, almost abandoned, family-issues having teenage boy.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												This is mostly the most funniest game I've ever played. No game has made me laugh in tears.Throwing a Firecracker has never been so fun.9.7/10Review:I've never played the PS2 version in my life, so this is my very first time playing Bully. When I found out about it, people said it's like GTA. Now I have to say: I really dislike GTA myself. But looking at the screenshots for the game, I was like, this doesn't look like GTA at all. I played it for an hour, and I was really into it, and when I threw a FireCracker at someone and got busted, I laugh so hard I couldn't breath and was in tears (No joke.)This game has a very good plot. It takes place with a kid named ""Jimmy Hopkins"" who got a new stepdad, and is going to BullWorth Academy for being expelled by all of the schools he has been too. BullWorth has loads of bully, and it's Jimmy's job to stop the bullies by beating them up, doing some tasks, etc. The characters are well though out, some annoying, some likable, and some dislikable. You might like Jimmy the best.Gameplay is a bit of a key masher, and using Shift as attack is just unconformable, even running around is just awkward, and aiming is a huge pain with a mouse considering how slow the sanity is. So having Controller Support is great. The Gameplay adds more things to use in combat, which is nice so that it doesn't get repetitive. Game has Missions as well, and every single Mission is different. You can even learn new moves from Gym or the Hobo Guy. Mini-games are great as well, and though out.Graphics are kind of Meh, but hey, it's an old game. Bugs do happen though, and some of the Physics on character can sometimes be weird, even in Cutscenes  (Example: Some guy's leg twitching, characters go through some things, etc.) The soundtrack is great, it really puts you into the mood like when getting chased by a teacher/police-men, in fights, etc. Interacting with other people in the town gives the town life, so that it doesn't feel empty, and it's open world, so that's awesome too. If you get accomplish anything, it's very rewarding, and if you get busted or fail, it feels punishing.This game is great with humor as well, and the game is great by itself, even it's beautiful FPS.Overall:+Gameplay+Story+More weapons when playing the game more+FPS+Mini-games+Great characters+Open World+Humor is great+Controller Support+Awesome Soundtrack, really puts you into the mood.+/- Graphics are Meh-Poor, Awkward controls with M/Keyboard-Weird Physics that happens sometimes.-BugsYou should get this game. If you have the money, get it.9.7/10EDIT I:I realized that the music doesn't loop in mini-games. That really sucks that it doesn't loop, because they are catchy. I even relized that I can raise the sanity when using the mouse in the options. That's better to make up the awkward controls for M/Keyboard.EDIT II:I beaten the game. For 15 dollars, it was worth it on how long the game is.EDIT III:It turns out you can play freely when you beat the game. It gives you the Missions you missed, and you can finish the classes you missed. I'm trying to get 100% on this game, and it might take a while.			"

												Bully is a very good sandbox game. The PC port isn't that great: a controller is highly recommended for playing, but if you have one you shouldn't encounter any serious problems.There is a very good variety in missions, keeping things from becoming stale. The combat is still fun, though not difficult, but the game doesn't lean on it too hard. The developers used their imagination not just for mission objectives, but also for the mechanics you'll use to accomplish them. There is very little one-and-done, with the developers instead first introducing you to concepts to make sure you know how to use them when the missions come along.The school and the surrounding towns are very fun to explore, which is important to a sandbox. Each area has a distinct feel to it, and there are plenty of routes and vehicles to get around on. Customizing Jimmy's outfit is executed well, with a good selection of sensible outfits and zany articles of clothing to make an outfit to suit whatever mood you happen to be in. It would be better if you could store more than one custom outfit at a time, and scroll through the articles of clothing more quickly, but the end result is still great.I very much recommend Bully. It's great fun to play, and has a lot of personality to it.			"

												Bully could have been dubbed: ""The mischievously violent adventures of high school."" condensing the entire spirit of the game. Think of it as a silly Rockstar take on the path to adulthood, taking wrong turns every nook and cranny.This is not a children's game though, as the humour is typically Rockstar-borderline, which is absolutely great.Has some technical issues with windows 10, but still more than worth suffering through.

												One of Rockstar's golden gems that, sadly, has seemed to fall through the cracks. While not as grand in scope as Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption, Bully was certainly as detailed for its time, and the PC version omits none of the finer touches. Although the interface is subpar, it is easily dealt with, and a minor hindrance at best. The combat, so to speak, is somewhat of a middle ground between Rockstar's earlier work, such as Vice City and San Andreas, and its latter work, namely Grand Theft Auto IV; while serviceable, it's not very inventive in its mechanics, per se, but rather with the imaginative weapons it puts at your disposal. Bags of marbles and stink bombs are more memorable than, say, an assault rifle and a shotgun, if purely for the novelty of their use. To a large extent, that philosophy explains the charm of this game. While not rare for any media to take a satirical look on American schooling, Rockstar pulls it off in such a way that the plot, although unsurprising, is laced with charm. It's unique to watch a frankly idiotic protagonist emerge as a flawed hero through less-than-cliche means, and mostly for his own benefit, instead of some altruistic need to help his schoolmates. As always, the writing is truly where Rockstar shines. I wish this game had gotten a sequel, but, as we pass the ten year anniversary of its release, that looks less and less likely. As such, Bully will have to stand on its own as a memorable critique of the farce that is the American education system.			"

												Bully is one of my Top 5 games of all time. It's got the classic Rockstar storytelling quality, and the gameplay is just as fun as the best GTA games.Bully though is special to me because of the school theme...it reminds me a lot of being in High School in the late '90s. I can relate a lot to the main character, Jimmy, because I didn't belong to one particular ""clique""; I had friends and enemies in all of them. I was bullied a lot and in turn, did my fair share of bullying (something I'm definitely not proud of).Bully specifically reminds me of the '90s because it seems to be set somewhere within that decade. Although it was released in 2006, the vibe here is of decades past. There is little to no tech...you don't see characters sporting cell phones and the only tech I can think of is the digital camera you acquire. The classrooms, cars, and overall setting look oldschool like they did in the '80s/'90s and the mischief Jimmy gets into is the same type us '80s/'90s kids got into before the days of smart phones and social media.I love this game so much that I own 3 copies...this one, Bully Scholarship for Xbox 360 (backwards compatible on Xbone), and the original PS2 version (backwards compatible on PS4). Which brings me to my next point...Sure, I love the game, and I'm thrilled to own the various versions but what prompted me to seek out alternate versions is the absolutely unstable way of how Bully Scholarship runs on Windows 10. I've tried every fix out there from different exes, compatibilty modes, processor affinity settings, to limiting the amount of RAM the program uses and Bully still crashes randomly at the worst possible times. I even followed that ""How To Make The Damn Game Work"" guide (which is the best out there) and my game still crashes. So just plan on it being unstable if you're using Windows 10. People tend to have better luck running it on Windows 7 and earlier. My only advice is to follow the steps in the guides in an attempt to minimize the crashes and save often...maybe even restart the game every 30 minutes or so.So those are my thoughts on Bully in a nutshell. I highly recommend the Scholarship Edition since it improves the graphics and adds content, like extra missions and classes. If you have an Xbox (360 or One) or Playstation (PS2 or PS4) it'd be in your best interest to pick up those versions too since they are less prone to crashes (and they are cheap). One final recommendation I have is to download and apply SweetFX with the Bully template of your choice...it really improves the colors and makes them pop. You'll also have some extra graphics options too. Best of luck with this janky port, and HAVE FUN AT BULLWORTH! \m/			"

I'd end up getting fed up redoing the same bits over and over again and uninstall, then come back months later just incase.

												It's rare that a developer goes from make a adult game about crime with very adult themes. To making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example Bully is a giant open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play, and much more to just kind of find.The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions;like the jocks or the nerds, and the more the more you do work for one faction it can effect your standing with others. Which in turn can effect the way some of the people treat you at school. The combat is very similar but instead of machine guns and rocket launches. Your playing with slingshots and stink bombs. There are also a lot of things that are different about Bully that really makes it feel like your in high school it feel very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. Like you have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class, and of you don't go the prefects or any adult of authority. All the classes have there own perks like one of the classes shows you where all the collectibles, and unlike the protagonists in GTA jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep so if your out past 2 you just pass out on the spot which can make some night missions feel a little too time restrictive.The story starts you out in a car ride with you and your mom and what seems to be your new stepdad. They then drop you off in the front of Bullyworth academy where you meet the principle and some of the teacher, but the fun starts to come in when you go to your dorm room and meet your new friend Gary, who is a sociopath, i don't know how else to put it.You soon start to become manipulated by him, and you two soon go your separate ways and you start to see less and less of him. You then start to do work for the other factions of the school. Playing Bully it kind of puts you back and makes you think about your time in high school, I know the archetypes aren't as plain and simple as they are in Bully but it does a great job of boiling a lot of the high school experience down to a 20 hour game.Then there are a few technical issues with bully I didn't really have too many other then the game crash on me a couple of times, and that just sucks after that happened for the first time a started saving much more frequently. I can't really say definitely how the game will turn out for you, but it didn't seem to bad. From my experience with it. Over all the game is well made but parts of it just seem kind of repetitive and broken;overall though I think it's a great game.			"

One of R* most underrated games and definalty worth the purchase wether you're a new player seeking a school yard brawl & firing a slingshot like Bart or an old timer who had the chance to play this gem back on ps2 or xbox and wanting to relive those first times all over again. Inital controls are poorly confgiured but simply altered to make gameplay smooth & easy.Runs perfectly fine on my Windows 8.Rockstart never dissappoints!Cheers			"

												This is a game that I played briefly about 6-7 years ago that I never completed, which is strange because I usually obsessively play the story in Rockstar games to completion. Chances are if you wanted to play this game at some point you have by now. Coming back to this in 2016 was rough graphically and gameplay-wise. However, once you get past the rough edges, this is a game where the sheer lunacy of the tasks you are completing (such as beating up midgets dressed like Christmas elves, helping a drunk santa find his drugs, collecting panties for the peverted gym teacher) still makes this game playable. The story has major holes and meanders throughout, but the characters and setup for missions remain entertaining. The combat and skateboard/bike are fun if at times a little clunky. Last but not least, the soundtrack is pretty incredible (no hyperbole), though you'll hear the main theme over and over again. The only way I  can recommend this game in 2016 is if you somehow missed it in years past and care more about atmosphere and mood of a game than the mechanics itself. This is a really cool little offshoot that Rockstar has done aside from the GTA games. At the price you're likely to get it at nowadays, it's a cheap, laid back time if you missed out on this little piece of Rockstar's history. The obvious downside is the graphical fidelity that really makes you appreciate how good games look nowadays, in addition to audio bugs that take away from the overall presentation. If you don't play it, at least give the soundtrack a listen.			"

It's about the atmosphere, the groove that comes out of that Highschool parody. I don't know how to explain it, it's something really special.On top of everything you get an incredible, post-punky soundtrack written by Shawn Lee that couldn't suit the game any better. Would pay dem 10 bucks just for the soundtrack's digital copy haha.I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Bully is an excellent game and the ways to have fun are endless. However, this port does not work well if your OS is Windows 10. On Windows 10, you have to run it using compatibility mode by using the options Windows XP or Vista, which is fine. But even with running with campatibility mode, the game still crashes frequently to the point where you have to save after every mission just to be extra cautious in case if your game crashes. I honestly wish that Rockstar would fix this issue to make it work better for the people who have Windows 10 because a lot of people (like myself) have been having the same problem. I highly doubt the developer is going to make a patch though because this game has been out for years and they are too busy with GTA V. This review is not about the game, but it is about the PC port itself. Once you get past the crashes, Bully is very enjoyable and one of my favorite games. I highly recommend playing the original version on the PS2 or getting the Wii version of the Scholarship Edition. Those two releases run the best, in my opinion and I had very little issues with them.			"

												Sooo... I am doing a new review for my readers (currently none). Bully is Rockstar Games' GTA in school. But instead of killing people you just knock them out. But combat is a small part in Bully.It's class mini-games are fun and make you use your brain too. And don't try to skip class. The prefects will get you. And being a naughty little Jimmy will get you to do chores.Bully's story is deep and great. It has some crude humor and some small laughs that make this game a gem. Like every Rockstar game.Bully might not have rainbow graphics for 2008 but this is a port of 2006's Rockstar game Bully : Canis Canem Edit. Canes Canem means dog eats dog in latin...I did not focus on the gameplay part of bully but you need to try it out. Violence, dark humor, makin' out with taller chicks and more high-school violence... And this gets a : Badass seal of Badassery. "

												Now I finally know it's not easy being 15 years old rebel! Thanks to Rockstar!!!I recommend it to everyone who likes open world games, can play in third person perspective and who would like to try something new. Bully brings many hours of fun as you go through main story missions and some optional side missions. You can attend lessons at Bullworth Academy to unlock some extra items or skills.I really like how they made intro videos before start of story missions.They are very interesting to watch and if you fail some missions you are able to skip intros. I like how the story involves several groups of students - Bullies, Nerds, Preppies, Greasers and Jocks.In Bully it matters in which period of the day are you doing your missions. It will be necessary not to be seen by authorities at times you should attend your lessons or at the nighttime. Don't forget to be in bed latest at 2 or.. I won't tell you what ;) No spoilers!Later on you can explore different areas, play mini games, bike race, swim, fight, have romantic relationships and kiss girls and more!Even though Bully: Scholarship Edition is one of my favourite open world games, I want to point at some cons. The game was impossible to play&enjoy with mouse and keyboard. With controller it's simply perfect! The second thing I don't like is the system of saving player's progression. You are not able to save when you have a mission running and it's possible to save only after finding a save book. The concept wouldn't be that bad, if the game was actually stable and wouldn't crash very often. But in the current state, it can be very disturbing.* * * RECOMMENDED * * * Now it's time to give us a sequel, Rockstar! :)			"

												Welcome to Bullworth Academy, a melting pot of high school stereotypes. Outsiders are making plans to rule the world, teachers terrorize their pupils, sports aces and rock 'n rollers try to impress the girls while the posh students wrinkle their nose. While the GTA-style game itself is well done, the technical conversion to the PC is a bit sloppy. Should you ever be asked why video games are a cultural asset, show them Bully.			"

												I really like this game, it helped me express my anger way back in the days. when I was was a kid I was bullied at school by some big dumb doofus heads. I would often come home and play this game to take out my aggression. It felt REALLY good beating up some fat nerds, and even better beating up some dumb jocks, like the ones that beat me up. Although to be fair, they only beat my up because they were jealous of me and my SMOKING hot GF who had big boobies (she weighed 450 pounds, mostly because of boobage) and they would call me stuff like ""Gay"", ""Weak"", ""Pony loving ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" because sometimes I wore my super cool 20% cooler rainbow dash T. The jocks also called me a dumb gay♥♥♥♥♥♥because I would wear super-awesome-supreme-ultimate-ninja shirts like Naruto or some super-cool-awesome-beat-em-up Attack on Titan T shirts. One day I went home, and asked miku what I should do. She said I should challange them to a dance off. Long story short, I won. the dumb jocks cheated and tried to beat me up instead of dancing because of their super inferior dance moves, and their inability to pull off a fedora.Anyway, I'm a lot stronger now because I've been drinking a lot of diet coke (so im also skinnier) because I use to drink a lot of regular coke.Good game, I'd recommend it, especially to all of you enlightened by your own intelligence.

												This game is cool... the story to the game play will keep you busy. If you are willing to deal with a GTA San Andreas engine from the original xbox during game play however, will be a whole different story. The game starts out with you being a delinquent coming from a step-father sort of relationship. You get dropped off at this academy for behavioral correction and your journey starts there.Throughout completing the story, you are able to acquire new sort of weapons or skills (such as dynamite or a strong uppercut). When fighting, the player is able to make fun of that person. I'm not one for violence but when I got swung at by a jock I kept kicking and making fun of him while he was down. When not in combat options to down talk or up talk someone is also available. There are requirements to go to class and perform quick time events. Some classes or learning new knowledge allows the bully player to unlock more. When running around at night time or when engaging in a fight, supervisor teachers are around and will make it a case to chase you down if you cause enough ruckus. The graphics are alright and will keep a veteran gamer happy as one grew up without HD. This may bug some to a point and may lead to a person putting down the game sooner rather than later. I like the game, but since it is bit out dated and having played more than my fair share of GTA's since the first I'll have to rate it is an average :RATING : 7.1/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-EDIT : Upon playing it more, I'm starting to play it simply for the experience (duhhh) but it's turning out to be quite enjoyable. Problem is I'm friends with a bunch of nerds and all the bullies want a piece of me.			"

												Bully... where to start?You play the role of Jimmy Hopkins, after getting expelled from numerous schools you get placed on Bullworth Academy. A school full of bullies, nerds and annoying teachers.You go around helping people, going to classes, pulling pranks, bullying people, going to the carnaval and alot more!Bully: Scholarship Edition uses a newer game engine than the original from 2006, it does look like a 2008 game but still has a really good school atmosphere.There are some downsides though, the pc controls are verry clunky and can make it annoying to play at times. The game crashes alot and this can make it really frustrating when you haven't saved after doing a few missions. Altough there are fixes on the internet, they still don't prevent the game from crashing at all. Over all i would highly recommend Bully: Scholarship Edition, if you're a fan of openworld games with wide variety of content. Bully is an amazing interesting, refreshing and creative experience!

												Under normal circumstances, I would not be giving Bully a bad review.Bully is a great game. One of my all time favourites. I sing its praises all the time. I tell everybody who hasn't played it to play it. It's killing me to not recommend it, believe me. This game means a lot to me.BUT....The PC port is awful. It's been eight years since Scholarship Edition was released and the issues are still here. You might not suffer from the god-awful glitches, but your game will crash unexpectedly a lot.I looked up so many different techniques and solutions to avoid getting your game crashed. I've tried them all, and there's always this small sense of panic and dread just waiting for the game to crash at any minute after trying the latest solution, and it never dissapoints in that regard!It's a damn shame. For lots, Steam may be their only way to get to experience the greatness that is Bully, and while it is possible to finish the game's campaign on the constantly-crashing PC port, it will be a long, uphill battle to do so, and it shouldn't be that way. Great game, awful port.			"

												I love bully. I've played every version of it. This PC version crashes alot for me and the controls are very akward (I use a Keyboard and mouse, and don't have an official xbox controller). I hear only the official xbox controller works for the game. As Much as I love bully and rockstar games, I would have to NOT recommend this game for PC/Steam.			"

												While I'm generally a fan of Rockstar products, this game just is completely unstable no matter how I changed the Window's compatibility settings for the executable (Tried XP SP3, Vista, etc... and no luck). It crashes every few minutes on Windows 10 with no fix in sight. I can't recommend anyone buy this if you're running Windows 10 as you'll never really get to enjoy the game when it crashes every 3 minutes losing your progress.			"

												This was initially a negative review, saying that the game would randomly delete your save. After trying compatibility options, I have decided to revert to a positive review.

Do you wedgie the occasional meat-head jock? Yeah. Do you throw stink bombs into girl's dorms? Totally. Do you give swirlies to preppy kids? Of course!

												Kinda like a toned down school boy mini world semi GTA aspect game!Graphics: The graphics are not the best and certainly okay for the game. You might be annoyed at the style of it like I was!Controls: I used an Xbox controller because I originally played the game on Xbox so I automatically knew my way around it when playing Audio: The audio is simple at such with some cool affects added like bullying sounds, marbles and tripping people up etc Game: This is overal a good game.I have played some hours on this game and I like the design of the game.Yes Rockstar cannot make a proper PC game, and this game is no different.  It has the bugs and problems like all Rockstar games, but then you look past them because you are a Bully.You get to do things that you normally do not think about in a game, you kinda get a free roam where you get go karts, bikes etc and ride around the local town terrorising so that part is enjoyable.The way the game goes about the classes feel like a mini game in the game, so the design is good.I would actually like to see an updated version of Bully, like a Bully 2 with some nice graphics would be nice.Would I recommend this game? Yes it only 60% of me.			"

												One of my all time favorite Rockstar games, which I personally enjoyed much more than the likes of GTA IV and V. I played Bully all the time my PS2 when it came out a decade ago and, wanting to relive that nostalgia, recently picked it up on sale for a few dollars. Unfortunately most of the reviews did not mention how absolutely broken it is for Windows 10. And when I say broken I mean crashing literally every 15 or, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes. And for an older game with no autosave function that means redoing missions, classes, and favors again, and again, and again. I am aware there are many ""fixes"" to the crashing issue, I've spent hours searching for all of them, but not one of them has worked for me. Some report that their game works fine and some of the solutions have solved their crashing problems, but beware that many of the solutions that work for some do not work for others. It's a shame that such an outstanding game was given such an abysmal pc port, but as it is now I can not recommend it.TLDR: One of Rockstar's best games, but one of its worst pc ports that is plagued by random and frequent game crashing.

General info~Genre: Open world, action, school simulator, third person~Number of players: 1~Completion time: 15-35 hours~Adolescent protagonist~Rockstar Vancouver productStrong points+Detention vs Prison: Bully: Scholarship Edition isn't just a GTA (Grand Theft Auto) with younger felons. Rockstar Vancouver created a unique world where attending classes and spending time with your roommates and girlfriends is more important than owning a city or harassing opposing operations. By playing Bully you will have the chance to reminisce stories from your own childhood / school years. Of course, there are strong similarities to other Rockstar titles, but give the game a chance before judging it too harshly.+Narrative: From zero to school's most recognizable figure, our hero will rise to success through a clever script filled with some bold ideas. The game is divided into chapters with different events, weather conditions and rising adversaries.+Characters: A believable protagonist, an elite school, a carnival full of freaks, a drunk homeless Santa, Bullworth has them all. In addition to the town, Bullworth Academy is a bustling community housing different factions: from the dorky nerds and perverted teachers to the strict prefects and snooty cheerleaders. Some of them serve as companions, possible love interests or even chapter bosses!  Many of the characters will affect Jimmy's road to the riches in numerous ways. Feel free to run the rest over with yourscooter.+Rock around the clock: Bully features a time-based world. Different quests or characters may appear depending on the time so stay alert at all times. Just remember to return at your dormitory before 2:00 am lest you fall asleep on the pavement!+I own you: Feel free to expand around town and own different places. These save spots function aptly as bases for sleeping or hiding from the authorities.+I'm out of powder: Unique weaponry that suits Bully's atmosphere. Itching powder with a notorious stun effect, slingshot for taking care of business from afar, even a bottle rocket launcher for throwing... ehh... deadly glass at your enemies!+Know your body: Throughout the game you will have the opportunity of attending classes. They are not mandatory but passing them will grant you useful skills such as secret revelation on map or persuasion of girlfriends in order to... increase your overall vitality by 100% . Feel the power of love, baby.+Watch the trilby, boy: Many clothes to customize Jimmy with. Dress him like an elf, Christopher Columbus or mafia leader. Afterwards, pay a visit to the barber shop for taking care of that big head of yours.+Those yellow spots: Except for classes and random mayhem you will also have to complete quests in order to advance the game. I found the majority of them entertaining, novel and of normal difficulty. In addition to the main challenges, Bully features side quests and secrets scattered around town offering unique prizes: Lawn mowing, protecting nerds harassed by bullies, even cart racing.+Murder on the dance floor: Instead of songs or radio stations, Bully features different instrumental themes fitting for each occasion. Example: 


YouTube™ Video: Bully Scholarship Edition Soundtrack - Nerd Fight Theme 

			Views: 100,480		

			This Is The Soundtrack / OST For Bully Scholarship Edition When the nerds get angry.		

+Length: Neither to long for gamers who get bored easily nor too short for those who cherish free roaming and secret hunting.+Full controller supportWeaknesses-Jimmy is a beast: He possesses unlimited stamina, accuracy prowess and herculean strength. Kidding aside, you can run without having to stop to take a breath. I do not find it as a major weakness but certainly drops the difficulty a bit for some gamers.-”Adrian, I did it!”: You can still finish the game without passing any classes. This takes one of the strongest parts of Bully away, so invest some time on them just to fill more of a student and less of a petty criminal.-You missed a spot: I found out that a few quests are permanently lost if end-chapter missions are finished prior to them. Always make at least two save spots if you are a completionist.-Problematic adaptation: Before publishing this review, I played the original Bully on my PS2 to compare it to this version. Although Scholarship edition is an accurate port, many players complain about the frame rate being locked at 30 frames per second. I finished the game with no mods installed, on Windows 8.1 and I did not experience a single crash. Nevertheless, whether you experience any bugs or you just want to unlock the frame rate, there are mods to aid you.My rating5/5During the Playstation 2 era certain games suffered from weak or limited advertising and weren't known to a broader audience. Glass Rose, Bully, Shadow of memories and Okami  are among them. Bully: Scholarship edition is an entertaining game with a novel plot in a notorious and addicting universe. Feel free to check it out whether you are an open world enthusiast or a casual gamer looking for some fun. "

												Bully is an open-world crime game that playfully twists the formula of its Grand Theft Auto cousins. Set in an unforgiving private school, you’re tasked with taking down the school’s feuding social cliques as a bully who fights bullies using any means necessary. Instead of firearms, you’re given the arsenal of a traditional schoolyard prankster (itching powder, stink bombs, slingshot, etc.) and follow a series of diverse missions that have you racing bikes, winning boxing matches, delivering papers, painting graffiti, and even playing rhythm games. This variety extends to a surplus of optional content in the surrounding town. The game favors density over volume, as the relatively small world feels expertly crafted. Most notably, every single student has a unique name, face, and voice, which helps the game succeed at building the “living world” that so many open-world games aspire to. You can watch these students go to class, kiss in the hallway, hang out with their cliques in the evening, and bully each other using the same pranks you pull on them. Bully’s attention to detail and gameplay variety make it a charming and unique open-world game.5/5 – Loved it.			"

												Bully is a very interesting game by Rockstar. It was clear Rockstar wanted to try something different compared to their uber violent and masochistic GTA/Manhunt franchises. So they created Bully, which is in essance a parody on the mass violence that goes on in their games.In this game you play as a former high school bully, Jimmy Hopkins. Who is a major reference to coming of age protagonists like Holden Caulfield. The plot is actually fairly interesting and has a few nice twists here and there. It molds nicely with the gameplay, which is similar to San Andreas except your weapons are things like slingshots and bottle rockets. The world itself is also unique, as the game goes on seasons change and the world reflects this nicely.Bully is one of my favorite Rockstar games, and it comes highly recommended from me. It is well worth the price of admission.			"

												Should be renamed Bully: Crash to desktop Edition. While a really fun game,I had so many instances of the game crashing on Windows 10. But there are some helpful tutorials to fix this problem. Also if you find yourself downloading the Rockstar Offical patch for the game,don't bother. The patch seems to always fail to download correctly. Aside from all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things about it,the game still proves to be very fun. I never played it when it came out but when i got the chance to play it on PC i took it and have enjoyed almost every moment. As most people say it's ""GTA but in a high schoolish setting.""			"

												I have been playing ""bully"" since it was can cainm edit (dog eats dog in latin). i have been beating over and over the graphics are a little out of date but its a really fun game. Bully was created By Take-Two and Rockstar Vancouver. You play as a boy named Jimmy Hopkins aged 15 your mum is going on her 55th honeymoon and she leaves you at bullworth academy. If you have played GTA it will feel similar.The gameplay feel much like a GTA game but has diffrent aspects to it. The comedy in this game will never get old. Its genrally a really fun and enjoyable game.final verdict: 10/10			"

VERY CRASH-FRIENDLY ON WINDOWS 10 8/10 This is a pretty fun game with an interesting story. The game is about Jimmy Hopkins's (a 15 year-old delinquent) year at Bullworth Academy, one of the worst in the country. Jimmy must gain the control of the cliques to become the king of the school, and does so through many ways, though primarily fighting. At the end of each chapter, there is a boss fight with a clique leader. When he defeats the leader, he gains the respect of that clique. Overall the game is very fun and worth a recommend, but it is warned that the game crashes a lot on Windows 10.Pros: Very fun Good story All the characters are unique, with their own fighting styles, appearances, and personalities 6 different cliques Cool weapons Bikes!Cons Very easy The game world is small, even though he transportation is much slower then GTA, the size is not proportional to a GTA game Locked at 30fps (can easily be fixed through here

			This guide is written only for the 1.200 patched version of Bully. This is the most up to date version and the one that pretty much everyone on Steam is using. -- By default, Bully's framerate is capped at 30fps.

												I loved Bully before it even came out. Very original concept, by a great developer. The result was exacty what I expected. GTA is great, but it's fun to take that whole same mechanic and place it somewhere unusual. There is just so much variety in this game. So much to discover. Such a huge world. It is frustrating that the school schedule doesn't give you enough time to explore sometimes, but I guess that sort of difficulty is what adds another layer of fun.			"

												So I LOVE Bully BUT however the PC version on any computer with Windows 10 will usally crash. It just sucks I really hope this is fixed or if Rockstar at least made Bully 2 for PS4,XB1 and PC it would be awesome because we could finally play Bully on PC again or hopefully if this Windows 10 problem doesent get fixed then hopefully Windows 11 would fix this does not mean the game is un-playable it would just be more fusturating having to worry about saving here then doing this mission before it crashes it is really annoying. So if you want ANY version of Bully and you have a PS2,XB360,IOS or a PS4 I would recommend that but if you cant get it on those then you can get it on steam it is still enjoyable but a little bit more fusterating. So at the end of the day it is not 100% borken more like 57% I would say so I do recommend this game and thanks for reading.			"

												This is a great game (or at least was on ps2) but unfortunetly, crashes alot on windows 10. I've completed this game in about a day. I keeped losing progress whenever it crashes. so im gonna  make a list of what not to do to help prevent the game from crashing. do this at your own risk if you choose not to take my advice.1. do not talk to the lunch lady unless youre doing a mission.2. do not try to save a custom outfit.3. dont exit the math class before it ends.4. (spoiler alert) when you fight russell be prepared to do that  fight over and over again. it also lags alot(then again that could just be my computer its self.)5. dont save in the principles office. always save at the boys dorm.6. be careful using the rubberband ball.I reccomend that if you have a ps2, pick up the hard copy of the game. its really cheap. or if you have windows 7, visa, or 8/8.1. it works fine on those. but it still periodiclyall of the things that make my game crash, could be totaly different on your computer. These are just things i have run into.so my final verdict, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR WINDOWS 10 UNLESS YOU LIKE LOSSING PROGRESS AND CONSTANT GAME CRASHES			"

If you do, avoid doing my mistake.I buyed it on a sale long long time ago, did not test it after maybe a year and I cant get a refund now.I think its weird Steam dont have a better routine for removing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that does not run at all.I would think it were in their best interests to provide the best possible user experience, but sadly this makes me think its only about the money.I know it is rockstar thats made this game, but as long as a game is possible to buy on Steam, the game should work on new systems. Make rockstar release a patch or tell them you will remove this game. At least give a fair warning when buying this game were you tell buyers it may not work for new systems.			"

												I played this on the ps2 when it was first released and the 360 a few years ago now and it is without a doubt my favourite childhood game and I'd recommend it to anyone. However, I've spent the best part of an hour trying to get to the main menu without crashing to no avail, trying all fixes I could find to resolve it; with no luck. I think it's disgusting that this game is still available to be purchased despite the fact that many if not most Windows 10 users can't even play the game.Great game, terrible port...Will be refunding. If you aren't on Windows 10 give it a try to see if you can make progress in the game without crashing, but make sure you only test it for less than an hour and a half to refund if need be. I don't want to completely disparage any Windows 10 users from buying this game but you'll almost definitely be in for a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of hassle.			"

												Great game, poor port. Humor, characters, story, memorable. Lots of things to do.Constant crashing on Windows 10. There are solutions but they don't work for everyone. To me, limiting my CPU to 1 processor does help with the crashing, ranging from 1 to 5 hours per crash. The 30 FPS cap is stupid but luckily you can easily remove this (google Bully uncapper).gg 8/10 would be 11/10 if it stopped crashing every 10 minutes.			"

I've played this game on the PS2 and that's exactly why I bought this game for the PC, nostalgia. This game is pretty much like GTA, but takes place in a school. You get to beat people up, break into lockers, trespass in some areas and beat more people up. Like GTA, there's always the d-head who catches you if you do these things. Instead of the police, there are school guards (at least what I think they are) they're slow, and you can run away from them, if you got caught by them, you're forced to go to class.9/10. I recommend this game. Go buy it, it's worth it!			"

Other than that and the 30 fps frame lock, the game is great in terms of performance.			"

												A true hidden gem from rockstar. Bully is just like the GTA series, a open world sandbox-style game set in an privat school. But instead of killing people you just knock them out, combat is a small part in Bully. The story is a typical college/high school story, with a large dose of classic Rockstar humor. I can recommend this to everybody who likes rockstar games, definitly worth the buy.			"

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an awesome game I can say I get nostalgia when I play it.I remember playing Canis Canem Edit (Alternate Title for Bully) on my friend's PS2 and was hooked onto the game.When I saw Scholarship Edition released I was happy as I could play the game again plus with new content like new classes.The story is really interesting and it is very easily to get sidetracked from attending classes as there is quite a bit to do while free roaming around the school campus and nearby town of Bullsworth.The trouble meter is an awesome feature and it shows what rules you are breaking, whether it be truancy, tresspassing or bullying, etc.You can bully others in this game (though that isn't the main focus as it focuses on the other school bullies) but you will be punished for it and will have to face the consequences if caught.Overall great game and sorry for the huge review.I rate Bully an 8/10 due to the fact that because it is an old game it performs poorly on Windows 7 and above with hugh crashes and performance issues on windows 10Don't just assume that because it is a Rockstar Game that it is Grand Theft Auto.

												Bully: Scholarship Edition feels and plays basically like a trimmed and a lot less violent version of GTA, taking place in a fictional school in New England.The story is pretty generic: You're new to the school and no one likes you. In order to gain respect you fight your way to the top, blah...You have to attend classes in order to unlock certain abilities, upgrades and outfits. You also play pranks on your schoolmates in order to gain reputation from the various fractions, do side events to earn some additional stuff and cash or find collectibles scattered all over the city.The playtime should be something between 15 and 20 hours, depending on how much of the optional stuff you do and how often you fail.Note that this is a console port with quite a few flaws. The keys are not re-bindable and the only options available are: Resolution, AA, VSync and Shadow quality. The game plays like crap with keyboard & mouse, so I highly recommend to play it with a XBox controller.			"

												Bully is a great game. The PC version however is good but only if you buy it through steam. I was unfortunate to by my first copy through amazon. Its not amazon's fault the product didn't work right off the bat. So I go to rockstar.com and low and behold this game has little to no support. It has one patch and the patch from the site will not install correctly if you run from their website. I looked up some pc gameplay and all the vids I found where people playing it on steam. So I went ahead and waited for a sale and got the game on steam. The game works just fine now. On a different note this game is so much better with a controller than with mouse and keyboard. At least in my opinion. If you only played the Playstation 2 version when this first came out you will be a little suprised that they added a few classes. These classes only serve as to unlock new clothing they added for your character. Otherwise its the same game you loved when you got it on Playstation 2. Now unlike other rockstar titles this is way toned down. No sex, murder, or guns. But Bully has a ton of chaotic fun that will keep you entertained and liking the story untill the end.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game. Its by Rockstar Vancourver Studio, so it has a GTA feel to it, but its kept PG13. You start out as a new kid in a rich prep school and you have to make friends early. There are several different cliques in the school from nerds, jocks, greasers, preps etc. Each clique has their own missions and quirks.This game is not as open as I like, but I still had a lot of fun. You can choose to attend class or play hookie and do the missions. If you go to class you get combat bonuses like better sling shots and stink bombs.			"

												Man, I cannot believe some of the people who gave this game a bad review. This was one of the best GTA style games I have played. The Graphics and gameplay are just ok but it the game is extremly fun to play. The charecters are really likeable and has one of the funniest story lines I have ever seen. I would defenatly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good game.Graphics: 7Sound: 9Gamplay: 6Fun: 10			"

Product received for free
												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an awesome game I can say I get nostalgia when I play it.I remember playing Canis Canem Edit (Alternate Title for Bully) on my friend's PS2 and was hooked onto the game.When I saw Scholarship Edition released I was happy as I could play the game again plus with new content like new classes.The story is really interesting and it is very easily to get sidetracked from attending classes as there is quite a bit to do while free roaming around the school campus and nearby town of Bullsworth.The trouble meter is an awesome feature and it shows what rules you are breaking, whether it be truancy, tresspassing or bullying, etc.You can bully others in this game (though that isn't the main focus as it focuses on the other school bullies) but you will be punished for it and will have to face the consequences if caught.Overall great game and sorry for the huge review.I rate Bully an 8/10 due to the fact that because it is an old game it performs poorly on Windows 7 and above with hugh crashes and performance issues on windows 10Don't just assume that because it is a Rockstar Game that it is Grand Theft Auto.

												This game is incredible. Its definitely dated by todays standards but its one of my favorite open world games ever and it still holds up to this day, I play through it once or twice a year because its just a rock solid game from the golden era of Rockstar open world games. Everything from the art and character designs to the music and voice acting is on point, its pretty clear this game was the developers' baby and they put a lot of love into the final product, and it totally needs a sequel like really, really super bad.R* pls			"

Needless to say, I was eagerly anticipating game. I even bought a top of the line Mach V rig with all the bells and whistles and a 78in monitor to take in the beauty of all. My machine has no problem handing the graphics settings on Ultra and can tell you that visually, this game has the potential to stunning (provided your computer is to the task) and you can mods.rockstar released this much anticipated game yes it did.

												Best game Rockstar ever put out...and I think that is saying a lot! A little lighter than their usual titles... this plays as kinda of a Jr version of the more violent games they come out with. While it may be lacking in blood, gore, and strong language, it makes up for it with fun. hilarious characters saying hilarious things. Awesome story line, fantastic game play, not too hard nor to easy. The map is a decent size with plenty of room to roam around. Nice amount of mission with the story, plus plenty of side missions and mini games. The Scholarship Edition even brings more to the table. Check this out, and you won't be sorry... particular with the extremely cheap sale price this week!(Dec. 17th 2013)			"

												I could just go ahead and say ""You can give wedgies to little kids and you can grope girls 10/10"" like most people do, but this game deserves a lot more than that.This is my favorite game of all times, got it for the ps2 initially and I finished it like 6 times on there. Then I got steam and had to buy it for the pc and I'm so glad I did!It really is a GTA Junior but I like it even more than the original because it's magical! I don't even know how to express myself. The world is so charismatic, the missions are great fun and make sense, the soundtrack is AMAZING and Jimmy is the best sprinter/aimer/sportsman/biker/boxer/student (if you wish to do all the classes), the best main character in general!Story is short but there is much more to it than in that, in fact if you only do the main missions I believe you don't even get 50% completion, so yeah!I recommend this game with all my heart I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Hell! If you enjoy it a quarter as much as I did you'll still have a blast! :)			"

												The sun is rising, it's a beautiful day.The alarm clock goes ""BEEP BEEP BEEP"" and you trampoline yourself into a vertical spine position called standing.""My goodness, today is the first day of school"" you hastily expel from your innards.That's right Peter, today is the first day of school but not only that my friend. Today is the first day of school at a new school.Your mother and stepfather will soon drop you off with hatred in their hearts at Bullworth Academy.There you will fight your way to the top and have everyone shout your name when you pass them.""Bully: Scholarship Edition"" they will shout repeatedlyIt will be a wonderful journey and it begins now.Bully: Scholarship Edition or more commonly nicknamed ""Jimmy"" is the main character of this video game and he's not afraid of showing it right away. The story is about him. The cutscenes star him. This is quite the problem for me because he shaves his head. This is something I do as well, for that reason I have trouble distinguishing fiction from reality and got into trouble with the police. Luckily we live in an age of mystery and magic, you don't need to play as Jimmy anymore. You can use technology called hacking to hack the video game and change the model you play as. I opted first in playing as one the adults as I thought maybe the lady folk around campus would be into more experienced men but no. No model would change the attitude they had against me, this made me sad. Hacking doesn't work on the people in the real world either.Gameplay is ""Beat the jocks at dodge ball, play pranks on the preppies, save the nerds, kiss the girl and ultimately navigate the social hierarchy in the worst school around. "" and that pretty much catches it all using the umbrella method. Now, I've only played it for 55 minutes but what I experienced during that time was wonderful. I hit people, threw books at people, hit on people, talked to people(thumps up edition), talked to people(thumbsdown edition), bought soda and meeting some kind of creature called a prefect you can easily avoid by just jumping all the time.The gameplay mechanics is what you would expect from a Rockstar PC port, somewhat clunky but generally okay. The game also features all kinds of education based mini games like chemistry, english, math, geography etc. All these subjects and their mechanics are highly representative of the American education system. In conclusion, it’s a beautiful sandbox-style game with beautiful characters and beautiful gameplay.3/10			"

												Personal Rating: 7/10Ah Bully. This games getting a sequel in 2016 so hopefully people can get hyped for that after they've stopped ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves about Fallout 4. However let's take a look at the first game.Bully is an open world game set in a school. You play as Jimmy Hopkins who is arguabley the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥on earth at the beginning of the game. Much like Rockstar's other games, you do quests located around the map to advance the story. Very GTA IV like but without any of those silly cars or mass genocides, carried out by helicopters and bowling.Gameplay wise, it's honestly nothing special to be honest. I can't feel connected to Hopkins because he's a♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I can't feel any sympathy for him or any bullies for that matter. I mean, I'm a nerd, in this game you're basically asking me to steal my own lunch money. But the jokes on him, I make my own lunch and bring it with me *pushes glasses up nose*. But nah, it's not fresh. There's nothing convincing me to do any of these actions apart from to advance the story. One new thing they added into this game is classes. No, not Call of Duty classes. As in, actual learning classes like Art, English and Science. You might be thinking ""Well what's the point in going to classes? I live the thug life"". Well, these classes can eventually give you upgrades and weapons such as stinkbombs, clothing and even a bike (which I never got, apparently my lack of skills in production and art carried over into this game). Each class revolves around a minigame, like in English for example, you have to make as many possible words out of a jumble of letters, or in Art where you have to avoid pencils and stuff to draw a picture? I don't know what they were thinking but it works I suppose.Obviously a big part of the game is combat. But it lacks a certain something. Beat 'em ups and Fighting games have never appealed to me, and Bully is basically a beat 'em up with a couple of minigames slapped on the top, with an unrelatable character and numerous little cracks in this game.However, it's still great. As much as I've complained about this game, it really is a very good game. Graphically wise it might not stand up to today's standards, however they were good for it's time. Some of the characters like the Principal and the Homeless Bloke are well made and I enjoyed the parts of the game they were in. Now obviously I haven't played all of this game, I finished it on my Xbox 360 though so that can sort of give you an idea.The one big problem with the Steam version is that if you try and change the options, such as the size of the screen, the game will crash. Well, it did in my case, so I'm playing the game in a 4:3 window. The game's options are full of bugs that may crash the game, so be careful.			"

												PLEASE FIX THAT GAME MY GOD. seriously.. bully is a great game which i really really recommend. is fun,have all a great game needs to have to be a great game but still ROCKSTAR PLEASE FIX THAT GAME UP. this game runs really bad in windows 10 like reallly really bad. i can't even go inside the school without seeing it crash or lag extremely without a single reason. i have to play it at 800x600 to actually be able to walk without feeling like i'm playing a powerpoint presentationAnother thing. the controls on keyboard are a bit confusing. they aren't bad because you will end up getting used to it (and also because you can change them) but i still recommend having an xbox 360 controller to play it without getting confused sometimes besides the windows 10 issues. the game is great and i recommend if you don't have windows 10 like i do but if you do i recommend you to be a bit careful related to it			"

												Bully is a wonderful free-roam, perhaps one of my favourite Rockstar games. The graphics are mediocre by this time, but it's nothing to scoff at either. While the game is buggy and has some issues with AI, it's not usually game-breaking and you'll be too busy beating people up to care.The character depth is great, especially due to the fact that no two characters in Bully are the same, they each have their own personalities and traits, and if you don't think so, just stop to listen to them and maybe you'll see what I mean.The music is suitable and, for the most part, sets the emotion of the scene adequately.Bully is a great game and well worth the price.(P.S. Rockstar, make sequel pls)			"

												This game doesn't work for Windows 10 64bit, so do not buy it if you are a Windows 10 64bit user. None of the compatibility modes work, the game still frequently crashes.Bully: Scholarship edition SHIPS with the Version 1.200 patch on Steam, so downloading the patch from Rockstar and running the .exe serves only to provide an error message as it is already installed.This is a great game marred by a lack of attention from the developer. If they put it on sale, you'd think they'd make sure it worked. What a damn shame.			"

												You want to know how much I think this game is good? Go look at my Left 4 Dead 2 mods. Then it will be obvious that I think that this game is one of my most favorite games of all time. It has a very unique story, but, like another review I saw, has a bit outdated graphics and low quality sound. But personally, I think this game deserves a 9/10 rating from my experience. I've played a lot worse, but I've played [slightly] better. Therefore, if you're into GTA or Saints Row, then I recommend this game 100%.			"

I'm not sure what it is, but I take a strange comfort in the setting, the people, the places. It plays like Grand Theft Auto but with a High School Setting, you go to classes, sneak around at night, save the school, and get the girl. Has a great sense of humor and a likeable main character. Looking forward to the sequel!			"

												WARNING: VERY BAD CONTROL SCHEME!  There is partial controller support, meaning it supports controllers but has a lot of problems with them.  Xbox 360 controllers are not plug-and-play, but they work as long as you enable them within the in-game options menu.  The game's default keyboard controls are terrible, and while the game is best played with a controller, it sometimes requires you to use a more accurate aiming tool, like a mouse or tablet, to play the minigames... well, you could probably do the minigames with your joysticks, but it would be unnecessarily difficult.  The minigames are clearly designed for a mouse.That aside, Bully is a nice game for how old it is.  It has decent visuals (nothing special), similar to GTA3 with characters closer to the style of Fable (sort of, see screenshots), and it plays fairly well.  The story has a lot of hilarious moments and some good laughs for people who like absurd phrases.  There are some gross-out moments, as well, so the game may not be for the squeamish.  Immature, snot-nosed brats should love it, though!  ;DThe only gripe I have besides the controls is that the AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The characters will just stand around doing the same behavior, even saying the same phrase, non-stop for the entire time you're near them.  I wish the devs would have given NPCs more believable behavior patterns.  That said, if you run through the levels very fast, you will not notice that issue.You can play a bunch of metagames which help progress the story, but there is not much replay value, because the game really isn't that open and offers very few distractions to keep you occupied.  There is very little challenge to the game, but that may be a good thing for some players.Overall, my opinion allows the game a 3/5.  Get it if it's cheap.			"

												Pros:Another excellent Rockstar sandbox game, worth the price. Give this a go if you like GTA. I also recommend it for those who like GTA games but often find the story missions too difficult. Bully's missions are a lot easier than those found in most GTA games. There's a lot to do outside of the main story too, with countless side-missions, minigames, secrets and unlockables to find. The game's soundtrack is awesome, by the way, composed by Shawn Lee. If you play this game for more than ten minutes the music will have already been stuck in your head.Cons:If you're playing this on Windows 10 you may encounter crashes a fair few times, there are steps that can be taken to minimise the frequency of these crashes. I took these steps but I couldn't eradicate the crashes completely, I may have missed something however. Also, the game is locked at 30 FPS if you're worried about that. It can be brought up to 60 FPS with some tinkering if you like, I didn't mind it all that much. Another issue I had was the audio, outside of cutscenes I thought the characters' voices were too quiet and they were overpowered by the music, even though I had the speech option at max.To sum up, Bully is a unique, funny game with a great story, a fantastic soundtrack, a ton of side missions, a lot of pranks to pull and a lot of characters to interact with. The few technical problems I mentioned are outweighed by this game's qualities.			"

												Bully is from the creators of the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. This time, instead of a space age, or an urban enviroment, a school. Bully takes place in Bullsworth Acadamy, and is about a young boy, who has been dropped off at this boarding school because of his wreckless behaviour in the past.Along the way you'll meet crazy characters such as a hobo that teaches you kung-fu, nerds, jocks, and of course, the headmaster.It is and open world game, but the world isn't as big as Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas. However, the world has personality in the character dialouge, and the charm in the enviroments, like graphiti, the carnival and the school corridors. Lessons are fun mini-games, and detentions also have their own mini-games, like lawn mowing or snow shoveling.This game deserves a sequel, and with recent news of Bully getting trademarked, we may have a glimmer of hope for Bully 2.That or it's a moblie port.Rating: 9.5/10			"

												Pros:Another excellent Rockstar sandbox game, worth the price. Give this a go if you like GTA. I also recommend it for those who like GTA games but often find the story missions too difficult. Bully's missions are a lot easier than those found in most GTA games. There's a lot to do outside of the main story too, with countless side-missions, minigames, secrets and unlockables to find. The game's soundtrack is awesome, by the way, composed by Shawn Lee. If you play this game for more than ten minutes the music will have already been stuck in your head.Cons:If you're playing this on Windows 10 you may encounter crashes a fair few times, there are steps that can be taken to minimise the frequency of these crashes. I took these steps but I couldn't eradicate the crashes completely, I may have missed something however. Also, the game is locked at 30 FPS if you're worried about that. It can be brought up to 60 FPS with some tinkering if you like, I didn't mind it all that much. Another issue I had was the audio, outside of cutscenes I thought the characters' voices were too quiet and they were overpowered by the music, even though I had the speech option at max.To sum up, Bully is a unique, funny game with a great story, a fantastic soundtrack, a ton of side missions, a lot of pranks to pull and a lot of characters to interact with. The few technical problems I mentioned are outweighed by this game's qualities.			"

												Bully is from the creators of the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. This time, instead of a space age, or an urban enviroment, a school. Bully takes place in Bullsworth Acadamy, and is about a young boy, who has been dropped off at this boarding school because of his wreckless behaviour in the past.Along the way you'll meet crazy characters such as a hobo that teaches you kung-fu, nerds, jocks, and of course, the headmaster.It is and open world game, but the world isn't as big as Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas. However, the world has personality in the character dialouge, and the charm in the enviroments, like graphiti, the carnival and the school corridors. Lessons are fun mini-games, and detentions also have their own mini-games, like lawn mowing or snow shoveling.This game deserves a sequel, and with recent news of Bully getting trademarked, we may have a glimmer of hope for Bully 2.That or it's a moblie port.Rating: 9.5/10			"

												Bully. It's GTA, but without blood and deadly weapons, and instead of playing as an adult man, you play as Jimmy Hopkins. A 15 year old kid who's aggressive and a fighter, but not truly malicious. He only gives people what they have coming to them.Bully takes place in Bullworth, a town in New England. Your mom, well, Jimmy's mom, drops you off at Bullworth Academy. A boarding school. The school is full of bullies and corrupt teachers and it's up to you to put a stop to it.The game's storyline will guide you through six chapters (There are 65 missions, the sixth chapter is an endless free-roam chapter, giving you the chance to complete non-storyline missions and to collect collectables.) Each of them takes place in a different weather season. The missions vary, it's never the same. One time you're cleaning a rat infested library and the next time you're helping a teacher escape from a psychiatric hospital. As Jimmy, your main goal is to bring peace to the school by helping and befriending the five school cliques: The Nerds, the Jocks, the Bullies and the Preppies.Of course you'll have to go to class. These classes are: English, gym, geography, math (ew), music, shop, art, photography and biology. They are simple mini-games which become noticeably harder every time you attend them and make progress. You'll also have to deal with a time schedule. You can skip class, but you won't get any rewards if you do so and prefects will catch you if they see you outside of class. Jimmy, your character, is highly customizable. You can buy clothes, change your hairstyle and more. You can even buy a bike, a go-kart or a scooter if you saved up enough cash. Money can be earned by either taking a paper route, doing missions for townies or students or by completing storyline missions. You've got weapons. No, they are not guns and no you can't kill people. There's a super slingshot, you can use firecrackers, stink bombs, eggs, a bag of marbles, a bottle rocket launcher and so much more. You can also pick up one of the many objects around you (umbrella's, vases, bottles) and use them as a weapon.Interacting with your fellow students is fun too. You can talk to them, give them presents, put them in trash bins, punch them in the face (aka bully them) and even kiss them. (This only applies to several girls and yes, you can kiss some guys too if you're into that.)The game has a very impressive map size. You can explore the entire school, the school grounds, the town, a fully functional theme park, an industrial park and a few more awesome places. There are many collectables scattered around the map too.Bully may be pretty good, but it's not perfect. The graphics are rather outdated, the sound isn't that amazing and you will have to deal with odd controls and some bugs. But don't worry! It doesn't kill the fun. Bully is an amazing game and there's much to do. And for only $14.99 - £9.99 - €9.99, it's certainly worth it. Go buy it! I recommend you it!			"

												Bully was a game back in 2006 released for the PS2 that basically offered the gameplay of Grand Theft Auto to minors without penalty.Bully is a game where you play as 15 year old Jimmy Hopkins as he attempts to survive his high school days after his mother and step father drop him off due to their honeymoon. While Jimmy attempts to fit in, he does various jobs for each of the cliques at the School to gain their favour. Whether its getting som D&D pages back for the Nerds, beating up the Jocks for the Preps, or roughing up the Preps for the Greasers, Jimmy does pretty much everything possible to just survive.Gameplay wise, this is a text-book R* sandbox game with its own unique touches. You can go to class where you play mini-games to unlock new abilities, start fights with the various cliques of the school, or just be a delinquent and destroy everything.Bully was one of the most unique R* games in it's gameplay feel. Sure it plays pretty close to the Renderware Grand Theft Auto games (GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas), it has its own unique feel with a pretty interesting plot, some great voice acting, and missions and activities that are fun to play. It's 14.99 and the game is pretty long, so you do get your money's worth.			"

												Bully (aka Canis Canem Edit) is certainly one of those rare gems most people have not heard much of. It seems as if the people of Rockstar had been given complete freedom to include whatever they wanted in this game. The characters are funny, the story is compelling, the mini-games are well implemented and the gameplay is fun. I like how although the map is not huge, you’ll see it change as the seasons change. This expands the possible themes of the game and its pace, and it also gives you a reason to change the protagonist’s clothes to fit the current season and do different things at different events during the game (Christmas, Halloween, Carnival time etc.) There are a ton of Easter eggs and funny scenes within the game if you are willing to find them. I liked every single class (but for English, that cr*p was hard) and the missions were all fun, but somewhat easy. The game is old, and you can tell by its graphics and the overall look, but it is still fun and it'll make you laugh at several points. The worst thing you can say about this game is that it’s not a great pc port. There are weird sounds all around (unless you change some setting in the menu), the FPS are capped at 30 and it’ll take you some time to find out how to skip cutscenes. The camera won’t stay in a fix position as it does in GTA, but there are some things this game does better than its older brother Grand Theft Auto. For instance, you don’t have to start all over again if you fail a mission, and at least people use umbrellas when it’s raining. Oh, and collectables do not float in the air and they are included in the game in such a way in which you don’t really have to look for them if you don’t want to, because you’ll get most as you play the game’s missions. Jimmy is a sort of Holden Caulfield, and that’s great. He may a bit aggressive and not be very smart, but that does not mean he’s malicious either. You really have fun being Jimmy and experiencing once again your time at your high school, even if it was probably not as exciting as in this game. Gary, Pete, all the teachers, the different school gangs, the ost, the minigames, going skateboarding everywhere… they may be all simple things, but they really make this story outstanding and, above everything else, fun.

												I've loved this game ever since it originally came out on PS2. I remember one time I invited a few other people that never played it before to play it and they loved it too! The story is amazing, the graphics are beautiful but not hard on a CPU, and gameplay is, good, I say that because some of the controls are bad and well, sometimes things work in weird ways that seem glitchy compared to certain things in Grand Theft Auto III, which came out a while before this. But either way, here are my ratings for the game:Game itself: 9/10Concept: 10/10 just for originality,Story: 10/10, some offensive stuff but that's one reason it's awesome,Controls (for PC): 4/10, aim mode is Up Arrow and to look around you use the mouse, and to move you use the WASD keys, when do you have time in like a boss battle or something to press Up?Physics (among other things): 5/10, you drop an item, it falls straight down. You jump off something with the Skateboard Bucky gives you early on in the game, you lose a lot of speed and sometimes just comepletely stop. Worst of all when you throw someone onto a street curb in such a way, and this is often, they will have gravity to that spot, meaning, they will be able to stand at a full 45 degree angle and not have to balance or anything.Overall: 8/10, this would have to be my favorite game on PS2 besides Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and that underrated game called Gun.Thanks for reading this long review!

												The first 2 chapters were the best in my opinion 3rd and 4th was alright and i feel like the ending was a bit rushed. Amazing soundtrack Which was produced by Shawn Lee. The audio of the npc's voices were at times not the best. I find this game to be really enjoyable and it gives nostalgia to the people that have either watched the game back in 2006 or played it. I would recommend you to purchase this game and try it out.			"

NOTICE: Although I am recommending it, I do advise you should try to play one of the Console Versions or at least use a controler for the PC Port.Bully: Scholarship Edition is a lovely game, just ported poorly for PC.I just finished the game, and only experienced 1 crash and 2 FPS drops through all of it. 1 crash was due to using the camera to take pictures of students for the yearbook; Had a FPS drop during the fight under the school and the other in the factory to fight one of the ""bosses"".I didn't find the controls to be horrendous, they are a bit funny at first, but you'll get use to it after a short time.Story (This subject will lack because the games description will give you a good insight and I don't want to spoil anything) I found the story to be pleasent. It wasn't the best and I found the it to be something like GTA's The Lost and Damned, but not entirely. All in all, I enjoyed it and found it hard at points to stop playing because of it.Gameplay/Controls Gameplay is pretty solid, but using keyboard and mouse can be quite infuriating at at times. Fighting was pain for me at the begining, sometimes I would end up hurting friendly NPC's, because they were in the way of an enemy NPC and using your mouse is how you switch between targets which would cause me to accidently switch to a friendly NPC.Riding your skateboard and bike with WASD can cause you to wreck... quite a bit. It becomes stressful when you are doing a race or an objective that requires you to use your bike.There are 'minigames' so to speak; you can take a side job missions to earn extra cash, go to the carnival, take a trip to a skate park and compete in bike races.Their are collectables such as rubber bands and G&G Cards to snag.I would add tag spots, but they didn't seem perminant but I could be wrong.You also have classes and they are used to give your character upgrades. Example, you complete a Class One Art and you'll get 25% Health Bonus when you kiss a girl. You are not forced to go to class, but the school guards and police officers will chase and attempt to take you to class.Pros:Good StoryLikable CharactersEnjoyable GameplayDifferent From Most Games (That I've played)Cons:Bad PortClucnky ControlsFeels Slightly DatedSummaryI know most people don't recommend it do to it being a bad port, but it is still fully playable.$15 price is not bad at all, I got 20 hours out of it and possibly more if I decide to 100%.I would say, try to get it when there is a Rock Star Publisher Sale going on, then you can probably get it for around $5 - $10.All in all, well rounded game and sadly it doesn't seem to get the recognition that it deserves. One of Rock Stars hidden gems.			"

												My favourite Rockstar published game.Played through the original on PS2 several times, same with the 360 and on the PC.Completed 100% on all these systems too. Definitely worth a buy.Cons for the PC version:The default controls are dogshit. Tweak them before playing or just use a 360 controller.Also to those who ♥♥♥♥♥ about FPS caps, the game is capped at 30fps by default but can be set to 60fps using a custom .exe that can be easily downloaded.In the end, I would recommend 100%. 10/10 game, quite fun.

												Bully is a brilliant game with an amazing cast of charachters. It's the sort of game you'll play through once and remember for years to come because it's so memorable. Missions in the game are pretty uninteresting and binary in nature, but the storyline and acting are so good that they'll serve as motivation to keep you playing. The game has a few other problems and areas that I wish were expanded and improved but it's stil worth the <10.00 price of admission Overall: 8.5/10Pros:+ Hollywood levels of voice acting, writing and storytelling + All the cast of charachters are awesome. Jimmy is a bamf and the main antagonist is an evil genius that's easy to hate + Game is full of charm; from the quintessential Rockstar sense of humour pervading the entire game, to the locations,    to the great soundtrack+ Unique setting that is well thought out + Fun combat system + Game is a decent lengthCons:- Bland missions- Game has almost no challenge - Money is useless in the game so there's no incentive to complete errands on top of missions- Combat is fun, but somewhat button-mashy - You can't stay out past a certain time otherwise you'll get done for violating curfew which means exploration outside of school grounds is discouraged/ not enjoyable- Virtually nothing to do once you complete the storyline- unless you enjoy collecting gnomes?

												Absolutely fantastic game. 2nd favorite Rockstar game, only behind Red Dead. (BTW, LORD GABEN BETTER PUT IT ON STEAM.) Bully revolves around the daily academy life of Jimmy Hopkins, a fifteen year old troublemaker and an all-around badass.The game is really cool because it's open world on the campus of Bullworth Academy. Now, this can be great for the 2 kinds of game players that exist. The ones that actually play a storyline and are afraid to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥in a videogame (Me), or someone who doesn't give a damn and just screws around hitting girls and giving prefects the wedgie of their life (Also Me).Pros:+Humor. LOTS of humor+Likeable Hero+Classroom Aspect+Voice acting (GOLD)+Not restricted to just the campus+Nonrepetetive storyline+Intresting story about betrayal and, well, BULLIES!+Antagonist is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ (I like that)+YOU choose the way you play. Lover or Hater kind of thing+Unlockables+Character Customization+Interesting soundtrack+Fun Gameplay+Easy Achievements, sorta, on console+A Pretty lengthy storyline+Crime and punishment system is realistic-ish and is reasonable+Lenient Prefect escape systemCons:-Vague respect system-Graphics are a little painful to look at, but for it's time it's alright-Controls are something special-No AchievementsThe game is very good, and I give it an 89/100. This is also the first game I got all achievements on (LONG weekend).An underrated game that you should buy.Have fun hiding in trashcans, shoving Algie into a locker, beating up Tad, and making out with Mandy (or Eunice... if you're into that).

												In Bully you play as Jimmy Hopkins, 15 year old problem teen who right at the begginning of the game is being left at Bullworth Academy boarding school by his mother and new step father who are about to leave for their honeymoon.When Jimmy first arrives at Bullworth he quickly learns he's at the bottom of the foodchain in the school and sets out to literally beat up each Cliques leaders to earn their respect.The game controls and plays very similarly to GTA with some differences.Jimmy is expected by teachers and prefects which act as the ""police"" within the school  grounds to attend classes on weekdays and go to bed on curfew.Nothing stops you from skipping class or staying up late, but if you get caught it can mean detention.Each class has its own minigame which gets harder each time you pass, and in the post-game you unlock some new classes you couldn't do at the start of the year.Combat is very similar to that of GTAIV, but heavily improved upon. There are many moves and techniques Jimmy can learn such as sweeping under someones legs to knock them over or uppercuts.When using a grapple on another student Jimmy is able to ""bully"" them in various ways.Overall I'd say this is one of Rockstars best releases to date, and one of the few games released by them that I still fully enjoy.If you enjoy GTA you're pretty much guaranteed to enjoy this.

												Bully is a game like no other. It is an open world game by Rockstar, the Publisher that has the best open-world free roaming games in the market. The unique aspect of Bully is the context in which it develops its story. A school for kids who'd rather be in trouble than in class. With a real psycho villain that is on par with the rest of the villains in other Rockstar's open world games. 10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.Rockstar, we want Bully 2 after RDR 2!			"

Besides that you're trying to bring peace and order to the school, which takes a lot of doing to achieve.The game took me about 13 hours and I did somewhere around 68% of the content so there's some more hours to be had if you're interested.

												was running from a prefect and he got stuck in a wall420/360 would get stuck againEDIT: Holy nutballs I based a review off a rare glitch? Damn must have I been high, erm.Bully:Scholarship Edition is a third person game that takes place in a VERY stereotypical american high-school, if you're looking to do a Columbine this isn't for you unless you want to substitute with a slingshot or spud gun.In one mission you break into the girls dorm and steal panties.The game is full of fun minigames, hell some of the classes are minigames in themselves. (I don't count Maths and English as minigames, ok.)You can basically do whatever you want in a school-themed game and not have any real life consequences, go ahead and shoot that fat nerd with the spud gun.You've got the Nerds, the Preppies, the Greasers and i'm pretty sure everyone would know there would be Jocks in this kind of game, each with their own theme whenever you're fighting someone a part of their faction, speaking of themes, when you get the game you get the soundtrack too for free, some of the soundtrack (like the theme that plays when a prefect chases you down) sounds like 80s cop music and it's just so memorable it's no surprise that it may get stuck in your head quickly.Let's just get to the most fun parts, you can beat people up of course, you could throw itching powder at people and watch them thoughtlessly scratch themselves, you can throw stinkbombs and firecrackers, shoot a slingshot, bottle rocket launcher (kinda like fireworks), and spud gun, make out with several different girls (Or guys, don't talk about that seriously.).The game offers at least 15 hours of gameplay unless you just speedrun it and have no fun at all outside of the main storyline.Conclusion: 8.5/10, I absolutely wish for a sequel, and a sequel with many more hours of gameplay, Happy nerd hunting, gamers!

												9/10Another great game by Rockstar!Short summary: A child/ younger persons GTA. No explicit language only minor ( B word for female dog is the strongest language used). Guns are replaced with school like weapons (eg Slingshot). Bikes and skateboards instead of cars.Has a good story and enjoyable gameplay. I quite like the idea that you are a bully to bullies rather than just a bully at a school. I thought the characters were rich with interesting personalites. The gameplay is very fun and even the school subject quests are entertaining (except for english, I found that one a bit boring). The side quests for NPCs are great fun, though there were times when I really wanted to punch the quest giver (which I eventually did). Even at a school there is a wide range of fun weapons to play with and a reasonable sized open world to explore.Overall I found this game throughrally enjoyable. I loved the story and I thought that the gameplay was excellent. I would reccommend that Rockstar fans should definatly buy it. If you have never played one of their games (GTA series, Red Dead Redemption etc.) I reccommend giving this game a go.			"

												Bully is a pretty cool game, it is reminiscent to GTA in that you can free roam and openly accept missions from random people, as well as complete the main missions. You play as Jimmy who has been expelled from another school and has arrived at Bullworth Academy, and the principal is determined to change his ways. The game is full of fun, hilarity and mayhem.

Despite some audio issues (unflattering choice of recording equipment guys) and some superflouous new content (did we REALLY need new T-shirts?), this is the Canis Canem Edit you know and love, given a lick of paint in the engine that brought TES IV to the fray, and free from the restrictions of the PS2 that caused the low-quality audio.

												I wouldn't buy this game. The interface is terribly clunky, and while I understand that this is supposed to be a ""bad"" school and kids are noisy, I have never once been in a place where there are two hundred people shouting the same six lines at the top of their lungs at all times. The sheer amount of loud, grating, poorly voiced ""children"" in this game is a marvel of auditory annoyance.In addition, the game makes a big deal about the choices you can make in dealing with the other students, however the pre-scripted events have no options whatsoever. Someone hits you with a slingshot and you have no option but to chase them down and beat them up, instead of having an option to simply wait and get revenge later, or ignore it entirely (with whatever penalties are appropriate).The graphics range from not impressive to abysmal and I don't know how Rockstar managed to screw up the controls and user interface so badly. Bully is probably the worst console port I've played in a very long time and about the only redeeming value to this game is it is a bit of gaming history, as a shining example of people freaking out about a ""violent video game"" that's incredibly bad.

												Bully is a pretty cool game, it is reminiscent to GTA in that you can free roam and openly accept missions from random people, as well as complete the main missions. You play as Jimmy who has been expelled from another school and has arrived at Bullworth Academy, and the principal is determined to change his ways. The game is full of fun, hilarity and mayhem. You help Jimmy make his way through the year of Bullworth by helping the bullies, teaming up with the nerds, kissing some girls and even asssiting some of the teachers, there are a few missions which I found annoying but overall the missions are quite well spread and well thought out, the story is cool, there are seasonal changes around the school like Christmas time (my favourite was Halloween, you'll see why).

												One of the best comedic open world games ever made that makes you feel like your in high school all over again.PROS-Fully Open World to Explore-Tons of Mini Games-Unique Leveling System Involving Schoolwork-Replay ValueCONS-30fps Lock (Mod Needed)STORYYou play as a young man who starts out being dropped off at a new school by his newlywed mother & stepfather as they go off on their honeymoon.  The story starts off great as you get to see the characters develop nearly right away.  The young boy is angry as hell & the mother don't give no ifs ands or buts about it as she's just married some rich guy.  Anyways, after all that you go to your new school & board room.  You then get the chance to learn your new natural habitat, meet some new friends, kick some nerd or jock butts.  All the fun stuff you'd do in a normal school :P.  As you progress you meet some new friends.  One's a sociopath while the other a more timid type of kid.  These are the two main characters that will help progress most of the story.  The end result is you becoming the unofficial king of the school & eventually the entire town where everyone knows you & respects you in some way.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is very similar to GTA type games.  You run around, can steal bikes or pick fights.  If you pick fights with adults you're gonna end up getting caught.  Adults are a lot harder to fight but can be managed if you have the skill or weapons at your disposal.  Cops are a lot harder, though.  If you get caught outside of school during early hours you will be sent to class.  Classrooms act as minigames that usually involve some sort of QTE segments but doing these are very benificial as you unlock upgrades, weapons & such from doing them.  If you finish all your schoolwork you can then explore the town freely without the fear of being arrested & sent back to class since you no longer have any classes that you're required to attend.  There are also a variety of minigames that are also fun & give ample rewards.  Arcade cabinets with high scores that are actually fairly easy are one of the required mini games to progress the main story, but you do get a new weapon from doing it as well.  Then there are bike races which are really fun & give you new bikes to choose from as well as an entire theme park with it's own set of mini games & prizes such as a motor scooter which is the best vehicle in the game.  If you're riding the scooter without a helmet cops will give chase.  There are also odd jobs you can get around the town like delivering papers or mowing lawns.  Paper delivery plays like the best version of Paper Boy you've ever played & mowing lawns plays just as you'd think it would.  Just don't mow the flowers.  There's also a punch out like boxing mini game that ends up unlocking new fighting moves to utilize in combat.All in all everything about the gameplay is well done with very little glitches or hang ups on controls.  I never had a problem doing anything in particular myself.  Exploring the world is one of the many pleasures in this game & there are lots of things to find such as trading cards, rubber bands, or gnomes to destroy.  OVERALLOverall, this game is worth every penny you spend.  It's got everything you'd want in a video game.  Open world to explore, solid progression system, mini-games, vehicles, etc.  It's all great & good fun.  If it's on a sale you should definitely pick it up.  Even if not on a sale it's worth every penny spent.  IMO this game is better than most of (if not all) the GTA games.			"

												I remember first playing this on the XBox360.  I pre-ordered the game because it looked like a blast.  I thought of it as a more safe version of GTA.  Being an Achievement addict, my first couple hours in the game involved running back and forth giving wedgies to everyone, beating up anyone, and throwing all sorts of junk everywhere and making everyone cry...and honestly, I think that fit with the main character's attitude at the start.Playing the game, I was delighted to see all the simplified stereotypes of people in school.  Who really needs individuality when you have a clique?  And we are the one boy who stands above all of it.  It was an amazing journey just trying to survive and not get kicked out of Bullworth Academy, while at the same time doing a Lot of messed up stuff I never did in school which would get anyone arrested now.  I enjoyed seeing Jimmy forced to be as much of the ""good guy"" as he could be while at the same time setting off just enough trouble not to get kicked out of school.The formula for success was good enough to me.  It sort of fit into my own 15-year-old mindset of how growing up worked.  Get in good with the various cliques while not being a part of any.  Date your way up the ladder; you can't always start with the popular girl.  Before you know it, you're a star and everyone loves you!  Jimmy finds out it doesn't work like that, though.Yeah, this isn't a complete review or anything.  The bottom line is ""GTA without guns, carjacking or hookers, in school.""  If you like GTA, you'll probably like this...unless you prefer guns, carjacking and hookers...  If you're not into shooting up a strip mall, this is your game.  The story shows the rise, fall, and rise again of Jimmy Hopkins as he struggles to keep his head above the water in the middle of chaos.  And I have to say, the ending was insane.  When you first meet Gary, you know there's going to be some trouble.  I'm amazed the principal was so worried about Jimmy messing up he never saw psycho Gary coming...poor guy.This game is worth buying at any price, and playing to completion.			"

The ONLY reason i give this game a no, is because it is simply not a very good port. I played for a few hours and it crashed on me and took me back to the beginning of the game. Still worth it if you want to deal with that.			"

Nerds are for you? go for it, protect them from....being chucked in a bin. Build teen romances and go on a date to the carnival, why not?There's also the fun addition of the classes where you have to do mini games/solve puzzles in order to pass but if that type of gaming isnt for you then just skip class! But beware of those pain in the butt prefects! Oh and the coppers if you go off school grounds! "

I've never felt such pain as I did when I got a score of 1008 out of 1010 on the Sumo minigame... I cried. TL;DR at bottomSeriously, though, this is a really fun game, but the the port is terrible on Windows 10. I would probably not recommend to anyone after Windows 8. Even after trying a few fixes I found online, I still couldn't get it to run for 15 minutes without crashing. If you can get it to work on WIndows 10, though, it does run in native resolution for me (1366x768). Framerate issues occur for absolutly no reason some times. If you can get past the issues with this game, then all the power to you. It really is a fun game. The biggest issue is one that plagues all Rockstar games: NO AUTOSAVE!!! This really makes the crashing detrimental. If you can't save after a mission and it crashes, you're out of luck... talk about raging. Graphics: 14/20 (18/20 in 2006)Gameplay: 12/20 (A little stale, but it's the formula that never grows old. Crashes and bugs nearly ruin it on Windows 10. 17/20 without issues.)Sound: 18/20 (Some cheezy voice acting, but great music.)Story: 18/20 (Some cliches, but really fun and humerous.)World (Characters and setting): 20/20 (One of the most origional games ever. Characters are great.)Overall(Windows 10): 82/100 There are a lot of problems with this port, but the game itself is awesome. Would recommend ONLY on sale. (On Windows Vista, 7, or 8: 91/100) If on Windows 8 or older, this game is a must-buy. Still, though, get it on sale if you can.			"

If you like GTA you are sure to like this.The story is not what I thought it would be, it's sweeter than you'd suspect based on the title and the controversy of the time (which is laughable considering the games made since then). Jimmy is forced to rule the school because everyone else is a bigger jerk than he is and it turns out he's not so bad after all.It's one of the games I like to play through every once in a while.

The Greasers, leather jacket wearing punks who try to act tough, The Nerds, weak mischievous fools who usually use stink bombs on bullies, The Preps, High life living chaps who only associate with other wealthy students and they also love the sport of boxing, and finally the Jocks, they rule the school and everyone knows it. In this game you can beat up practically anything from guys to girls to rats. You can go into town and visit different shops like the barber shop. You can go on panty raids. You can vandalize walls. You can prank people. You can do every bad thing you could have done in school.			"

												This is certainly one of the best games Rockstar has ever made. Why? Because it's incredibly unique. You play Jimmy, a (possibly 90's?) schoolkid which was sent to Bullworth, at which he spends most of his time. He's a Bully, but a good guy at heart.The game continuesly opens up and gives you more and more tools to play around with, while the Story is pretty appealing since there's a bunch of change and you won't often see the same mission twice.Though, there is one negative point: The PC Port and KB/M controls are absolutely terrible. If you're going to buy this, make sure you have a controller, otherwise it's not bearable. Don't worry about not being able to aim properly, since you won't shoot too often either way, and when you have to, it isn't hard.			"

												While this PC port comes with awful controls, you can customize them, or do what I do and use a 360 controller.I'll start this review by saying Bully is one of my favorite games of all time, I had it on the Playstation 2, and I kept my PS2 for 2 years until I discovered this was on steam, where I bought this and donated my PS2. Bully has what I consider a great storyline, plenty of weapons and perks, great AI, good replayablility (I've beaten the story, so I loaded a save file and have just been free roaming this whole time. You can unlock a moped, and eventually a go-kart along with a bunch of different weapons from bags of marbles to potato guns. When you first arrive at the school, you are hated for being the dumb new kid. As the game goes on, you gain respect for doing multiple missions, which is how you are treated. I'd say this game is worth $15 but during sales its gone down to $3 or $7. This is a must have in my opinion, after you complete the first chapter you get to go into the local town and cause mayhem, and with a developer such as rockstar you really can't go wrong.The modding community is not what is could(should) be, I was able to download a mod to put the super spudgun into the game but I've only found a few others (One that added cars, different outfits, etc) OverallI'd give this a 10/10.

												Great game. If you are using an Windows 10, according to others you MAY experience frequent crashes. I've played this on Windows 7 and 8, and I was actually able to complete the full story without any crashes. It's a heavy game however. If you want max settings PLUS a solid framerate, you're definitely going to need pretty high specs. I'm using GTX 960 and I'm getting 60 FPS on max settings. Mind you there is a released executable which replaces the original one, removing the 30 FPS limit. I'd only recommend getting that if you have 8 or more GB of ram. Other than that, it's a really juicy story, lots of fun, and can easily be modded. 10/10.			"

												Jimmy Hopkins, a young delinquent teen, gets sent to the notoriously bigoted Bullworth Academy by his mother, who's caught up in another fling with an older man. He learns his way around the school and makes friends and enemies (well, pretty much just enemies). Taking down clique after clique, he clashes with Gary, a teenage sociopath, for the title of the ruler of the school.I liked this game! The story was amusing and there were several interesting characters. However, the voice acting was painful and the graphics weren't the best Rockstar could have done. The music was GREAT and there was an intricate web of characters and quests to mess around with if the main story got a bit boring. The fighting was a bit strange at first, with unnatural keyboard positions forcing me to twist my hands around each other, but you get used to it, and by the end of the game you're a champ.Basically GTA for teenagers.

												One of rockstars best and sort of a hidden gem. It's open world but it has the qualities of a small map design with a nice flow and realism. Game mechanics are actually fairly challenging yet simple in concept. Wish it was more fleshed out storywise near the end but really I just didn't want the game to stop it's very endearing. Graphics are nothing to write home about but they don't seem dated and fit the theme well. Sound and music is great if a little repetitve with some tracks.			"

												OK, so here's my take on the crashing thing:THIS GAME CRASHES. A LOT. It crashes roughly on-par with any Bethesda game with mods or memory issues, which is maybe twice every couple of hours. I played a full hour before I even found my first crash.I've seen A LOT of people giving a variety of stories on their own experiences with the crashes. Some saying extreme things, like the game doesn't even run in the first place, or that they can place only about 10 minutes before it crashes. I haven't experienced this.My first experience with the crash was by the mission ""Save Algie"", which is maybe the 4th or 5th mission in the game. I figured, ""Oh, there it is-- the mythical crashes!"" No problem, I thought, I'll just load a save..Oh..Oh... I forgot to save since the beginning of the game.SO BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK-- Be aware that Steam will refund the game if you decide you don't want it within 2 hours of gameplay; I would DEFINITELY recommend this game, crashes and all, if it were less than 10$, so definitely get it if it's on saleThe game itself is amazing; I've played it on every console I've ever owned, I've played it since I was a small child, I can even associate many of the events of my early life to playing the game. I even went back on the day I graduated high school to play the game with my friends. It's an instant classic and is tons of good fun, so this game would be golden if not for it's technical issues.All of this said, I *can* recommend the game with a bit of an asterisk next to it: SAVE OFTEN. Do a mission, and return to the dorms to save. I, myself, can have plenty of fun with this game so long as I remember to save after every event, which is not too hard as there's various places to save in the game. That said, if you do buy the game and find you crash too frequently to return and save your game, then feel free to refund it.TO SUMMARIZE: The game *does* crash, but I think it's a managable issue that makes this game worth it depending on your definition of ""worth it""-- i recommend potential buyers buy the game, see what severity they have of the issues, and decide for themselves if they want a refund.Oh, and of course, this isn't to say that Rockstar or /anyone/ shouldn't patch the game-- Come on. If Steam is gonna pull 15$ in on this game, then they need to make sure it isn't working worse than their FREE games. It's not that dated-- I can play Wolfenstein 3D with minimal issues on Steam but can't make a PS2-era game work. Bull.			"

												*For me, this is the BEST Rockstar Game ever. This game has got Great story about being a guy who was in a school with FULL of Bullies.*Gameplay is so exciting. But if you're playing with Controller. Because this game is a Port. *There are different activities in this game. You can race with bike, you can race with Go-Kart you can bully nerds, you can play in carnival, you can kiss girls or you can be pervert, or you can be a student (like attending a lesson) *Lessons are exciting. But if you want to pass Geography and English, open the internet before starting. Because they are VERY challenging.*Characters are great. Voice actors did great performance.*Graphics are good if you're playing in High options. But they're good all the time. *Musics are AWESOME. If you want to listen all of the songs after completing the game, they're located in games program files.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10 (with controller)Music: 10/10Final Verdic: 10/10			"

												My option and review... Well first of all i just bit scracthed game (33hours, and on start still)This game has multiplayer on developement and also otherwise good roleplay game as offline mode already..My options are simple since i have played this on PS2 as i were really young kid.But lets start..First of all game gives you nice options and items etc... as thinking its old already.On start of game on its very hard specially without controller but will be easy after hour.Some missions might be hard like ""Save the Algie / Help the Algie""Game actually really teaches English words, Math, Mouse control (Biology), Music, Chemistry (Focusing skills)Game gives you nice tools and stuff to explore and find out.Game has semi-big map for so old game.. But its not open on start yet.Game works nicely on Windows 10 after chancing some settings and i will be glad to help with them. (Not perfectly still)I love the game as it.. Its story about ""Jimmy"" who helps bullies or defence's nerds.. very simple by doing missions.If you like games like Grand Theft Auto then you will love this... YOU DONT HAVE VEHICLES ON START.But in fact.. Looking how old game is and how huge userbase it has.. It even gives you alot Steam Guide contet and mods at internet. So if you are looking for game to waist +100hours at least.. Then get Bully! I can tell you its worth of money even for 30hours speedrush..But if your gamer like me who likes to do mini-missions, run around maps and explore etc.. You will easily spend up to 300hours to this game. ! :)			"

												Bully is a really great game. It's loads of fun with a surprisingly in depth story, and tons of memorable characters. The issue is that running this game on Windows 10 is impossible. It will crash constantly, and for no reason whatsoever.  I, and just about every other person that's tried to play this game, have tried several different fixes and patches that, at most, let you play for an extra 5 minutes before experiencing another random crash. I understand that this is an older, less relevant title, but I'm still severely disappointed in Rockstar for putting no effort at all in to fixing this problem that has been present for quite some time now. So as much as I want to give this game a much deserved positive review, I just can't recommend this game to anyone due to the amount of frustration I know they'll suffer. "

												Great game, holds up well though it does not run well on Windows 10. That can be fixed to a degree by fiddling with patches or compatability settings, but most patches I found did not work, and the compatibility change only worked for a day. I've heard it works better on windows 7, if you're running that, it's an amazing game that shouldn't be missed.			"

												*For me, this is the BEST Rockstar Game ever. This game has got Great story about being a guy who was in a school with FULL of Bullies.*Gameplay is so exciting. But if you're playing with Controller. Because this game is a Port. *There are different activities in this game. You can race with bike, you can race with Go-Kart you can bully nerds, you can play in carnival, you can kiss girls or you can be pervert, or you can be a student (like attending a lesson) *Lessons are exciting. But if you want to pass Geography and English, open the internet before starting. Because they are VERY challenging.*Characters are great. Voice actors did great performance.*Graphics are good if you're playing in High options. But they're good all the time. *Musics are AWESOME. If you want to listen all of the songs after completing the game, they're located in games program files.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10 (with controller)Music: 10/10Final Verdic: 10/10			"

												My option and review... Well first of all i just bit scracthed game (33hours, and on start still)This game has multiplayer on developement and also otherwise good roleplay game as offline mode already..My options are simple since i have played this on PS2 as i were really young kid.But lets start..First of all game gives you nice options and items etc... as thinking its old already.On start of game on its very hard specially without controller but will be easy after hour.Some missions might be hard like ""Save the Algie / Help the Algie""Game actually really teaches English words, Math, Mouse control (Biology), Music, Chemistry (Focusing skills)Game gives you nice tools and stuff to explore and find out.Game has semi-big map for so old game.. But its not open on start yet.Game works nicely on Windows 10 after chancing some settings and i will be glad to help with them. (Not perfectly still)I love the game as it.. Its story about ""Jimmy"" who helps bullies or defence's nerds.. very simple by doing missions.If you like games like Grand Theft Auto then you will love this... YOU DONT HAVE VEHICLES ON START.But in fact.. Looking how old game is and how huge userbase it has.. It even gives you alot Steam Guide contet and mods at internet. So if you are looking for game to waist +100hours at least.. Then get Bully! I can tell you its worth of money even for 30hours speedrush..But if your gamer like me who likes to do mini-missions, run around maps and explore etc.. You will easily spend up to 300hours to this game. ! :)			"

												One of the best games Rockstar have to offer. If you can bear through the bugs'n'glitches, and you have a controller, definitely check it out.  Game consistency here is better than any of GTA games. Bully is full of content and worth the money it costs by far. The atmosphere reminds me of the first Harry Potter games. Basically, as everyone says it's GTA about kids. Too bad the kids aren't able to play it. I only wish i could play it back in 2006 and not now.Aslo music is superb.			"

												Rockstar games has left this game.Windows 10.. Hate it or love it, it's here to stay. And as such alot of older games have been affected by it's lack of proper backwards compatitibility. Leaving a majority of good games like Bully: Scholarship Edition with a smaller playerbase that it potentially could have. Now granted Bully is a very small game, especially in contrast to larger titles like Grand Theft Auto V, but I think it's very important to not forget that even though the community is small it's still one of the most pleasant ones that me and many others have come across, ""It severly pains me to see this great community slowly but surely wither away."" -SWEGTANontheless Bully: Scholarship Edition will still be one of my favorite games still do this day, and it always will be.

												Bully is a really great game. It's loads of fun with a surprisingly in depth story, and tons of memorable characters. The issue is that running this game on Windows 10 is impossible. It will crash constantly, and for no reason whatsoever.  I, and just about every other person that's tried to play this game, have tried several different fixes and patches that, at most, let you play for an extra 5 minutes before experiencing another random crash. I understand that this is an older, less relevant title, but I'm still severely disappointed in Rockstar for putting no effort at all in to fixing this problem that has been present for quite some time now. So as much as I want to give this game a much deserved positive review, I just can't recommend this game to anyone due to the amount of frustration I know they'll suffer. "

												This is a really fun game from Rockstar, and I would say its right up there with their GTA series. No surprise there since all it really is is GTA in school. You take on the role of James Hopkins, a new kid in a private school that is full of juvenile delinquents. You can run around and explore or complete side quests to advance the game. You can even go to classes during the day and play mini-games that unlock extra abilities. If you're late for class and the guards catch you in the hallway they will chase you down unless you outsmart them and hide in a locker.The graphics are outdated and the controls are awkward due to it being a console port, but that shouldn't prevent you from having a lot of fun with this game. It literally has everything. Slingshots, firecrackers, kick-me signs, trespassing, lock-picking, curfews, slippery bannana peels, bicycle-riding, stink bombs and much more. Everything you think a bad kid would need or do is in there. It's a great and funny game.			"

												I've had tremendous difficulies trying to get this game to run properly. As things currently stand, there really is no option that would yield in excess of 45minutes of gameplay on Win10.  No matter what you do with the compatibility settings, no matter what you do wih CPU core affinity setting - nothing manages to mend the utter mess that this game is on a Win10 platform. I've tried two different hardware configs, quad core i5 with a discrete AMD GPU and a dual core i3 with Intel HD5500 graphics chip. Both suffer from the same kind of crashes occuring in seemingly reliable intervals.My advice would be to definitely wait for a sale ( I bought it for measly $3 ) and also to not be afraid of relying on Steam's refund policy in case you find out that the game runs poorly on your system as well.

												It's rare that a developer goes from make a adult game about crime with very adult themes. To making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example Bully is a giant open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play, and much more to just kind of find.The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions;like the jocks or the nerds, and the more the more you do work for one faction it can effect your standing with others. Which in turn can effect the way some of the people treat you at school. The combat is very similar but instead of machine guns and rocket launches. Your playing with slingshots and stink bombs. There are also a lot of things that are different about Bully that really makes it feel like your in high school it feel very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. Like you have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class, and of you don't go the prefects or any adult of authority. All the classes have there own perks like one of the classes shows you where all the collectibles, and unlike the protagonists in GTA jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep so if your out past 2 you just pass out on the spot which can make some night missions feel a little too time restrictive.The story starts you out in a car ride with you and your mom and what seems to be your new stepdad. They then drop you off in the front of Bullyworth academy where you meet the principle and some of the teacher, but the fun starts to come in when you go to your dorm room and meet your new friend Gary, who is a sociopath, i don't know how else to put it.You soon start to become manipulated by him, and you two soon go your separate ways and you start to see less and less of him. You then start to do work for the other factions of the school. Playing Bully it kind of puts you back and makes you think about your time in high school, I know the archetypes aren't as plain and simple as they are in Bully but it does a great job of boiling a lot of the high school experience down to a 20 hour game.Then there are a few technical issues with bully I didn't really have too many other then the game crash on me a couple of times, and that just sucks after that happened for the first time a started saving much more frequently. I can't really say definitely how the game will turn out for you, but it didn't seem to bad. From my experience with it. Over all the game is well made but parts of it just seem kind of repetitive and broken;overall though I think it's a great game.			"

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is a fun free roam type game. You're a 16? year old schoolboy who is sent to a boarding school called ""Bullworth Academy"" by you're parents.The game is fun but the framereate is capped at 30. While playing you can be a bully if you really want to, but you can also be nice to the nerds.Pros:- Free roam- Fun missions- Almost everythingCons:- Combat gets old after a while- 30FPS capGet this game if you can afford it, you will not be sorry.

The game is unfinishable due to a bug in the ""Rudy the Red Nosed Santa"" mission which still hasn't been patched and doesn't look like it's going to. so 0/10 for unfinishable game. Not starting a new game and playing through that far again just to get to the same error.			"

												 Not only does it not run on  Windows 10 without crashng ever few minutes, it HARD crashes meaning you have to completely power down your system which is a huge no no in my book. Resolution option is also completely broken, port is useless on modern machines, avoid if you're on Windows 8 or above.			"

												Old, cheap and yet an extremely entertaining game! I wasn't expecting much from it, but the game itself is very intriguing and exciting, indeed. Voice acting is exruciating, in the sense that the audio files themselves are low quality, and this shifts during the game - from good to bad, vice versa. ! BEWARE ! It ships with a .exe that is made to glorify the poor hardware of the Microsoft Xbox 360, alas they've limited the framerates to 30FPS. It is completely unplayable as the mouse-delay is unbearable. So pick up the free .exe made from a user on the Internet that enables x>30 FPS - make a copy of the original .exe as some missions WILL be glitched.Other than that, the story is really fun, voice acting is pretty natural and the overall world is very attractive, esp. during winter. It's a little small and there is a great lack of side mission, in my opinion. The game compensates that lack of side missions with stellar story missions! This game is *fully* worth your money, and so will a sequel be.. I hope. ;)8,2/10			"

												You're not going to take it anymore. From edgy publisher Rockstar's Vancouver development team comes this dark comedy set in the most vile and sadistic setting yet in a Rockstar videogame: the schoolyard. As a troublesome schoolboy, you'll laugh and cringe as you stand up to bullies, get picked on by teachers, play pranks on malicious kids, win or lose the girl, and ultimately learn to navigate the obstacles of the fictitious reform school, Bullworth Academy.

												Pros:1. You won't get bored with this game's storyline. It's funny and interesting all the way through.2. Separate school ""factions,"" i.e. nerds, bullies, jocks, etc. Doing certain events in the game raise/lower respect with different groups. You can also access different groups' hideouts.3. Lots of fun to be had outside of the events. Causing mayhem in the school is entertaining enough.Cons:1. I found the controls a little awkward, especially when fighting other characters.2. This might have been my experience, but it takes a while to load different areas. This really effected the flow of the game.3. It takes a bit of learning to coordinate through the characters' schedule. Getting caught outside of class while in the middle of an event can cause a reset, which can be irritating if you're in the middle of a particularly difficult event.I'm sort of neutral on whether to recommend this game or not. I really enjoyed the storyline, the characters, and the extra details added to the game (such as the different seasons). However, I found myself becoming disinterested quickly between the long loading screens and sometimes difficult to achieve events. But if these things don't bother you, I would say you should get it.			"

												I played and finished this game when I was in middle school and wished that I could live the experience every time I played it. I highly recommend this game, although it has a GTA feel to it, it tops that game in many ways in my opinion, purely because it is more innocent. The plot is fun and interesting to follow, and if you are a teenager in spirit (or in reality) you can connect with the in-game characters really well.The number of hours I have played this game probably exceed 200, and the version of the game I used to play on the PS2 did not have half of the classes you get in this version, I very pleased to be playing this game again here, and would recommend that everyone give it a try too.

												This is definetly one of the best games rockstar has ever put out, the story in here is great and the loads of school based mini games are really fun but my one problem with the game is just how poorly optimized it is on pc. Im sure that there are ways around this but its just annoying having to mess with all the files and get it running properly. If you have the time and patience then i would recommend it especially for the crazy prices that this game goes for on steam but if your looking to jump right in without any issues then get the Xbox 360 or PS2 Versions. Its backwards compatible on Xbox One and theres a port of the PS2 version on PS3 and PS4. The Wii and Mobile Versions aren't really that good though...			"

I tried all the tricks they listed on the forums, I went to rockstars website for the downloads.. nothing kept the game working for me. If you can find this game on console it is amazing. I would not recommeend losing your money for the pc version.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, but I can't recommend purchasing it as long as it has so many crashing issues on Windows 10 systems.  It would be one thing if it were no longer for sale, but it is for sale, and it's expensive enough that it's really not okay to have so many people with the same complaint and the only official fix is to tell Windows it's only allowed to use 2 gigs of RAM.  There are a myriad of suggested fixes in the forums, but none seem to fix my problems entirely.It's too bad, this would be a definite ""buy"" if not for the constant crashing.			"

It also includes the original soundtrack for free and hell that is good! The soundtrack in this game fits so perfectly on every situation and each student gang has its own unique music that make the game more fun to be played with. I wish that rockstar made Bully 2 in the future.I really recommend this game for y'all, It's not a waste if you it and please don't bully in real life :D "

												Bully is such a great game! Actually, it's my favorite Rockstar game and that says something. BUT (yeah that was a big but) : Since I've updated my OS from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, the game keeps ♥♥♥♥ing crashing!! So annoying, man...And I have literally tried every ""fix"" there is, and nothing worked properly. Though I've managed to reduce the amount of crashes. On average it crashes like every 30 min. So ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. I mean it's a great game and I would still recommend it but I hope that the fat ♥♥♥♥♥ at Rockstar will get it fixed eventually, cuz those crashes ruin it completely.			"

												This was a fantastic game back in the day of the PS2 era, still is to be honest. It's great when Rock star bring their games to pc, *Cough* Red Dead Redemption *Cough*.So with Bully being developed by beloved RockStar, it was designed from the same vein as GTA...but with kids...and no guns...or killing. Not necessary a major drag, you just get to run around with a super powered slingshot, stink bombs and fire crackers to really annoy people.The game is based around a 15 year kid called Jimmy Hopkins, who is transferred to a boarding school because his mum wanted to go on a 12+ month holiday. Lucky her, eh? So you're the new kid, and you need to work your way up the ranks to be at the top of the school. So naturally no one respects or fears you to start with, even the nerds of the school. So you do the usual mission progression and go through the chapters, which are pretty much like school terms, and you work for different school groups to gain their respect and trust.That's pretty much the jist of the game, other than that it's got you're typical collectables hunt, garage full of vehicles (in this case it's push bikes), shops selling you goods to help you with your carnage, and mini games to help you earn extra cash / abilities.The mini games are kinda fun and can completed fairly quickly. You've got your class room mini games and your 'earn some do$h' mini games. The cash ones are typical teenager jobs, such as a paper route or mowing lawns. But with the class room mini games they help improve Jimmy's abilities, such as chemistry lessons help buff up your chemistry set to create more useful and powerful prank tools. Auto shop gives you better push bikes, English helps you pick up the ladies ;D and so on. The class room mini games can essentially be completed in the first chapter, so no more lessons for the whole year! If only...*Sigh*Quite a lengthy game, if you go for 100% completion. The story is a bit meh and generic, like it's been done in a way before in previous RockStar game. Not going to give too many spoilers now! You'll just have to play and find out ;)  Then again, I could be completely getting one of the GTA games plots all wrong in my head, I hope not.But there are some good moments in the story with memorable, and stereo typical, characters you expect from a US school. Can't say I can really relate to be honest, British high school life is waaaaaaaay different. Thanks for butchering the spirit of The Inbetweeners, USA...An annoying factor to the game is the restriction at night where you can't be out of your dorm past 8 pm, other wise you get chased by the never sleeping prefects and police. If you're out after 2 or 3 am, you automatically get knocked out and appear in your dorm for 8 am. So you can't be a crazy kid and never sleep, ever.I do have to you warn you though, since this was a console port to the PC the controls aren't 100% perfect. So I recommend playing with a controller. Not the keyboard & Mouse!Over all the game isn't too bad, defiantly worth picking up if you have nostalgic feelings towards this game. I know I did, and didn't regret it! :DIn conclusion:  Fairly decent graphics from the PS2 era.  Good story, the game is quite lengthy if you also do the side content.  Excellent alternative to the GTA series, if you're looking for a less violent game.  Plenty of side content to keep a completionist busy for a few hours.  Fun character clothing customising. Make Jimmy look like a right ponce.  Fairly big open world.  Irritating in game hours, in which you have only so many to do stuff in.  Poor port to PC, use a game pad rather than a keyboard & mouse.7 / 10 Get the Go-Kart asap, other wise you won't be able to run the old ladies over fast enough before they dive out of the way.			"

												Bully SEPart 1: GameplayBully is a very good game as you go though a lot of missions to do with helping people or getting revenge on people.Also if you are stuck on a mission you can always do errands (aka side quest) to earn money.Part 2: RealisimRealisim in this game is good as if you dont sleep at night you will faint. Also if you dont go to class on time and get spotted by a prefect you will be sent to the princibles office. One of my Favourite things on Bully is if you do to much bad stuff you will have to go though detension, but no not normal detension! Instead you have to mow the lawn in a time trial.Part 3: OverallI know there is not much to this game. But I DO recommend it.			"

												Never got the chance to play Bully before, and jumped at the chance as it was on sale , initially it worked fine, but now it's havng alot of crashing issues with windows 10 (possibly since anniversary update) , but i've seen people have issues with 7 and 8.1 , so i'm not sure, i've heard good things abput this game and want to play it (and hopefully it gets a sequel) but i can't reccommend buying until Rockstar fixes the issues			"

												Believe it or not this game is a good learning tool.  It preps you for college. It does this because you have to jumble going to class and doing quests. If only I had owned Bully before I went to college.  This game also teaches you how to get girls in 3 EASY steps. 1). Cat-call them ""ayy bby u want sum♥♥♥♥♥"" 2). Give them a gift like flowers or chocolate 3). Kiss them.  Now I get all da pussi (plural for ♥♥♥♥♥) at college.  The only problem with this game is the name.  It should be called:  BETA FANTASY SIMULATOR 2005.  Thanks to this game I can live out my alpha fantasies!			"

												Definitely one of my favorite games of all time, I played so many weeks worth of hours on the ps2, doing all the quests, getting all the content, romancing students, and decided to buy it on pc since it's now my main source for games...the sheer amount of things you can do in this game--the storyline and its quests are amazing by itself but in addition there are dozens of side quests to complete and items to acquire. Jimmy's room becomes sort of a trophy case for all your achievements in game and it's rewarding to try to get everything you can. As well as that, exploring the world is very fun and rewarding, especially given that you have limitations such as a curfew, so biking around the city at night leads to cops chasing you for ages.Amazing game, I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

												I remember putting this game into my PS2 way back when thinking it would just be Grand Theft Auto in a school. But boy was I happy that I was wrong. Everything about Bully, whether it be its characters, atmosphere, or even its soundtrack, just gives it way more personality than some Grand Theft Autos. It never feels like a chore to play, with more varied missions that keep it interesting long after you'd usually get bored with a GTA campaign. When I saw it on the Summer Sale, I got without hesitation and started my journey through Bullworth Academy for my 4th time. The only complaint I have with the game is that the towns outside of the school never feel as fleshed out or interesting. But that and minor glitches aside, Bully is a fenominal game. And if you have a controller nearby to use, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a fenominal port.			"

												Sometimes I have problems switching in-between multiple opponents. Some of the classes may be difficult for you. It's older, but it's still a really good game. It was made by Rockstar so if you like GTA you will probably like this game too. You can get several types of transportation in the game (no cars though.) The missions where you help the hobo by finding him radio transmitters are hillarious. You have a wide variety of weapons( no real guns.) The high school nostalgia is definately worth the price.			"

												A good, solid game with a lot of charm. However, just like it's protagonist, it's rough around the edges and lacks what is needed for it to be great. When people say it's kinda like GTA in school enviroment, they're right. It's kinda like GTA. Unlike GTA, you're somewhat limited by the school system and time, because you can only do certain things at certain time, but the time flies by quickly and so does the tempo of this game. You're constantly on the move, doing a lot of smaller missions and try to fit them to your daily routine, which is not a bad thing, but a lot of missions are really primitive, especially compared to GTA. Many of them are creative, so you won't be getting bored, I just wish we perhaps had less and more fleshed out ones. You can of course slow down, doing less every day and just fart around, but it can be frustrating, knowing you have to commit truancy to finish a mission, when you want to go to class so you can get a nice upgrade (passing at least some classes is adviced, others give you crap like different clothes you'll likely never wear out of embarrasement).Bully has a lot going for it, but it has some drawbacks, making it somewhat difficult to recommend to everyone. First off, the obvious - poor PC conversion. You will not have a good time playing this with keyboard and mouse. A gamepad is a must. Second, the controls are sometimes very loose and inprecise, plus the autoaiming system when you fight somebody is downright broken, on multiple occasions it targeted an ally, or target that was much further than the one I actually wanted to attack. Also, I really had an issue with a camera, not only it likes to fly around like crazy, but the default view is almost sitting on the ground, not like in any GTA, where it flies over your shoulder. Here, I found myself constantly battling against it.The game has a decent lenght, but it pales compared to GTA. It's by no means short game, but I couldn't help wishing for more - spending more time with certain characters, longer missions and better main story, which is rather weak to be honest, not that it's bad, there are many great moments, but it's somewhat overshadowed by smaller and isolated encounters with weird inhabitants of Bullworth. You meet a lot of hillarious characters once or twice, and then they just fade away, or maybe you'll bump into them randomly, and that's kinda it. Not that it's dissapointing, once again, I just wish there was more, because this settings has so much potential. The main protagonist is kinda underdeveloped, he doesn't have that much character going for and sometimes does questionable things without questioning them at all, when just few seconds before he was pretty vocal about it.With that out of the way, Bully is worth your time. For a great price, there is every school steteotype imaginable, it's all filled to the top with great humor. Dialogues are fantastic, characters are fantastic (although you spend way less time with those that are really interesting, and there is very little character development, again, probably due to the more arcady nature of the game), the atmosphere is fantastic and despite you being limited to much smaller area than San Andreas for example, it's packed with stuff to do. I've especially liked that weather changes as you go through whole year and so does appearance of everything. I don't think there are many games from school enviroment, but I'm willing to bet there aren't any that have open world and are this funny. It is a miracle that we even got this game, and even though it's flawed and lacking, it puts an evil grin on my face.// Also, outdoor graphics are strangely muddy and blurred, there is some rather unfortunate effect applied there, and it doesn't happen indoors. Because of that, when you first start the game, you'll immediatelly feel like something is wrong, and that perhaps you have a wrong resolution. No, it's the game, either a weird design decision, or another bug.			"

Highly recommend it for its amazing storyline, well thought out characters, and a flawless art style for its time, not to mention the music, fitting the 60s high school style.

												I played this all the way through on the Xbox 360 Edition, Since I don't play consoles anymore, I picked this up for the PC when it was on sale.The game itself is really great, especially considering when it came out. The graphics have certainly aged, though they were good for their time. The gameplay itself is very unique, you get weapons which you'd expect a schoolyard deviant to have, like a slingshot, spud gun, etc. Plus, you have to perform minigames to do well in your classes. Despite your character's deviant nature, it actually will help you to advance in each class, giving you things like new ways to interact with people socially, new outfits, eventually new bikes, and in the science class, new, unique weapons.The Story is pretty long and you'll find yourself having a good, lengthy gameplay expirience, not to even begin with all the side-stuff and optional stuff you can do. But basically, as a new kid, you're trying to make as many allies as possible with all of the social groups at bullworth academy. I'm not going to say more because I don't want to spoil anything, but it's a good story nonetheless and one to be expected from a dysfunctional academy of sorts.At first the world feels a bit limited, but that's only as you're getting the ropes of things, once the town opens up, the world is actually a pretty good size, and like I said before, there is a fair amount to do, especially when the town opens up. There also is a curfew, if you're not back in your dorm by a certain time, you can get in trouble with the prefects or the police, and if you don't get back to school in time, you can even pass out and lose your shoes or some other items.While the game is good, the PC port is very lacking, I can't even get it to do 1080p right on one monitor without part of the picture disappearing and/or stretching out to the other monitor. There's also a pretty limited amount of graphics options, however, one thing to keep in mind too is that this game is several years old, and computers back then couldn't handle what the ones of today can.Overall, if you still after all these years haven't tried it, I would highly reccomend it, it's a great, full game that has a lot on offer and you will likely not be dissappointed. 8.5/10			"

												     Probably Rockstar's best game. There isn't anything that really needs to be said about this game other than that it's just game, no stupid tutorials, no unnecessary features, it is just done well with just the right amount of stuff. Not only that, it follows a really unique gameplay style (more kid friendly than their edgy Manhunt too) which is pretty fun to play, a nice story that actually shows how bad bullying is and shows Jimmy being rewarded for being a ""good"" character, and a great port to the PC. This doesn't really need to be mentioned, but there isn't any problem with controls, or any bugs, or any problems at all, it does every really well and it feels really nice on PC. If you need me to describe what makes this game so good I will easily describe what makes this game so good (since there is a lot).This game's story is just great. There is so much to it and it is so great. It's all about characterization, but still manages to focus on gameplay and problems in the game world. Each chapter shows you gaining the respect of each clique, while showing you not only what their stereotypical clique is, but what each character there is like, which can be pretty funny, or if not, interesting to listen to. I don't think there is any part where I was really bored, which is great. There are also side missions which typically are teachers asking you to do things for them, and are actually somewhat linear themselves. These missions really give you an idea of what the people are like in this game in the background, and gives you a whole world to immerse yourself in. It really does well with the immersion, especially with just how humorous the world is (it's showing that the whole world is almost literally out to get him, and that not only are the teachers idiots, drunks, or evil, but the kids are essentially stereotypes who aren't interesting, but interesting at the same time, something you have to love about this game). Overall, it's really a great experience that you'd have to see for yourself on why it's so great.The gameplay style is pretty interesting too since you play as a 15 year old in a really bad school and neighborhood. There isn't any killing or weapons, and because of that, it focuses more on melee combat and combos, and special stuff like eggs and stink bombs. Other than the combat, there are still stores and an open world like GTA, just a lot smaller, so you focus more on using the map to your advantage and experiencing the importance of each area. Also, there are fun minigames like the Challenges for save points and the Carnival, which both reward you with cool stuff. If nothing else, it's a pretty worthwhile experience just because it's something new, but it's a lot more than that.Overall, this game is a lot of fun and definitely worth paying even full price for. You'll definitely get your money out of this and more. I really can't describe anything more than that so for the best idea of what this game is about you'll have to play it.			"

												This is by far my favorite game out of all the ones Rockstar has done. It has the feel of a Rockstar game but the story is amazing. The setting actually makes you feel like you are back at school with all the drama and hijinx it entails. Even after 7 years the game still locks amazing and plays great too.I honestly want Rockstar to make a sequel to this game more then any of their other series. PS you can shoot bottlerockets and throw a rubber band ball of death			"

												Just got 100% completion on Bully: SE, had a great time having a wild goose chase to complete all the little tasks and keeping out of the cops/prefects' reach :POne of the best games I've played. I really like the fact that it was open-world and that I could interact with npc's, also lots of gameplay and an interesting storyline (which was definitely not repetetive) to keep me entertained, and the type of humor the npc's and story had to offer was great. I would honestly play the game from start to finish a second time.Bully can be innapropriate at times, as in cursing and sexual themes, so I can't say I recommend it to everybody. Be warned, squeamish and little young'uns :3			"

Welcome to Bullworth Academy, an interesting place to say the least. You play as Jimmy Hopkins, a delinquent child on his last chance in an open world. As your progress through the game, you unlock access to more parts of the world, which contains a vast area to explore. This game is a classic, and is just as fun today as it was 10 years ago.Pros:+Visuals have aged very well for a 10 year old game+The gameplay is smooth, with the encounter of a bug being very rare+Very playable, third time playing this game from start to finish and was still enjoyable+Open world full of quirks to explore+Characters fit to their groups seamlessly, making it seem very close to a real school experience+Wide variety of characters with each dialogue fitting in almost naturally +Each environment is carefully designed and makes the setting seem almost realCons:-Main story is generally short, possibly beatable in one long sitting-Sounds sometimes seem out of place, removing a little from the immersion -Limited to a certain playstyle, most choices are made for youOverall this game is a classic, and I highly reccomend it.

												Definitely in my top 5 games that badly deserves a sequel! It's a game where you, a troubled boy, go from just getting by in school to taking over the corrupt school and is made by the people that made the Grand Theft Auto games. Who didn't wish this was a game before it existed?! It's absolutely done right too! This is one of the best games ever by Rockstar in my opinion.			"

Highly recommend it for its amazing storyline, well thought out characters, and a flawless art style for its time, not to mention the music, fitting the 60s high school style. Would expect nothing less from Rockstar, the makers of the Grand Theft Auto series. 100/10 Would play again and again and again.			"

												I played this all the way through on the Xbox 360 Edition, Since I don't play consoles anymore, I picked this up for the PC when it was on sale.The game itself is really great, especially considering when it came out. The graphics have certainly aged, though they were good for their time. The gameplay itself is very unique, you get weapons which you'd expect a schoolyard deviant to have, like a slingshot, spud gun, etc. Plus, you have to perform minigames to do well in your classes. Despite your character's deviant nature, it actually will help you to advance in each class, giving you things like new ways to interact with people socially, new outfits, eventually new bikes, and in the science class, new, unique weapons.The Story is pretty long and you'll find yourself having a good, lengthy gameplay expirience, not to even begin with all the side-stuff and optional stuff you can do. But basically, as a new kid, you're trying to make as many allies as possible with all of the social groups at bullworth academy. I'm not going to say more because I don't want to spoil anything, but it's a good story nonetheless and one to be expected from a dysfunctional academy of sorts.At first the world feels a bit limited, but that's only as you're getting the ropes of things, once the town opens up, the world is actually a pretty good size, and like I said before, there is a fair amount to do, especially when the town opens up. There also is a curfew, if you're not back in your dorm by a certain time, you can get in trouble with the prefects or the police, and if you don't get back to school in time, you can even pass out and lose your shoes or some other items.While the game is good, the PC port is very lacking, I can't even get it to do 1080p right on one monitor without part of the picture disappearing and/or stretching out to the other monitor. There's also a pretty limited amount of graphics options, however, one thing to keep in mind too is that this game is several years old, and computers back then couldn't handle what the ones of today can.Overall, if you still after all these years haven't tried it, I would highly reccomend it, it's a great, full game that has a lot on offer and you will likely not be dissappointed. 8.5/10			"

												The only problem I have with this game is that if you play it on Windows 10, around chapter 3 your game will start to crash. It's best to not play the game on Windows 10 as it will start to crash every couple minutes while you play. If you are using any other operating system then I'm sure Bully will run fine and no crashes will occur, thus you will not getting frustrated every 5 minutes due to ""Bully.exe has stopped working.""

You will see why. I have this game on PS2 and PC, and I love the story line, which is far better than the Grand Theft Auto V story line. You are in a school, called Bullworth Academy.The town of course, is called Bullworth. And you gussed it... It's Free Roam Open World :) - The best game type!Just buy the game. Now. I promise you will love it. If you don't I will eat my hat.RATES - 10/10			"

												This game is just as good as I remembered. The port is not good, and there are glitches along the way, but I managed to get through all of those and beat the game. Also, with some modding, you can make the game look a little better. I'd say get it when it's on sale.			"

												This game is my all-time favorite open world game. On top of the storyline, the interactiveness and freedom that the game gives you is just amazing.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the Rockstar games franchise, or just anyone who enjoys open world roleplaying games.I did NOT regret buying this game, it's just awesome.

												One of the Best games ever made, sadly they probably won't fix the crashing, but sometimes this helps, start up the game, ALT+TAB out of it into your desktop, in the searchbar, type in task manager, then right click on bully and then click on go to details, then right click again, then click on set priority, make the priority either high or realtime, it will show a thing that says, Are you sure you want to change the priority, click yes, you have to do this every time you load up the game.

												The gameplay is fun and this game manages to do a lot even with its Teen rating. You can do the same things you do in GTA games. There are clothing shops, barber shops, and many ways to get around the world like bikes or skateboards. Just like GTA, when the time comes to cause some havoc the option is there. However, Rockstar in their infinite wisdom decided to phone it in on the pc port like they always do. I logged many hours on bully on the PS2 and Xbox, but this version of the game is far inferior. There are severe pop in issues and the options menu is lacking.			"

												First of all, it crashes every 10-15 minutes on Windows 10 with no warning whatsoever and there's no real fix anywhere.  I've tried the ""fixed"" exe, running as administrator, Windows XP compatibility mode, everything.  Still crashes constantly.  For that reason I can't recommend it.As for the game itself, this is a console game and it almost certainly should be played with an Xbox 360/One controller.  It will will work with KB/M but it's awkard.  Being a console game, there aren't a lot of video options.  Unfortunately the game is locked at 30 fps, but if you've played the original Bully then there you go.The gameplay is fun, simple, and engaging.  The soundtrack is oustanding, and luckily the Steam version comes with the soundtrack as well.  The non-music sounds in the game are fairly low quality.  It has a pretty strong story mode.  If it gets fixed, I would highly recommend it.			"

												I love the game, but this is a terribly shoddy port of it. I went to settings and set video to 1080p, and now I can only see a quarter of the screen. I can no longer even see the resolution options to reverse the resolution change. I could probably fix it by messing around with files, but frankly I'd prefer to just play the 360 version of this game.Bottom line: This game should not even be available for purchase, as it's closer to what you'd expect from the inundation of abject dreck that one would find on Greenlight than it is to a boxed commercial product. buyer beware!

												Great game with many interesting and fun missions. Only problem is the game crashes a lot and there is no autosave function built into the game so if you are in the middle of a mission and your game crashes, it starts you back at the last time you saved in game. This game gets a thumbs up just because of how good it is, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to windows 10 users. I think I will contact Rockstar soon to help me with the issue.			"

												Bully is a great game which I spent many hours on when it first came out on PS2, but as usual - Rockstar have brought another buggy game to the PC with no interest in patching it.Game crashes every 20 minutes or so, regardless of workarounds.Launch Options:Windows XP SP3 Compatbility Mode,Run as Administrator,Launch with ""-d3d10"" startup switch.

												Two quick things to note before you purchase Bully: Scholarship Edition: 1. The game runs at 30fps natively (Whoop de doo, but apparently this is an issue for some people.)2.  An XBox 360 pad or 360 pad emulating software is highly recommended to play this game properly. Other configurations can work, but it works best with 360-styled controls.Anyway...Bully: Scholarship Edition is a 2008 upgrade of the 2006 PS2 game, so don't expect a lot of the bells and whistles that open world games of today have, and even in scale it's much smaller than Rockstar's other PS2 offerings. The smaller scale works in Bully's favor however, as the world is much easier to navigate and able to breathe a bit more. In the game you'll spend your time juggling your school studies alongside completing various missions to advance the story and curry favor with the various cliques around campus. Mission structures are fairly simple and easy to execute and have a certain charm to them given the high school setting. Blowing up toilets with firecrackers, dropping stink bombs in lockers, and rolling teachers down a hill an a locked porta potty are a lot more charming than the typical Rockstar fare of ""Go here, shoot dudes, now go here."" There's still a bit of open-world repetition to the process, but the story missions are varied enough and the scholastic mini-games fun enough that tedium rarely sets in. Narratively, Bully is more a comedy than most open-world games. There are quite a few genuine laugh oud loud lines and moments that make seeing the story through a worthwhile endeavor. Though the story and characters are brilliantly acted, they're unfortunately not written quite as well as they should be and the overall narrative and anti-bullying messages end up muddled. The main antagonist only appears in the opening and final chapters and the climax feels very slapdash and out of nowhere. With as strong as the Grand Theft Auto PS2 games were in this department, it's a bit of a bummer that Bully ended up getting a bit of a short stick. All that said, if you missed Bully the first time around, it's certainly worth a look. There's enough charm, comedy, fun things to get into, and great acting to keep the tedium of an overworld game from creeping up too often, just be aware that the payoff might not be exactly what you were hoping for.

												Bully: Scholarship EditionPositives:+ A really fun open world game, where you play as a bully named Jimmy Hopkins. You can learn some really cool fight moves, use slingshots, stink bombs, itching powder, spud guns and throw eggs at people..there's many, many more items than that. This game has a comical and serious feel to it which is great.+ The storyline is interesting and you get to interact with the stereotypical school groups, such as jocks, preps and nerds. + You can attend school throughout the game or skip it, but there's numerous activities to complete in each class, many of which are enjoyable. There are a lot of small errands to complete and collectibles to find.+ I liked the style of the graphics. Even though they are not amazing for the time period, they're nice.Negatives:- The map size feels adequate when playing, but it takes a moment to realise it's quite small, especially for a Rockstar game. This is where Bully could have been improved. A bigger map, with even more to do and see. The exploration in this game is fine, but it could be enhanced.- Lack of quality side missions. You can participate in errands, but they don't have any plot background and the rewards aren't exactly useful. Bully: Scholarship Edition would benefit from deeper story-based distractions and side missions, extending the gameplay time. Which leads me to my final point.- The game is fairly short, it took me approximately 25 hours to finish which I suppose isn't too bad, but it's not quite long enough for an open world game.Overall Score: 7.5/10Bully: Scholarship Edition is awesome fun. It's a game that has been largely forgotten with time, but definitely worth picking up.			"

 Review: Bully: Scholarship EditionThis is an Honest ReviewPROS➦ Open world style Small Town➦ Many activities for the player to do➦ No guns, no drugs. Just classic ways to fight.➦ It doesn't have the GTA style gameplay, you can't drive cars, you drive bikes. You can get busted at school for breaking school rules instead of killing people.➦ Good balance between slow pacing and fast paced action scenes.CONS➦ It is indeed a bit dated.➦ Odd selection of keys for certain actions (Using Left Alt to confirm things?)➦ You cannot edit most settings while in game, only on the main menu.MY RATING: 7.5/10DO I RECOMMEND IT: Yes!

												I've enjoyed Rockstar Games' 'Grand Theft Auto' series ever since the release of 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'. I thought they did a great job technically with their game engines and stylistically with the visual designs. Plus, 'Grand Theft Auto' games are great satire of the crime film/game genre and of contemporary society for the most part. While aware of the negative impact the games can have on society and the younger generation of gamers, I still defend the merits of 'Grand Theft Auto' games.I was pretty stoked when I first read about 'Bully' back in 2005/2006, but was disappointed that the first iteration would not come to the PC platform. About a decade later, I finally got my hands on the remastered version of the game, thinking that Rockstar had injected similar type of technical and stylistic mastery, and social acuity into crafting this game as they did with 'Grand Theft Auto'. Was I wrong. True, in the year 2015, the game engine that runs 'Bully' will definitely show its age; I can accept that. However, 'Bully: Scholarship Edition' looks and sounds very uneven in spite of the remastering. The keyboard and mouse controls for the PC also feel unoptimized.The truth is, I just can't recommend 'Bully: Scholarship Edition'. It simply lacks the energy, fire and humour that I enjoy in 'Grand Theft Auto' games. The setting of Bullworth Academy, while well-designed, just doesn't seem to allow for much exploration. It feels too confined and claustrophobic even when compared to 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City', which was released in 2002. Most importantly, 'Bully' doesn't play or feel like a satire. It is pretty much a straight-up (private) school simulator full of cliques and stereotypes with uninspired early missions.While you may approach 'Bully' and complete missions with good intentions, and that your character implicitly dislikes being bullied, you ironically need to be a bully to accomplish your goals. The unsatirical tone of 'Bully' actually makes me feel horrible for my heinous actions in the game. While I can find some reason to justify my undertaking of violent acts in 'Grand Theft Auto', I find my actions and bullying in 'Bully' to be distasteful.In the end, I guess where 'Bully' fails is that it is too real. Whereas the action sequences, violence and set pieces in 'Grand Theft Auto' were designed to be cinematic, grandiose and hyperbolic -- making the games rather hyper-realistic, all the bullying and hijinx in 'Bully' are mostly possible and hit too close to home for comfort. Given the well documented negative impacts of bullying on people of all ages, I cannot in good conscience recommend 'Bully: Scholarship Edition'.			"

												I have tried playing this game three or four times because I have fond memories of playing it on the original Wii, but after the game crashed time and time again, shortly after loading in, I had to give up on it. Thank god I got it in a sale, because if not I would be raging right now.			"

												This game is still broken for windows 10!!! Everytime that I've played this game it has crashed on me. It's a real shame that rockstar would sell a game that doesn't function right on windows 10. I know asking for a update is probably me being to hopefull, but i just want to be able to play what I payed for. Bully is an awesome game, and it would really be great if they fixed this!			"

												A poor experience. Console controls clumsily mapped to PC combined with unresponsive mouse look and random targeting makes completing quests and avoiding prefects seemingly a matter of luck. Then the fact that the game can't really be saved means tedious reloads and repetition to finish quests.When I failed I often felt the game was at fault not me. Giving up -- don't have time for this when much better games wait to be played.(Not to mention the crashes on Windows 10)			"

												I played Bully so much on my PS2 when I was young and never had the chance to finish it and get the 100%, and I did all this on the Steam version. It's surely my favorite Rockstar game.-The story is very good, not too complex or outstanding, but it's very good.-The map is not too large, it's even kinda small if compared to other Rockstar titles, but you have anough stuff to do in it, so that's not such a big problem.-The missions are fun, really, really fun.-Side missions are as much fun and entertaining.-Lots of secrets to unlock.-It's addictive and fun to play the whole game, but sometimes it can get a bit repetitive, so you need to take a break when that happens, and come back after some time.-There are bugs, but they never really interfered in my experience, except the people walking around and their sounds being heard from the other side of the map.Also, if you have that bug when you start the game and everything disappear, you can fix this with a patch (just Google search ""bully bug fix"" and you'll probably find it somewhere).

It's a very fun rockstar game, however like many of their games it isn't optimised too well for PC with issues with sound I often found. The interesting idea of this game is that you are playing a kid and not an adult causing chaos like in a typical GTA game. I believe they should try something like this again as I'm sure it'd be well worth the interest.			"

												I've had this game on consoles and it's been absolutely brilliant. Made by the makers of GTA, it really is like a version of GTA in a school setting. Since it was released I've spent countless hours playing it... but I can't recommend it on the basis that it REALLY doesn't translate well onto the PC. The graphics are bad. Not just bad, I mean to the point of being unplayable and I've got a top end graphics card. It's a shame because the game itself is fantastic, but it really is best left for the consoles!			"

												Really wanted to enjoy this game, but it's either the general awfulness of the PC port or the fact that the graphics and gameplay really haven't aged well - I couldn't get myself to play past the first few missions. Also, the writing doesn't really work for me - the world doesn't feel anywhere near as real and immersive as the GTA games always have. Still, with halfway decent controls the game would at least have been playable.Can't recommend. If you really must play it on PC, wait until it's 2€ or something on sale.			"

												Why is my School in this game?Jokes aside (Actually I'm not) this game is great, the graphics still hold up today and the game is very fun!You are Jimmy, the new kid at Bullworth Academy who is rather untenable and causes a lot of trouble!Classes in this game are fun! Except for English for obvious reasons, when you finish them, you get a new item like a shirt, outfit or a new ability. Weapons are very creative like a Spud cannon, a rubber band ball and a baseball bat you can find.Also everyone in this game has a unquie model, voice and personality, you might see a girl with a boy one day, while the next shes talking to someone else, I have never seen this in any game so far besides the Sims, sadly I haven't seen any of these yet :c

Also the music is fantastic, some of it sounds like a 70s cop film.Overall if your a fan of Rockstar or love open world games, this is a must have.			"

												Pros: Good conceptCons: Everything else, specifically the game content and the apalling interfaceThis is a very poor quality port. I haven't played it on a console, but it's obvious that it's not a PC game. To start with, the mouse control is atrociously bad. I can't see where I'm going and I needed to get a trackpad just to pick locks. The menu interfaces are diabolical: you have to use left shift control and space to select things that a mouse could click just as easily. The fight controls are similarly awful and hard to get the hang of. A mouse click would do the same job as holding r and left shift. Sprinting is a waste of effort too. Who wants to quickly tap shift?On to the game itself. The ""missions"" I've completed so far are so interesting that I want to stick my head in an oven. I had to speak to the headmaster, get some chocolates for a butch neurotic lesbian and walk to two classes. Oh, and then I had to put someone in a bin after chasing them for a few minutes. It's so unengaging I'd rather organise my desktop icons.For a game released in 2008, I can't help thinking that the graphics are a bit substandard too, but that's not really important. The glitchy sound is also very annoying. Oh, and I have to walk to some irrelevant room just to save. That would have been alright if this game was fun like Vice City, but it wasn't fun at all. The walks to the save room just gave me time to contemplate how♥♥♥♥♥♥it was.			"

												One of the unsung gems of Rockstar, Bully can be aptly described as ""GTA for kids,"" but yet so much more. Don't let that tagline fool you, Bully is nearly as good as, if not better, than its M-Rated cousin, and deserves the cult following. Its missions are high in number but short and sweet, and it's easy to wreak havoc in the schoolyards witout a shred of guilt. More importanty, Jimmy Hopkins is a genuinely likeable character, which is saying a lot considering he's the poster boy for an angsty teenager. One of the better protagonists crafted by Rockstar by far, and simultaneously allow players to cause chaos at Bullworth without the cognitive dissonance and easily slip back into the role of a hero when the story calls for it.It would be wise, however, to skip out on the PC version, which is a lousy port, and go straight for the console versions, either for the Wii or the 360's HD edition.But if you want a short-but-sweet ""Steam style"" review, here's one!I said ""hi"" to a nerd. He tried to punch me in return. A prefect came and kicked his♥♥♥♥♥for me. 10/10.			"

I decided this game was worth it and I still love it. It works very well either with the keyboard or controller. However, I was very disappointed that with Windows 10 this game continues to crash at random intervals with no provoked signs. The fact that you can only save at certain locations means when this random crash happens, all my progress in a mission has been discarded.			"

												Most people refere to this as a ""terrible port"" or some rude term the chose to say, the truth about this game is that it is an amazing game, has absolutly no lag, and has many ways to customize gameplay. While true it does have it bugs like any good game its an older game that doesn't get so many updates. Most of the people buying this and complaning are people that were looking for something stupid like CoD but cheaper, this game is nothing like CoD its if anything more like Pokemon or Fire Emblem because it has well developed characters and helps make it feel like the character you play as is actually you not just some random person.If your looking for a game with plenty to do, hard to forget characters, and made for any kind of person then Bully: Scholarship Edition is a game you should buy even if it is full price.I honestly give the game an 11/10 and hope for a sequal, remake with more in it (message if you wish to know all), or very similar game by the same company.

												Fun game! If you're playing ""Bully: Scholarship Edition"" for nostalgic purposes, the game will be an even better experience. That being said, despite the much better graphics than the original version, the game is pretty dated. If you've never played the game before, I wouldn't buy it for more than $5. If you beat the game 100% it's easily over 20 hours of gameplay.			"

												Just got to the save point? Wouldn't it be a shame if Bully was to cr--But honestly, I really adored the concept and system of the game, but its hard to enjoy this when it crashed every time I got about 15-20 minutes into the game. There are allot of fixes created in the community disscussion, but none of them really worked for me. I would love to try play this game once there is a confirmed fix, but for now this game is unplayable for me.			"

												This is a great blast from the past. Have you ever been bullied. Yes:well this is your chance to fight back! No, I bullied people: Well great uoull fit right in.Pros: Give wedgies, throw people in lockers, skip class, start fights, run from the cops, ride a ferris wheel, destroy gnomes for a carnie, and throwsnowballs at cars, this games great. It has the factions that dominate the schoolgrounds(before the emo/hipster/swag phase) such as the Jocks, Nerds, Bullies, Outcasts, and Greasers(yeah Greasers, bring the spud cannon). You dont have the largest aresnal in a game, but your in school, start off with a slingshot, get a skateboard, build your bicycle, make friends(advance in story) to get more weapons. Some weapons can be learned in class such as the stink bombs and firework launcher.Cons: The games dated, but not terribly. Think of going back to GTA:SA with a Vice city sized map( I guess), no lethal guns, only forms of are your always handy skatebord, and bicycles,no strippers.If you like what Rockstar puts out, but want less ""adult content"" then this is the game for you.

												very fun and the story lasts Forever but i wouldn't recemend wearing the elf outfit unless you want to be made fun of by nerds but thats a good excuse throw them in the bin >:D at the carnival there is pleanty to do, i would save up for the scooter as it comes in handy in many mission. overall i would give it 10/10 there are some glitches but that adds some comedy to it as you can see from screen shots they can be so funny and some not so much but all the same enjoyable so i would recommened adding to your wishlist or picking it up as ive played about 17hours so far all very enjoyable!

												I didn't expect this to be any good at all.Then it turns out it's basically GTA, except you're a kid running around town in his underpants.Solid 7/10.(I also did an internet about it)

There are allot of fixes created in the community disscussion, but none of them really worked for me. I would love to try play this game once there is a confirmed fix, but for now this game is unplayable for me.			"

												It's definitely a fun game. Get to live the moments I missed in my own time in high school, like kissing all the girls XDThere's a vast array of missions you can do as well as running errands for some quick cash. It's a great open world game. Story so far seems pretty good too. I have had a few issues with the game however. There are some random lags I get as well as the mouse not working too well. Which can be annoying depending on the mission (ie aiming in first person, sometimes the mouse will jump past the target making me have to restart) as well as having experienced a never ending loop of the load screen and characters freezing during animations, forcing a game restart. The last 2 examples have only happened to me once each, so it seems to be a rare event, but thought I should mention it.With that said, if you save often, it's not a game breaking problem and I've really enjoyed this game.

												Bully is possibly one of my most favorite games, I first played it on PS2 back when I was only 3 to 4 years old. Scholarship Edition is the same game with better graphics. Of course Scholarship Edition is superior to the PS2 version, but suffers from crashes on newer PCs. I don't mind the crashes and I assume Rockstar or some other company will swoop in and fix the games problems when the new Bully comes out. So buy this and have some fun!			"

												This game worked okay for me on Windows 10 if I ran in compatibility mode (XP Service Pack 3) and as administrator, without display scaling. (Otherwise the display didn't fit my screen even with the correct resolution.) But using a keyboard and mouse, the controls make it really difficult to play. I couldn't get past the lockpicking tutorial because moving the mouse didn't really move the lock (it would randomly go in either direction no matter what I did). Since I'm stuck there at the beginning, I won't be playing farther. It sounds like a great game from other reviews so I'm pretty disappointed in the port.			"

I loved the music, the humour, the characters, the brilliant attention to detail and most of all... the replay value. I have re-played and completed this game over Twenty-Seven times! Twenty--Seven... when have you ever loved a game sooooo much you played it Twenty-Seven times to the end? The fact is this is the perfect game. Perfect setting, perfect characters and an insane amount of fun! This game will never leave my mind, and I'm STILL waiting for a sequel. RockStar surprise us. Bring us Bully 2 and make it good. It will be hard to recapture the beatuy that is Canis Canem Edit, but if anyone can do it.. its RockStar.			"

												Very good game, but it keeps crashing. Its a old school Rockstar game, so its a save-station you need to go to if you want to save, it doesnt auto-save... So its really annoying. I cant get passed the first mission. I recommend playing this game, but not when it crashes all the time.			"

												This is the greatest game of all time.This game is amazing and here is why I think it's the best game of all time, its wired this game it's made school fun i wish my school days where like this game this game as taken such a simple thing that everyone goes through made it amazing like with real school you may not know everyone but you know everyone's face in this game you never see the same child at once yes you see the same adults at once but that doesn't matter because you don't look at the adults, the classes are well designed you don't have to go to them but you get rewards for doing them there not hard but not easy the story is great with most games you're and adult but with this you not so with most games you kill 50 people but you can't kill the villain? But with this game you are a child so of corse you can't kill the villain (Garry), all of this missions are fun and interesting I found the writing funny so many stereotypes, all of the characters (even the non-story ones) are interesting and detailed, I was more excited for Christmas day in this game than I was in real life, yes you play Christmas day this game is so simple but was made so well the greatest memory from this game I have was when a kid told me his name and next day he asked me if I remembered and I ♥♥♥♥ing did I don't know what could beat that!

												From playing this on the xbox 360 many years ago, I can say this is one rockstars greatest masterpieces; but if you're looking to play this on windows 10 then don't bother. Due to a fault in the game, crashing is an inevitable occurance if you're using the windows 10 operating system so if you want to play it, go elsewhere.			"

												Pros:- Pretty much a soft-core version of GTA.- A lot of NPC's, each with different ( and funny ) dialogue.- Made by Rockstar.- Six different cliques, all unique, including Nerds, Jocks, Preppies, Bullies, Greasers, and Townies.- You can attend classes ( which are pretty fun minigames which you can unlock extra items from )- Instead of guns, you get makeshift weapons like fire-crackers, stink bombs, a slingshot, and even rotten eggs.- You can beat up old ladies.- Completely non-linear.- You can save people from the bullies, or even bully them yourself.- Instead of stealing cars, you can steal bikes, and scooters.Cons: - For a game made in 2008, the graphics don't seem that up-to-dateRating: 10/10Don't think, just buy this game! c:			"

												Surprisingly interesting, but not a surprise with a Rockstar game.  Makes you laugh at some of the silliness but also reminds you a LOT of high school.  Certainly deeper than I anticipated with a few very good laugh out loud moments. Almost something you might want to have your kids play to understand bullying more.

												GAME DOES NOT WORK.Absolutely appalling. I always wanted to play Bully. Too bad the game crashes while loading. Spent hours trying everything anyone has ever said to do. No dice. Windows XP emulation? Nope. Patches? Nope. Registry? Nope. Drivers? Nope. CPU affinity to 1? Nope.Windows 7 (NOT 10), 64-bit and still ""too new"" to run? Please.As a software developer, I have to say this is one of the crappiest ports I have ever seen. I can still run Thief 1: The Dark Project. I can run Trespassor and Outcast. Duke Nukem 3D still runs. But apparently a game Rockstar is still selling is too much to ask for to run on a system that came out in 2009. (Bully came out for PC in 2008.)Moral of the story? Even though Steam allows refunds now. You damn well better test the game before that period runs out. You can't simply ""trust"" Rockstar as a brand and come back after a few weeks and play your game. There are apparently hundreds of people burned by this if you search online... buyer beware, indeed.It's 2015 and Rockstar is still selling this game. There is no excuse for a AAA-company not running quality assurance. But that's the key... isn't it? An indie company can't afford to screw over people and still make money. If I wrote software that broke like this, I'd be out of a job.If you guys fix your game, I'll gladly edit this review.			"

Bully: Scholarship Edition is a beat'em up adventure game. New kid Jimmy Hopkins must make his place among the bullies, nerds and jocks of Bullworth Academy, making allies and enemies while pulling pranks and getting into fights.Pros: The game is large enough, beginning with the Academy, but opening more of the town as you play. There's plenty of missions to go through and characters to interact with. Pulls a lot of humor and setting from 1990s kids TV show stereotypes.Cons: This game is a bad PC port that plays awfully without a game pad. The graphics lost all their charms with age. The story isn't involving, having none of the sarcastic flair other Rockstar games such as the Grand Theft Auto franchise has, so there is little to no reason to revisit it once you've played through it.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itI take my nostalgia goggles off and look at it from a fresh perspective, and find little interest. I scratch my head wondering why I found it appealing some years ago, but will not be going back to Bully: Scholarship Edition again.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												I actually don't have a lot to say about this game. So I'll keep it brief.Pro's: Some aspects of the game are funny, the first one, or two, or ten times. After that, it's more than a bit tedius.Con's: You play your role as a spoiled little brat who needs to be stuck to a pike and rammed into the ground as a warning to the others.Basically, the game is really all about violence and the kiund you'd have at a school.  The controls sucked on it, as well.After an hour, I just couildn't kep going.			"

												I Can't even get pass the menu screen, I don't know if it is because of the operative system (Windows 8.1) but I can't make it run properly. Not even installing some Patchs from Rockstar Games webpage. Not even changing the use of RAM in the PC or the number of cores in use. I ran out of ideas. So, If you Know that certain games do not run in your operative system probably this wont run neither.			"

												Bully was an okay console game during the PS2 era, but the engine is showing its age in the extreme at this pont. I can forgive outdated graphics though, what I really have a problem with is the horrible control scheme. This game just does not play well on a keyboard/mouse combo at all, and even though there are some fairly sensible ways they could've made it more tolerable, it's just not there. Even on sale this felt like a waste of money and HD space.			"

												Nothing but crashes and very huge memory leaks. Just choosing story in the menu makes my RAM usage go from 20% to freaking 98% and then the game crashes, and the thing is that the RAM usage will remain at 96-98%, forcing me to restart the PC.It seems that some people don't have this problem, I think it's the OS, since it's Windows 8.1 and this game was probably optimized for Windows XP and Vista. Either way I couldn't find a fix.The game is very good but this port is just horrible.			"

												An ancient game with some fresh ideas on adventure genre.Somewhat silly (kiss someone to get more HP), it's fun actually. Should I say, was fun?1. No save anywhere outside of combat = phonedesigns where you don't have terabytes of free space2. Horrible controls that make driving a torment and not fun (not worse than GTA5 helicopter though)3. The game is crashing more than Fallout3 on it's release and you can't stop that by any means, with point #1 this makes you a masochist4. Rockstar doesn't care for PC and from consoles they switched to phones now.Do not make the same mistake I did. Do not buy this broken piece of s. There are better games from developers that care about PC.I couldn't bring myself to finish this, repeating something endlessly just because the game crashes like crazy is a slap to the face of any proper gamer.Uninstall.

												It's like GTA for Kids, you know. You are a 15 years old kid going to an academy, having fun by raging others, fullfiling tasks as well as playing a lot of missions. You are able to create fire crackers, stink bombs and you get a snifshot that is very nice to aim at other students or the personal. Kicking their♥♥♥♥♥only does not sound nice, it is, it's absolutely worth it.All in all: If you get bored, it's really awesome to play this game, you gotta have it, kicking other's♥♥♥♥♥ raging at others by using splingshot , firecrackers water balloons and a ""rocket launcher"" such as other stuff you can use. It makes a lot of fun and the weather is also changing from time to time.			"

												It's a fun open world game made by RockStar but clearly shows it's age in terms of gameplay. Basically your main character, James 'Jimmy' Hopkins, is your standard errand boy. Go here, do what someone told him to do, rinse and repeat. It's an okay gameplay mechanic back then but is dated by today's standards. One thing I really dislike about this game is the rewards for completing missions, which is money. Normally it's fine to get money as a reward but in this game, there's almost nothing you can or want to buy. Money is useless.All in all, for a 10 hour game, this is a must buy for open world fans. If it's too expensive, then wait for a sale. I got mine at about $9.			"

You can beat up bullys or be a bully and beat up the nerds. Sneeking about getting into trouble and hanging out with your mates is fun. You can unlock equiptment like a slingshot, skateboard, fartbombs and much more. you can help nerds get back there things by beating up the ""populare"" kids who are bullying them. Explore this game and trust me it gets better as you go...			"

												Good game for console, but♥♥♥♥♥♥PC port.Pros: 1. Pretty good story.2. Decent fighting.3. Good character development.4. Many ""adult"" jokes.5. Quite a bit of things to do.6. Classes are quite fun sometimes.aaaaannnddd thats where the Pros end.Cons:1. TERRIBLE PC port.2. Game crashes every 2-10 minutes.3. Nothing i've tried fixes these crashes.4. Game is unplayable with these crashes.5. Game caps at 30 fps unless you download another exe which im not sure is reliable or not.6. Games story becomes mundane after a while as many missions are the same, (example is missions where you literally beat people up)7. Repetitive boss fight concepts.8. Boss fights are WAY TOO EASY.9. Overpriced for a game that's barely functionable and is this old.10. Buggy AI that sometimes glitch and bug out, causing you to have to restart some missions.11. The game really makes you hate almost all the social classes in the game, atleast in my experience.Overall, I don't recommend buying this game at full price, but I instead recommend people who want to give it a try to wait for a sale.

												An enjoyable and great take on the GTA open world concept with a much less menacing and zero bloody content. I'd recommend it but with reservations.*minor spoiler*The game sees the protaganist rise his way up the school hierachy. Throughout the story, the game will involve performing acts of violence, coercion, pranks, harassment, vandalism, voyeurism, defying authority (with or without good reason), and other questionable acts to reach the goal of getting to the top of the school hierachy. Though most of  the acts ingame are justified as befitting of the crapsack world setting, I'm not so sure students who are in a maturing phase should be stimulated with such content.I played this game on the PS2 when I was 17, it was mostly a silly game to me back then, but now as an adult; having revisted this game recently, I'd definitely have reservations for letting 13 year old students play this.

												To begin with, I'd say this game is a cracker. Doesn't have the best of graphics considering it was released yonks ago, but the gameplay is unique. It's a GTA-esque game which is 'built' around a school where you bully people and help a few as well. All and all, a good game for time-pass and hey, it's on sale, get it if you wanna revisit ""Old-School GTA"".			"

I quite literally cannot play the game for 5 minutes without having it crash and several other people are having the same problem. I have tried absolutely everything to get this game to work but I refuse to delete it because the time that I have spent playing this game was already well worth the $3.75 I spent on it. I hope the game works for whomever is reading this review... it is such a fun game! Regardless of the crashing issue that has left me unable to play... I still recommend this stupid game.

If it would have at least played halfway decent (for its age I expected uglish graphics, which is not the issue here), I may have been able to actually play it. But no, characters running around at super speed, audio is all over the place (hearing conversations a mile away, and everything at 100% volume), and controls are the most ridiculous inflexible setup. Very unplayable trash.Oh well! If I could 'delete' games from my library, this would be the first one haha.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I love Bully and completed it three times...on the Wii. However I keep running into problems on the PC version that make me want to stop playing it. Every now and again the game would randomly freeze, I have had a few times where failing a mission brings you to the loading screen and stays there forever, and there are problems with the voicing sometimes where people sound like Steven Hawking. In short i wouldn't buy it on PC.This port has to many problems in short.			"

*Tips fedora*This is a great game that allows me to relive my glory days, a portrayal of schools in America, before America became land of the cuckolds and social justice warriors (or more commonly known as the footmen of George Soros, for those who are not of plebeian upbringing).Back when it didn't matter where you were from, what your race was, or how you expressed your gender identity. Back when you could outright assault somebody, and not have someone cry about how you need to respect their gender pronouns, and how they now have PTSD because of your cyber violence against them.This is a great game, it brings back memories of a better time.

												Parents need to know that this game is an expansion of the original 2006 Bully game offered on newer platforms, and that it depicts antisocial behavior and violence within a school environment. At its heart it is a simulation about bullying behavior in a school setting and therefore -- given the sad state of school violence -- a hot-button topic for parents. There is plenty of psychological mischief and physical violence, including fistfighting, kicking, humiliating taunts and insults. Weapons include a slingshot, firecracker launcher, baseball bat, garbage can lid, and fire extinguisher, but there are no guns or bombs, nor is there any gore, serious injuries, or deaths. The Wii edition makes use of the console's motion sensitive controls to punch, but doesn't make players engage in the physical act of punching. The game contains some sexual remarks, sexual pranks (stealing girls' underwear and sneaking into a bathroom to try to get a photo of a girl in the shower (all you see is steam), and alcohol references. And depending on the path taken, the main character, Jimmy Hopkins, can kiss another boy. Pranks include pushing kids into toilets, tossing stinkbombs, firecrackers, and itching powder at pedestrians, and throwing marbles on the ground for others to trip over. The game does include consequences for misdeeds. The game performed better than expected on PC. I played on the original version on PS2. I higly reccomend playing this game; however, I would highly reccommend playing with a controller! 5 out of 5 Stars			"

												I've had hundreds of hours of this game on my old playstation, so don't be decieved by my game time.I have always loved this game and for many reasons. One of my favorite things to do was stuff people in lockers or hit children and girls just to get into BIG trouble. I loved the storyline and the ending was great. I think that the only thing wrong with this game is that there will probably never be a sequel, which shatters my heart. If you hate highschool, you will love this game. If you love highschool, you will love this game. If you never went to highschool for some reason, you will love this game. The game's so old, yet it runs beatifully on my modern computer. I reccomend this game to anyone looking for a story rich, free roam, high school simulator, nostalgic (even if you haven't played the game before), butt kicking time. If you haven't bought this game WAAAAY back then, and you were a gamer WAAAAAY back then, then i'm honestally dissapointed in you for existing.TL;DR?10/10, A masterpiece- no, a symbol for classics everywhere, or one might say that it's ""the game that describes what a classic game is"", or as Jimmy Hopkins would say, ""Fun for the whole family, OF ME!""

Pretty fun, jokes on the other hand is really cringe.The only annoying part is the game that often keep crashing and stopped working.There's no auto save feature and you need to keep running to a save point to save your data or else you will loose every previous game play. Game is a little buggy as well, random drops often couldn't be looted.All these little failed features has accumulated and it is slowly eating out my interest in continuation to play.			"

I bought it again later on down the line for my xbox360 when scholarship edition dropped. Now that I have a decent gaming PC, this HAD to go on my ""to buy"" list. So many memories and all of them entirely relivable at any time. This game is fun, silly, crazy, and immersive all at once. Graphics are a little dated, but if you can get past it then you're fine. :D			"

												$2.99?! Awesome deal and bought it! Here's what I think:Keep in mind... I love Rockstar games. Bully has a nice gameplay, world design, and great voice actors. I don't even have an hour into the game and already I'm getting frustrated playing it. First off... the controls. I don't feel comfortable with how the key bindings are. Change them? I tried and that changes a lot more than it says. One key binding has like 3 uses for it and doesn't even mention them. I've tried DS3 but unfortunately, it wasn't connecting. Secondly... the frames aren't that great. If you're really expecting good frames from this game, then lower your expectations. I'd say 30 fps MAX. I get framerate from a beginning cutscene. Third... 40 minutes into the game and it crashes. Once I found out that there's no autosave, I gave up, flipped the table, and wrote this. If you REALLY want a game with better frames that is open-world as well, spend just a little bit more on other games. I honestly don't recommend this game BUT if you really want to try out Bully... be my guest, since it is $2.99 for now.			"

												Side note: I owned the PS2 version and the Xbox 360 Version, 100% both of them.Bully is one of R*'s crowning achievements. Memorable characters, locations and missions. I can say with great certainty that it is one of my favorite games of R*'s. If I could I would recommend this game a thousand times over.Now, for the sad part and why I can't recommend it to you. The PC version is a mess. Running on my 760, the game flashes black screens and stutters. Running on my i5's intergrated graphics, it's flawless. The keyboard support is a mess but I have X360 controllers on hand so that doesn't bother me but for those without that could be a deal breaker.So, You've been warned. One of R*'s greatest games is a horrible mess on PC. Do you have an older laptop that might be bad enough to run the game? Buy it in a heartbeat. If you have anything halfway decent, I'd be worried.			"

												Loved the game on xbox but this port is just lazy and extremely badly done. Sound is awful compared to the old console versions and dont even try to play this without a controller. Get the console version secondhand somewhere and play that instead.			"

												I'm sorry to have to give this game a negative review because there a lots of positive things about it and only a small number of negative.  But one negative is a game breaker.    Bully is set in a residential school where your character is dumped by his mother and his new stepfather at the start of term.  For all the furore of the game's title the game is part of a mileu of childhood fiction - aspects of the ""Just William"" stories, ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"", ""Dennis and Gnasher"" ""The Bash Street Kids"" and ""Mean Girls"".    Although violence is epidemic and endemic in the school - GBH with baseball bats being regarded as ""character forming"" by the headmaster there's no need for your character to be a sadistic bully.  Indeed the game system, particularly at the start, favours running away from most fights and most of the missions involve helping people and pranks rather than outright sadism.    The school day breaks down into lessons (two a day) and free time where you can do various missions and favours.  Getting to class is always stressful because the game never tells you where your class is until it starts involving a mad dash to avoid hall monitors and staff to avoid truanting.  The classes themselves are mini games ranging from the very simple (music just requiring you to hit left or right trigger in reponse to the screen), to tricky (the word puzzles in English need pretty high skills), to very tricky (Biology needs you to be fast and accurate with your controls), to extremely difficult (the workshop's control tests are murderously difficult).  By the way DON'T get the game if you haven't got an X-Box for PC controller.  If you don't pass a class you keep on retaking it.   The outside class missions involve object finding, fighting, stealth and obstacle navigation.  Often you will find yourself having to run away from bullies and staff.  A skateboard may seem the better option to get away but the game has a nasty habit of flicking your perspective near objects like walls leaving you confused and trapped.  Inventory controls are clumsy with rearranging your inventory being difficult and no way to store the equipment (stink bombs, marbles, a catapult etc.) off yourperson.  Also the game bizarrely sees to lack a ""Start from beginning"" option so there's no way to erase a bad day without going to a previous save.   Your character sleeps but doesn't eat (a relief after the first canteen mission).    Overall the game is good fun.  The school characters and charicatures are well drawn with the language making the game unsuitable for younger, more impressionable gamers.  Also once you enter the second chaper the game world expands dramatically.  The game bumbles along whether you succeed in class or fail, succeed in missions or fail.    You can buy new items and clothing but other than mission specific items there's no indication whether these items affect gameplay at all.    Why the negative review then ?   The game crashes.  Rockstar has been aware or ought to have been aware of the problem for at least a year but the game still crashes.  There's no autosave function so since time is always ticking and is a significant limitation in the game you don't ten to go back to your bedroom (where the save ledger is) until the end of each day.  So if the game crashes late in an evening you could find yourself having to repeat two lessons and two missions you'd already completed.  On average having adjusted my setting I get about 90 minutes of play between crashes - which can then involve losing an hour of gameplay.   This would have been a strongly (but not overwhemingly) positive review without this flaw but with it the game is so annoying as to actively put you off playing.  Which is a shame because Bully is probably a better game than the first three GTAs at least.S.x.			"

												A butchered port of the Console version, This is one of the few rare examples of a console game being better on the console than the PC. The keyboard and mouse controls are cumbersome to say the least, if i didn't have to slide my mouse across my mouse pad several times to inch the camera up to aim at something i was asked to shoot or take a picture of I'd be fine but this only begins my many gripes about this port of the game. The graphics have this weird glow about them, no matter how low you bring down the brightness its still there along with this awkward foggyness that looks like a cheap cover up for draw distance on a ps1. Along with the fact that the textures sometimes flicker and shake awkwardly. Randomly cutscenes will not play after key moments in the game are complete, The controls make many of the missions much more difficult to complete than they would if I just used a controller, Seriously use a 360 controller if you're going to play this game properly, or just buy the 360 version. I feel as though rockstar had no time to put forth the effort to make this game work for PC's in the first place. The graphics look incredibly dated even more so to the fact that this is basically an HD remake of the ps2 version. I really love the console version of this game and have sunken many hours into it on the 360, I can happily say I'm glad i only purchased this version for about 5 dollars on a sale because the frustrating controls and poor graphics make it not worth more than a few dollars. This game by it self is so excellent it tells a great and interesting story with alot of great jokes that come along with it but it being on a PC ruins it completely. The Options feature standard console graphical options and that is all, no chance at turning down this weird glow effect the game has. This version of the game is not worth buying get the console version if you actually want to enjoy it.			"

												“Bully: Scholarship Edition” takes a refreshing turn in the modern shooting and killing genre, by having a quirky and childish game that takes place in a UK boarding school. The game begins with his mother and his step-dad dropping the protagonist (Jimmy) off at one of the toughest boarding schools in the nation. They proceed to laugh at Jimmy as they voice their plan to go have fun off at their honeymoon. Ironically, this is an accurate allusion to Jimmy’s future because there is very little fun to be had in the school and consequently this game. In a game where it simply falls in both humor and gameplay, there are very few positive things that I can say about “Bully: Scholarship Edition” other than the fact that it is a bit innovative. I want to begin first by dissuading the illusion that this game is for children. With the amount of sexual implications, cultural references, drug use, and so on, the audience is likely to be people who have had the experience or are undergoing the experience of secondary schooling (high school). I wanted to establish this early on so that when I talk about things that are a little bit more complex, the idea that this game is for children is no longer an argument. The gameplay is refreshingly lacking of guns, but has a strong centralization on hand-to-hand combat. I found it funny that the lessons learned in classes translated into violence used on campus. Unfortunately the player is discouraged from using violence, as you will get caught by the prefects and punished. It is simply easier to just let anyone bothering you get caught by prefects rather than acting in self-defense. Outside combat, the diverse gameplay is very tedious. The classes are all very basic mini-games (most of them QTE) that, if done successfully, gives some sort of reward. Talking about rewards there are three kinds, money, clothing, skill-ups. While skill-ups are small benefits for your character, money and clothing are nearly worthless. A large portion of money goes into aesthetics and clothing is nearly entirely aesthetics, but having different clothing than your uniform gets you in trouble by the prefects which nulls their usability. This is confusing because Jimmy likes money; he will do anything for money but the game fails to acknowledge its purpose. Furthermore  SPOILER ALERT  at the end of chapter one, Jimmy says to the leader of the bullies (Russel) that the bullies should stop bullying the weak (nerds) but rather to fight those who deserve it. Russel acknowledges this, but there is no change on campus, bullies are still bullying the nerds. The players see no change or benefit due to their actions, making the entire ordeal and arc meaningless. Furthermore, the plot becomes meaningless as ""Jimmy's rise to power"" when he voices that he doesn't want power. SPOILERS END The gameplay while diverse, is simply monotonous. Most of the gameplay is not a challenge, and are lengthy in duration: a bad combination. For example, to get accepted into the nerd base, you need to beat their score at a 2d plane scroller, similar to snake. The mini game was simple, you play as a sumo that collects food and avoids hazards and everything moves linearly. As you collect the food, you get more points, but it doesn’t increase in difficulty or challenge. The sumo doesn’t get bigger or slower, nor does the game spawn more hazards; you just play repetitively until you want to. This example is similar to a lot of the gameplay in “Bully: Scholarship Edition”, a test of endurance for the monotonous and repetitiveness.      The game features an extreme stereotype of each of the cliques in secondary schooling, with nerds, jocks, prefects and so on. However the humor of each of the clique falls flat when the extremism is never moderated. The humor is not subtle, all the characters are just screaming with obnoxious stereotypes that just become jumbled and contrasted but never emphasized. Furthermore the dialogue lines are not diverse, meaning that you will hear the same lines over and over. For example, I was running the same way as a prefect character who muttered “I want a hotdog” over and over. This isn’t humor, this is abhorrent. The players simply cannot engage with the characters or plot if they are all simply flat stereotypes. Finally, the worst thing about this game is the audio. Like I stated earlier, it is very irksome to hear the same lines being repeated over and over. However, on top of that there seems to be no depth of hearing. There is the same volume for a speaker talking next to me as there is for a fight going on half the campus away. Thus imagine walking around campus, and hearing a cacophony of dialogue, each difficult to distinguish, on top of the other in-game sounds. One cut scene was next to the ocean, and the ocean sounds washed over all the dialogue that happened in that scene. The next bit was a bike race in where there was a disembodied voice that shouted “EXTREME” over and over until the race ended. With all these in mind, and I pray my mind is still sane, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Imagine you took all the Americana Juvinalia films (the Sandlot, Meatballs, Revenge of the Nerds, Porky's, A Christmas Story, etc), blended them into a fine paste and made a video game from it. That would be what Bully is.I wish I could recommend it. I wish I could say its better because it's unique and can be a lot of fun, but it does get a bit stale by the middle of the game.Gameplay wise, the missions are what you would guess. You egg houses, raid panties, french girls and all the stuff you'd expect from something of this genre. You learn different melee moves and you get ranged weapons, both of which are useful in many cases. There is a bit of variety in missions, but some of the missions are the same as in previous chapters, just with a difference of location and enemy.Also, something really, really annoying: Sometimes if you fail a mission you will not get the chance to do it until the next day. I know the game has to punish you for failing, but I would have preferred to just restart the mission.The story kind of wore on me after a while. I didn't really get attached to any of the characters because they wheeled them around like I was riding a rollercoaster past everyone in the school. I wasn't too thrilled that I had to go through all the factions pretty much doing the same types of missions in order to boost my reputation with them. There was a bit of predictability. I didn't really laugh as much as I would have expected from a comedy game. Though, the ending did get me super psyched and that made up for a lot of confusion during the middle of the game. It feels like you lose the purpose of the game near the middle.The open world seems small at first glance, but it is designed excellently. There's a lot of nooks and crannies to get lost in. There's a few collectibles, but not the obscene amount that you see in most open world games.The music is quite unique as well. The soundtrack is usually dominated by bass guitar with xylophone paired with celeste, which gives it a feel all its own. The problem is that some of the tracks aren't looped well and you'll be listening to 10 second clips stop then start again. Also, in regards to the sound design, some of the dialogue, which is excellent, is drowned out by the sound effects and you'll frequently find yourself straining to listen.I did run into one bug that caused the game to get stuck in a cutscene. I had to reload from an earlier point and that sucked.I really want to recommend this game, but it has its share of problems. If you're looking for something different this isn't a terrible choice, but bear in mind that this game has a LOT of annoying issues.			"

Revel in the overly simplistic gameplay while taking quests out of order because they appear when they shouldn't. Laugh as your frustration builds when you try in vain to shove kids into lockers and trash cans. Enjoy reading the FIVE MINUTES OF UNSTOPPABLE CREDITS because the kids at RockStar are a bunch of narcissistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who DEMAND that you read their names whether you want to or not. Be thrilled in reaching the final chapter after being submitted to the forementioned seemingly endless credits, where you're told you can ""finish the tasks you missed""... except for you know, quests that disappear because you've moved past them without knowing that the quest you did take would finish the chapter. Sigh in relief when you press the ""uninstall"" button.Shame... a good story in an absolutely horrible vehicle. You'll save yourself money and a lot of frustration and get nearly the same gameplay experience watching a Let's Play series on YouTube. NOT Recommended at all. I will never buy another RockStar CutScene Collection.			"

												Bully is incredibly boring and prone to crashes.Pros:+ Huge variety of outfits and accessories that allow you to customize the look of your character.+ Interesting concept.Cons:- Even after you jump through hoops to get the game running, expect crashes.  - Limited freedom.  At 5 hours in, the game was starting to give more quests, but everything feels restricted.  - Most of the minigames for classes (which you attend to unlock stuff) are boring and frustrating.- There is no set schedule for classes and you can't choose which one(s) you want to attend on a given day.  - Some costumes (like red ninja) draw ridiculous aggro and in practice aren't fun to use even if they are cool.- Guards are everywhere, which makes it hard to get away with ANYTHING.  Again, I expected more freedom.- It took me around 5 hours to beat chapter 1, and that is what it takes to unlock a new area.  Content gets stale.			"

												I originally recommended this game despite the fact that it's buggy. But after playing for a few more hours, I'm afraid the bugs are simply unbearable. I've reached a point in at least 3 missions so far where a non-player character is supposed to do something in order for the mission to continue, and they just stand there doing nothing, or get stuck running into a wall. On another mission we all seemed to fall through the ground into nothingness! The bugs are simply making it too hard to progress, and as a result I'm not enjoying the game at all.Then there are the minor bugs that don't stop you from progressing, but are extremely annoying, The sournd is the worst of these; the footsteps of non-player characters in the vacinity are louder than everything else. The result is a thousand footsstep sounds going off, louder than the music or dialogue. It's driving me crazy/Don't have enough space here to describe all the bugs I've run into. There are simply too many. I can't stick this any more, so I'm deleting the game before it's complete. Waste of money, I'm afraid.			"

												Where to start, to begin with if you have windows 7 your going to have a VERY bad time with this game. I bought it back during one of the steam sales but later regretted it as it's kind of broken oh the starting movie plays but when you get to the school you soon realize the problems first the slow loading of textures even going inside the school the inside would not load up then the dreaded loading screen of death after talking to the principal the first time, I tried everything setting compatability to windows xp even installing some files that were not in the files (rockstar really? you should have had all the files in the game already!) It's sad it really is because I wanted to try this game I wanted to experience what I couldn't but I can't, but if your willing to bother getting all the files and manually putting them in then maybe you'll be luckier then me but until then I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

												With graphics and gameplay taking you back to the PS2 era, Bully follows a young troublemaker lad into the horrors of a prep school, full of high school stereo types and awkward moments. Sadly as much as I wanted to be interested by this game, it just wasn't meant to be. I struggled to stay interested and the controls were a bit wonky at times. The whole concept, while cool, just isn't executed as well as I expected.			"

												I will admit that I came to the party pretty late with this one. This game is using a modified version of the game engine that powered GTA: San Andreas but that's a good thing. However, the game is now starting to show its age, even with the updated visuals. It's a shame that I didn't play this before GTA V as the age of the game is very apparent if you play this after GTA V. But.....it IS still a good game, not as good as it would have been a few years ago but still worth your time. The main story is rather short considering that it was made by Rockstar, but with all the side missions chucked in you're looking to a good 20-30 hours of gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes GTA or anyone that likes the idea of being the toughest SOB in the whole school! 8/10.			"

												I spent a fair amount of time playing this game before I made a decision on whether or not I liked this game. Unfortunately I don't like.I always had an interest in this game all the way back when it was first announced years ago but never picked it up. Until recently.What good things can I say about this game. It has the usual Rockstar Style. Open world, tons of missions and a good variety, collectibles, side missions, tons of them. This game also allowed me to do things that I haven't been able to do in my own life. Such as have friends throughout my school life and go on dates with girls. There is also a fairground where you can win tickets and exchange them for prizes. The game is full of content, the game is also well written as you'd expect from a Rockstar game.Unfortunately all of that content doesn't really mean anything if the rest of the game is terrible. When I started playing this game and I looked at all the textures and models I honestly thought that this game was made shortly after GTA3 however it turns out that it was made after GTA:SA. Whilst the textures and models have never really looked great in Rockstar's games I did expect better. Another issue with this game is the absolutely nightmarish controls, such as alt to run, shift to punch and tab to view the map, the combination of these buttons often resulted in me minimizing the game accidentally.There is a reputation system in this game that allows you to pick who your friends and enemies are, however the story missions make you hop from one group of people to the next essentially infuriating them all by the end.This pretty much makes the rep system null and void. The prefects which have taken the role as the police in this game as they seem to have power not just in the school but in the nearby town as well, apparently the prefects own the entire town 'Tommy Vercetti' style.I didn't find the game all that interesting but it seemed to last far too long for me.If you like Rockstar you might be able to put up with this game but I couldn't.

												A fantastic idea for a game brought down by countless flaws. The reliance on QTEs and rigid timers makes the classes and scheduling of activities feel like chores after the first couple times, the frustrating save system and poor stealth mechanics make missions and retries quite tedious, and the game overstays it's welcome. There just aren't enough good gameplay ideas to fill out 50+ missions. It's hard not to spend the entire time playing the game wishing for a sequel filled with obvious improvements.			"

												If you expect this game to be a GTA game in a high school, you might be disappointed. The map is much smaller, things to do is much less, and those class minigames are boring. Well, I'd like to admit that those are not the issue bothering me, the real issue with this game is that, the story is just...bad, it is nothing to be said specifically about the story, it is just plainly bad from start to the end, even much worse than the story of GTA3. That to be said, this game can still be enjoyable if you really loves Rockstar games. Count me out, though.			"

												They should have called this Bully: Broken Port Edition.My journey to get Bully: Broken Port Edition to run was an a very frustrating one. When I saw that the splash loading screen before the intro video was going nowhere fast, I did the usual when problems like this arise; Set compatibility mode to windows XP, checked ""Run this program as Administrator"", and tried to start it again. Same splash screen lock up. Disabled desktop composition, and was excited when the intro videos now played; but then nearly swore frustratedly at my PC monitor once it then promptly crashed not half a second after the logo videos finished. I then googled a solution; hoping that I would find some user made fix, and it brought me to this thread http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=786851 which was of no help in the slightest as I already did everything suggested. I then looked to the steam community hub, and anyone who has had similar issues was met with replies along the lines of ""Must be something wrong with your PC, works great on mine! I guess you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck."" Well, that's fantastic that you got this game to work on your PC, but my game is still ♥♥♥♥ing broken, so you're not helping. There are also rumors of game breaking bugs and a 30fps cap in the PC port from those who have miraculously somehow been able to get past the first loading screen, so it probably wasn't worth the trouble anyway.If you really want to play Bully, do it by other means. Play it on console or some♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Continuing Rockstar's tradition of not bothering to properly port games to the PC, we get Bully.  Honest to god, there are portions of this game that require you to hit the square button or the triangle button or whatever.  I'm playing on a god damn keyboard here.  I don't have a triangle button.  They couldn't bother to properly port this game over to PC.  It's basically unplayable on the PC unless you're really good at remember what symbols correspond to what letters on your keyboard.  It gets confusing because a lot of the minigames require fast button presses.  Other than this MASSIVE problem, the game looked okay.  I really don't know.  It also lagged like nobody's business.  Get it together, Rockstar.  There are still people who play games on the PC.Pwninator Score: 2/10			"

												Not nearly as good as I thought it would be. It looked like ""Grand Theft Auto at a boarding school."" And that's more or less what it is. I played it for a couple hours, and it just never grabbed me. The idea is really cool, and the story's not bad. The gameplay is solid, and it's fun. I dunno. I just never latched on.The problem is I expected it to be a little less GTA and a little more Harry Potter. In reality, it essentially is GTA without cars. I was hoping RockStar would do something a little different, but they really didn't. I'm pretty sure they actually used the GTA engine to build this game.Which is fine; it just doesn't really make the game very compelling, what with the swarm of GTA games that I'd been playing back when I picked this up. And now that style of game is becoming as ubiquitous as Diablo clones. Saints Row now has a third sequel, and is pretty much no different than GTA.At any rate. Bully is not a bad game, it's just too much like Grand Theft Auto to be interesting if you've already play Grand Theft Auto.			"

The controls are difficult to use, the camera angles make it difficult to get around anywhere. I saw the low score, and thought it still looked cool while it was on sale... even at $1.00, it would be over-priced. The mini-games are kind of lame- and it's not really anything like GTA. I'm going to finish playing it now- now that I've already paid for it- but in hindsight....Just save yourself the frustration, the graphics are bad, the missions/quests are bad, the characters are lame and shallow, and the plot just makes absolutely no cheesy sense.

												It would seem that I spent 90 mins playing this game and didn't get much enjoyment out of it. It seemed like the game could have been fun, but the poor controls and UI mission system really made me feel annoyed the whole time I played it.The missions they ""force"" you to do are strange/lame and ""out of character"" things. Example: Help some nerd use the restroom, it is a forced mission. If you fail because you do not know the entire map layout or because the mission UI navigation is lame....  You must keep trying the same lame mission: only next time you try it, it will have Teacher Aids chasing you because it is night time or during class hours causing you to fail and do it again -People randomly fight you, feels like Jimmy is  tank, ect:I am certain that it is just me and that nothing is wrong with this game but I honestly tried for almost an hour and a half to play this game but between the controls, forced missions, and poor UI.... I just couldn't take it. Perhaps another day.			"

												If you're not interested in a game that presents sexist, racist, and weightist views, you should avoid this game. 25 minutes into the game it is already quite clear that it is full of nothing but harmful stereotypes, no doubt another example of Rockstar's famous “satire.” Whatever the intention of these depictions, they are still presenting negative views of people. I'm writing this for the socially conscious gamer who does not find it fun to be immersed in a world populated by the most vulgar and hateful stereotypes humanity has to offer. If you can find enjoyment in this game, good for you. It doesn't matter to me if people like this game or not, and I'm not trying to attack or put down people who do. I'm only interested in saving people the money and time if this is not the kind of game they would be interested in.Here's a breakdown of what the first 25 minutes have to offer:Sexism: every female character encountered was an extreme stereotype that presented a very negative view of women and their sexuality. It really came across as misogynistic. Weightism: The dialogue of fat NPCs while walking around the world was designed to make them appear unintelligent and reflected common harmful stereotypes. The first fat character the PC interacts with, a girl at the school, is given a deep, unfeminine voice and is crying because her chocolate was stolen.Racism: the only two black characters the PC interacted with were presented as enemies. This was just in the first 25 minutes, but it was not a promising start. Vulgarity: a minor annoyance, but definitely something be aware of: the NPCs walking around the world constantly shout out immature insults.I couldn't play longer than 25 minutes because I found the content too distasteful, however I can't imagine the game gets much better. The entire thing just had a very hateful and immature feel to it. I hope this was helpful, I know I would have liked to see a review covering these issues before I bought the game. On another note, If it wasn't for its socially regressive content it looked like it would have been a fun game, so if you can get past that you might like it.			"

												Cringey from beginning to end. The school, the 'manipulations', the pranks, the alpha-male boneheaded decisions, the prepubescent writing, the inconsistencies of characters, the unrelatability and lack of empathy for the protagonist... There's really nothing to like here. I was going to play this game as a kid on PS2, but never got to it, and finally did on PC, and I wish I had never heard of it. Rockstar would have been better off making a childish game about prison, because at least they could get more into the issues of sex, violence, and guns. The overall plot is poorly stitched together and makes no sense. Characters go from being livid over betrayal to gullibly innocent or humbly reclusive to recklessly ambitious in the same cutscene.This game in a nutshell: be a king of school by beating up everyone in the way (because that's all it'll ever take) and tonguekissing literally any and every girl available to you. I'm astonished you aren't shanked or shot by the end of the game.If you want to know about port issues: 1. There are no camera control options. And it sucks. You'll have the camera flip between 180 changes midfight causing you to miss all the time. 2. You can't access even audio options until you start the game and watch through the first cutscene. 3. All other options are super barebones. 4. 6 save slots. Because you know, memory card limitations. 5. It does crash, just rarely. But save often.			"

												This is an old bug riddled game, its not worth picking up, I've wasted my money on this trash.From crappy keybinds to game breaking bugs, I really recommend avoiding this title because well, I doubt Rockstar is going to update a game thats 5 years old now. When I talk about bugs, i'm talking about the combat system, its litterally horrible, it seems Jimmy can't pick up weapons without instantly dropping them, making it impossible to complete one of the missions where you have to pick up bricks and throw them at a thug that you happen to be chasing for sling shotting you.And of course, the keybinds, who on earth throught that shift was a good key for attacking and alt was perfect for sprinting? I mean seriously, its always been traditional with games for shift to be for sprinting and mouse buttons for attacking.Ontop of that is class room activities requiring you to have super accurate timing right down to the split second while padlock picking forces you to rotate your mouse in a way that just feels so uncomfortable its asking to give you a Repetitive strain injury.

												It's basically GTA as a grade schooler.  Missions open up as you complete more, but many are restricted to a certain time of the day.  That plus the slower modes of travel make the pacing a lot slower than other rockstar games and can feel like it's being dragged out.    The gameplay isn't very exciting, missions are short do one little thing then come back, and the customization/upgrading doesn't do much to enhance the experience.  The story is about a douchey little kid, fighting with other douchey little kids for control of a school ran by douchey people in a town full of douchey people which I found completely offputting.  The music, random npc dialogue, and cutscenes (if the game bugs out on you and you have to redo missions) get old quick.			"

												It's clear that Bully: Scholarship Edition is not my favorite game, but at the same time, I feel like you are missing out on a good experience if you have not played this game. The Scholarship Edition has added missions, NPCs, classes, and items to the game, however, in my opinion, they are not worth re-buying the game if you have already completed the older version on the Ps2. The graphics may not be the prettiest you’ve ever seen, and the controls surely aren’t going to be your favorite, but the pure amount of detail and time that went into this game shouldn’t be ignored or looked past. Upon release, this game was already at a disadvantage due to being released on the Ps2 after the newer generation had already started, and Xbox 360 games were on the rise. All that being said, I must admit, I do look forward to the hinted(1) sequel(2). Read my full official review here: http://nerdbacon.com/bully-scholarship-edition-pc/ "

												Bully is a game such as the GTA series. Only this time you play as a kid that has just started at a boarding school. Since it's in the gta universe, you know it's going to messed up, in a good way. The game mechanics work as GTA does. You can go to a bunch of different locations to trigger missions, you can run around and pick up weapons and items, attack anyone you see, and use some vehicles. Since you're a kid, you can't take any cars, but there are bikes, skate boards, and the likes of which. The main story has a good flow, and is exciting, and only actually counts for 50% of the game, yet it taking a good amount of time to finish. The game I think is set in the 70s and has a great soundtrack made to fit. All in all, it's a classic Rockstar game. Being one of the older games that came out on PS2 first, it has a little worse graphics than the norm, but if you give it a chance and play it for a while, you'll get used it.			"

It's probably one of the few titles that we'll ever see that tickles on the prospect of innocence (or lack thereof) of the American teenage youth. Or any teenage youth for that matter!A charming, comical story with laugh out loud cliche stereotypes (you have your jocks, your geeks, your preppies, etc.,) and a sense of reminesce that at some point in time, we were somebody at this school.Though the game is quite dated, again, I call it a classic because it's one of the few games I'd actually go back and play again (I originally played the hell out of this on the XBOX360!)

												I bought this a couple weeks back for the full price in order to relive the experience that I remember on my PS2. Not only is it the same great game, but it's been reworked on an entirely new and improved game engine, along with added classes and extra missions. Nostalgia with added gameplay features. In my personal opinion, The world of Bully is the most interactive and immerseful world Rockstar has created yet, so much so that I can almost consider it a simulation. Bully makes you feel like a student at Bullworth, and gives you the freedom to do whatever you will in this universe. If Bully is a title you have missed, or even if you have played the Canis Canem Edit a few years back, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a highly polished Rockstar title that is absolutely not to be passed up, especially if you're reading this and it's still -75% off.

												A game misunderstood as trying to sell violence to children. This game is about trying to fight violence among children -- first by fighting the bullies, then by fighting the rich jerks, and then by fighting the abusive jocks. The title can actually be thought of as ironic -- it has little or nothing to do with ""being"" a bully and everything to do with what you will do against other bullies.That all said in its defence, it's still a ""grand theft bicycle"" game if you ever want to get onto the wild side a little. But if anyone sees that as being the forest, they're really missing the trees.			"

												So it says I've barely played this game. That's true, I've barely played this game on my computer. I haven't experienced everything there is to the Scholarship Edition, but I can tell you that everything that was in the original game is ♥♥♥♥ing AMAZING. I played this game forever on my PS2, and I HIGHLY recommend playing this game WITH A GAME CONTROLLER, as the controls with the mouse are quite funky.			"

												Rockstar has taken a common high school nightmare for nerds such as yourself, fused it with GTA, and created a game where the pleasures of being a badass in school are available to everyone, regardless of their appearance, intelligence, or upper body strength. Bully is a fun game with a lot to offer. It has an enjoyable story, lots of funny moments, heaps of minigames, and a lot of missions to complete. If you're a fan of the GTA series, or even if you're not, this is a good game to pick up.			"

												Very similar to the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Coming from Rockstar this was not a shock to me. The mini games for school classes are a nice touch. Was much better once I plugged in an XBox 360 Controller. Some of the activities like lockpicking, shop class, and tagging required you to spin the mouse without a controller it was kinda cludgy.  Once again not a surprise for a Rockstar game.			"

												This is a fantastic game, it's like GTA: School Edition. You can follow the narrative missions which have good variety or simply explore the environment and collect collectables. It's a great laugh and also takes me back to the days of playing this on PS2!The only issues I had were sometimes I felt the controls were poor using keyboard and mouse, particularly in the Shop class, and once my character got stuck which required me to load from a save. However these were only very minor problems and on the whole the keyboard and mouse controls are decent.I would highly recommend this game and is a must buy if on sale!			"

Or any teenage youth for that matter!A charming, comical story with laugh out loud cliche stereotypes (you have your jocks, your geeks, your preppies, etc.,) and a sense of reminesce that at some point in time, we were somebody at this school.Though the game is quite dated, again, I call it a classic because it's one of the few games I'd actually go back and play again (I originally played the hell out of this on the XBOX360!)

												Bully is one of my all-time favorite games. I'm not even joking. There's so much stuff to do in this teenage version of GTA that can't be explained in just words. It honestly upsets me that they're not doing a sequel to Bully- it's one of the few games out nowadays that deserves it. That said, the controls are a bit clunky and hard to get used to, since it's converted from the console versions, but nevertheless is a great game to play.			"

												I bought this a couple weeks back for the full price in order to relive the experience that I remember on my PS2. Not only is it the same great game, but it's been reworked on an entirely new and improved game engine, along with added classes and extra missions. Nostalgia with added gameplay features. In my personal opinion, The world of Bully is the most interactive and immerseful world Rockstar has created yet, so much so that I can almost consider it a simulation. Bully makes you feel like a student at Bullworth, and gives you the freedom to do whatever you will in this universe. If Bully is a title you have missed, or even if you have played the Canis Canem Edit a few years back, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a highly polished Rockstar title that is absolutely not to be passed up, especially if you're reading this and it's still -75% off.

												A shining example of Rockstar's ability to tackle, what seem like at the time, impossibly politcally incorrect subjects.  This game was originally released in 2006 on the PS2, and during that time was one of the games that shaped me as a person. Bully follows the life of Jimmy Hopkins, a by no means perfect teen, through his life at Bullworth Academy. He comes from broken home, with a mother who by no means cares for him, and a multitude of stepfathers. When Jimmy is introduced into the school he quickly learns that those who cannot physically stand up for themselves are tormented relentlessly, and that it is not only tolerated, but encouraged by the school. Jimmy is by no means a bully himself, but tries to establish himself as a sort of bringer of justice in the school, by systematically humilating the kids who needlessly bully others. This game was far ahead of it's time, it expertly tackled subjects that no other developer would dare undertake at the time, and in my opinion withstands the 8 years of aging. While the story is a very interesting social commentary on things like broken homes, and bullying, as the name implies, it's gameplay did not withstand the test of time in the same way it's story did. The game is essentially unplayable without a controller, is a godawful port in almost every way, and has very simplistic fighting mechanics. The game is capped at 30FPS, and when uncapped will break certain missions. The fighting essentially entails kick, block, punch, and while the additions of things like the slingshot or marbles can make it slightly more enjoyable, it's still pretty repitive. Overall I'd say it's worth it for the story and, as any good Rockstar game contains, great social commentary alone. Although if you're very gameplay centered I'd say wait for a sale.			"

												I've wanted to play this game a while, but the performance, presentation and general graphical quality of this port leave much to be desired. My eyes physically hurt from looking at the (lack of) antialiasing, and there is no option to turn the graphics quality up - in fact, there are no graphics options beyond ""brightness"" and ""subtitles"". I normally don't get hung up on the graphical quality of games, but this... this looks and feels as if I'm playing a PC game from about thirteen or fourteen years ago, right down to the Star Wars: Dark Forces style blocky washed-out menus. That would be kind of acceptable on its own, but the game also runs terribly, chugging along at a paltry rate, and the controls are godawful. I think I might just get this on X-box, where it belongs.			"

												Despite Bully being originally a PS2 game and therefore it being riddled with glitches this is a really awesome Sandbox game. Basically it's GTA in a school setting and of course the crimes are a lot less severe. This game is tons of fun, the characters are lively and colourful and the stereotypical groups (Nerds, Preps, Greasers, Jocks, Townies, Prefects) are well defined as the main story has you, Jimmy Hopkins, deal with these groups and has you climb to the top of the school to eventually face your nemesis Gary Smith, a sociopathic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who causes trouble behind the scenes. The main story gives you a good variety of missions to do and you can also interact with others in a variety of ways in a very lively (and I do say; probably a bit exaggerated) school environment. One other thing to note is the fantastic soundtrack which helps set the scene very well.			"

The minigames are fun and exciting and there is always something to do.

												Awesome game! It doesn't get the credits it should deserve. I highly recommend it.Story is entertaining. You play the character of Jimmy Hopkins on his journey in Bullworth Academy. Attending classes, doing jobs and errands for people. Fighting of different gangs to earn their respect and eventually control them. Once you progress in the story line you unlock more of the town around the academy. It feels like GTA but on a smaller scale and without extensive violence. The game is loaded whit mini games and collectibles. Gameplay and pace are very well done by Rockstar.Graphics are somewhat outdated but still good enough to play. Sounds are very good. Different sets and styles depending on the setting. Controls can be a little tricky at first but shouldn’t be a problem once you get used to them.  "

All aspects of gameplay work as they should and if you play on PC you will get a jump up in graphics as compared to console versions.It has the Rock star flavour to this game and many say its a school based version of GTA which to be honest is not far off the truth.If you have ever wanted to relive your school days or play a smaller but more refined version of the GTA format without the cars then this is for you.Very close to perfect and game devs these days need to go back to basics to deliver this sort of simple yet highly enjopyable gameplay and concept.

												Everyone's talking about games like Saints Row and Watch_Dogs to be GTA clones, but you haven't seen a real GTA clone until you've played this, and yet it contains not a single car. Rockstar has made a brilliant and hilarious adaption of their flagship game.Yes, the PC controls are terrible, yes, the graphics are worse than an indie title, and yes, it is rather buggy, but I can live with all that in the exchange of this incredibly entertaining gameplay and a quite unique story. This game tries hard and succeedes surprisingly well.			"

												From the current Time of Day, Month, and Year that I posted this review, I had played the game 94.9 hours in total. I was obsessed with the game and still am. If you're wondering why, the game is so addicting by; Going to class, Kissing a lot of girls, Doing Missions, Bullying students, Harass stuents or anyone, Sexual harass any girl in the game you see, Doing labor work outside of BullWorth Academy, Going to the circus and play circus games, and so many other things. The stats in the game doesn't really leave out any details of what some people might wanna see and wants to tell their friends who also played this game or compare it with them. This game is very great and recommended to those who miss out their School days. When I was trying to buy this game, I was thinking really hard if it was going to be good or not. I didn't want to look at the reviews of what people put because there was probably going to be spoliers I don't want to see. So I took my chance and got the game definitley didn't regret on getting this game. One of the Best Games that takes to a different level in most of the games you'll probably played before 2008. The graphics and the audio is okay. There's certain parts of when it crashes. So, you'll have to save most of the time. This part is important though, If you wanted the multiplayer version, you'll have to get it for the console. The Computer/Steam Version doesn't have Multiplayer. If you're not sure that you want to buy this game, then you can talk to me about what your not sure about the game. Thanks for reading my review and have wonderful Morning/Evening/Afternoon/Night. :D			"

												Horrible and cruel, Bully is a devil's treat. As inventive as the GTA series, this game allows people to do the commit the kinds of nasty and spiteful things in life that wouldn't normally be tolerated. If you like the idea of getting your way by using force and humiliating others, Bully is for you. It's not a nice game in any sense of the word, but it will certainly appeal to the more ruthless and brazen of players. Not for the squeemish.			"

												Let's face it, this game is THE forgotten master piece by Rockstar. You don't have gore in this game, although I would not recommend it for kids, since it does include violence. You go to school as Jimmy Hopkins who has been known as a Bully and has been to several schools, by whom he has been kicked out. Now he is at a Boarding School in New England and whilst you can go to class and do a lot of fun minigames there, such as Music, Biology, Sports, etc.. (I am not kidding they are actually really fun!), you can also later on explore the town around the school and unlock several unique and funny save locations. Even when you complete the game, which has quite a lot of missions, there are still so many things you can do! You can either collect all the Rubber Bands, Trade Cards, or just do some Boxing and Races, win some prices at the carnival, or do whatever pleases you!I have an Xbox Wireless Controller, and it works great! Also the English Language is fully supported, even though Steam says otherwise. Even though some argue that this game was better on the Play Station, for me it is quite the same experience and if you play with a controller, you can really get into this game!Graphics: 9/10 - This Edition is basically the HD edition of the old games, which still has pretty good graphic even though it came out several years ago.Keyboard/Controller Support: 10/10 - I have had loads of fun playing with my controller, and keyboard/Mouse works also.Story: 9/10 - A very good story, which is sadly a bit predictable (taking over the school and stuff)Minigames: 10/10 - A lot of satisfying minigames, which you can engage several times and still have fun with!All in all: One of my favorite games of all time, which for me is even better than most of the GTA Franchise, and for this small price, it is also more than definitely it's money worth!PS: I am still hoping for a Sequel, Rockstar please make it happen!

												I do not reccommend you buy this game on Steam.  If you can find a physical copy, that one is a lot better.  The Steam version for me constantly crashes even on low settings.  Physical version however doesn't crash, and I can put the graphics to the highest quality.  Other than that, this game is great, its fun and very much like GTA in high school.  The only reason I thumbs down this game is the issue with the Steam version of the game.  If you want to buy it, buy it physically, it also may be a lot cheaper than buying it on Steam.			"

Graphics are a little dated, but they hold up well.  Sound / voices / soundtrack are pretty amazing.  Every NPC is a fantastic caricature representing every trope in the book, similar to the random people you see walking around in other Rockstar games such as Grand Theft Auto.  My biggest gripe is the controls, because they're pretty clunky.  The game was originally made for consoles and it shows.  It might be easier to play with a controller.			"

The graphics in the game weren't great for the time but adaquete, the gameplay was fun and fairly relaxed (take it at your own pace).  There were a couple of stealth missions but nothing too bad.  The scholarship edition replaced cut content and added a fair bit extra.  If you can get it at a decent price its well worth a play.  Rumours of a sequel abound.			"

												I've wanted to play this game a while, but the performance, presentation and general graphical quality of this port leave much to be desired. My eyes physically hurt from looking at the (lack of) antialiasing, and there is no option to turn the graphics quality up - in fact, there are no graphics options beyond ""brightness"" and ""subtitles"". I normally don't get hung up on the graphical quality of games, but this... this looks and feels as if I'm playing a PC game from about thirteen or fourteen years ago, right down to the Star Wars: Dark Forces style blocky washed-out menus. That would be kind of acceptable on its own, but the game also runs terribly, chugging along at a paltry rate, and the controls are godawful. I think I might just get this on X-box, where it belongs.			"

It's not beautiful in any way, but it's definitely not an eyesore (AA helps).The game itself is amazing. The gameplay, setting, and story are all incredible, and the soundtrack is so damn good you'd wonder why Shawn Lee doesn't do movie scores. A nice additon is that the soundtrack is sitting in your game files in case you want the music from the game. Not all the game music is there though, unfortunately.This is an amazing game, and don't miss out if it's on sale, even if it's enough of a steal at $15.			"

												If you've never played Bully before, or are just wanting to replay it, this is for you. If you're curious about the Scholarship Edition content, don't bother. The extra missions and classes aren't worth buying the game again if you already have it on a console. The vanilla game is rad, though, and the Scholarship Edition doesn't take away from that.			"

												Tremendously fun game, so close to being as good as my favorite Rockstar title GTA: San Andreas as to be practically tied for first place.  As a PC port it has issues - you won't want to play it without a controller for instance - but for a game that came out for the PS2 in 2006 this is a remarkable achievement.  A great setting, awesome comedy, plenty of variety in gameplay, locations and things to do, this game is a winner.			"

												A lot of people don't enjoy this game, but I for one love it. It packs everything I loved from the old Grand Theft Auto's into a middle school, along with so much more. The dialogue can be cringe-worthy at times, but the story is pretty decent, and with all of the cliques being extremely stereotypical there's a few laughs to be had through the durration of the game. Also, the soundtrack is amazing and you get it with the game, so buy away.Oh, and you might want to bring a controller. A nutless monkey could've made the keyboard controls better.			"

												Minor Theft Bicycle? Bully plays a lot like a tamer, school yard GTA, but I liked it. I had a lot fun playing through Bully. The missions were usually fun and somewhat varied and the humor was often solid. It's one of the the better GTA clones around.  It took a little over 20 hours to beat and I got about an 80% completion rate.  The graphics look really dated at this point as they are essentially last-last-gen now, but they are still functional. If you like the open-world sandbox game, give Bully a shot.			"

												Imagine your typical GTA game set in a school and you'll get Bully. Contrary to the name, this is not a game where you play the bully. The game begins after Jimmy Hopkins was unceremoniously dumped on the doorsteps of Bullworth academy, after having being expelled from seven other schools. As Jimmy, you'll be forced to fend yourself against the unsavory elements of the school... The scholarship edition offers more missions and classes compared to the console version. The geography class is especially helpful if you're interested in completing the game fully as it provides the location of collectibles. The only drawback with this port is that the controls while on bicycles are overly sensitive. This can, however, be circumvented by using a pc controller.			"

												Encompassing all the mythos that American high schools have been endowed by the media throughout the last century, Bully: Scholarship Edition serves as a reminder of other times where rivalries and pranks were taken on the physical plane rather than internet chat logs and micspams. For more practical information, this port was not perfect when it was first released but most issues have been fixed since then. This is an expanded version of the original release, with more variety of classes, characters, missions, and a revised storyline.			"

												Probably Rockstar's best game on the PC, it's the only one of their sandbox adventure game's I've completed.  You play as an adolescent teen trying to make his way through a year at a bording school.  The missions are varied and there are a ton of little touches that bring the game to life.  One really cool thing that's easy to miss is that every single student NPC is unique and will react to you based your path through the game.  Recommended only if you have a controller, because some of the challeneges are downright impossible on a keyboard.			"

												Bully proved to be an open-ended world with more depth than is first apparent.  While there are a few bugs and issues, the game has far more joyous mayhem as you slowly build and lose factions with groups.  Powering up health by snogging -- even in some cases being able to get gay kisses -- is very cool.  News has come out that Bully 2 may be in slow development, which would be great news.			"

												For GTA fans (III+ and above),  this game is worthy of your time.  It's less violent and bloody of course, but so sweet in it's own unique gameplay too.  I wasn't sure about it at first, but now I'm really happy I'm trying it out now.  It's way more in-depth with tons of stuff to do than I expected.  Your not just limited to some school either, you explore a whole damn city with tons of regions to unlock as your progress in the story to leave a pretty solid open sandbox world to explore!  Anyone who loved all the GTAs cannot pass on Bully.  Disregard what some people might say about the controls on the PC, they aren't difficult to pick up at all.			"

												Eh, as a game, it's very good at integrating mundane activities into the player experience. In terms of the whole gameplay experience, there were a few things that just made me lose interest fast, chiefly the inability to retry a mission after failing it. In most games, when you fail a mission, even if it's a side thing, you get a screen that pops up saying ""oh, you failed! Want to try again?"", but in this one you're booted right back to free roam. Often, the missions can only be found at specific times of day, forcing you to roam around doing stuff that you might have found fun before, but which suddenly becomes tiresome clutter as you claw your way back to a second crack at the mission. summary: don't buy as an in-between time wasting game. This one demands your attention, something I couldn't give it, but a person who likes GTA might jump right in.			"

												How could anyone dislike this game? I really hope Rockstar will think about making a Bully sequel, or something. This particular game gives a lot of attention to details. Which makes sense, since it's fueled by social interactions and fights. But still, outstanding details, which won't be all perceived by playing the storyline just once. Soundtrack is awesome, but I had a few sounds issues I couldn't wrap my head around. Also you can't turn off music completely even if the option is right there. Voice acting is really funny and well-made. Characters have an original sense of humor. Only the storyline is mostly too predictable and at times makes no sense. Just a few bugs, most of them pretty silly. Overall, 9/10.			"

												It's clear that Bully: Scholarship Edition is not my favorite game, but at the same time, I feel like you are missing out on a good experience if you have not played this game. The Scholarship Edition has added missions, NPCs, classes, and items to the game, however, in my opinion, they are not worth re-buying the game if you have already completed the older version on the Ps2. The graphics may not be the prettiest you’ve ever seen, and the controls surely aren’t going to be your favorite, but the pure amount of detail and time that went into this game shouldn’t be ignored or looked past. Upon release, this game was already at a disadvantage due to being released on the Ps2 after the newer generation had already started, and Xbox 360 games were on the rise. All that being said, I must admit, I do look forward to the hinted(1) sequel(2). Read my full official review here: http://nerdbacon.com/bully-scholarship-edition-pc/ "

												Despite Bully being originally a PS2 game and therefore it being riddled with glitches this is a really awesome Sandbox game. Basically it's GTA in a school setting and of course the crimes are a lot less severe. This game is tons of fun, the characters are lively and colourful and the stereotypical groups (Nerds, Preps, Greasers, Jocks, Townies, Prefects) are well defined as the main story has you, Jimmy Hopkins, deal with these groups and has you climb to the top of the school to eventually face your nemesis Gary Smith, a sociopathic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who causes trouble behind the scenes. The main story gives you a good variety of missions to do and you can also interact with others in a variety of ways in a very lively (and I do say; probably a bit exaggerated) school environment. One other thing to note is the fantastic soundtrack which helps set the scene very well.			"

												Like GTA, but in high school and with a lot more hand to hand combat.In other worlds, sandbox world with a lot of stuff to do, collect or beat up.You get ""toys"" that in no way resemble actual guns and weapons to use to your leisure.Mini-games, QTEs galore.Story: you are a strong kid, that does what others tell him, but are still blamed because you did what you ware told to do.You can be a bully, but it basically all boils down to a lot of misunderstandings, that will make people attack you and give you a reason to beat them all up, until you atchive peace.Good game, a lot of side content, GTA in heart.

												I absolutely love this game, despite of me playing it as a child on the PlayStation 2 (nostalgia) it's like Grand Theft Auto, but you're in a school and you can't kill someone.Instead of lethal weapons, you get a Slingshot, some firecrackers, stink bomb and more. You can give someone a wedgie, which is hilarious, and you can mess with the nerds and even the douchey jocks that always tries to mess with you with no reason. You get to attend classes, such as Music, English, Art, Physical education, etc. Just like any normal school would have.There is a curfew at night which means you have to get to your dorm before it gets dark. You can make out with a girl and get them to make out with you which is pretty useless but I guess if you don't know what porn is, then this might be satisfying for you. What I do when I'm bored is I sneak into the girl's dorm, you know just for fun, and I can ultimately tell that the Girl's dorm looks way classier than the boys' dorm.. The Boys' dorm is filled with trash, boring wallpapers and rats running around. Whilst the girls' dorm looks like a mansion.What's also fun to do is to go outside the school, after completing early missions, you get permission to go outside - where there is actual police trying to catch you if you do something wrong - which makes it look just like Grand Theft Auto. This game is just so much fun and brings so much memories when I used to play it on the Playstation 2.9/10 "

												This game was released by Rockstar a long old time ago before we had our GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption, and if this isn't one of the most fun games I've ever played I don't know what is (PS2 Version). You go through the life of Jimmy Hopkins, a young kid popular for being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the game isn't called bully for that reason. You go through Jimmy's life trying to become a better person while trying not to fail your chemistry quiz. It's a great game and really puts school into a game well. "

												Not exactly what I was expecting. I thought that this is a milder version of Postal but it is not. For me this is an advanture game with sandbox and RPG mixed in. Violence is not pointless, NPCs are interesting and the gameplay is really diverse. This might not be as complex as GTA San Andreas or GTA 5 but still one of the best Rockstar games (better than GTA 4 IMHO).			"

												Great nostalgia for me, who played it on ps2. It's a very nice open world rpg. The world has the right size in my opinion, you can discover a lot of places and the environment feels right. My main complaints are due to the port to PC. Some of the minigames are barely doable first try because of the wierd buttons you have to press for them. Translating the rotation of a stick to the circle movement of a mouse is really bad for a quicktime event. I also encountered some bugs, which almost softlocked me out of progression. I basacally had to do a quest, where I throw snowballs at some kids and every time I tried to do it in one go the game froze. I did it eventually by Alt+tabing out of the game after every throw on a kid. Also towards the end the missions get very repetetive.			"
