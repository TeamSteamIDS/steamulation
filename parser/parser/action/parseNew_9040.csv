												Quake Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon is the first official expansion pack for Quake, developed by Hipnotic, aka Ritual, and released in 1997, few months after original. It focuses on single-player portion of the game, bringing not only new levels but new elements as well, making it the first id software related expansion that doesn't suck.Like original Quake, Mission Pack uses CD to play it's own soundtrack. And since Steam doesn't include it, you will have to go and find it somewhere. And then you will have to go through trouble of implenting it properly with _inmm if you have Windows Vista or higher, so music properly loops.As usual, game allows you to choose if you want to play with software or OpenGL rendering. You probably should stick with software one, as it kinda looks less muddy and OpenGL one has some bugs. Like no overly-high lighting or no full-bright textures for light sources.When you launch the game, don't forget to write ""+mlook"" in console, to enable mouselook.There is also bug of sorts where you will not be able to select game's new weapon - hammer. It's supposed to be on ""0"" weapon slot, but it doesn't seem to be binded to any key. You can fix it by writing ""bind 0 ""impulse 226"""" in console.Plot of Scourge of Armagon goes: You arrived back into military base after defeating final boss of Quake. Yet it's too quiet and you read from console that base was sealed as reinforcements of Quake still keep coming through portal. So you decide that you should travel to another dimension once again and put a stop to it, somehow.Then again, wasn't ""Quake"" a codename for final boss you just defeated? It confuses me slightly. But I guess we can blame all these monsters on surviving member of Quake's order.Anyway, proudly and couragely, the mission pack throws atmosphere and abstarct level design into trash bin, instead bringing more realistical approach. You got to play through 15 levels or so divided into 3 linear episodes. Futurustic base one puts improves on original base levels of Quake, which felt a bit wasted. More looking like real places and it adds a new enemy for sake of variety too. Then come nest two episodes down in strictly medieval and then ""ancient-runes"" themes. And this is where I think that game drops the ball. Not only themes aren't that much interesting, but more realistical level design means less interesting level layouts.It's kinda funny. Times ago when I did a walkthrough on Quake games, I prefered this approach over original. Maybe was more interesting this time around. But as I rebeat game recently, I was missing more abstract and complex approach of Quake.Not to say that level design is completely flat. No, it's quite good. Got interesting pieces. Like graveyard theme. When you also have to enter coffin to exit the level.Engine also got updated to allow things like rocks rolling down the slope, trying to kill you. Or force bridges. And levels use some scripted levels here and there. And sometimes they are build in such way, that you are very likely to get hit without ability to avoid it. Like, spawning thunder-throwing monster in open area.As said, it also doesn't have same atmosphere. Now with brighter maps and with new rocking soundtracks, it's call for action. I don't get the same grim feeling. Something that made Quake unique. Not sure if I dig new music, but most people do.And yes, it introduces new monsters and new weapons. Weapons are gimmicky thigns that weren't needed to begin with. Like, grenade launcher that throws mines that stick to the surface. They are quite weak for mines and it's more fun to just shoot into face than expect for monster to find a path toward place where you are hiding. Or it got laser cannon and hammer, that waste same ammo as Lighting gun of Quake and once again, seem to be not-so-needed variations. Laser can bounce off walls, but it's mostly there to hit you back. At least hammer is useful without ammo as it can gib zombies.And yea, new monsters. Scorpions, tough enemies that increase variety in base levels, strafe here and there and shoot nails at you on the floor level. And gremlins, who behave like monkey and just have some gimmicks like stealing your weapons or spawning more of them by ripping corpses apart. Shame that they killed faster to really consider those things. And new flying organic ""mines"" don't make sense. They increase speed when you aren't looking and are usually put in such way that you will be unaware that one is behind you. Just no idea aside from making you reload a save.Oh, and it got a new final boss. Who isn't gimmicky and is proper one, unlike final boss of Quake. So it's better. If forget that he will die under half a minute from all the ammunition that player was given by that point. Still better.Actually, if you wished Quake to have more of Doom atmosphere in grey-brown setting while having more realistical level design, that majority of gamers prefer over abstract, then this mission pack will be better than Quake itself. But if you liked original Quake, then eh, it doesn't get all things in same way.I am actually surprised that I didn't like it as much in recent walkthrough as I did years ago. But oh well.			"

												FPS games have always been short relative to, say, RPGs, so it's not surprising their DLCs or 'mission packs' tend to be even shorter.But you don't want to hear about that. This is the good ol' days, back when mission packs and DLC actually meant something! In fact it's almost as big as the original game itself! Scourge of Armagon boasts new weapons such as the laser pistol and proxy launcher - useful tools when faced with limited options in some face-off scenarios. Example: you might be having trouble with scorpions. Answer: mine the corners with proxy grenades! And while the laser pistol is frowned upon by some (the kind that can't aim properly and end up shooting themselves with reflected shots), it can be a godsend on Nightmare difficulty, where enemies often start shooting as soon as you see them, and keep shooting ceaselessly, regardless of their gun's clip or shell capacity. Shooting reflected shots around corners could save your bacon.As with Quake, you'll need Ultimate Quake patched in to enable the in-game soundtrack, and the tracks are good enough to be worth worrying about. They help to evoke a sense of atmosphere that the graphics may not be able to accomplish on its own.All our favourite foes from Quake return (except its boss, for obvious reasons). New enemies include the gremlins and aforementioned scorpions, the latter of which will probably grief you the most. Other odds and ends include force bridges and shields, an actual boss fight this time, nice graveyard scenes, entering coffins. There are now also giant flying bombs (""Vor bombs are not enough, must add more bombs,"" babbled the lead developer to his team)You liked Quake? Then get this. It's like a box of chocolates. One box of Quake is never enough.			"

												Quake: Scourge of Armagon is an expansion pack to the original Quake that introduces new enemies, new weapons and a slew of new levels to shoot your way through. The most noticeable difference from the get go is the amazing new soundtrack added to this expansion. While the original Quake had creepy ambient music that put a sense of dread to the environment the music in this is either heavy metal or some rather dark sounding techno that will have you involuntarily headbanging. This new soundtrack suits the game as the levels are filled with far more enemies at any one time so you'll be shooting more often than not. Unfortunately like the original Quake the soundtrack in this has been cut out of the game leaving it with nothing but sound effects. If you are not willing to mod the music back in I would suggest you skip this expansion all together as it just isn't Quake without the soundtrack. This expansion is far harder than the original game and will require you to put your former experience to the test as they can and will throw tons of high level monsters at you at once.Enemy placement is also far more cruel and you will often times be face to face with the likes of a Vore (spider demon). It is necessary to keep your finger on the fire button at all times as any delay can lead to your untimely death. This expansion pack is not just a bunch of levels to shoot your way through as the level design is also quite different in that it has an Adventure game like feel to it. For example you will be running from falling boulders, trying to squeeze your way through spinning grinders to press a switch and a few narrow steel beams you must cross over bottomless pit. Most of these environmental hazards that differentiated it from the base game are only found in the first few levels and then it's mostly shooting bad guys in your face with the gun of your choosing. A new weapon added is a grenade launcher that shoots grenades and won't detonate until someone steps near it, whether that be you or the enemy it doesn't differentiate and may cause your death if misused. The next weapon you will encounter is a laser weapons that fires bouncing balls that is very useful for shooting enemies around a corner. Last but not least is a mighty hammer that will electrocute any surrounding enemies though it does take up cell ammo.You will need all the help you can get as the new enemies are equally as deadly as your new found arsenal. One of the first new enemies that you will meet is a giant robotic scorpion that shoots nails at you. It is a very deadly enemy as these nails move quite fast and are hard to avoid. The next one is called a Gremlin which leaps at you and will steal whatever weapon you are holding. It also has the ability to chow down on corpses and spawn more Gremlins so taking care of any you see should come as a priority if you don't want a small army of them after you. Lastly is a floating hunk of meat called a Spike Mine that will explode in your face if you let it get close enough. It sounds like an easy enough task to simply not let it close to you but these guys are pretty sneaky and while they do emit a distinct sound it is rather hard to hear, making it too late once you see it flying overhead like a deadly piñata. One hit is all it takes for these guys to kill you so while they are the weakest enemies they are also the most dangerous. All of the monsters from the base game are back and ready to rip you in half though thankfully the Slimes are only encountered once in this expansion. You will be facing a lot more of the grunts and Rottweilers as the entire first episode is set on Earth.There are three episodes overall and it is quite a lengthy expansion pack considering it took me about 6 hours to complete while the base game took me 8. The story is as unimportant as ever and involves a creature called Armagon taking control of the hellish forces after the demise of last game's bad guy and attacking Earth yet again. It is up to you to go into hell and take him down. Thankfully there is an actual final boss fight in this unlike the underwhelming ending in the original. The story is as minimal as ever and will only give you a few lines of text at the end of an episode. The environments you will be exploring are pretty interesting and range from a church, some type of building floating in pitch black darkness and some levels with rivers of blood. Some environments can now blow up in certain set sequences and annoyingly enough the debris from the wall can still damage you for some unknown reason causing you to wait around until they disappear so you can walk to the objective safely.New items include the Wetsuit which will allow you to breathe underwater and reflects electric type attacks. A rather strange shield that reflects half of the damage you take back to the enemy and last but not least a horn that summons friendly monsters. These monsters will follow you around until they die and what monster you get is up solely to luck. Secrets are plentiful and as difficult as ever to find though it does help to keep an eye out as ammo can be rather scare at times. Running out of ammo is a death sentence as the axe does little damage and has very short range, even if you are lucky enough to have the hammer it has the same range as the axe and it is a rather bad idea to face someone with a chainsaw for an arm or a giant scorpion in melee combat. When all is said and done this is quite a meaty expansion pack with all that we loved about Quake but cranked to 11. If you didn't like Quake the first time around there is nothing here that will convert you though for those that loved the original, Scourge of Armagon definitely lives up to the standards set by the original developers ID and may actually be even better given that you prefer pure action and more difficulty. Why they took away the soundtrack is unknown to me but if you are willing to put in the little effort to get it back this will definitely give you more of what you loved about Quake.			"

												A good expansion for Quake. In three new episodes you will encounter few new enemies and alternative weapons. But what is more important to me are those little detials in every level. Now you need more than search for keys and switches. Destroying objects, avoiding deadly machinery or falling objects gives game more life. And those working clock! They even ring when its noon, so its worth to wait :D. The level design sometimes show us details we can compare with Strogg enviroment from Q2 and last boss looks a bit like tank. So from my oppinion its worth a buy and try.			"

												Scourge of Armagon is the first of the two Quake expansion packs. It chronicles the main character taking on a brand new force of extra-dimensional enemies, this time lead by a cyborg known only as ""Armagon"". It was developed by Ritual entertainment which would later create games like Star Trek Elite Force 2 and SiN.Compared to the original Quake, Scourge of Armagon has a destinctively sci-fi look and feel to it. A lot of the enemies are footsoldiers and one of the new enemies is this robotic scorpion that shoots nails at you.However what makes this expansion memorable to me compared to Dissolution of Eternity, the second expansion, is how frantic it feels at times. The map design feels intentionally designed to be a little claustraphobic, and there are many more traps and inconveniant enemy spawning locations. Likewise there are several new enemies that require slowing down a little and being cautious, such as these gremlin enemies that steal your weapons and use them against you.Unfortunately the final boss Armagon was far too easy, and it kind of made me wish there was an additional episode. I don't think it's a bad expansion pack but by no means is it a must play.			"

Quake Mission Pack 1: Scourge Of Armagon			* 7/10This first mission pack brings A pleasant expansion with more levels, a bunch of new weapons, power-ups, enemies and badass soundtrack for those eager to get more Quake.The most relevant elements are surely Mjolnir hammer that, as the name suggests, throws lightning to multiple enemies, the laser cannon that fires laser bolts that bounce on walls, the horn of Conjuring which will spawn a random creature that will fight by your side.I've noticed that level structures are kind of throwing weapons at you, while providing a fair but not excessive quantity and variety of opposing forces promoting a stunt-action approach to levels.I was disappointed with the final boss as it reminded me too much of Makron, so its design doesn't have much to do with the medieval style of the first Quake.Considering the age of the game and the lack of 16:9 resolutions I would suggest to play it with any modern port available as it could provide some serious graphical update as well. I've played this with darkplaces and various texture packs.+++PROs+++ ACTION. A simple and pleasant action-oriented expansion with some new weapons, powerups, enemies and a badass soundtrack to listen while you jump everywhere and slay down all the enemies.---CONs--- NOT MUCH. Not much actually, the levels' structure literally throws you almost lots of weapons almost immediately without balancing that firepower with an equally strong and numerous opposition of enemies, and the final boss design doesn't match much with Quake Style, in my opinion. OLD ENGINE. The engine is quite old nowadays and lacks 16:9 resolutions. If you want higher resolutions you have to check also the DPI box in the Exe properties. Alternatively you can load the game using one of the many modern ports available around. I've used Darkplaces.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

												So you telefragged your way to the end of Quake and you want more? Well, you came to the right place. Scourge of Armagon is the first of two ""official"" expansions, neither of which were created in-house at iD but carry the stamp all the same. This isn't exactly more Quake in the way you might be thinking, but there's a chance you might enjoy it even more.Unlike the base game whose story could fit on a Post-It, Scourge of Armagon seeks to create a slightly more cohesive experience. In the wake of your victory over the... bad guys, you set out to track down the rest of the... bad guys. This means instead of four disparate episodes to blast through, there's a linear chain of 17 levels that form a story out of their very design. You'll start in familiar tech bases and research labs, gibbing grunts and commandos, before passing through an impressively-detailed dimensional gate and ending up in the gothic castles and hellish mazes of the... bad guy world. You can generally see where you came from when you start a new level (or at least how you got there) which adds a nice bit of continuity to your journey.It's essential to note that levels in Scourge of Armagon actually look like real places. Bases have control panels and supply cabinets. The hellish cathedral has pews and bookshelves. The mines have cart rails and drilling apparatuses. Every area is far more grounded and identifiable than the insane architecture of the original, though this isn't necessarily a plus considering how much I enjoy the fever-dream ambiance of Quake. You also might not care for how huge these levels are, featuring room and monster counts double or more than the ones you're coming from.This brings me to the difficulty, which is the one aspect that sours me on SoA. Every level is absolutely jam-packed with enemies, with some absurd mixes of threats in later areas. Normal in SoA feels like Hard in Quake, and I'm not about to try anything harder than that given how much effort each level takes to finish. You'll also run into some devious traps and one-hit kills like crushing ceilings and deadly fans that can quickly end an otherwise promising run. This is exacerbated by the amount of backtracking most levels need, some being so maze-like that the creators helpfully included signs and scripted messages to key locations. Virtually none of SoA's levels are straight shots, and they have a habit of spawning more enemies for you to battle when you pass back through completed areas.If you can stomach the challenge and the wandering, though, there's a lot to appreciate here. The new enemies and weapons fill in some interesting gaps in the original lineups and are welcome additions. The artistry on display in each level, from the architecture to the scripting, is top-notch and feels pulled from the very best user-created maps. Honestly Scourge of Armagon almost feels like a midpoint between Quake and Quake II, especially in the look of the levels and the new weapons. It's an interesting experience in ways that the original Quake is not, yet features a lot of the same exhilarating combat that you're here for. Any fan of the series owes it to themselves to give it a try.			"

												This is an absolute must buy. Level design is beautiful, atmospheric and various. A few cool new weapons and enemies. There are stunning and memorable moments that I totally didn't expect to see in Quake. Rotating objects (doors, falling pillars, machinery), stones that bounce around in the mining machinery, cool cinematic scenes during the very last level, and even a working clock!.I have to admit that the last boss fight is on the level of Wolfenstein 3d - hide from the boss behind the pillar. But the authors decided to bet on spectacularity, and it did pay off - scenes of Armagon's arrival and death are impressive, and there's even nice unexpected cutscene at the end. And the challenge will be there, too, because the level before the last is far from easy.			"

												Where Quake was a classic FPS, its first mission pack is a classic example of an expansion done right.Developed by Hipnotic Interactive, who would later rebrand themselves as Ritual Entertainment and work on such titles as SiN, Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K. 2 and Legacy of Kain: Defiance, Scourge of Armagon expands the Quake experience by adding a new campaign, several new enemies, weapons and powerups, all of them blending right in with the old elements. However, I feel that the expansion's strongest point were its levels. Creatively designed and much more difficult than the vanilla game, they're expansive and make use of more advanced mechanics and visuals in order to accomodate and overall complete the mission pack's other additions.If you enjoyed Quake, you'd be sinning if you passed this mission pack over.

												This was a good mission pack. I got 4 hours of gameplay for $5! That is a great deal! If you liked QUAKE, want more missions, more challenge, and a new boss, then I would recommend playing this.7/10			"

												Same quake goodness, fresh levels and fresh feel. More time was spent on the variety in the levels as well as the different locations, but it is still on the same engine so apart from a couple of new minions not a lot has changed from the game play.Well deserved new power cell weapons, as well as a new explosive weapon and increased diff (for those who like it on hard). A must have as part of the Quake 1 collection.			"

												Yea!-Old School twitch shooting-Great Level design-Its more QuakeMeh!-AI shows its age, which makes exploiting them easy-New items give a meh feel to the expierienceBleh!-Needs mods to support modern resolutionsGist:Another 3 episodes(15 levels) of pure Quake awesomeness, the levels design is amazing which you don't see much of in that caliber in todays games. If you like Quake its a must buy. But just like the original game you will need mods to clean it up a bit and give support for modern resolutions. "

												This review only include about the Mission Pack 1!  About the [Mission Pack 1]: This [Mission Pack 1] did not bring lot of features. But it is still good.  Good things: -The game did not be worse. -A few new weapons and desing.  Bad Things: -Still does not include the original musics. -Still need install the [Quke Ultimate Patch] and disable the Steam-overlay.  My recommendation same as my first review. If you miss that, you can read here! "

												Essentially just more Quake, but too easy, and with some dire level design. They overload with you ammo for the best weapons while convoluting the levels, meaning you're running around lost but armed to the teeth.Still worth a playthrough, but not as good as the original.			"

												Very good expansion.  The level themes are immediately recognizable and you can tell they really put a lot of heart and thought into them, unfortunately some of these levels can become a bit labyrinthine as you lose track of where to go and what new pathway has become available to you.  Fortunately, there's no time limit.  The new weapons buff your arsenal with some needed variety and the new enemies also become quite a surprise in their strength.			"

												Both of the original Quake's mission packs are amazing and worth playing. This and Dissolution of Eternity are better than the last act of Quake with larger, brighter environments, improved map design and new gameplay mechanics (most notably new ammo types). These mission packs are probably the best game in the Quake series and sadly seem to be overlooked.			"

												After completing the original QUAKE, you may think you're the biggest bad♥♥♥♥♥this side of QUAKE-con. But after you play the first level of Scourge of Armagon, you realise you're wrong. You're actually just getting started.This mission pack is lengthy and difficult and so is an absolute gift to QUAKE lovers and masochists alike. More challenging enemies, such as the brutal Scorpian robots and the weapon stealing Gremlins, combined with a handful of new and interesting weapons, like Mjolnir (That's Thor's hammer!) and a Prox-Mine gun, this mission pack injects new elements into a game that you may think you have mastered.The long levels are a true test of the player's ability, especially on the Hard and Nightmare difficulties. If you are wanting to brave them, be ready for attrition against a rabbling horde of 180 enemies a level that are ALL more deadly than you.It'll leave you sweating and battered, but no game is quite as rewarding when finished as QUAKE: Scourge of Armagon.Recommended for Quake veterans and/ or people who want a challenge!

												If there's anything that I'm positive this one did better than the original QUAKE, it's the soundtrack. My, my. Pretty badass, of course.The 'couple new weapons are alright I suppose. I found myself ignoring most of them though.Level design is worse than the original Quake's, and also the second expansion, IMHO. Might be my memory, having played the original QUAKE time and time again even as a kid, but, if I'm not complaining about the second expansion's level design, then I'm pretty sure there's something definitely wrong with this one. It annoyed me throughout the whole damn thing. I know it's meant to be tough, but damn, it's pretty overkill, so much I swear I ragequitted or couldn't deal with something a couple of times, and I rarely do that with single player shooters. Damn.The new powerups are nice. A welcome break from all the original QUAKE's ones, I suppose. Nowhere near as good, though. I kind of like simple things like Quad Damage and Invincibility better. :PAlso one of them gives you an AI ally. I've got to say, for its age, I understand why they're so terrible at following you, but you're better off leading an enemy to them rather than let them find the enemy. Seriously.Final boss fight is lame but I understand given the fact id sucks at pulling bosses anywhere outside of games like Quake III. I just spammed rockets at the guy and called it a day. After a handful of attempts, of course. And it was my first time throughout the expansion. Oh, and it was Nightmare. Yeah.Overall...I'd say it's alright for an expansion, buut...do not get it if you're not that big on Quake. I think. I'm a bit of a challenger-type gamer that always goes for the hard difficulty, so if you're not actually planning on playing on Nightmare, and/or are (maybe even very) patient at stuff like, say, taking a grenade to the face and scarce medkits, then I'm sure this expansion's fine for you. If you get mad at stuff like that and  think this expansion isn't worth the trouble, then yeah, don't. If you are big on QUAKE then go ahead, like everybody else here says.It's...alright, I guess. Have fun with it if you do get it though! :D			"

What I like about the game •	I liked the new weapons they added, like the Laser cannon. There are also new power ups, like the horn of conjuring.   •	They have added new enemies to kill, like the Gremlin and Centroid.•	 There are some awesome levels in this expansion pack, like Catacombs and Limbo. •	Brilliant boss fight at the end of the game.•	Plenty of secrets to be found and there are also secret levels.•	The gameplay is still very addictive and very enjoyable.  What I disliked or was disappointed with•	The steam version of the game, doesn’t have the music playing during the levels, but it can be fixed by a patch. My conclusion An excellent mission pack, with some brilliant levels. More of the addictive and enjoyable gameplay. You get a lot for the money. If you liked quake, then you will really enjoy this. I highly recommend it.83/100The Ulimate Quake patch

												This first expansion pack for Quake is the best out of the other mission packs that were developed (there was a third pack unreleased commercially). The map design is on par to that of id quality, filled with military bases and dark runic/medievil environments, along with having more additions such as more detailed traps and rotating objects. One secret level within the game is designed with Deathmatch in mind and is suspeneded across a black void, something that wouldn't be seen again till the famous Q3DM17. Expanding upon Quake's arsenal is the Mjolnir hammer, great for crowd control, a proximity mine launcher (though not as fun as the vanilla grenade launcher), and a laser rifle that has a higher rate of fire than the one used by Enforcers. While it is nice to have a few extra weapons, they weren't as memorable compared to the base game. As with ealier FPS titles there is not much story, but all one needs to know is that Quake's general, Armagon, is up to no good, leaving you to eliminate him, along with everything else that gets in your way. Gameplay is the same, kill anything that moves, but still retaining the awesome pixel-hunting secrets (the best ones hidden away by level designer, Levelord), remaining just as fun as its predecessor. New power-ups are present in the form of a wet-suit, Shield of Empathy, Horn of Conjuration, the horn being the most interesting as long as you get a nice ally on your side (damn dogs). The most memorable concept was the Gremlin enemy, being able to steal your weapon and use it against you! It will also ""eat"" the corpse of fellow demons to spawn another gremlin buddy, which was an interesting sight the first time I played the game.This is a recommended title for those who couldn't get enough of the action from the first Quake.
