												This is the first game created by Gearbox - the legendary developers behind Borderlands and Brothers in Arms. Opposing Forces is the first expansion to Half Life. Released in 1999, exactly a year after the original game.Personally i like it just as much as the original Half Life, and in my book, original Half Life is in top 10.It consists of 12 chapters, but don't let that fool you cause it's not nearly as long as the original Half Life. 6 hours is as much as you can get from it.That said, the game has it's own identity. For example, just like any half life game, this one has a tutorial. Gearbox decided to have a bit of fun with it, since you start out in the boot camp.It's a typical training mission, but a nicely done training mission. Had a lot of army stereotypes and FMJ references.Unlike Blue Shift (2nd expansion), this game actually tried to add some things of its own. Night vision googles instead of the flashlight. Sniper instead of the crossbow. Pistol with a laser pointer instead of the revolver. Wrench and a knife instead of the crowbar 2 new alien weapons - one is like a bazooka, the other has infinite ammo (shoots lightning balls).Instead of long jumps, your protagonist climbs on ropes.1 new Black Mesa prototype weapon, that teleports you to Xen. The location you get teleported in generally have a lot of loot.1 completely new weapon, not just an alternative model - a machine gun (M249 SAW).There are new alien types as well.Also, throughout the game, you will encounter your comrades, the most important ones are medic and engineer. Medic can patch you up, while the engineer can drill through doors.As for the story, neither Blue Shirt nor Opposing Forces are canon. That said, Opposing Forces has a lot of cameos. I personally wouldn't have minded to have it in the official lore.Deep inside it's still the same game, but at least they tried to add a few things here and there. Like i said, it has it's own identity.I highly recommend it.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:Also see my:  Half Life (1) Review Half-Life 2 ReviewHalf-Life: Blue Shift ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewINTRODUCTION:Half-Life: Opposing Force (also known as Government Cover-up Simulator 1999 or Call of Half-Life: Black Mesa Warfare) is a first-person action shooter game that serves as the first expansion to the critically acclaimed and award-winning Half-Life by Valve. Unlike Half-Life however, this title was made by Valve alongside Gearbox Software. Interestingly, unlike Half-Life, the player will see the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of a U.S. Marine(the Military enemies in the first game).PLOT (No Spoilers)The player takes the role of Commander…(I mean)…Corporal Shephard, a U.S. Marine with the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit who were sent to the Black Mesa Complex for an unknown operation. While en route inside an Osprey to the Complex, Shephard and his team are attacked by Xen air-borne units forcing the Osprey to crash knocking him out. Follow Shephard in his trek across the massive Black Mesa Complex in an attempt to escape while uncovering a government cover-up that would pitch Shephard against U.S. Black Operations Units, Xen forces, and a new alien threat called Race X.PROS:+ New enemy types with unique abilities and weapons (instead of just rehashing the materials of the main game)+ Fun and interesting new weapons such as the Displacer Cannon and Shock Roach+ Well made action-packed story which shows players a different side of the Black Mesa Incident+ Introduction of new game mechanics such as Rope Climbing, Secondary heavy melee attacks, Grappling hooks (Barnacle hook?), Night vision and Portal guns that send you (or your target) to another dimension (See Displacer Cannon above)+ Possibly the first FPS game to implement a Military Squad game mechanic+ Entertaining Tutorial with cultural references+ Story intersects with some important Half-Life 1 events+ Good voice acting for its time+ Andrian Shephard is possibly a descendant of Jack (protagonist of Bioshock) due to his uncanny ability to wield a Wrench in battle against Black Ops Soldiers and Aliens.CONS:- Relatively short game with me clocking around 5 hours of game time on hard mode.- New squad mechanics is clunky (I can actually forgive this since it’s possibly the first squad mechanic on an FPS game)- Puzzles are not that satisfying to solve- Final chapter leading to the final boss feels rushed and underdeveloped- Unsatisfying and easy final bossCONCLUSION:GREAT EXPANSION that I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED specially for those who played the first Half-Life game and I say this because it is littered with several subtle nods from the main game.  WORTH IT?MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE.  I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you do not have it, get Half-Life Complete.FINAL NOTES:Opposing Force is a good example on how to make an expansion; it introduces new game mechanics, new enemies, new weapons and all the while delivering a new story that still being closely related to the main Half-Life plot.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Making an expansion pack to Half Life was no small task. But Gearbox was more than willing to set the bar.Opposing Force is fundamentally a similar experience to Half Life 1. But it expanded on it's core foundation in numerous ways. There are new actually interesting weapons, friendly squad members who serve different non-combat roles and a few other things.But what Opposing Force does well is it continues the legacy left by Half Life 1. It has consistantly good pacing and like Half Life dynamically goes from low-key puzzle segments to high octane action horror. It's just so much fun to play it's an actual challenge for me to pick between playing either Half Life or Opposing Force. Since both games compliment each other so well.If you like Valve games, or even first person shooters. You owe it to yourself to play Opposing Force. It is one of those games that you just can't stop playing.			"

												Oh man, oh man, oh man. I was both curious and a little worried after HL - how can a totally new person (Shephard corporal) lead the story, and how will the story go on without Gordon Freeman. As I mentioned in my HL review, I wasn't too happy with Half Life's pacing - the environmental changes that were supposed to delay you were all too random-like - it was just obvious that game mechanics with the sole purpose of slowing you down. It was really unreal. Similarly, it kind of bothered me that even though Gordon IS the archetype of the clever protagonist, the man of science who rises and fights back - it's just surreal that every other scientist is older than him, and can't protect themselves at all. Hell, Gordon was more capable of fighting than the guards, employed by Black Mesa.So, back to Opposing Force. You play with a soldier (not a bad guy, you don't need to kill scientists if you don't want to) , and your standard gear will be a Deser Eagle and a combat knife - I really liked how realistic this part is compared to Gordon's. The story and the character harmonizes, your character, and even HIS ACTIONS have their part and place in the story. Additionally, claimed by wiki it's his training, Shephard can climb ropes, which is an intresting mechanic in the game, and opens new dimensions in movement and game variety. And at this point I still have 3 great things to say about the game, but they are kind of interlope - first of all, the game introduces numerous new weapons - M249 (brutal machinegun), Displacer Cannon, Sniper rifle, the already mentioned Deser Eagle and then - New alien weapons! The rocket-launcher-like Spore Gun, the Shock Roach (my favourite) and the Barnacle Grapple.Second great thing is partly about Barnacle Grapple - it can be used as a good-ish melee weapon, but it's main usage is just crazy - it can stick to any organic surface, including some pods on the walls, that appeared along with the alien invasion.  You have a grapple that can be used to close distances and move around some parts of the map - it's just brilliant. The Second Great Thing is the creativity of level design. FINALLY the expansion, while being shorter than the base game, uses it's features much more frequently, while inserting these into the game almost flawlessly. There are not only  ""push the box 3 metres to the right to jump"" parts, there is a part when the same box needed to be used 3 times! I guess this is because they knew that after playing the base game, the player will know that they can be moved, and as s/he's accustomed with the feature, can use it in a more varied way.And the third great things is the overall game integrity. It's good, in my opinion way better than the base game was.  There is way less button pressing - once you need to free a medic to take care of the engineer, who can afterwards open a door with a flame cutter. Much intresting than pressing two buttons, isn't it?  Most blockades during the game are legit - a huge worm or pillars of flame in the waste burner(?). Things that delay your progress won't just randomly happen, but your way goes through paths where they delaying elements DO exist, making - at least in my eye - Opposing Force a much more immersive game then the original story.(On the sidenote - bossfight was less monumental, but far less frustrating than repeadly missing jumps in the shower of electric discharges of Nihilanth)I won't throw numbers around, but while I felt Half-Life was fun/good,  I *loved* Opposing Force. I wholeheartedly recommend this purchase if you enjoyed the base game, and you're intrested in the expanded story.			"

												Opposing Force is the first expansion pack for the five star new standard bearer FPS Half Life 1. The bottom line is this is a great expansion pack.You are a marine, Corporal Adrian Shepard sent into the Black Mesa facility after Half Life 1's protagonist Gordon Freeman uh accidentally created a rift in space / time and brought aliens in. Everyone talks to you in the game without cut scenes.When you start the game, Gordon in Half Life 1 is still there and your mission goes from being sent to kill him to fighting for your own survival. You visit portions of the first game yet changed, such as you will visit some of the entry tunnel from the first segment of Half Life 1. You will visit the dam from the original game. Everything changed with new challenges in each. There are plenty of puzzles some are different than the original game and others are more complex. Such as instead of having to use a push box once, you need to use it 3x pushing it from room to room.I'd say those old environments (destroyed with new challenges) are maybe 1/100th of the map content. The new environments feel fresh and they use a lot of lighting to make it look different. It feels fresh because the other universe is starting to be integrated into our own universe through the aliens making it and because Black Mesa had creature exhibits. There are new textures, you'll go through vine covered sewers where giant fat aliens have their nests.There are also new gameplay elements that you will be introduced to in an optional training course. The training course is a very nice tutorial that will show you everything new such as ropes to climb and swing on. It's a very nice mechanic. The flashlight has been replaced by night vision goggles which are very nice. You also have new squad mates to find in the game that will aide you like the medic who can heal you on command, the engineer who will blow torch his way through some doors and your standard commandos. Each of these three will fight intelligently and won't just stand around getting shot. They will defend the territory if you command them to stand there.That's another thing the enemy and friendly AI is great as always from the game. AI will run from grenades, throw their own grenades, flank you, run from your fire and other things. It's very nice.There are a lot of new weapons. I was surprised. You start with new melee weapons, a new pistol with an optional laser sight, a new sniper rifle that can be quite useful, new alien technology (if you don't want to hear just skip to the next paragraph), such as an electrical gun, a cannon that looks like a BFG from Doom (only more awesome), an acid spitting alien, and a ceiling grabber (yes the enemy) that can be used as a hook shot!All the old enemies are here too... but there are a lot of new enemies too (if you don't want it spoiled, skip on!), the new enemies seem to be faster and more dangerous. From waist high creatures that run to you, to taller electric shooting aliens controlled by ant like parasites, giant fat electrical discharging enemies... and their offspring, the list goes on, but you'll be surprised at some of the things the expansion comes up with.With a 5+ hour play through the first time, I do wish it was a bit longer so they could divvy out the enemies a bit slower. But hey it's an expansion pack. The graphics are not improved and they still have bugs like getting stuck in the floor of elevators and lifts, but all of that can be overlooked. A lot has been added to make this expansion worth anyone's time. Great expansion pack!			"

												Another expansion pack for the original HL, this time giving us a look into the ""enemy side"" and the way that the events of Black Mesa affected the Marine Corps called to ""contain"" the situation. The main character Corporal Adrian Sherpard is brought into the facility but things dont go like planned and all hell is broken loose.Another short game that complements the original story of Gordon Freeman, but the ending of this game leads me to believe that we might see more of this character in future installements of HL, so it might not be just an expansion pack game.9/10.

												An mazing expansion of Half-Life and my favourite one from the entire Half-Life 1 Anthology. For some reason i enjoyed it more even than the original Half-Life. A great opportunity to experience the military specialist's side of the story. Brand new weapons and a lot of new freaking aliens, also you get to use nightvision instead of the flashlight which is kinda cool, not even mentioning the new weapon that creates teleports to Zen, a different one for every location in the game where you use it. A great game with a captivant story. Definitely a must buy!			"

												Nostalgia!This Half Life expansion takes a different spin. Instead of playing a Black Mesa personal you are Corporal Adrian Shepard and you are task to hunt down Gordon Freeman and terminate him. You think it would be easy, instead just like the Black Mesa personal you are thrown into the chaos that is wrecking havoc all across the facility and just like everyone else. You must fight your way through the facility and survive. This game adds a lit bit of something new to the game. Not only new alien species. But also team effort. Your AI squad mates that are dotted throughout the huge complex. Be warn however there are some instances that they MUST SURVIVE if they die then you will have to start all over again from where you last save. So keep them alive and work with them.This game adds more puzzle and more exploration to the huge facility which is always nice. The only minor complaint is the senstivity in some cases it can get really annoying or dizzy when doing these physical puzzles (jump, crouch jump) those sort of puzzles. Unlike in the previous games where the looking senstivity and what not seems more slower. So beware of that.If you are a Half Life fan and want a taste of of military action. Half Life style. This game is recommended			"

												This expansion to Half-Life is much longer than Blue Shift is and also, much harder to get through. There are times when you're going to get frustrated, but I still consider this a short and sweet package with the army flavor in it. Not to mention the training section of the game. That training section in the military barracks was amusing and also felt realistic. I totally recommend this game.			"

												This was almost as engrossing as Half-Life actually was. Of course, you can't beat God (Half-Life, in this case) if you're an angel (OF), God is God for a reason! And that's the stupidest analogy I've ever made up, but bear with me, games like Opposing Force are never easy to make justice in words. But what I mean is, even though this game can't beat Half-Life, it was incredible. I'm not going to lie; I found certain things a tiny, tiny tiny tiny bit more ""WOOOAAHHH"" than Half-Life, but y'know... HALF-LIFE, MAN.Something that amazed me from the game is the fact I was actually busting my ♥♥♥ to save every grunt I encountered. I loathed these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Half-Life and Blue Shift; I mean, they killed the poor scientists/security guards and actually enjoyed it! It was so sad! And I'm so used to killing them that every time I encountered a group of HECU marines, I'd panic and start shooting them. Then I'd be like ""Oh. Right"", and pressed the F9 key (my reload last save). At first I didn't mind and let them die, but dammit, they grew on me, to the point I'd truly be attempting to save them. I just felt fond of them. Except for the grunt that pushes the scientist when he's asking for Freeman when you're about to board the Osprey in which you're supposed to escape. That grunt I killed. ALSO, TWO GRUNTS ABANDONED ME IN CHAPTER 11 (The Package). I WENT TO EXPLORE A ROOM AND WHEN I GOT OUT THEY JUST DISAPPEARED. ♥♥♥♥♥.Getting more serious now, something that really impressed me from Opposing Force besides the guns, the Race X and the new ""puzzles"", was the large-scale battles you can have at times. If you take care of your squad, you can have a group of at least four grunts with you. So when you encounter a lot of enemies, the fights are phenomenal! Sadly, this only happened once to me, I was barely able to get three grunts to follow me most of the time because some grunts were just too stubborn and stupid to follow me. This is the strongest flaw I encountered in the game; the grunts' AI is really stupid in the vast majority of the time. And they were also generally pretty useless in battle, and I'm not even counting the times I died because of friendly fire. However, there was one time in which I was able to have an epic Black Ops-Shock Troopers-HECU battle. Replayed it about four times just to repeat the breathtaking sequence. Unfortunately, it was hard to achieve and generally I spent too much time in the game trying to get everyone to follow me, which is simply precious game-time wasted. This is quite disappointing, in my opinion, since the rest of the game is of such extreme quality. Being someone who's mostly played modern games, I have to say Opposing Force (as well as HL and BS) looks really good and its graphics are not bad at all for being a nearly twenty year old game. And even if the graphics were terrible (they're decent, in my opinion), the game would make up for it with its fantastic atmosphere, gameplay, battles, bosses, guns, ambiance and so forth. I also adored Gordon's direct and indirect appearances; his ""employee of the month"" photograph (was that his office?), his constant mention by the grunts and finally his Chapter 6 (""We Are Not Alone"") direct appearance: where you actually see him. I seriously replayed that sequence seven times. I LOVE WHEN GAMES CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO DIRECTLY. Thinking that while you're still fighting your way through Black Mesa, Gordon is beating the crap out of Gonarch and everyone (or everything?) else. Opposing Force is, quite simply, a passionate application of creative design. I seriously cannot wait for Tripmine Studios' remake. Definitely recommend the game. But as I also said on my BS review; only play it if you have played Half-Life. Otherwise, the game might feel dull to you and you won't understand the storyline, and won't be able to fan-girl over Gordon's appearances/mentions... well... if you're a crazy fan. Like me.			"

												Best expansion for a game : EVER!I haven't had so much enjoyment playing an expansion pack. As always, Valve never fails to impress, same goes to Gearbox for their legendary game developing skills.Opposing Force not only expands the main game, but adds major updates to the already grand foundation laid out by Half-Life. The story starts right where Half-Life starts, but you're controlling a commando of the HECU unit (which was the army squadrons that were trying to kill you in the original game) and the plot cuts off to a different direction that we never got to see before and also you get to have super cool buddies and with so many additions to the game which are : MANY new weapons, different equipment, lots of new characters, better AI, squad teammates with different attributes, lots of new enemies.And best thing was, I got this gem during the Valve special sale event along with the whole Half-Life collection just for 10 bucks. Best decision EVA!10/10 - All hail Gaben, our lord.			"

												The game follows the storyline of the original Half-Life game but goes even deeper showing the final hours before the destruction of the facility that weren't in the original game. The game follows a marine who is sent to a classified mission in Black Mesa. The story is the same as the original Half-Life but from a different perspective. Some events that happened in the original game can also be seen in this game adding to the experience if you've played the original game. Later, the player encounters completely new types of enemies. The game has the same feel as the original Half-Life with all the puzzles and boss fights. Overall the game is very fun to play and is a great FPS experience.			"

												Half-Life Opposing Force is a stand alone add-on developed by Gearbox for the original Half-Life 1.  It's set in the same world and environment only this time from the perspective of one of the U.S. Marines of which were the enemy in the original game.I always enjoyed these add-ons for the different perspectives that overlapping ever so slightly. The detail in these games are great and despite how old they are i still really enjoy them. For me they are quite nostalgic to play, but i imagine maybe for others who are just now coming across these games, they might look a bit crap. With that said, i'd hope that the story would be enough to keep the new audiences interested. The game runs great for it's age. The resolution for my screen wasn't compatible but it wasn't too bad, it was still very playable. Unlike my recent playthrough of Half-Life: Source, this one actually had no bugs or anything that stopped me in my tracks. I had no problems with this game from start to finish. Although, this game was a quite a bit shorter.I sunk about 5 hours into this game and completed it in that time, compared to the original game, which took me a lot longer, this game is fairly short. With that said it's still a great addition to the franchise. As far as mods go, this one was great. There are interesting new additions in this game, a few of which i forgot about. New races of alien, new human enemies and new weapons. All of which kept the game interesting instead of it just feeling like the first one. Again, there is never a dull moment in these games as there is always something around the corner. Some of the puzzles in this game impressed me, as they were just as creative, if not more so, then the first game.All in all I've definitely recommend this game if you have played the first one and can put up with the old style of the game.TL;DR : A great add-on to the original game, it's old but classic. You play from a different perspective from the first, get new weapons, fight new enemies and it's generally just a lot of fun, although shorter then the original game.

												Best addon for Half - Life. Now we play for Adrian Shephard - HECU soldier. As well as Dr. Freeman, he will look for a way out of Black Mesa. The main differences from the original game - a large number of new monsters, and the availability of a new arsenal to destroy them.8.5/10			"

												This is actually my first time playing opposing force even though i have gone though the regular half life 1 and 2 many times. It's suprisingly short.. probably half as long as half life 1.The graphics and puzzle are just about the same difficulty but jumps are little bit harder.It's much easier to die in earlly game from the envirment hazards and late game became black OPs.Overall it's a nice little addition to the original half life 1.8.5/10. IF you have missed this one like me.. spend some time to try it. It's not long but it's still quite fun like regular half life. only took me 3.2 hours to finish. "

												As someone loving a good setting and a great story with room for theories and mystery, this game gives me everything I could ask for.If you love or even like Half Life, play this game!It enhances the story for a big chunk.This game is from 1999, so I won't even talk about graphics and stuff, you can imagine how it looks.The only thing that bothers me is that you change weapon if you pick up the new one.That killed me once as I got some Nades from a crate, but that is a little thing.You can't change that in the options menu, if you know console commands feel free to change it, I don't know how.Anyways, you should totally get this game.I hate that I did not play it earlier.

												Half-Life: Opposing Force is an awesome expansion pack to the original Half-Life, but this time from the point of view of a Marine named Cpl. Adrian Shepard. The events in this game run parallel to the original so it's great to see how the other storylines unfold from a different perspective. There are a load of new weapons added and also a few new enemies to encounter. At times you will also have a squad to help you out which really gives gives the feel for some epic battles when it's your squad versus a horde of monsters. If you're itching for more Half-Life then this is a must play and is an awesome addition to Half-Life series.			"

												Honestly, it IS incredible.Now I remember HL1 when it has only come out and it was splendid. It looked so detailed back there, so long, filled with puzzles and crazy stuff.As far as I remember, when HL Opposing Force came out, it was also praised as an awesome and one hell of an Add-on (yeah no freaking DLCs back there). I remember, I was using cheats since HL was hard (and it still is) and I simply couldn't pass through it otherwise.Now I've finished it honestly with only my skill alone, or should I say.. Survived it. With a constant save/load, trying to stuck as much of the little HP given as possible, using up ALL of the weapons, tools and explosives given, and Honestly, after years of modern shooters with, you know Health Regen, Dumb AI that's standing still and shooting after a huge pause, linear gaming and a hell lot of ammo on round I'm voting for that era of FPS games to be back here.Forget the graphics I was SO concentrated on the action, simply sucked into game, I really couldn't stop. For the first time in YEARS I have finally had challenge, and if you, my friend is still willing to have challenge in the one genre that puts your reflexes and aim to the test, you HAVE to fight through this game. You can either realize what it trully means an old-school way of making FPS games, or you might remind yourself of that wonderful era, when we were really proud of ourselves to get to the title in the end where you sit there relaxed and realizing it's over. No wonder modern FPS can't possibly make you feel the thrill, they don't have the guts for this.			"

												Half Life: Opposing Force is the final expansion pack for the original Half Life but is it worth your time ?Half Life: Opposing Force puts you in the shoes of Corporal Adrian Shepard who is sent into Black Mesa to kill Gordon Freeman and you get to experience the invasion through his eyes.Gameplay is the same as Half Life and Half Life Blue Shift but it adds new stuff to it. You can use the barnacle monster to swing around the environment. Overall apart from that new mechanic and new weapons like the teleportation gun that sends you to a location with ammo, armor and health pick ups.The soundtrack is awesome as always. There are intense music during some of the later firefights and it's awesome. The audio for the bad guys isn't that good but that's too the age of the game. But the music overall is really good.This expansion is really hard even on the normal difficulty. You will have to take things slowly, if you move too fast you will die cause some of levels are insanely hard. Level Design for the most part is alright, there's less of thinking where to go, but it still has many places to explore to find secret stashes of ammo and health pick ups. But some of the levels have very claustrophobic environments that could confuse some players.Half Life Opposing Force took me 5 hours to finish. It's quite short and it's doesn't have much replay value apart from the first playthrough where you will see everything there is to see.The game has a few minor bugs like the enemy AI glitching through walls but overall it doesn't happen too often and there aren't any game breaking bugs that I could find.Overall this is a very good expansion pack compared to Blue Shift. It's longer, adds more stuff and has a better story. Overall If you want the complete Half Life experience than by all means check out Blue Shift and Opposing Force. But if you have to choose one then by all means buy  Opposing Force. I give Half Life: Opposing Force an 8/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												This game is buggy and it crashes. I think this has more to do with the Steampipe version as I don't recall having any issue when I first played this game 10+ years ago. The game crashes when you sometimes load or go back a map meaning that you have to go back to the last autosave at times. There are numerus bugs throughout the game, you often get stuck in lifts and you can get stuck in walls during map translation (although that is also present in HL), furthermore there is a section where the roof of a lift goes through the bottom acting as separate lifts if one part gets blocked. There is one section where a scripted NPC is talking and mid-sentence he says one of the random idle lines and doesn’t finish the scripted line. But more importantly there is a major sound issue right at the end, the volume level of a section of a map is really really high, if you were playing the games moderately loud with headphones this could literally cause pain before you were able to turn the volume down.As for the game itself, the map design doesn’t match that of Half-Life’s. In HL everything was well thought through and everything was in its place, in this things are a bit random. A couple of times there are scripted sequences that open up your path, these are obvious and makes the game fell scripted. There are reused sections from HL, although these have been altered and are not meant to be the same place as the ones visited in the original, there is even one section that seemed to be reference to a map in HL but it was evidently different and happened after another map, where that map happened first in the original. In addition there is not much of a story, at all.The same can be said for the enemies, they are uninspired, overpowered and are just there to be something new. Valve cut a lot of content from the original because it wasn’t that great, Gearbox hasn’t seemed to have done that. A lot of the enemies are just not that fun to fight, and furthermore the use of the Black Ops in the original was infrequent, because they were much more powerful than the grunts. In this, they are used way too often, although most don’t go invisible. But ultimately Gearbox was just using an enemy that wasn’t used that much in the original, instead of what they should have done is create new human enemies, perhaps Black Mesa security forces or something. The use of the new aliens and overuse of the Black Ops was just an easy way to make the game seem different to the original, a lot of really good enemies were not used purely because they were used in the original.The same can be said for the weapons, a lot of really good weapons from the original are not there and instead you have gimmicks and there are far too many of them. Furthermore there are way too many weapons that have regenerating ammo, once you get them you need never use bullets. There is a reason why Valve cut a lot of weapons from HL2, a methodology that Gearbox did not get.But ultimately, this is not Half-Life, this was not made by Valve. It was a quick expansion made by Gearbox for those who liked the original. Considering that it is still a good game, it is not anywhere good as the original, but that’s more because of how good the original is. The design of the maps, weapons and enemies are uninspired, but it is still a Half-Life expansion, so it’s ok.			"

												You know that this contribution to the Half-Life legacy isn't gonna be TOO serious when your opening cut scene features a military dude doing an R. Lee Ermey impersonation, right before he gets unceremoniously sucked out of an airplane.  It IS official Valve product, though, so while it's one of the ""lighter"" - and arguably less ""essential"" - forays into the Half-Life universe, it's still a very high-quality product by the standards of not only first-person shooters, but indeed video games as a whole.  Sure it's dated more than a tad - especially graphics and sound-wise - but the gameplay is still very much there, and the story ain't half-bad neither.  The word ""solid"" definitely comes to mind...and then some.      Maybe not the best place to start your FPS training - that'd be more like Half-Life itself, dare I say! - but obviously highly recommended to fans of the original who crave more.  It delivers, plain-and-simple, in a way which a far more recent ""mod"" like Wilson Chronicles - look it up (no, wait, don't bother) - does not.  Clever mapping, light-yet-interesting puzzles, crazy weaponry and gadgets, satisfying combat...it's all here.  An absolute steal at five dollars, really... Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												A fine expansion. It builds upon the legendary HL gameplay (Run. Think. Shoot. Live.) and expands it with a myriad of new weapons, including many exotic ones, and many new enemies, mainly the menacing Race X. They will shoot you with lightning, poisonous darts and discharges of energy. Hazard Course was changed for a glorious Boot Camp where many drill sergeants (stereotyped after the film Full Metal Jacket) will degrade you to dirt bags, maggots and other derogatory existences. The game possesses a brilliant minimalistic soundtrack very different from the original Half-Life. AI is still quite buggy, doesn't like to follow you, gets stuck. There is no crowbar, all weapons were changed visually and functionally. There are many original features like the Barnacle Grapple that will help you latch onto organic objects and ""suck"" your way into them. M-40A1 Sniper Rifle, Shock Roach, Spore Launcher, XV11382, a laser sight Desert Eagle, all new toys. There are a few annoyances like operating the mortar and music stopping after loading. If you liked the original Half-Life you will love this.			"

												I was just looking through my games list, and the reviews I've done for games, and realized I left out some important ones. I'm in a bit of a chatty mood, so let's do a few, shall we?HL:OpFor is an expantion pack for Half Life. It was sold along with Blue Shift back when CDs were still a thing. I bought it WAY back when. Opposing Force puts you into the character of Colonel Sheppard, one of the many Special Forces guys running around in Half Life. Some have argued whether or not Opposing Force(and, by extention, Blue Shift) are ""Half Life Canon""... I would say that they are, as they add to the story of Half Life without conflicting with it. The fact that you see Gordon Freeman for a moment puts you right into the original story, even if you're technically walking along side of it. There isn't much in the way of ""new content"", but what IS there, works well within the Half Life universe. Your goal is to escape Black Mesa with your life intact, after you've been left behind. While shorter than the original Half Life, it is still a lot of fun to play, even after several run throughs.			"

												An excellent expansion pack from developer Gearbox! I wonder how many of us still know what expansions were... nowadays these extra stories would come in the form of DLCs not an expansion pack. It meant to indicate a longer story and this is definitely a bigger pack than a dlc which can be a single weapon or a new costume for a character in the game.In any case, Opposing Force puts us in the shoes of a corporal, a certain Adrian Shepard, who - along with his fellow soldiers - is sent to neutralise the enemies invading the Black Mesa facility. As expected, things go awry and you are alone facing the good-old aliens. There is a new assortment of weapons, new enemies and new music. Oh, and there are fat security officers helping you!By the way: the game comes with widescreen settings and vsync can be switched on! Just excellent!A relatively long and challenging expansion pack that comes very cheap. It did age a lot throughout the 15 years but it is still a great game... at least for reminiscing purposes.

												Opposing Force is the first expansion pack of the two that were released for Half-Life on PC. Both expansions were developed by Gearbox and got support from Valve. When I first found out that the expansion packs for Half-Life were developed by Gearbox I was quite amazed. Around that time, there was a lot of drama surrounding Duke Nukem Forever and Aliens: Colonial Marines, so I was amazed that in the past Gearbox had the honor to make expansions for a game classic like Half-Life. In this expansion you experience the story of Half-Life from the perspective of a soldier. You are going to Black Mesa, and your aircraft crashes. You wake up and don't know what is really going on and what the mission is. The game itself is pretty hard for me to curate, because it all just feels and plays the same as the original game. (With the expansion having half the length of the original game.) The new features are some different weapons and enemies, both of which are creatively implemented.  The only new feature that I didn't think was all that well executed was the nightvision goggles. They looked cool at first, but they sadly only really work in short distance. This expansion takes place in Black Mesa for the most part, not much time is spent in alien dimensions. At the beginning, I had the feeling that the weapons were a little bit more balanced than in the original game. Because I found myself using the shotgun more often. Still there are some new weapons that I almost never used. What I found special about Opposing Force is that I could see that Gearbox added some more humor in the expansion than what there was in the original Half-Life itself. I still have to say that the story in my opinion didn't really add too much to what we already knew from Half-Life, but it is still fun to see it from their perspective.The nitpick I have though is that the thing I loved about Half-Life is that there never really was a moment of standing still where you are forced to listen to someone. Opposing Force had that happen twice, sadly. This was pretty annoying when I died a few times at one of those points. (I recommend quick saving directly after you are done waiting) Throughout the expansions there were some nice references and they shared the same moments with the original Half-Life timeline.The gameplay is the same mixture of shooting and exploration, just like in the original. The beginning first felt a little dull but then the game started to pick up. I especially liked the shooting at some parts, even though I hated one of the new alien enemies who in my opinion was just really annoying, an enemy which requires too much ammo to take down and does too much damage.  Opposing Force might not be as good as Half-Life, but in my opinion it is still worth to play it if you want to have more of the same Half-Life gameplay.Reviews of the other Half-Life games:Half-LifeHalf-Life: Blue ShiftHalf-Life 2 "

												Opposing Force, the 1st of the three Gearbox expansions for Half-Life, re-tells the story of the Black Mesa Incident from HECU marine Adrian Shephard's perspective. Adding a plethora of new content like Race X (not to be confused with Xen creatures,) and additional weapons; Opposing Force offers an enjoyable yet distinct experience, albeit with somewhat muddled level design.

I don't want to spoil the story anymore play this game and discover for yourself ;)Let's jump to pros and consPros:+Extremely Challenging+Hard to beat the enemies (even on easy difficulty)+Variety of weapons (About 14-15)+Amazing Graphics (For a video game that was developed in 1999)+Nice Gameplay+The game is challenging you won't be able to beat this game easily in Short It's not your average run and shoot game instead of hunting down waves after waves of enemies there are a lot of puzzles in the game you have to solve in order to proceed to next level only intelligent people are able to do so (Seriously)+Great soundtracks+Physics is perfect (almost)+Maps are very detailed (for a game developed in GoldSrc Engine)+Variety of weapons (about 13-15)+Hard to beat enemies+Great Environment (The feeling of being alone and surrounded by enemies from all sides)+Mod SupportCons:-Extremely Buggy (It was difficult to complete the game I had to keep loading the same save file over and over again at some levels for example:-sometimes a door won't open,npcs wont respond,buttons wont work but loading the save file again would solve the problem xD)-Multiplayer is ALMOST dead-A VERY SHORT storyOverall Rating:-7.5/10Although I did enjoy this game but due its short story I recommend you to buy it during the sale it doesn't deserve $5			"

												Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack for Valve Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game Half-Life.  The game was developed by Gearbox Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment, it was released on November 19 1999 Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half-Life. Opposing Force returns to the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the perspective of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game. The you take on the role of, Adrian Shephard, who is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility when a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units. As an expansion pack for Half-Life, Opposing Force is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Opposing Force does not significantly differ from that of Half-Life: you are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. There are also a lot of new weapons for use in single player and multiplayer, again you see everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains in control of the character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Multiplayer, well lets just say it's the same as the original Half-Life's but this time every map from the original game are in this one!. The HD pack is compatable with this too with a lot of new weapons and maps in the multiplayer, I played LAN with one of my friends and thought it was like an updated Half Life multiplayer. Overall I would rate this game a 9/10 brilliant story and multiplayer, I am absolutely 100% sure that Half-Life Opposing Force will absolutely blow you away!			"

												Opposing Force was the good expansion for Half-Life. It updated the graphics nicely, added many new weapons and provided an interesting perspective on the whole Black Mesa incident.In Opposing Force you play the role of Adrian Shepard, a soldier sent to clean up the Black Mesa incident and ensure that nothing gets out. However, as with all things related to the Black Mesa facility, everything that can go wrong does go wrong and you'll soon find yourself on the losing side of a battle against increasingly powerful aliens hellbent on conquering earth and government elite troops sent to clean up you.In terms of gameplay you will explore many new places in the Black Mesa facility however you will also often find yourself treading familiar paths and will even catch a glimpse of the Freeman himself on occasion.All in all Opposing Force provides an interesting view of the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of one of Gordon Freeman's enemies and helps explain a lot of things they didn't fully cover in the original. Definitely worth a play for any fans of the original.			"

												Probably the best expansion ever.The fact that it adds a bit of tacticality to the game with the whole squad classes thing like a medic to heal you, a grunt to help you with killing stuff and an engineer to open locked up doors.Its full of pumping action and its fast paced which while it might make you fustrated, it does give you this feeling of intensity with the music and all.Just get it.And do get it on sale with the other half life games.Or just get them all.They are all amazing.

												Opposing the ForcesHalf life, which I used to pass the time again and again, is still my favorite FPS game. There are many reasons for that (including countless LAN parties in my teenage years), but the thing is, only recently, and thanks to my friend who  bought me HL pack, I've discovered that apart from Blue Shift, (which I personaly call The Blue Sh*t) there has been another expansion. This time more interesting, since we get to see the Black Mesa events from perspective of a Solider. After beating the game, I decided to share my thoughts on it.1. The Lord is our Shephard. - The main character, the idea of the gameShephard. Well that's basically who our protagonist is, just like in the first HL, we play the part of the people's hero, leading the frightened flock through the dangers of the warzone that the Black Mesa compound has become. Groups of two, three soliders can be found scattered along the whole game. I think it's a good idea to view the original HL story from a different perspective. The point of view is the key here, for it gives greater insight to certain things, like: - Humanizing the Grunts, whom, in the first HL we understandably percive as an evil force, not very much different from the aliens from Xen. Here, we realise they are just pawns, placed in a similar position to the BM personnel. - Outside of Black Mesa, we get to see what happens on a larger scale, exploring the military grounds.- We revisit certain places, like the laboratory in which Freeman teleports to Xen, and get to see what happens then.The entire storyline follows in the wake of Gordon Freeman, so it has a nice feeling to it, for the players who enjoyed the plot of the original game.2. Panta Rhei - What's different from the original HLI must say I'm not a fan of the changes to the armory, or for that matter, to the way we can fight here. Some of the weapon options recived a failry mirrored replacement, like the Colt Python. Some, in fact about a half, remained unchanged - Glock 9mm, the HK MP5, Spas-12, and RPG. The new weapons include three alien biological weapons, which are very ammo efficient since each of them posesses a way of replenishing the ammunition indefinitely. I don't like their concepts however, since for me, they don't serve any purpose in expanding our combat possibilities (except for the melee weapon, but it's nearly impossible to use in serious combat, due to it's nature). I don't understand the replacement of the crowbar. It has been devided into two weapons - Pipe Wrench, which has 2 attack modes (a normal hit and a loaded attack which takes 3 seconds to fully load) and a knife, quick and low damage/range weapon. For me, the crowbar was perfect. After getting the glock I barely even used the wrench, since there is plenty of 9mm ammo everywhere, despite playing on Hard difficulty. The explosives remain unchanged. We get the granades, Laser Tripmines and Satchel Charges. More new weapons include Sniper Rifle, Heavy Machinegun or an experimental Displacer Cannon.Casual, Casual.. ehh. C'mon, the three best weapons of the series, being (in my humble opinion) The Crowbar, The Crossbow and The Gauss Riffle, are gone. What fun is there in slashing Xen'ians with a regular knife?The enemies are also different, considerably tougher and more challanging than in the first HL, altough less fun in my opinion. We hardly see any zombies or headcrabs. We mostly battle organised Xen soliders and their.. warmachines?3. Nihil novi sub sole - So what is this game all aboutIt's Half Life. Reskinned, rearranged, rewritten. But it's all the same. The ideas were eaten, chewed and spat out in a mixture of green paint. I like the game, I really do. It's just - we don't do anything new (oh ok except for using a rope two times). Literally. It's all crawling through the pipes, trying to figure out how to get out of old storage-like places, fighting, jumping. There is no new element. We don't even have a chance, despite being a Corporal, to actually implement this element, for commanding people or anything. We just run around exactly like Gordon did, and fight a war we don't understand. there is one thing worthy of mentioning here though - The game passes on, and even expands the element which is one of the reasons for my deep affection for the first HL, this being the nessecity of strategic usage of the enviorment. There are situations and places in which you have to actually figure out what to do. In most of today's games you are given a minimap that shows you where to go. These games explain, step by step, what button to touch and what wire to cut. In this series you've got to rely on your instinct, and that's awesome.4. Leave a light on for me - More about concepts, changes and the gameAm I the only person who hates the night vision? Man, it's such a terrible concept. I understand that we play a solider and military has to possess some high tech, but damn. You (or at least I) can hardly even see anything in this green light, even in the dark. I'd like a regular flashlight instead, please. What's the deal - couldn't they just leave the flashlight AND add the night vision? If they could implement 3 melee weapons, why not 2 light variants? I know not. Besides, there are like 3 or 4 places in the game where it actually comes in handy. Let's say HL has way more to do with a solid horror climate, where you had to use the flashlight actually more than the pistol and the battery was almost always red. The game is too long. Most of the locations are artificially stretched by repetition. In my opinion the game could be reduced to the 60% of its current length and still have the same, if not the better impact. By the way - there are hardly any bosses here, the ones that do exist are reused HL 1 bosses or boss ideas. Sad. Also, what the hell is with this Displacer Cannon's secondary fire mode? So we can basically teleport to safety at any moment we just need ammo. Did I mention that I hated the Night Vision?5. Too much love will kill you - my final opinionThe game is decent, overall. It lacks some elements of the original HL atmosphere, which made it a hit, but perhaps it was meant to be this way. Despite playing as a solider I almost haven't felt the military spirit in the process, except for some parts when the combat music carried us. As I mentioned earlier the action is stretched like granny's breasts. There were moments where I've felt like I was meeting some kind of a Force Opposing my completion of the level. Oh, lest I forget - my ultimate complaint. The game was way too easy. Playing on the Hard difficulty, through the most of the game, save for perhaps two last chapters, I was running around will full health... and armor. For old HL veterans this must sound like a blasphemy since HEV armor was hard to come by in HL 1. There are also way too many medpacks in this game. Well perhaps I am tainted with my multiplayer experience. Anyways, I recommend this game, adding 0.5 to my original score, for the sentiment towards the series.Half Life: Opposing Force - 6.5 / 10Proxym 2014			"

												Amazing 1st expansion to the notoriously great Half-Life. Brand new storyline that ties into the original. The rest of this review will contain spoilers. You are Adrian Shepard, a marine whose mission in the beginning is unknown. We eventually find out it's to kill Gordon Freeman. You crash into Black Mesa, and near the beginning (I forget if it's like the third chapter or something) you hear a scientist say ""Hurry up Gordon, I can't keep it open any longer!"" And we run into Gordon Freeman in the flesh. Spoiler mode: deactivated. The two storylines intertwine to make this whole complex thing that is hard to keep up with. But, keep an open mind and pay attention, and you just might get it. Opposing Force has everything Half-Life has to offer, and then some, such as new weapons, new survival tactics, and new enemies. I wouldn't be able to decide which one of the two is better, but I do know some people who chose this game, even though it's shorter. I don't know. Purchase and play it, and maybe you'll be one of those people.			"

It's a good extension and is worth giving a try if you liked HL1, as it brings a few new elements (weapons, some new gameplay possibilities like interaction with props) and it's always good to meet again these stupid Rambo sounding soldiers.

Eventualmente ele acaba se separando de seu grupo e tendo que lutar pela sobrevivência, contando com a ajuda não só de outros marines deixados para trás, como também de seguranças e cientistas que ele encontra pelo caminho. Aqui é apresentado ao jogador uma nova raça de alienígenas e complementa o que é contado no primeiro jogo. Assim, você vai encontrar novos inimigos e terá mais opções de armas, além de visitar outros setores da Black Mesa.

												Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack made by Gearbox. While you play as Gordon Freeman in the original game, this time around you take control of a marine called Adrian Shephard. Gearbox showed their creativity in this game and added a lot of weapons, new aliens, zombified marines, ropes and a glorious knife.++ It adds new things to the Half-Life universe+ Nods to the first Half-Life game+ Interesting puzzles+ Good maps+ Health packs+ Many weapons to choose from- Like it's predecessor the final boss is bad.- No subtitles and the voice acting is hit or miss- Dumb friendly AI- dated weapon soundsI'd recommend buying Opposing Force if you liked playing Half-Life 1 and want to see the Black Mesa Incident from a marine's point of view.

												In Half Life: Opposing Force you play as Adrian Sheperd, a man part of the ""opposing force"" in Half Life, rather than playing as Gordon Freeman.I like playing as Adrian Sheperd as his perspective of the Black Mesa incident is interesting. The new weapons introduced in the game were a great addition and I also liked the night vision goggles. In Half Life I found myself having to look at a guide at some bits in the game as I wouldn't know what to do or where to go next but I didn't find that problem in Half Life: Opposing Force.The game was a bit short however, but that's to be expected as originally this game was an expansion to Half Life. I also found the storyline to be very straightfoward and not as compelling to Half Life's story. Although I did like the ending to Half Life Opposing Force and would like to  see what the G-Man does with Adrian Sheperd in a future Half Life game (if another Half Life even comes out) Overall I'd give this game a solid 8/10Also there's an epic Full Metal Jacket reference			"

												When you're tasked with following up a hit 3D Shooter, the correct(?) decision is to make everything different. Opposing Force is the standout Half-Life expansion with its bevy of original content. New weapons, enemies, and a new squadmate mechanic make this game a very different experience from the first one. How well it matches up to the original's quality is questionable however. Opposing Force is a decidedly quicker experience, forgoing the long introduction and introducing new weapons at a much faster pace. Many of these new weapons, such as the Shock Roach and Desert Eagle, are fun to try out and find the very different niches for them. Because Half-Life in influenced by Quake, Opposing Force adds its own spin on Quake's CTF Flail. Where Opposing Force falls flat is in the squadmate mechanic, where you can command multiple soldiers to serve with you. However due to the narrow corridor-based aspect of the level design, they'll be getting in your way more often than not. Fun story, if less interesting and nuanced than that of the first game.The rope physics are adorably bad.If you have to choose get this over Blue Shift.			"

												Completed Half-Life: Opposing Force.It unfortunately was not that good of a game, Blue Shift was done better than this. The level design is weak all around and the opportunities to wield your larger arsenal are squandered by erratic ammo placement and a weapon with infinite ammo. The worst part are the annoying new Race X Shock Troopers that cut through all human allies/enemies and are bullet sponges if you don't deal headshot damage. They turn potentially large battles into strafing in circles or in and out of cover to avoid losing health that you have no idea if you can replenish or not. The Voltigore is at least designed to be a tank but it is used too often and becomes boring.The weak climax that is the final boss is a great example of how the entire game is sub-par. The Gene Worm has only two attacks, the path there is arbitrary and the entrance to the area is a simple sliding metal door, the official strategy guide is the only source of details that are necessary to understand the importance of killing it, the second floor of the first room of the two-part area has a large square hole that the walkways go around for no reason and serves only to bait the player into taking fall damage, the dialogue of other HECU going there first and dying is only there to explain the use of the rope ladder and strange turrets but is contradicted by how it appears from the portal, the fade-in animation is messed up if you attack it with the shockrifle, and its ability to summon other minor enemies is completely underwhelming.

												Half-Dead Obtuse Triangle is an expansion off of Half-Not Alive. Similar to Blu Shift (key) you play as a character who isn't Gordon and is also followed by the GG-Man. You play as Shepard from the Mass Effect Games before he became an astronaut. He is a colonel in the U.S Military as you begin to fight against White Mesa with a trusty Pipe Wrench, your crow bar 2.0. You soon fight not just Zen enemies, but a competing alien life called X or something.  You also fight Black Ops Soldiers who are pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because they don't share cookies with you and think they're better than you in every way.  You also teleport a lot and don't have to kill scientists. Also, you will shoot a lot of guns. I mean, you go from having the greatest pipe wrench to an Assault Rifle and Shotgun. You end up going to purgatory because GG-Man is the greatest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to ever live.			"

Then it was something amazing, something magic... especially after playing original Half-Life.Boot camp, really I did not like to play boot camps at all, Half-Life and Half-Life: Blue Shift have boring training course, and I mean it. But training mission in Opposing Force is very funny Full Metal Jacket parody. Recruits, drill instructors, soldiers, they were so real. I finished only boot camp, but I already got a lot of positive emotions. You may skip boot camp, but you should not.The game can offer you huge set of new weapons, new enemies and some possibilities. What possibilities? I will not tell ya, because this is spoiler. I can tell only, that these possibilities are absent in original Half-Life.Well, the game is very dynamic and has its own atmosphere. Opposing Force is longer than Blue Shift, but shorter than original Half-Life. In any case you should play this game, if you like good gameplay and plot and do not afraid of old graphics.			"

												Half-Life: Opposing Force is very well made expansion for Half Life. The ideas for the expansion are brilliant. Returning to the same research facility, but this time as Corporal Adrian Shephard, fighting government agents and aliens and wondering if I will meet myself (Gordon Freeman) at some point, if I can change the history, if more will be explained by experiencing it from a different perspective..New enemies, new weapons, eventually an assistance of up to 3  fellow U.S. Marines. Even though I was playing it on medium difficulty as Half Life before, I felt like I was easier passing through the game with almost no moments of frustration.What I didn't like about the expansion was night vision, being stuck in elevator glitch and the final boss fight. The night vision is way too green, which makes the walking in the darkness very unpleasant. Remember to save before you enter elevators or small tunnels. And finally the last boss frustration. I really liked the game, but the final boss took me 2 hours to kill. First I tried to shoot it and there I wasted most of my ammunition so after I figured out what needs to be done, I decided to use Shock Roach to defeat it. They said I just need to repeat all the action several times and it will eventually die. It didn't. This alien weapon is completely uneffective against it. Even though the final fight destroyed the extremely positive feeling I had about the game, I still recommended it. Avoid the frustration. Learn from mistakes of others. Enjoy the expansion!			"

												A perfect add on for the original game, adds a whole new level of understanding and perspective to the events of  Half Life. Worth buying, can't fault the game at all, as it still manages to entertain me as much as it did when I played it for the first time a few years ago, and has continued to do so for other people for years, great games never become ""outdated"" and this game is a truly shining specimen of a classic fps that delivers both action and reflection upon the original game. I urge you to buy it, no Half Life player should think twice before doing so                        10/10			"

												I had no idea when I wrote my Half Life piece that it would be so popular. I believe a whole 0.5 people read it. And as a very unwise company keeps demonstrating; I should push it further and do Opposing Force. For those of you 0.5 people who have guessed it; the company was EA. Shifting from an MIT background to a going-nowhere-in-life background; in this expansion you control Colonel Adrian Shepard and you fight on the side of the jocks, hence the name ‘Opposing Force.’ Well done Valve, well done. You managed to make a clever name out of a scientific term twice now. You should be able to hear me applauding, assuming you have a wild imagination.In a prodigious series of events, Opposing Force tries to topple its predecessor by giving you two melee weapons (neither of which are a crowbar) and letting you have the magnum before the glock. Why? Hell if I know, just remember the astute title.  I’ve played through this one a few times as well and I have noticed something. You happen to be a nice jock and help the nerds. I guess Valve do have a wild imagination. But alas, I must remember the title… again. At this point I’m starting to wonder why everyone assumes the mute is going to save the world. Or maybe they just lead him towards the bad guys because they know he can’t refuse, literally.To summarise, this game has more enemies, more weapons and a shorter campaign like the usual expansion criteria. Nevertheless, I must praise it because it came from the backside of the glorious Gaben. I thought it would take longer to come out though.			"

												Half-Life: Opposing Force is a fantastic continuation of the storyline started in the original Half-Life. Looking back at it, OP4 isn't quite as amazing as HL1, but that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, OP4 is really friggin' awesome.Story: You're Adrian Shephard, a 22 year old marine, or something army-ish. Okay so I'm not really sure what you are, but what's important is you're in HECU, a military...thing that exists to make sure the Black Mesa research facility is safe at all times. After being mysteriously bumped up to corporal (*coughGmancough*) the Black Mesa facility is invaded by aliens. Unbeknownst to Adrian, the HECU are under orders to ""silence"" the facility, meaning they have to kill everything in there, whether it be aliens or scientists, with their sights especially on someone called ""Freeman"" who has been killing all the HECU. A mysterious ""Race X"" is also appearing, a new race of aliens even more powerful than the originals.The story is great. It ties in with the first Half-Life a lot, which is really neat while also including this sense of consistency. The game explains a lot of things from Half-Life, like why the black ops are there, and also makes the HECU become actual characters, as opposed to the mindless grunts they were in HL1. It's full of fun twists and turns as well as being just fun. One flaw, however, is that in HL1 you always had a set thing you were trying to do. Fire a rocket, find the lambda core, defeat the alien master, there was always something. Throughout a lot of OP4, Adrian is just wandering around mindlessly with no real goals and it makes you wonder why he doesn't try to leave instead of constantly going back inside Black Mesa.Gameplay: OP4 introduces plenty of new weapons and enemies while including most things from HL1, meaning it feels fresh and new, but still maintains the ""epic"" feel of HL1 and doesn't change too much. If you didn't like HL1's gameplay then chances are you aren't gonna love OP4. But if you did like HL1 but don't want a total repeat, OP4 is right up your alley. It's new, but not ""too new.""Characters: Although none of the characters are amazing, OP4 does flesh out and explain a lot of characters and groups from HL1. It makes them feel more real, and although no one character stands out as amazing (except you-know-who,) the cast as a whole just seem more real.Graphics: So, uh... this game came out in 1999. As in its graphics aren't exactly amazing. Granted, the new stuff does look better, but still... the game shows its age pretty obviously. If you want a game with good graphics, than look somewhere else. Also, screw you, because graphics don't matter.Music: OP4 has an entirely new soundtrack from HL1, and, honestly, I like it better. The songs are all really good (albeit a little out of place at times,) and they're just fun to listen to. It's not an amazing soundtrack, nothing spectacular that'll really wow you, but it's above average for sure.Replayability: Personally, I think this game is a load of fun and I've played it dozens of times. But technically there aren't any achievements or hidden goodies for you to find on subsequent playthroughs, so if you aren't the kind of person to replay games just because you enjoyed them, there isn't much in replayability here.Conclusion: This game is awesome. It ties into the HL1 series perfectly, and offers loads of fun for anyone that enjoyed the first HL game. Despite dated graphics and not a whole lot of replayability beyond being just a good game, OP4 is a fantastic game and I recommend it to any Half-Life fan.			"

												To be clear, I absolutely do NOT recommend this game for the singleplayer.  It's a shame, because the campaign is something special.  Like Blue Shift, it's a fun expanded-universe take on the original Half-Life, this time from the perspective of the Marines.  As one of the first to be deployed, your helicopter is shot down, and you wake up around the time of ""Forget About Freeman!"" as scientists manage to help you.  When G-Man conspires against you and makes you MIA, you're forced back into Black Mesa facilities on a somewhat short and very entertaining campaign.  Aside from playing as one of the HECU units, you have NVG's, multiple new weapons of all different types, and a variety of new enemies.This sounds, pretty great, right?  Well, it would be... if it worked.  Similar to a certain section of HL1, the pathfinding of escort AI are downright broken with the latest updates.  The AI will drive you insane with its cosntant indecision and inability to follow you even up a single stair.  It's a true test of patience trying to get anything done as the AI immediately decides you're too far the moment you get a centimeter off the ground or more than two feet away from them.  After multiple instances of simply doing my best to put up with it, the game finally stopped sending me these broken escorts, only for it to glitch out on an elevator and get my feet stuck inside.  My game ended there; this gamebreaking bug was something that I simply couldn't work around.  Not even jumping before hitting the bottom could save me from an elevator crash.This is a real letdown, as if it worked as previously I would unquestionably recommend it.  Still, why is it still positive?  MULTIPLAYER.Aside from the once-great campaign is a fully revamped version of Half-Life 1's Deathmatch.  Now including more maps, all the new Op4 weapons, and a TDM mode as well as CTF, Half-Life Opposing Force takes the original Deathmatch game mode and turns it up to 12.  You'll have to work a bit to get friends or fellow HL1 nerds to join you, but it's absolutely worth the trouble for such a fantastic multiplayer game.Aside from AI pathfinding bugs and the aforementioned elevator glitch in the campaign, the engine works very well on modern systems and will run on just about anything that supports OpenGL decently.  Op4 hasn't particularly aged well from a technical standpoint, but it won't stop you from having a great time if you're patient enough to get around its dead community and singleplayer technical problems.

												Oddly enough, I prefer Opposing Force to all the other Half-Life games. I'm not really sure why, but it just *feels* right comparatively. It doesn't feel tedious like Blue Shift, nor does it feel overly long like the original Half-Life (or too short, like Half-Life 2). That's not to say HL1, Blue Shift, or HL2 are bad... it's just that I have more fun playing Opposing Force. Give it a try and maybe you'll understand.			"

												Whee... nostalgia.A spin-off game of the original Half-life made by Gearbox, now better known as the buggers who make the Borderlands games. Instead of playing as the nerd Gordan Freeman, you instead play as one of the lunkhead Marines that you had to fight in the original game. Yey.So what does this change? Not too much. You get options to control some other soldiers at times who help you open doors, heal you, and of course shoot aliens. There are also plenty of new weapons, several of which are rather awesome like the M249 SAW... or whatever it's called. It's a light machine gun, ok? Beyond these little things, there's little to differentiate the game from the original Half-Life, except that you fight far more aliens than humans. And that some of those new aliens are rather nasty.Well, it's also shorter. Alot shorter. I cleaned this out in just under 4 hours, though I had the benefit of past memory that seemed to instantly remember exactly how to get through everything despite not having played this in a decade.Anyway, it's a little extra Half-Life funtimes. Might as well play it if you liked the original game. :o			"

												If you liked Half-life, you will love Opposing Force. You play the character of Corporal Adrian Shepard. Your platoon was among those that stormed Black Mesa after the Resonance Cascade failure. However, you were shot down by some of the alien aircraft and ended up being the sole survivor. You end up having to survive on your wits, a few disgruntled troops, a wisecracking Black Mesa guard, and a whole lot of weapons. I highly recommend this game, as it is part of my favorite series yet, and has a great storyline as well.~Fibcoa7P.S. I would highly suggest playing this in Easy mode unless you are extremely hardcore. Heres why. Half-life: Opposing Force is probably about 5 times harder than the normal Half-life games on Medium difficulty. Unless you want to be extremely frustrated, or are just REALLY good at Half-life, play this one on easy.			"

												This is one of the finest FPS games I've ever played. While Blue Shift was decent at best, this game is downright excellent. It feels right at home for a Half-Life game and is not alienated in any way, shape or form. It has amazing attention to detail and references to the original game feel very natural rather than being forced in to remind you that it's a Half-Life game. The puzzles in the game are challenging enough to be fun, but not on a level like Portal where it makes it the whole focus of the game. I was able to enjoy the new characters just as I did in the original, but there are two flaws with this game. Sometimes absurdley powerful enemys cake the map like an 11 year old's Mario Maker level. The other flaw is that it lacks music in some intense scenes making them a little underwhelming. Nonetheless, it's definetly worth the play.			"

This, along with the original Half-Life would probably fall into my top 20 favorite games of all time.Pros:• Gives you a new perspective of the Black Mesa incident by putting you into the shoes of a H.E.C.U. Marine sent to ""silence"" the BMRF• Loads of new weapons that weren't present in the original Half-Life• Loads of new enemies that weren't present in the original Half-Life• Long-ish storyline that will take you anywhere from 6 to 10 hours to complete fullyCons:• The only con I have for this game, is that when you go past the red tripwire and you have a military buddy following you, he starts firing at youI give it a 9/10All in all, really great game, I'd recommend it.

Tried loading mid-boss battle save and killing boss again but it didn't work, had to watch it on YouTube instead :/ There were also at least 5 occasions where my character got stuck and couldn't move leading me to have to load an earlier save. If you've got the choice between Windows and OS X go for the former, I've noticed in Blue Shift there's s few animation glitches as well (not unplayable, though).			"

It soon turns out that in general chaos everyone fights everyone, including new alien species and black ops soldiers.There are a few new weapons (alien lightning gun, Desert Eagle) and some new features. You get to lead other soldiers with various specialties: engineer who can cut doors, medic who can heal you. You learn to climb ropes and at one point you can use alien technology of grappling gun.Graphics is not great, but it's cool enough and the level design with brilliant color schemes and lighting styles makes up for it.Music sets the mood nicely, especially dynamic themes when something serious is going down.It's 2015 and I definitely enjoyed playing Half-Life: Opposing Force!GAMEPLAY 8/10GRAPHICS 7/10AUDIO 8/10STORY 9/10			"

												Getting my ♥♥♥ down, back with nother nice oldie goodie playing this game brought back some nice memories.Taking the role of an USM army dog going to Black Mesa in order to provide security support. However things do not turn out as planed. You get to see things from another perspective this short but nice story keeps you pumped to the end.A nice change of pace of weapons (using alien ""stuff"" as weapons has never been so much fun in a modless HL game!) Puzzling situations are kept to minimal and the maps are both fun and good looking. You get to see a bit more about the whole Black Mesa buildings and projects. You get the chance to witness the chaos from a different point of view and you get to understend why the hell did these solder shoot at you while playing the first HL game.You can choose on how you can treat both of the sides (US army guys and scientists) and you can get to have multiple (more than 1) followers once again in the game helping you with fire power, healing or door opening actions.Recommended and totally appoved for its age.Cheers!

												A solid story driven first person shooter with puzzles and platforms. Just like all these elements made half life great. However, Opposing force is nowhere near as good as the original title. And the reason is because the level design is  entierly different than valve did, and it's not the linearity like these classic games but there isn't any rewarding hidden objects, weapons and ammo. By instinct I looked out for corners, crates, vent shafts and it didn't really felt like half life for me. Still, this is a classic.			"

(I reccomend you read this one first)Opposing force is very similar to Half-Life, and has you facing a different, but similar group of alien's, as well as some that we have seen from Half-Life. You play as one of the military soldiers that enters Black Mesa, but the twist is that you were never told what you are doing there. There is even a part where you can kill a soldier to save a scientist and get some armor. It introduces new mechanics such as rope climbing, and new puzzles as well. I highly reccomend this game. There are only a few downsides to this game that I did not find in other games. The first is that, despite the training room and the story making you feel like a soldier, and that in Half-Life, you see soldiers everywhere, here you don't see many soldiers that you actually take into combat until about the second half of the game. Even then, you don't work with nearly the amount you fight at once in Half-Life. They also feel the need to put in black-op's soldiers to fight, which I feel is unnecessary (I mean, they have a soldier-like enemy in every HL and HL2 game. I'm more interested in fighting aliens) but it fits. However, I do not understand why you encounter more Black Ops than your own soldiers.  The only other negative side to this game is that the boss fight is way easier than it is in Half-Life, for reasons I will not share here.

												Being quite a lot longer than Blue Shift(had I not speedrun it), this delivers some more insight about the mission of the military at Black Mesa. It was pretty good but I personally think it is the weakest out of the three (Half Life 1 the main game, Blue Shift and this). Still worth playing.			"

												Half-Life: Opposing Force is an excellent expansion for Valve's Half-Life. It gives you a whole new perspective in the game as you play as Adrian Shepard, a member of the military that you encounter as Gordon Freeman in Half-Life. Shepard is given unique firearms to the Half-Life universe, such as the sniper rifle and black hole gun, which were not present in Half-Life. Instead of a hazard course, there is a boot camp which runs the player through the usage of the PCV vest (the counterpart of the HEV suit used by Black Mesa scientists) and brand new weapons, such as the aforementioned sniper rifle with scope, and a modified pistol fitted with a laser sight. Teammates, such as a medic and an engineer, can be used to assist in combat situations by healing Shepard or breaking down locked doors in order to progress. New alien races are battled, and never-before-seen areas of the Black Mesa complex are explored, as well as areas from the original game. A new boss is also present at the end, with a moderately difficult way of defeating it.Gearbox really did an awesome job when making this expansion to the original Half-Life game.10/10			"

												If you've played the original Half-Life, liked it, and don't mind the good-for-1999 graphics, you'll also like Opposing Force.  It keeps the solid core gameplay from the original, but adds in new weapons, enemies, and puzzles - and they really are new puzzles, not just the old ones rearranged.  You'll also see your old nemeses - headcrabs, Vortigaunts, and the like.  A select few scenes from the original are revisited, but for the most part new areas of Black Mesa are explored.  Of particular note is that you can use more small alien specimens against your enemies than just the snarks from the original - and sometimes, this is necessary to succeed.If you haven't played the original Half-Life, you should probably start there, to get the background story for this one.  However, you could jump right in to Opposing Force without playing the original.  Just play the tutorial first, and you'll be okay.  Along the way, non-playable characters will fill you in on what's been going on.  Like the original, the gameplay mechanics are excellent in Opposing Force.  So if you're debating whether to get the original or try this one first at half the price, you can't really go wrong either way.I would consider Opposing Force to have lived up to the quality of the original.  It's shorter, but it's also less expensive, so I wouldn't consider that an issue.			"

												Half-Life Opposing Force is an expansion pack to Half-Life. You play as one of the marines that participates in the Black Mesa Incident (See Half-Life). Although the gameplay is not to different from Half-Life here are some of the things I liked and disliked.Pros:-A more detailed and immersive story (imo)-New types of enemies (Instead of reusing old enemies, although classics like headcrabs are present)-More different character models-New weapons with a mix of old weapons-Nice concept of commanding your own squad-Same fun gameplay as Half-Life-Less platforming sectionsCons:-Squad AI can be wierd some times (Like if you want an enginner to follow you through a door he will sometimes move to the door, and then walk away from you repeatedly)-Not enough medical / H.E.V supplies like the original Half-Life to help you out a bit-Underused mechanics like rope swing-No Half-Life 3Overall, Half-Life Opposing Force is very entertaining if you loved the original Half-Life than you will not be disappointed.

												This expansion-pack was the very first Half Life Game I had every owned. Playing the role as the ""Villian"" HECU Marine sent to silence the events at Black Mesa during Half Life. Adrian Shepard is to find/eliminate Gordan Freeman, (the main Half Life protagonist). As many events go wrong for Cpl. Shepard, he must find his way out of The Black Mesa Research Facility only to end with a brief discussion with the G-Man, a currently mysterious character in the Half Life universe.What got me to still enjoy Half Life: Opposing Force to this day was the Entertaining Gameplay, Expansion to Half Life, Relates to some of the story, and a decent variety of Weapons which can be used throughout the Game.Hopefully Valve will continue to release more Half Life expansions for the future.

												The first of 2 expansions to Half-Life 1. I'd say this one is my favorite.This one is about the length of Episode 2, but adds much more in terms of content value.Opposing Force adds several new weapons and a few new enemies. The Shockroach, M249, and M40A1 are great additions that really gave [the game] a new sense of life, and the Desert Eagle was a fun replacement to the Colt Python seen in the other Half-Life games.In terms of enemies, the Shock Trooper, Voltigore, and Pit Drones are very welcome additions to Xen's aliens, forming part of a new species simply named ""Race X"". They're more powerful than the Vortigaunts and Alien Grunts of the normal game, but are fascinating in their own right. However, Gearbox seems to be the main factor behind their creation, and I hope Valve could have them worked back into the main Half-Life franchise.Overall: A very fun and very deserving expansion into the Half-Life universe. It desperately needs a sequel, and I hope for the return of it's mechanics. 9/10			"

												This is how you make a good expansion pack.While the original Half Life puts you in the role of Gordon Freeman, Opposing Force puts you in the shoes of a conpletely different character during the events of the original game. Instead of being a scientist who is trying to fight for his life, you are now Adrian Shephard, A Corporal rank soldier who, alongside his platoon, has been sent to Black Mesa to clean up the problems that have occured there.And the mission goes to hell pretty damn fast.What was supposes to be a simple clean up mission for Adrian suddenly becomes a similar situation that Gordon had - a fight for survival. If Adrian must endure the madness of Black Mesa, he must adapt to his surroundings, use anything he can get his hands on, rely on those willing enough to help and use his military training plus his own wit to it's full potential. So far, Opposing Force does Half Life justice by sticking with a similar story with a lot of great ideas that contrast very well with it's predecessor, so that it doesn't become too similar.But what about the gameplay? Does it do justice to Half Life too? First off, due to the fact that you are now a Soldier instead of a Black Mesa Employee, there ane new friendly NPCs, who of which are Soldiers, Engineers, and Medics. All of which are a great help and can back each other up. And due to the way the story starts, you won't need to kill the survivors of Black Mesa (which was what the Military was sent for), the security guards and scientists of Black Mesa will still lend you a helping hand throughout the story. When it comes to weapons, sadly not all of the guns and gadgets that were in the original game make it back. However, all of the weapons that haven't made it back have been replaced with new and, surprisingly, BETTER weapons. Remember the Crowbar? You now have a stronger Combat Knife! How about the .357 Magnum? Now a Desert Eagle, which is faster and comes with a Laser sight! All the new weapons are not just replacements though, For instance, there is a new LMG weapon which is an absolute blast to use and feels completely different from the weapons that were in the original. Overall as far as weapons go, Opposing Force gives you more than just new and improved weapons. Heck I didn't even think the weapons needed to be replaced with better ones, seems what wasn't broken got fixed anyway. There are new Enemy NPC's too, and they fit very well into the Half Life Universe, such as a bigger zombie, Alien Shock Troopers and since the Military are on your side now, the enemy soldiers have been replaced with different Human enemies, I won't spoil who they are but they are a worthy replacement, seeing that they were also enemies of a different sort in the original game, now taking over another role. And the Level design is just as superb as the original, but with the inclusion of new weapons and NPCs, we get to see a load of new puzzles and situations that couldn't be done in the original game. Oh! and you can climb and swing on ropes now! Which adds to some cool things! So, as far as Gameplay goes, everything is better.Graphically, yeah I guess it is just as blocky and wooden as the original, but there are some really varied looking levels again, even the training level looks great! The new aliens look fearsome and formiddable. Again Half Life uses real time cutscenes, which is always a treat, not to mention they are well written.When it comes to audio again, the game sounds just as good as the original, the aliens sound angry, the guns are loud, the soundtrack is excellent and the voiceacting is superb. Soldiers now have different voice lines as well as a different voice actor  since they are now on your side, but they are a joy to hear... in a cheesy Star Fox sorta way. ""MAN MY DOGS ARE BARKIN'!""But is there anything wrong with Half Life: Opposing Force? Sadly, there are a few issues. First off, the glitch that can get you stuck in the level terrain is still present, but again it doesn't happen very often. And... as much as I hate saying it, due to the fact you can get more teammates with more aggresive firepower, the remarkable AI from the original starts to show some of it's issues. For example, Sometimes, soldiers will not realise to stop shooting when the player is in their way of the enemy target, they'll even shoot if the player hasn't walked in the way and was already standing there, if I recall. Another little nitpick I have is that friendly Medics don't heal their own wounded teammates. However, the AI is still great, especially the enemy AI, as it's still relentless as it was in the original game. My last major gripe is the end boss, although was a bit challenging, I thought it was a bit too straight forward compared to the original.Tl;dr, Half Life: Opposing Force does justice to it's predecessor and is possibly one of the best Expansion packs I have ever had the joy of playing, and for an Expansion pack to add so much to an already perfect game is mesmarising. I may as well consider it a separate game from it's predecessor. Not only that, this was technically Gearbox Sofware's first ever project, and  considering how well made Opposing Force was, it was one hell of a way to start them off into the gaming industry. If you enjoyed Half Life, buy it. If you never played Half Life, buy it anyway!			"

												The only game capable of win with Half-Life. Has everything HL has, but adds more weapons, more enemies, more maps… More everything! The only thing it lacks is flashlight. Instead it is replaced with nightvision similar to this present in Counter-Strike and it is nowhere as useful as classic white light and even though without it it would be much harder to bypass voltigores-filled tunnels, going there with just a flashlight could be much more frightening. But I can understand it, it works great as sniper marker and it would be too easy to see creatures in darkness.Overall, a must-have for great singleplayer and still active multiplayer.

												Compared to Half-Life 1 and Blue Shift, Opposing Force is easily the most unique of hte HL1 series. Unlike Blue Shift there are new enemies to fight, new weapons to use (I love me that laser-sight Desert Eagle) and a new insight of one of the warring factions duking it out in Black Mesa, introducing a new faction called Race-X to balance it all out. The jumping puzzles are exactly what one would expect from Half-Life, level design is mostly the same as well, but fresh new content keeps the experience unique and gives Opposing Force the thing that Blue Shift didn't have, the feeling that you were actually playing a different game.

												An expansion pack to the original Half Life, it lets you play as the guys Gordon was shooting at for almost half the game. It's pretty damn fun, assuming you like the way Half-Life plays, and offers rare insight into the viewpoint of the generic enemy mook we've been mowing down in waves since 1995. Beloved enough that people are attempting to make it's own version of Black Mesa, it's a good game so long as you don't care too much about graphics or a few missing gameplay mechanics. Oh and you can use a Barnacle as a grappling hook, so that's always nice.			"

												Opposing Force was the only expansion pack to Half-Life that was really crtically acclaimed, and there's a good reason for that. To get this out of the way: this is a full game, not a short ripoff, and it remains Gearbox's best game to date in my opinion. Not only does it rival the original game, it remains a strong candidate for the best Half-Life game ever made. It's hard to believe that typically with an expansion pack, and the fact that was developed by another team just makes it even more unfathomable. However, Opposing Force gets everything right with Half-Life. Usually expansion packs don't end up being too special. They often do little else than add more content to a pre-existing game. Stand-alone expansions tend to fare better. Other examples of this type besides Opposing Force include Halo 3: ODST and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Opposing Force doesn't screw up anything. The puzzle solving elements are still great. The platforming elements are still great. What it ultimately improves on besides just the visuals, and this is the main reason why it's so great, is combat and pacing. All of the new weapons are fun to use. There is not a single moment in this game that lacks tension or feels off, and in the end although it stands on its own it gets tied together with Half-Life very cohesively. This is what an expansion pack should be in a perfect world: something that goes beyond what it's expanding upon. And although most don't, this is an exception.			"

												Here's my review for Half-Life: Opposing Force. 1st (standalone) expansion to Half-Life.Shall we began.GameplayIt's mostly same as it was in half-life 1 but improved as well alot more variety between weapon's then the original. Many  puzzling element's here and between. quick thinking required. and did i mention that you can shoot whoever you want? Ya you can do that it shoot the scientist's. shoot your fellow marines's. shoot that guard.GraphicsI can safely say best for it's time, Still very playable till now while other game's for it's time aren't. Only few graphical option's resolution and only a few bit more. But come on guy's it was 1999 okay.StoryIt take's in the same place (black mesa) but this time around you aren't a scientist no no no this time you are soldier hell ya baby. Joke's aside it's just great and put's you in the perspective of  Adrian Shephard,  U.S. Marine Corporal. You are sent to black mesa with your fellow marine's by the goverment to eliminate all threat's and silence the facility . The game occurs  after the incident  has already happend and you also get to see more off what happen's when the whole facility is destoryed. And no cut scenes here between event's same as the original half-life.SoundtrackWell there aren't many and no music in the menu as well. But still there are some and they are good.AiNot much to say here.

												For a game made during the first stage of Valve's series, it holds up fine, and fits in with the rest of the other half lives made during this time (Half life, and Half life Blue Shift) I would recommend you buy the ""Half life complete"" Pack, if you want all of 'em, you'll save money.That's not to say this doesn't work on its own, it's able to get into interesting gameplay, it's just better when you have the rest of the games made during this time period (Said games I already mentioned) it's able to give you a plot you can follow, and a training mode that, well, actually trains you for the game.In all, the graphics are the same as the other half lives released, and the gameplay is too, (Modified a tad) I recommend it to those who enjoy all of the other games in the half life saga (NOT counting Deathmatch) as it focuses on story as much as gameplay and fighting. If you enjoyed half life 1, or half life blue shift, this should fit right into the spirit of its game-sibilings.			"

												Here's my review for Half-Life: Opposing Force. 1st (standalone) expansion to Half-Life.Shall we began.GameplayIt's mostly same as it was in half-life 1 but improved as well alot more variety between weapon's then the original. Many  puzzling element's here and between. quick thinking required. and did i mention that you can shoot whoever you want? Ya you can do that it shoot the scientist's. shoot your fellow marines's. shoot that guard.GraphicsI can safely say best for it's time, Still very playable till now while other game's for it's time aren't. Only few graphical option's resolution and only a few bit more. But come on guy's it was 1999 okay.StoryIt take's in the same place (black mesa) but this time around you aren't a scientist no no no this time you are soldier hell ya baby. Joke's aside it's just great and put's you in the perspective of  Adrian Shephard,  U.S. Marine Corporal. You are sent to black mesa with your fellow marine's by the goverment to eliminate all threat's and silence the facility . The game occurs  after the incident  has already happend and you also get to see more off what happen's when the whole facility is destoryed. And no cut scenes here between event's same as the original half-life.SoundtrackWell there aren't many and no music in the menu as well. But still there are some and they are good.AiNot much to say here. Mostly same as it was in the original half-life which was pretty good so mostly it's the same here.Amount of play timeMore than 5 hour's. Very significant for a (standalone) expansion and the price alone.ConlusionSurely i fully reccomend you buy this gem if you are into half-life at all. For the price being only $4.99 dollar's i'd say get it.A worthy (standalone) expansion to the half life universe.

												Half Life Opposing Force is a 1999 Expansion of Valve's Half Life, In this ""Retelling"" of the infamous Black Mesa incident a manmade catastrophe that took place in some vague timespan between 2000 to 2009 AD and would ultimately pave the way for Earth's invasion by the Universal Union or ""Combine""  during the seven hour war mentioned in Half Life 2. You play the game via the eye's of one Corporal Adrian Shephard a member of an fictional special forces unit within the United States military. The game starts with you and your ""stars n stripes"" squadmates already in the air over the desert surrounding Black Mesa debating what the purpose of their deployment is only to be shot down by alien aircraft. You wake up in an infirmary a few hours later to learn that the military incursion as seen towards the second ""Half"" of Half Life was failing and the high brass has ordered all personell to abandon the base. You make your way to the evacuation sight only to be stopped by the nefarious ""Gman"" who sees to it that you do not leave the base with your fellow soldiers. As the game continues on you encounter another military unit however this one unlike your fellow HECU marines are hostile. These are the ""Black Ops"" as their name suggests they are a Black Operations unit sent in to finish the job the HECU failed to do which was to contain the base by ""Any means possible"" in this case the Black Ops have brought along a nuclear bomb  to destroy the compound and anything in it. Aside from the Black Ops theres also the ""Race X"" aliens a new group of hostille species tunneling their way to our lovely Earth in the ""Last hours"" of the resonance cascade. At the climax of the game you battle the Race X's ""Biggest and baddest"" member the ""Gene worm"" a gigantic monstrosity that according to the official Prima guide was sent to ""Terraform"" Earth hoewever you manage to defeat this thing before it can do its thing it exploding in a burst of portal energy similar to the boss fight of the first game. You awaken on a V-22 with the gman who promptly tells you that you have seen to much and you will be ""detained"" until further notice. Adrian Shephard has yet to show his face since his 1999 debut in the series and due to Valve's more recent titles suchas Team Fortress 2 Dota 2 and CS:GO it is unlikely he or ""Any"" of the actual Half Life cast will be shown in a future title. overall this game is one of my favorites in this series. My only wish is that gearbox had made more of these expansions aside this Blue Shift and the PS2 expansion ""Decay"" I give it an 9.5/10			"

												Half-Life: Opposing Force -This game is an expansion of the original Half-Life. Its content will amount to, or at least in my experience, about half (punny) the play-time of Half-Life. It follows a different character, from, you guessed it, the opposing force. Going into this expansion I didn't think it would be at long as it was. So, it tended to drag on a bit around the middle. The gameplay is the same as Half-Life, but you get more weapons and other items. I had tons of fun with this expansion. If you are going to play Half-Life, I think you need to play this expansion, and the next (Blue Shift).I had one big problem at the end of the game, though. From what I hear, it's a pretty common glitch, but I had just beaten the final boss. Instead of fading away (like it should), it disappeared, and I was left wandering around, wondering what to do. You are supposed to be transported to the final scene of the game, but that didn't happen for me. Not sure if it was my version, or my platform or what. Thanks to the Steam ommunity I found a code to put into the console that sends you to the coorrect scene. :DAnyway, one big glitch near the end aside, this is a great expansion and worth the money (even more so if on sale). the story is interesting, and Half-Life fans will really enjoy it.

												Now it is time to review the next installment of the crowbar simulator, the 1999 version... Wait... There is no crowbar in this game? Then how can it be the next installment of the world's most famous crowbar simulator??!! no it must be the wrong game... No you say? The crowbar is replaced with a Pipe Wrench and a combat knife? that is just great, it is already going to be my favourite game of all time *thick sarcasm*Well let's jam!//I have to say that I have played Blue shift, in my opinion when it comes to new content and so on, Opposing force is way too superior compared to blueshift//Half-life: opposing forces is the first expansion of the original game which ""supposedly"" flips the game upside down. Well let just be honest, this expansion is very much like the original half-life just without any crowbar and other weapons like the hivegun, some new weapons, new monsters and probably lacking some bits compared to the original game. But is it still fun? I would say yes :) Even though this one probably misses some more plot compared to half-life(Which already had a little plot) then it would  probably still satisfy your craving when finishing the original one.This game is only recommend if!- IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THROUGH THE ORIGINAL HALF-LIFE'S SINGLEPLAYER- You do not mind an old game with old ""ugly"" grafic, glitches and somewhat buggy AI.- If you love the half-life franchies and want to know more because this one gives some more hints to the original game.- you like a FPS game with some puzzle elements(just like the original game this one does not give you the glues straight ahead when it comes to the ""puzzles"" and the plot itself)The killers of the game.- The plot itself was more lacking than the original and with lesser hints of what is going on like what is the x-race and so on.- Even though I loved some of the new weapons I must say that the M249 SAW was way!!!! too!!! powerful. Either they should have provided with less ammo or something else  because even on hard difficulty it was way too easy with this weapon.- NO CROWBAR!!!- The game just like the original is filled with glitches here and there where you can get stuck weird places especially loading scenes.- The AI is not that great, still gives some challenge, but often you can sneak kill them.The Sunshines of the game- IT IS HALFLIFE...- Some of the new weapons were quite interesting especially the living ones :3 so kawaii!- It gives more interesting details about the g-man and there are some quite interesting encounters - Some quite interesting new creatures compared to the original one.- The game is really good to make a real connection to the original one, you even get to see Morgan Freeman. :)The game itself did not bring that much new to the table, yes some new monsters, new weapons, soldiers which you can ""control"", use and loot when you have led them to their death :P. But the game seemed to be too easy and missing more to the story line throughout the gameplay.But in the end it was still fun to play and totally worth it when you meet G-man and get more hints and details about the mystery of the half-life franchies.But if you are not a really great fan of half-life and old FPS games then pass on.

												A neat little expansion/side story to the original Half-Life game.If you haven't played Half-Life before then you should look at that game first. Maybe even get the bundle since it's cheaper.Half-Life IS almost(over) 20 years old though, so keep that in mind when judging the graphics. The controls and physics on the other hand have aged very nicely and are user-friendly. I highly recommend it. Unless of course 50 or 100+ years have passed since writing this. Then I'd have no way of knowing how well the game's controls have aged. They were insanely good and comfortable for it's time though. I can say at least that much with certainty!			"

												Half-Life: Opposing Force was a surprising adventure for me. Having played and fallen in love with the rest of the franchise almost immediately, I had never gone into a Half-Life game with an air of skepticism. And here's what I think (I'll keep it quick to avoid TL;DR's):For anyone familiar with Half-Life, the gameplay is similarly fast-paced and exciting. However, I was impressed with the addition of new mechanics that made the game an entirely different experience. This expansion of the Half-Life universe boasts new enemies, environments, and TONS of weapons. It is shorter than Half-Life, but a lot is crammed into the time that you get. Playing as HECU Grunt Adrian Shepherd is a fresh and different experience from Half-Life. However, I do have one minor caution for anyone new to the series: This game is pretty difficult. The same could be said of Half-Life 1, considering they are both older games, but Opposing Force has some moments where things may take a dip into the frustrating part of the spectrum. So quicksave a lot, newbies.			"

												This was my first Half-Life game I ever owned and we're still on pretty good terms. In this game you play as Corporal Adrian German Shepherd Dog, who is a 22 year-old US Marine ready to get out there and kick some tail. With a training camp that could've ended up like the beginning of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, you instead prep up for an on-the-double military response call, only to be attacked by aliens on the way in, wiping out your platoon in the war zone that is the Black Mesa science facility. The mission is called off, and the US Marines are left to survive on their own. It's up to Adrian to survive against lots of spooky aliens and make his mark as a young, out-standing American citizen while escaping Black Mesa, using cool alien bio-weapons or sciencey gizmos that make you feel like the coolest kid on this side of the black stump!I love every Half-Life game, but something about this one sticks out to me a lot!

												I haven't expected a lot new things from this expansion. Just additional hours of duct crawling and shooting.It is true at first. You just get climbable ropes, new type of helpers and guns.However as the story unfolds you really appreciate the ""second view"" thing, and I'm not talking only about revisiting old locations and Gordon Freeman appearances. I don't want to reveal too much but let's just say playing Opposing Force you suddenly realize from where some Half Life 2 and even Portal things came from. I haven't expected the story to be so much related to previous and future Half Life games because the development was outsourced to Gearbox Software   (Borderlands series).Corporal Shephard rather fights than brains his way through obstacles so the arsenal is pushed to the limit, both conventional and weird weapons. Flashlight is replaced with night vision goggles. This allows to keep fighting in pitch black areas. So it is still the same 'ol Black Mesa facility environment, but minor changes alters the gameplay enough to give it new feel. Opposing Force is a very pleasant conclusion to the original Half Life story.			"

												""This is what a singleplayer expansion should be."" - MeWhile modern singleplayer expansions usually just offer new weapons or a new area to explore, this expansion shows the same game and story from the eyes of the enemy. You play as Adrian Shepard, a solider who is stuck in the middle of an alien invasion. Work with other soliders to survive Aliens & Black Ops, who are trying to silence all witnesses and destroy the entire area.This expansion not only includes the new story and places, but new weapons alien, military, and experimental. Also a new Half Life Multiplayer experience with not only new maps(like Dust from CS 1.6 :D) & weapons, but a Capture the Flag Gamemode.I recommend this Expansion to anyone who enjoyed Half Life.9.9/10			"

It adds a lot of cool new weapons and enemies and has decent length, if you want more Half-Life but with some actual new stuff, this is a much better option than Blue Shift, though both of these sadly fail to replicate the same atmosphere of the original game.

												This is a damn classic. It's difficult at times, but also gives you a unique feeling of lonely desperation that really works in the Half-Life setting; not to mention Half-Life's great sense of pacing is still present. Plus, the M249 SAW is awesome. (Although technically it's sort of a cross between the M249 and M60.)You play as one of the Marines who were sent to Black Mesa in the original game to kill aliens and silence (read: also kill) any survivors. Your mission doesn't exactly go as planned, though, and you soon find yourself as just one combatant in a conflict that gets nastier by the minute.There is working multiplayer with some servers up, and surprisingly enough new levels seem to have been added in addition to the original ones. All but one are either free-for-all deathmatch or team-based CTF. There is one team-based control point-style map. Aside from a snazzy new HUD, and some great new weapons & areas of Black Mesa to explore, you also have the ability to lead and command small groups of fellow soldiers. The AI can get a bit spotty, but this game is more than 13 years old. If you liked Half-Life, you'll like this too.They relatively recently patched in the original music that was composed for this game. You can download it separetely from this website[p-l-m.blogspot.com]. I'd say it's pretty good, and fits the character of the game.If you liked the original Half-Life, you should probably get this.

												Half-Life: Opposing Force was a surprising adventure for me. Having played and fallen in love with the rest of the franchise almost immediately, I had never gone into a Half-Life game with an air of skepticism. And here's what I think (I'll keep it quick to avoid TL;DR's):For anyone familiar with Half-Life, the gameplay is similarly fast-paced and exciting. However, I was impressed with the addition of new mechanics that made the game an entirely different experience. This expansion of the Half-Life universe boasts new enemies, environments, and TONS of weapons. It is shorter than Half-Life, but a lot is crammed into the time that you get. Playing as HECU Grunt Adrian Shepherd is a fresh and different experience from Half-Life. However, I do have one minor caution for anyone new to the series: This game is pretty difficult. The same could be said of Half-Life 1, considering they are both older games, but Opposing Force has some moments where things may take a dip into the frustrating part of the spectrum. So quicksave a lot, newbies.			"

Unlike most FPS level packs of the day, Opposing Force didnt just add more levels, it added completely new features and a new story that runs concurrently with the story of the original. New weapons and a light squad-command system give the expansion a very unique feel.			"

												The first expansion for Half-Life, which is also it's best in my opinion.Challenging while retaining the spirit of Half-Life. The Soundtrack is also ambient and hectic.Played from the perspective of Adrian Sheapard, part of the military team sent to deal with the Black Mesa incident, you get to fight the Xen aliens, but also a mysterious race of aliens known as X. The game adds a few new weapons, new monsters, and the level design is damn good.The soundtrack is one of the best of the Half-Life 1 era games. Although Blue Shift uses the same soundtrack as Op4, Chris Jenson brings alot to the table. It easily matches Kelly Baileys original score.Opposing Force is the best expansion for Half-Life. It's pretty lengthy, stretching over 9 hours. Blue Shift is also good, but the new weapons and monsters aren't there, and the length is considerablly shorter due to Barney's story. The Half-Life series is not complete without these expansions.			"

												Half Life Opposing Force is an extension to the original half life game that actually has a pretty full story. It's definitely better, in my opinion, than Blue Shift.There are the standard wide array of weapons, enemies, along with the rather dated graphics and sound [as is to be expected], so if you're a fan of the original half life then this is definitely worth playing.Using a controller does not seem to work with this game, but it is an fps, so that's not a major issue.

												An excellent add-on for Half Life and one I praise highly as one of the best in the series. The gunplay is as good as any GoldSource game and the game runs great on every system I have played it on. The main problem I have with the game is the crazy difficulty. Once the game introduces the Black ops, it can be brutal and you will be playing through the same area over and over again and memorising enemy patterns. Play on easy for the best experience.			"

												The game has too strong a focus on setpieces - demonstrating Half-Life's weakest mechanical aspects - but tries to conceal this by adding new (and largely irrelevant) mechanics without the level of thought or polish the series is known for. Front-loaded with attention to detail, the game gets progressively thin as it wears on, but is thankfully helped out by the game it's based on. Adequate, but not the best Half-Life experience.Overall: 6/10 "

												I first played this when it came out in the Half-Life Platinum Bundle in stores, and at the time it was most likely the best game out there. Even now, it stands out as having some of the most memorable AI, interesting mechanics, and diverse weapons of any game I have ever seen. If you enjoyed Half-Life or any of it's other Gold-Source offshoots, you will like Opposing Force. Opposing force puts the player character into the Black Mesa incident much later than all other games in the series, and keeps the player there far after every other character's story has ended. One thing that sets this game far from other titles in the series is its difficulty. There are times when playing on hard that the AI for alien creatures and Black Ops teams seems to be almost mockingly hard. Even though they rely heavily on scripted paths and arenas, the Black Ops teams surpass what any enemy in the rest of the series can do, providing long fights that force the player to both act quickly and prepare for the multitude of tricks the enemy can pull at will.The weapons in this game were also an enjoyable departure from Half-Life, and may even outshine the innovative gravity gun from the sequels. Opposing Force arms players with many alien weapons, most notably, the embryo of one of the game's most memorable alien enemies. It also adds a handheld barnacle which, while ridiculous, is used as a grappling hook very similar to the recently added Team Fortress 2 grapple. The dislocator, although impractical as a weapon outside of emergencies, is a very interesting idea for a weapon, as it allows limited travel between Earth and Xen. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys speedrunning, the original Half-Life series, hard games, or doesn't mind trying older titles.			"

												Half-Life: Opposing ForceThe Lambda incident through the eyes of the enemy Half-life: Opposing Force, developed by Gearbox and released in 1999, is an expansion pack for Valves critically acclaimed fps, Half-Life. With new weapons, aliens and gameplay Opposing Force, although not as good as its older sister, is a short and fun game to play after you’ve finished the original Half-Life.After a Resonance Cascade occurs ripping holes in dimensional space allowing aliens to pass through to earth, Corporal Adrian Shepard, a U.S. marine in the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, and his team are sent to neutralize the situation by exterminating all life forms in the facility. This Resonance Cascade has also caught the attention of another alien species, Race X, who decided to conquer humanity and claim Earth as their own. This game is not essential to the Half-Life story line, however if you’re a big fan of the original game and are interested to see the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of the enemy, then this is a game worth playing. There are also many references to the first game and even a Gordon Freeman cameo.One feature which makes this game a great expansion pack for Half-Life is the fact that Gearbox introduced new enemies and weapons. If not for these aspects this expansion pack would be nowhere near as good as it is. My personal favourite weapon was the Barnacle Grapple which allowed you to latch onto organic matter and go flying towards it. There is also a Displacer Cannon which can beam you to Xen and back or obliterate other enemies no matter how large. The gameplay in general is the same as Half-Life with lots of platforming, puzzles and large battles against lots of enemies. You can even get help from other soldiers to heal you, break down doors or kill other enemies. The Graphics in Opposing Force are dated and nowhere near as good as those in Half-Life: Source, I wouldn’t recommend this game for people who cringe at bad graphics. The level design in Opposing Force, like its predecessor, is well thought out and goes well with the platforming, with lots of optional areas to explore.Overall this was a solid game from start to finish, however I would only recommend this game to those who loved Half-Life. The level design was great and the gameplay was fun with new weapons and enemies, however the graphics, for some people, may distract from this. Unfortunately there were no new “stand out” soundtracks in this game. Those from Half-Life were recycled.7.5/10			"

												Half life opposing force is the first expansion of the first half life, it has some new features like climbing a rope and from time to time u will need some teammates u help u get further in the game. I must say the AI of ur teammates can be frustrating due to the fact that they wont always follow u as good as the scientists and security guards in the first half life but thats the only thing i think could be better. I recommend this to any half life fan cause for only 4,99 u get almost a full new game and there are i believe 2 new weapons wich where pretty fun to play with.			"

You'll be able to use a few new weapons to eliminate a bunch of new enemy typs. You play as Corporal Adrian Shephard one of the soldiers who was suppost to kill Gordon Freeman through his eyes you get a view on Gordons opponents.

												This is possibly one of the easiest games to either recommend or not recommend - it is more Half-Life. If you enjoyed Half-Life, you should get this game. If you did not enjoy Half-Life, you should not. If you have not played Half-Life, you should get and play that game first.Simple as that.As for the game itself, this is the greater of the two Half-Life expansion packs. It's a somewhat short side story to the original Half-Life, following the story of one of the marines who is sent in to the Black Mesa facility after everything goes to hell...err....Xen. After the initial task goes awry, he's tasked with helping to eliminate the aliens. It's a great little expansion, if a bit short, and adds new weapon types, new auxiliary features to the interface, new enemies, you get the idea. Fantastic addition to the franchise mythos.			"

												The main thing you need to know about this game is that it's not a simple retelling of the Half-Life chapters from the military perspective. Opposing Force is a great expansion pack which features new parts of Black Mesa Research Facility, new awesome weapons, new mysterious enemy called Race X and of course its own story that goes parallel to the events of the original Half-Life. On the other hand the game suffers from various glitches, the most famous being the Desert Eagle glitch which prevents you from firing this weapon if you've tried to do so underwater. It's a shame that after so many years some of these are still not fixed (and won't be apparently). Also the final boss and conclusion seemed a little bit rushed. Pros:+ Good story+ New areas, weapons, enemies+ Barnacle weapon (personal favourite)+ All the good stuff the original game hadCons:- Annoying glitches- Final boss and ending are rushed- Little to no information about Race XDo you like the original Half-Life? Then you definitely should play Opposing Force. 7.5/10			"

												  This non-inventive game is actually a solid game if you remind yourself you are playing a very linear , half-life based level pack.The levels are a hodge-podge of black-mesa areas / zones. Most fights take place in corridor/small-medium rooms, so keep that shotgun hotkeyed. Mostly you fight aliens, as you are a marine this time around. The enemy is exactly as the alien enemy was in half-life plus a few new baddies (that were borring but not detrimental to the fun).   The level design is linear, but made intereting by having elegantly masked  the progression path with enviornmental puzzles. These puzzles involve shooting explosives to break open a new path, and/or moving crates to reach vents and other areas. The puzzles are rarely stumping/frusterating, yet their sollution gives the illusion of cleverness, which is a satisfying addition to the bad-♥♥♥ feeling you get from the combat.   Music is used very occasionally, often to signify an event that lacks the momentum the sudden and intense music clips would have you expecting. The rest of the sounds are exactly the same as half-life 1. Again this is a half-life level pack, not a sequel or prequel.  As far as story, you're one of the nameless marine grunts gordon kills. Thinks get fubar quick, and pretty soon your alone in black-mesa rushing to meet the evacuating remains of the marines. The story is dictated through the occasional human npcs. The dialogue makes references to the half-life universe and games without really adding to the half-life plot itself. This game can be skipped from the canonical half-life series if you only care about the story.   Its worth the time if you remind yourself to expect a solid level pack , it's just a seamless collection of worth-while (and occasionally excellent) half-life levels.			"

												Expandalone: Half-Life: Opposing ForceDeveloper: Gearbox Software[www.gearboxsoftware.com]Publisher: Valve SoftwareReleased: 1 November, 1999Canon status: Canon unless stated otherwise by Valve SoftwareSetting: 17 May, 2003, Black Mesa Research Facility, New Mexico, U.S.A., EarthSpoiler-free plot summary: You play as Adrian Shephard, a Marine who's been ordered to hunt down the rogue scientist Gordon Freeman, the number one suspect for why aliens are teleporting into the Black Mesa Research Facility. After your osprey was downed by an alien aircraft, you must find your way out of the facility, surviving attacks from aliens, black ops, and hazardous environments.Full review: Half-Life: Opposing Force is the first, and most difficult, of three expandalones for Half-Life developed by Gearbox Software. Opposing Force places you, as its name suggests, on the opposite ""team"", as it were: the HECU Marines which Freeman was forced to fight through in Half-Life.Opposing Force continues Half-Life's theme of varied environments, puzzles, and a minor story. The gameplay is exactly the same, save for new weapons and enemies. However, what I've found to be far more tedious was the combat. These new enemies can be a mixed variation of too quick, too big, deal too much damage, or have too much health, meaning you usually have low health, low ammo, and die several times, even on the easiest difficulty. I completed about three-quarters of the game before I was forced to use god mode due to how bored I got of dying every few minutes.Do I recommend buying Opposing Force? Yes, but only if you're a Half-Life veteran. For a casual Half-Life player who cares about story/lore first and gameplay second, like myself, you can give this one a miss.			"

												Wow. Just... wow. At first I went into this game prepared for a shameless cash making title by Gearbox. Well, let's put it this way, it's no Blue Shift. In a good way though. Instead of depending on references to the original to add any form of excitement, direct references are minimal, but awesome (You can murder Gordon Freeman and cause a paradox, teleport to the hazard course, and uncover the secrets of Black Mesa). None of those are even the high points (well maybe the paradox). First off new mechanics: your reticule reacts to being over enemies, and a squad command mechanic to unite with fellow soldiers. Obviously the major new mechanic is the squad command, is it any good? Well... Yes, but also no. What do I mean? It is pretty fun, interesting, and cool. However it is fundamentally flawed. There are three types of fellow soldier, heavy machine gunners that obliterate your enemies quickly, medics that heal you and can fight, and defense engineers that in addition to shooting also take doors down. Well that sounds cool, but they are pretty dumb. They always get in your line of fire, you have to beg to get healed and take down doors (mash 'interact' button like some maniac), and run right into bombs and trip mines. ""Davey, hurry up with that door!"" ""Yes Corporal"" *clunk* ""Davey, nooooooo! Not that blue laser!"" ""What?"" *boom* Yep that's definitely the worst part of the AI. Absolutely nothing else. Oh, what that elephant in the room, nah ingnore it it's fine. *Sigh* Okay I have to adress the elephant in the room. When you cross into a new chapter they... well they don't do anything. No, really they just stop and stare as you walk away in an almost creepy fashion. So, yeah not so wonderful, but it can still be cool at times. So anything else new? Oh, boy is there new stuff. Sniper rifle, night vision, heavy rifle, desert eagle with laser, pipe wrench, combat knife, barnacle grapple, shock raches, spore launcher, and the displacer cannon. Tons of new enemies that I couldn't even begin to mention to avoid spoilers, but let's just say prepare to run and gun for your life. It's got new maps, but in my opinion, they aren't quite as ingenious as the original maps. Well I have to admit I love the new variety, especially the new weapons. As always what you're supposed to do is often a process of trial and error, but I as an avid Mega Man player have gotten used to that. I guess if I have to be a downer the music isn't quite as good. Overall I'd suggest this game even if you haven't played the original. It's an amazing game on it's own right, not far behind the original. I give it 9.5/10 fallen doors.			"

												A more ambitious half life expansion, it is a good game if you want more HL goodness though not everything it adds works out well.More focus on NPC following you with the same/worse AI, dodgy rope physics that you are meant to climb, minor weapon issues like the deagle having similar fire modes to the 9mm pistol but with different mechanics and most troubling having the horribly inaccurate as default, charge up wrench swing that I ended up using over shotgun double blast, teleporter gun where you can spend rare ammo and risk Xen platforming for barely any supplies and the optimal way to play involving waiting to gather regrowing ammo.

												I definitely recommend Opposing Force; in fact, I recommend it more than Half-Life itself (Of course, you need to play it first if you want to understand the game). I feel like this game had a lot more story behind it, but that is not the only good thing. The enemies, the new weapons, the maps, THE MUSIC. Half-Life 3 can wait. I would love to see a Half-Life 2: Opposing Force game. This game is envolved in mystery, and has way more action than the original Half-Life. Do not think twice, and buy this game.

												A great expansion. I for one was never the fan for Half Life but the series does improve with every installment. Of the first installment this expanison brings a great deal to table. A large library of weapons to chose from and you get to see way more of Black Mesa than before. The mechnics are vastly improved from Half Life, which is great. New enemies and comrades to pick from. Adds a lot of variety. I think the real hero is Shepard, like seriously he does some crazy ♥♥♥♥ man.			"

												Note: Almost 100% copy-paste from my review of blue shift. Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: LowBudget: I can't name a half-life package deal it isn't a part of. Lenght: A few days to a week. Opposing force is half-life played as a soldier who participates in the assault on Black Mesa. While playing as a different main character, with different levels and a different perspective on the plot, it's essentially the same game, taking place at the same time as the original half-life game. If you liked half-life, you should play this, as it's just as good. Everyone knows half-life, so why should I even bother going into detail about this game? Just consider it additional levels.			"

												Opposing Force is Half-Life mod made by the late Afghanistan modder Stanley Kubrick.Game starts off with marine zombies fighting each other.  One marine get wrench and beat down other zombies.  He throw wrench into sky which transforms into space ship.  The ship contained Hal who would later marry Glados.You play the role of Private Joker, who is a battle-ready pacifist marine who like taking pictures of dead GI Joes.  This is also one of my hobby so I really feel connected to game.  You can start by doing boot camp with Gomer Pyle and Hartman or dive straight into action.When doing campaign you are either shot down by Viet Cong or Dutchman is pilot.  Not really sure as I am nodding to music.  The music is made of remixed versions of Beethoven music.  This is to remove need for licenses, although one track is based on Singing in the Rain.  To really appreciate the music you need to drink milk plus beforehand.After surviving crash you try to escape but end up with fight against Iranians wearing black onesies.  Most enemy and friend look same in the game.  In fact, all models are based on Peter Sellers.  The Richard Keller model from Decay was further used in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.  I only watch film after seeing final word in movie title.Some of the maps can be a maze.  If you get lost it will begin to snow before you freeze to death next to Jack Nicholson.  If you press use button on Jack he say ""Never rub another man's rhubarb"" before a huge one eye trouser snake try to attack you.  When you kill worm game ends.  Spoiler alert.G-Man trap you on plane and ask for Shephard.  You stand up and say ""I am Shephard"" but then other marines stand up and say ""I am Shephard"".  G-Man very confused and not know who real Shephard is.  G-Man say ""♥♥♥♥ it, no Shephard in Half-Life 2 then"".To play Half-Life 3 you need to enter password ""Fidelio"".			"

Though this time you kill the aliens instead of bang. Real-talk part: It was ok. Not as good as base game HL1 or Blue Shift, but I still had fun playing it. It's honestly super fun if you roleplay as a crazy person instead of a US soldier in this game oddly enough. Running around Black Mesa while pretending it's actually a mental institue, while shouting ""mynameachef"" while pretending you are a psychotic meme-loving chef who wants too cook up and eat everyone in his path was probably my favourite part of playing this game.

I would definitely recommend this to any Half Life fan or even any FPS fan, as a must-purchase. Definitely worth the 5 bucks.			"

There are more different new NPC fighting along or against us, and there are more new weapons (M249 SAW, Spore launcher, Wrench)Storyline is well- made, it somehow connects with original Half Life.

												One awesome expansion pack for Half Life, letting you play in the boots of a USMC Marine. Thankfully, you never meet Gordon in-game, or he'd carve you a new haircut, Kurt Cobain style. Gameplay is made much more fun, thanks to the addition of several new weapons, including a portable Barnacle to be used as grappling gun, and a living Grenade Launcher. You may also be in command of a team, and give your otherwise-not-so-bright teammates some basic orders.			"

												Experience a different point of view of the incindent of Black Mesa! In Opposing Force, you play as corporal Adrian Shephard, whose job is to kill Gordon Freeman.I'd say this expansion is better than Blue Shift, because it adds more weapons and enemies, levels are also more fun, in my opinion, as well. As you play, you will sometimes encounter Gordon and even the G-Man. Levels are easier than Half-Life's or at least I think so, because I needed to look up in google much less.Unfortunately, the game sometimes crashes while loading a save file. Other people have experienced crashes on different ocassions.Overall, its probably a good buy if you liked Half-Life. Don't see a reason to purchase it if you haven't played the original first though.			"

Telling storys and game events from differant prespectives, ephisese on other asspects of gameplay and overall improved charecter models are all what make this a must buy expansion. Best of all, its a standalone game but you'd be hard presed not to get this expansion without buying the original Half Life. Everything that made the original Half Life Great is here.			"

												The high standard to which all Expansion Packs should be held to.Despite being produced by an outside company, Opposing Force takes all the things which made Half-Life great, and adds enough to keep things entertaining and varied all the way through to completion. And very little Xen!Good music, good voice acting (Jon St John as the Drill Sergeant!) and interesting level design make this a must-buy if you like the original Half-Life.			"

												Experience a different point of view of the incindent of Black Mesa! In Opposing Force, you play as corporal Adrian Shephard, whose job is to kill Gordon Freeman.I'd say this expansion is better than Blue Shift, because it adds more weapons and enemies, levels are also more fun, in my opinion, as well. As you play, you will sometimes encounter Gordon and even the G-Man. Levels are easier than Half-Life's or at least I think so, because I needed to look up in google much less.Unfortunately, the game sometimes crashes while loading a save file. Other people have experienced crashes on different ocassions.Overall, its probably a good buy if you liked Half-Life. Don't see a reason to purchase it if you haven't played the original first though.			"

												Half Life Opposing Force sets a new bench mark for expansion packs even to this day and is a great continuation of the Half Life story and gameplay. Telling storys and game events from differant prespectives, ephisese on other asspects of gameplay and overall improved charecter models are all what make this a must buy expansion. Best of all, its a standalone game but you'd be hard presed not to get this expansion without buying the original Half Life. Everything that made the original Half Life Great is here.			"

It builds on the gameplay and setting of the original, it adds six new weapons as well as exploring the events of the Black Mesa incident from a fresh new angle that adds more intrigue, and answers some questions while raising new ones.

												[SPOLIERS AHEAD, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED]This is a very unique game following Cpl. Adrian Shepherd as his team attemps to mute the Black Mesa facility. Failure causes the HECU to port out and go back to base due to invading aliens that are overwhelming them. Shepherd and a few other HECU groups are left behind, and must fight their way out using teamwork, agility, and combat. <Insert story plot n' crap>Eventually, Shepherd finds himself at the underground car lot. The Black Ops are planning to set off a bomb called the ""Thermonuclear Device"". Shepherd de-activates it but it is re-armed by the mysterious G-Man. Shepherd meets a Security Guard and he tells Shepherd to beware of the Gene Worm that is coming through a portal. Shepherd finally defeats the Gene Worm and is teleported to the G-Man. The G-Man puts Shepherd into a safe place in the corner of the universe where ""he can cause no harm"". This game very fun to play, but I was ripping my hair out at the voltigores in the underground tunnels.Praise jebebus I made it out. :IMPROVEMENTS:More health scattered around the facilityTake less damageMake the pipe wrench more useful Make Black Ops assassins slowerLess grenade damage			"

												This is an expansion to the amazing original Half-Life game; this game has you playing as a member of the soldiers you fight in the original game as you battle past aliens alone after losing your fellow soldiers. This game is much shorter than the original Half-Life and isn't quite as good in terms of level design and some combat situations as well as puzzles you are put up against but is still a great experience. It is also amazing that Valve created this expansion as the story of a lone soldier running parallel to the main story; it's really interesting to see the situation from another point of view.13/15 - ""Good game but not as good as the original"" "

												Half-Lifes great version where you play as Shephard. You belong to the army forces who took over the Black Mesa facility. Really interesting game. Nice weapons and enemies. Play the original Half-Life first, then play this. This game is worth your money. 8/10			"

												I'm assuming most of the reviews are made from nostalgia, this mod starts off strong and quickly ends up being a headache of poor level and monster design. Most of the new weapons are pointless and the tried-and-tested monsters end up replaced with frusting new ones. Grunt enemies are replaced with more assassins who have 100% gun and grenade accuracy and can barely be seen in the dark using your barely-functioning nightvision. Modders were doing much better work at the time with much less resources.			"

												I liked this very much in the beginning. It has a great story and concept and brings cool new weapons and abilities to the franchise. However, half-way through, it gets off ballence. Enemies are over-powered and numerous, often coming at you in ambushes. They also don't explain the new species of alien, or why Gordon Freeman and Barney Calhoun never saw any of them. There were many instances in which playing this game felt like a chore but by then you're too far gone to just give up now. There is a bug that prevents the final sequence from playing after you beat the final boss (which was a complete waste of time) so I had to go on Youtube to see the result of my seven hours' hard work. 5/10 I love Half-Life but I just can't with this game. I'd rather replay Episode 1			"

												This review originally written on May 29, 2012 on GameFAQs""Almost as good as the original, don’t miss it!""This is a standalone expansion of Half-Life. I recommend you play this after Blue Shift because I think it's better and I like to save the best for last. The ratings and my feelings of this expansion are gauged in relation to the first Half-Life.STORY: 9/10Here you play one of the marines by the name of Adrian Shephard who enters Black Mesa. You get split up from your team and the game is you progressing along fighting aliens and black ops. The story actually isn't as interesting as Blue Shift, but this has a really cool ending.GRAPHICS: 9/10Again the same graphics as Half-Life, but to be fair this was released soon after so not much time to really improve them. Plus it keeps the same feel so not a big deal.SOUND: 10/10We get all the same sound effects from Half-Life plus more due to all the new content. What few music pieces there are seem to be recycled from the first game though. There are some new voices for the guards and marines which I like.WEAPONS: 10/10Not only do we get nearly all the weapons from Half-Life, but we get more! Notable additions are three new alien weapons. One basically serves as a grappling hook type thing which is pretty interesting but doesn't have much use beyond that. The other two are useful to save ammo for your big guns, but this method isn't needed as you get lots of ammo for everything.ENEMIES: 10/10We see a return of all the enemies from Half-Life but with several more. The new creatures are interesting and unique. A certain type is also very tough and can be tricky to fight especially in a certain area with no light… Unlike Blue Shift we get bosses! There is a boss you must figure out how to get rid of much like a certain one in Half-Life, and a final boss which also requires a bit of cunning.LEVEL DESIGN: 9/10Unfortunately this game is more linear than Half-Life or Blue Shift, but still not bad. There just aren't as many puzzles or alternative ways of getting places. However I must give props to the tutorial which is where you go through advanced training in boot camp. Pretty cool!SQUAD: 9/10Unique to this game is that you get other fellow soldiers who can follow you around and do things. The only ones of note are the engineer who can burn through certain doors, and the medic who can heal you and allies. A few times these guys are used to get past a certain point and you must keep them alive to do their job. They could've done more with them, but at least they tried something new.LENGTH AND REPLAYABILITYThis game is short clocking in at roughly 3 hours or so. This is the game's main flaw. It has a lot of new things like enemies and weapons, but not much time for you to savor it. Regardless it was fun while it lasted and it's still a blast to play with the new weapons and fight the new enemies.FINAL SCORE: 9.5/10Rounded up to 10/10 for GFAQs. This game does what an expansion should do and that's keep the same great gameplay but add more content to play with. This game isn't quite as good as Half-Life mainly due to the length, but that shouldn't stop you from playing this!			"

												We all know Half-Life is the classic. If you enjoyed Half-Life... you may find Opposing Force a little disappointing. In brief; Opposing Force puts you in the shoes of Adrian Shepard... one of the Soldiers sent in to 'clean up' Black Mesa.  Of course things go horribly wrong and you wind up fighting for your survuival and the fate of the world.The Good:* Most of the good things about Half-Life carry over.* New and interesting Enemies* New and interesting Weapons to kill New and Interesting Enemies with.* Explore New Areas of Black MesaAll in all a solid expansion and the idea of having a squad of specialize d soldiers to help you with is always great and leads to some interesting challenges. The Alien X Race also makes for tough antagonists. THe new black ops are also a joy.The Bad* Mundane Area Design.* Bad Lighting* Disjointed STory* GimmickyYeah, the biggest problem here is the lighting. I know Gearbox thought their Light Amp thingie was cool and it admittedly better than the flash light but... it's not practically to have the areas so dark you have to leave it on half the txchuffin time. You will be seeing alot of green in this game.Also the level design ... is dodgey. As in you don't quite feel the interconnection between the areas. In short they feel more like levels and less like actual parts pof a facility in some cases. A minor quibble. Also there are a timed few trial and error sections that will annoy you.Lastly it does feel Gimmickjy. SInce you spend most of your time fighting the allien X creatures... it's actually easy to forget that you're in the same Black Mesa as Gordon freeman and Barney Calhoun. It Might as well have been a different facility all together.Out of the two expansions this feels like the most tangental of them, and the least polished. There's also not much of the story being woven into the background, and it simply lacks the pacing of either Half-Life or Blue Shift.Not that it is a bad game.. it's still quite good but it is a step down rather than hup. Thankffully Half Life raised the bar enough that even a step down is still a high mark.			"

Yea, this is just another one of those, cheap, short, crappy, little expansions for a game they always put out isnt it? HAH! You are NOT going to trick me this time into buying you, forget it! >:c"" I also said to myself. Boy was i totally wrong. This game is the complete OPPOSITE of what i said. Lets put that in REVERSE form, shall we? ""Oh, what have we got here? YEA! This is 1 of those expansion packs that are cheap, super long, super detailed, and has epic gameplay to it!

ProsNew enemies, weapons and mechanics, the game works best when it shows the advantages you have by being a soldier.Shows you a new side of what was considered the enemy team in Half-Life.Cheap price, one of the most content full DLCs I've ever seen taking into account its $/min value.Includes the same multiplayer from Half-Life with an added Capture the Flag gamemode.There are some neat little additions in the animation department, there is a considerable amount of polishment and it shows. One of the alien guns actually have an animation that show the protagonist ""petting"" the creature. Very nice.During some moments in the game it will interwine with Gordon Freeman's adventure, and you'll be able to see dialogue from the original or even Gordon Freeman himself from a new PoV.There is no Surface Tension-like chapter in this one which is an absolute plus in anything related to Half-Life.The Training Camp chapter is hilarious and a joy to play.ConsMany of the new weapons and enemies are re-hashes of Half-Life weapons and enemies.Some areas feel like a completely different game, pushing my suspension of disbelief that Gordon Freeman never saw the new alien race or the unbelievably differently designed areas of Black Mesa in the original Half-Life (is Black Mesa racist and only let the black guards work in one department?)The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing green filter night vision is blinding!The game quickly abandons most of its ""soldier"" premise after the main team leaves and the rest of the gameplay is mostly a watered down version of Half-Life, with a few new uses of the soldier mechanics here and there.The store page advertises this game like we play as one of the soldiers ordered to murder Gordon Freeman, yet we're never really ordered to do so, as the game already starts close to the ""Forget About Freeman"" chapter of the original Half-Life. You barely even see Freeman through the game.Like in the original, some of the puzzles are downright impossible without a walkthrough.Like in the original, it's artificially extended, with some badly designed chapters that have no reason to exist in the middle of the actual interesting chapters.The multiplayer barely works most of the time, and is generally dominated by professionals.Disappointing cliffhanger-like ending, that will most likely never get anywhere.OverallIt's still a fun game most of the time but significantly flawed and by the end of it, it's already a chore to play. I recommend only for diehard Half-Life fans since the ending has been confirmed to never get anywhere ever since Half-Life 2 released and it is really more of the artificially extended Half-Life ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game has VAC and it already includes the HD texture pack from Blue Shift.			"

												Half-Life: Opposing force is the first and the largest of the three expansions.You play as Corporal Adrian Shepard, he is the closest thing you can get to the DooM guy in Half-Life he isn't as badass and well known as his friend and rival Gordan Freeman he is still awesome.On top of visiting lots of familiar places from the ridge to the lamda teleporter room you also see alot of new places you also get a few new weapons and a set of new enemies and instead of a crowbar, revolver and the two energy weapons you get a wrench, knife (which is like a faster crowbar that does slightly more damage) a teleporter, an LMG, a Race X Shock Roach, a sniper rifle and a Race X Spore Launcher also instead of an HEV (hazardous environment suit) you get a PCV (powered combat vest) which is almost the same with a few differences like a green HUD and NVGs (night vision goggles) instead of a torch which is good in some places but bad in others.IMO this is the game that made Gearbox what they are today.

												As much as I enjoyed HL1, this expansion felt like a chore to play. After the first 1/2 hour of gameplay all the battles were the same: peek around corner, shoot, dodge enemy fire, repeat.90% of the time you're running around with less than 10 health and 250 bullets for your peashooter M16, the only good gun in my opinion being the shotgun with its double barrel ability.The ending 'boss battle' if you can even call it that was incredibly anti climactic, not even similar to the one in the base game.If you're looking for more HL, I'm afraid that this poor excuse of an expansion won't satisfy you.Overall rating: 3/10, had some cool parts, but just not enough.

												This game doesn't stand on its own well.  It's severely dated and lacks any real story, and a lot of the choices for this game are poor.  (the alien gun that works as a grappling hook, but only in specific spots - it's otherwise useless, unforgiving difficulty in certain areas, uninspired design, etc.)HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT - do yourself a favor and only play this game after recently finishing Half-Life 1.  All the experience and familiarity from HL will help this game a lot, and fills in what is otherwise a vacant story with the richness of the HL experience.  Otherwise, if you're like me (last played HL1 7+ years ago), this game is incredibly weak and leaves you wondering how there could be so many glowing reviews for such a poor game.  For me, my only previous play-through of Opposing Force was right after I finished HL1, and I loved it.  I can only assume it's because I've forgotten/lost so much of the HL1 experience that this was so uninteresting.			"

												Very dissapointing. The promise of cool new weapons and a new perspective is well enough, but the game spends too much time having the player solve easy but drawn-out puzzles and run around boring enclosed environments rather than fight tooth and nail against aggressive enemies. Eventually it gets there, but by that point you are nearing the end. The new weapons are cool, but you barely get ammo for them and, once again, by the time you do the game is pretty much over. Most of what OP4 does, Half-Life did much better and more creatively. Some mechanics are barely used like the grapple. The trial and error gameplay of Half-Life is still here and somehow worse because now instead of platforming, you are fighting enemies that can quite literally kill you in one hit. Get used to quicksave because you'll be using it here more than in Half-Life. Overall, a very overrated expansion that took Half-Life's elegant design and did a big squirty dump all over it.			"

												SUMMARY STATEMENT:This game is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to make an alternative plot to half life. Every highlight of the game is just something you saw in the original. The value of this game is nostalgia, nothing more.Every step of the way, you can both see and feel when valve employees said to gearbox developers ""oh yeah and its gotta have this part here...  and honestly just model this part after this... you haven't put any of THIS in! Where is THIS?!?!""E.g. they stole the bit where you have to jump across a chasm to reach a ladder, and they ripped off the canyon jumping sequence, and the pit worm (spoiler lol) is modeled after the 3 headed beast in blast pit... you get the idea.You know how the Angry Video Game Nerd talks about video game publishing contractors (e.g. LJN)?That's how i'd describe gearbox while putting out this ""gem""Every aspect of gameplay that feels even slightly good is offset completely by remembering how much better it was in the original Half-Life. Valve should NOT let their genius be ripped off by charlatans like gearbox.There are some neat new weapons but for every cool weapon added you have 1 cooler weapon from half-life that didn't happen to make it in and 4 game segments that feel cheesy, like there was minimal effort put into it.It is very easy to imagine this was coded, textured, etc. by about 15 people who spent about 300 man hours between them working on this while being completely focused on something else.Surprisingly, however, the game has fewer glitches than half life. However, it retains the worst glitch of half-life, where you are in a small enclosed space, crouched, and the map changes (and you subsequently get stuck in the floor) meaning that you have to jump a while in the enclosed space, hoping that you happen to be in the air when changing between maps.If you're not out to complete every half life game then this game is not worth itdo not buymultiplayer is abandoned (Half life 1's multiplayer deathmatch isn't, though. Just saying.) so if you want to play that you'll need to arrange for a lan party or something			"

												Boring, bland, mediocre, and utterly pointless. I regret buying it.EDIT: With a push from another steam user, I will now explain why I hate this game in more detail! Wall of text incoming, hold onto your butts.It bored the ♥♥♥♥ out of me because it felt like a lazy re-tread of Half-Life's campaign, down to the shamelessly copying the tentacle fight from the main game (big thing blocks progress, go press two buttons/levers then press this big button to kill it). You even fight spec-ops guys again (which was infuriating the first time, and moreso here). It doubles down on this during its ending when the g-man shows up, and dumps your character into stasis.I found it bland because you play as a marine who comes in shortly before the millitary retreats. Now, if we had taken control of a marine who'd been there from the beginning, and had orders to kill the scientests and purge the facility, then THAT would have been interesting. It would have been a nice twist retreading Gordon's steps and seeing the carnage he left behind, and would have given us more insight into what was going through the soldier's heads as their buddies are massacred en masse by one scientest in a hazmat suit (besides some grafitti and idle chatter in the main game). Honestly, the story of opposing force is a wasted oppertunity (to me anyway).I found it mediocre because the new weapons and mechanics weren't interesting to me. Sure the symbiotic bug was cool, but its a reskin of the hive hand that shoots electricity instead of bees. The teleporting gun was never worth using for its secondary function, because the secret areas RARELY gave anything good. The spore launcher was neat, but obtaining ammo for it was annoying because you need to wait around for its ammo to respawn. The barnacle gun, while initially neat, let me down when I realized how limited its use was: besides a few spots where gunk grew on the walls that you could latch onto, it was utterly useless. Finally, lets talk about the new aliens, and how much I hated fighting them. There's the little guys that swarm you and go down in one hit, the bullet-sponge cyclopses, their weapons that you have to kill after killing them, the tanky ♥♥♥♥ers that you fight in dark narrow corridors, and the final boss. The final boss was the final nail in the coffin for me because, unlike the Nihilanth from the main game, you fight a big dumb worm in what is perhaps the DULLEST fight I've ever had to endure: use turrets to shoot its eyes, then shoot its portal mouth thing. After a few shots, it destroys the catwalk, forcing you to do some platforming to continue shooting it [I didn't bother climbing the rope, I just noclipped between the turrets], while also spawning one of the aforementioned bullet-sponge enemies to drag out the length of the fight. With the Nihilanth, you had to deal with the thing teleporting you, but at least the arena you fought it in was fun. There was nothing fun about Opposing Force. It had no memorable moments besides the ones it ripped off from half-life, and I had to wrack my brain and look at a few videos to remember all the crap I'd forgotten.Finally, this game is utterly pointless. I don't just mean that in the sense that it's existance is pointless, but it contributes NOTHING to the half-life universe. Whatever story or over-arching plot exists here NEVER returns in any form ever again. Your mission was never explained to you or the other schmucks you were brought in with (lazily explaining why the scientests/security force is working with the millitary, who were slaughtering them IN DROVES earlier during the main game), the big explosive that the spec-ops guys brought with them is dealt with stupidly easily, and like I mentioned earlier, at the very end of the game your guy is put into stasis because ""hurr durr, that's what happened to Gordon in half-life, so lets do that too!"". The greatest example of how pointless this game truly is can be summed up with an encounter early on; you come across a medic, who you need to escort to heal an engineer, who you need to open a door, and once he does, he runs in and is immediatly mowed down by a sentry turret. I could have saved myself 7 minutes of fighting if I'd simply noclipped through the door and kept going. Also, your dumb-as-dirt marine squaddies only follow you for a certain amount of time, and are stopped by invisible lines that they won't cross.And that is why I think that half-life: Opposing Force is a piece of ♥♥♥♥, and why I honestly regret purchasing it.

												I thought I'd like Opposing Force, but I did not. It's certainly an interersting concept that appeals to me, the chance to play as a HECU marine during the Black Mesa Incident and be on the side of the ""bad guys"" is a cool idea in my book, and although Opposing Force opened strong, I felt that as it went on it became progressively weaker. I think that where this game fails the most is in the gameplay. There are way too many weapons that you can carry around in this game (16 in total) and it gets to a point where either you forget to use them or they are redundant. I found myself sticking to the basic, dependable weapons the whole time (shotgun, assault rifle, etc) and there was never really a time when I had to switch to those alien weapons. I should also add that the barnacle gun is pretty much useless except for a couple of pre planned sequences where you have to go across an area using it, so that gun doesnt really see a lot of action which is dissappointing because it would have been cool to grapple up on regular ledges (not organic ones) and get a different view of the battle/tactical advantage. the AI in this game is also rather stupid, your marine buddies who are supposed to tag along with you (and offer you things like health etc.) will either get killed in about 10 seconds or glitch on a wall and stop following you. They're honestly better off dead so that you can take their guns and move along. The story is also pretty much nonexistent. No one bothers to explain where ""Race X"" comes from (and why Gordon didn't see them in his travels) and the same applies to the Black Ops enemies. They are part of the military, shouldn't they be HELPING you? What reason would they want to kill you for? And that boss battle, geez... what a boring waste of time. Whoever came up with that sorry ♥♥♥ excuse of a boss battle needs to be fired (there's nothing fun about shooting 2 eyes out of a monster). So, overall Opposing Force is an expansion pack that sets out to be as grandiose as the original Half-Life, but fails on its delivery. It's 5 bucks, so at the end of the day it's your choice as to whether or not you think its worth the pick up. But in my opinion, it's not really worth it.			"

The new aliens are annoying, overpowered, way too frequent, and placed at the absolute worst spots. I'm playing on Medium and literally had to rush past some spots because of the aliens. Before anybody says ""You just suck"", know that I played and beat the original Half-Life on Hard difficulty with WAY less problems than this expansion is giving me. I'd say the price it is now, which is $1.24 because of the Summer Sale, is an appropriate price to get this poorly designed garbage.			"

												It's an okay game, but I was disappointed after seeing a number of people say it was better than Half-Life itself. No-where near. I've only played both of them for the first time recently and while Half-Life itself had dated really well and was more enjoyable than many new games, Opposing Forces did not fare so well. While this may have been a worthwhile twist on Half-Life at the time, it is not exceptional enough to be worth recommending to new players nearly two decades later.			"

												While this is a nice game and helps add additional details to the Half Life game as seen from the eyes of a soldier, I did not like this game and I don't recommend wasting your time with it. 1) it feels as though it's dragging the original feel and intent of Half Life too far, it feels tired and recycled, despite having new weapons and monsters to fight.2) Many of the maps feel as though they were only in Work-in-Progress stage, they are empty and featureless.

												I don't think I've ever played a game with as much dichotomy in quality as this. The first half of the game is a clear showcase of the practice the developers had making the first two parts of HL1, and is probably the most fun I've had with the series so far. The second half is a tedious parade of gimmicky weapon showcasing at the cost of actually useful resources, and so you spend half your time with your hand stuck up an alien bug's ♥♥♥ and the other half trying to fight off ninjas with half a clip of ammunition for your real guns.I'll admit I've not actually finished this one at the time of writing, as after a while I just didn't have the patience to survive another wave of heavily armored enemies using a space fish's acid loogies and four points of health. Kind of a surprising turnabout considering how strong it started.			"

The story and gameplay stay true to the original Half-Life, though perhaps with a bit less platforming (thankfully).However, the second time through Black Mesa seems a little less exciting.  Of course, the multiplayer for this 1999 title has long since passed.Fans will probably enjoy playing, and newcomers, skipping.7/10			"

												When I played Half-Life, I was enthralled. This game just took it a step further and mainly focused on the gameplay mechanic, which I was good with quite honestly. It also makes alien usage of the Goldsource Engine, (there wasn't much to the action besides npcs killing eachother and not you, which was probably a big deal back in 1998. In this one, you actually see helicopters falling out of the sky.)I was also thinking we were done with the military... nope, fricking black ops.			"

												Half-Life Opposing Force sends a shock-wave through my body when playing this enormous of a game. So compelling, mind-boggling puzzles, some big changes from the Half Life Universe. Yet the gameplay stays the same through all of Opposing Force, it's just the minor improvements that make it worth even better than Blue Shift. Playing as Shepard, and being on the bad side of the story-line really put me into a different perspective of how Freeman came to be today. Playing through this once-in-a-lifetime videogame was definetly worthwhile and encouraging, because you get a better sense (and practice) at all the mechanics. That made all of Half-Life ever so great and compelling to tackle upon. Nevertheless the experience was ""one Hell of a Fun Ride"", Trust me, playing as Shepard when you've beaten every single other games before Half-Life 2 really gets a person in-tune with the story-line.9.33/10GL & HF...

												This game is (in my opinion) the best Half-Life game their is. In the game, you play as SGT Adrian Sheaperd as he navigates the Black Mesa facility during the residence cascade. It carries over the first Half-Life's suspense and survival aspects while adding new aspects to the game without completly changing the feel of the series like HL2 (not that I'm saying 2 is bad, I just feel it changed to much from HL1). .

												If you were a fan of the original Half-Life, then the expansions offer a look at the same story from a different point of view. Half-Life Opposing Force does this really well, offering an interesting take on the action of HL1 with new levels and weapons. Seeing the story from another character's perspective is quite possibly one of the most positively unique things about this game. It's definitely worth buying the HL1 anthology and giving this a try.			"

												Opposing Force definitely lives up to its name, not only do you get to play as your enemies from Half-Life, but there's also tons and tons of combat! That's not a bad thing either, most of Half-Life was puzzle solving and platforming whereas this is more along the lines of heavy duty survival and combat. The later levels manage to get especially nasty while still finding a nice balance between tactical but still fun. The new weapon ideas that OF offered were hit and miss though, the SAW & Desert Eagle are neat additions whereas the alien guns were iffy and largely boring. Similarly, the barnacle grappling system and the squad system really should've been more refined, they were awesome when they worked right...sadly that just wasn't too often. Although, the new aliens definitely rounded out for a altogether fresh experience, I especially liked how the story that tied into the original so well while avoiding being a total retread. A must play for any fan of Half-Life.Here's to Shepard returning for Half-Life 3!			"

												Set during the during the events of Half-Life, the Opposing Force expansion pack offers a different perspective as you play the role of one of the soldiers sent in to supress an alien invasion.Opposing Force builds on Half-Life's game mechanics, allowing you to command a small group of soldiers who have different attributes. You have the medic who can heal you and your allies, the engineer who can cut through inaccessable areas and your standard infantry solider who helps you during firefights. The friendly AI is quite rudimentary and you will often witness your allies wandering out into the open and getting cut down by enemies.The enemies you face are similar to those in Half-Life but with a few interesting additions. The aliens you face are more varied as are the weapons you can use to take them down. Opposing Force features some of the most imaginative weapons you can encounter in a first person shooter, from the gun that can teleport you, or your enemies, to destinations unknown to the grenade launcher that is actually a small alien that you feed explosive food to.Opposing Force is a great expansion pack, building on the world established in Half-Life and allowing the player to experience a familiar setting in a different light.

												Opposing Force is one of my favourite Half-Life games, and is an amazing addition to the first game. If you played Half-Life 1 and enjoyed it, OpFor delivers an intense, well-paced experience, and adds a lot more to the game. Playing through the Black Mesa Incident as the military is an interesting perspective, and adds to the complex lore of the Half-Life world. It leaves more questions than answers, as Half-Life games tend to do, which is a good thing. OpFor feels very different from the main game, and plays very different too. A lot of new weapons have been added, and although some are just reskinned versions of old weapons, the weapons here feel more militaristic than Gordon Freeman's patched together arsenal of stolen guns and scientific experiments. OpFor offers a lot of new content to Half-Life 1, and is an amazing experience for anyone who enjoyed the first game.			"

												There are some things you can never play enough. This is one of them.Building on the already genre defining work of Half Life, Opposing Force is perhaps my favourite of HL1.This expansion pack puts you in the jack-boots of cult favourite Adrian Shepard, and kits you up in a uniform that is all too familiar to the Freeman and Half Life players.As one of the military spec ops. marines, you'll see the Black Mesa incident from an entirely new perspective. So even before you exam the gameplay, this is a brilliant piece for fleshing out the story.But the gameplay is actually what makes OF work: It is, in my opinion, of a higher standard than the original game and introduces some fantastic ideas and elemants to the experiance. The player's arsenal increases exponentially, with a dismounted barnacle, electro-laser-xen gun, a teleportation device and the legendary SAW deserving special mention. You'll find no shortage of ways to splatter, maim and exact severe trauma on the interlopers of Xen !The slightly dodgy squad system can be lived with and is very rarely a problem.I recommend this with passion and zeal. A genuinely great piece of work that for me ticks more boxes than the Original Half Life.This is for Half Life fans, story fanatics and for those who may be forgetting just why Half Life is the monolith to the gaming industry that it is.Buy now!

												Eternal classic, no game is going to ever replace that one, better than the original Half Life, better character than Gordon, meet ""Adrian Shephard"" the most awesome badass marine ever. Experience the world of HL with lots of new incredible levels and a multiplayer so good that by far cant even be compared to the HL-WON one, or the Steam one.So many weapons and so many ways to kill that you'll end this game without having the experience of testing all the guns on all the enemies. A big game but could be bigger. Too bad ValvE dind't gave a better ending to this game. ValvE failed hard at putting Shephard unto stasis and never talking about him again. 9/10 game.Sincerly,Killah			"

												Okay, This is my favorite Half-Life mod PERIOD! It has all-new weapons, new player models, and new monsters! The only downside is NO MORE CROWBARS! :( Kinda sad because I think Half-Life is based off of crowbars crapped into zombies heads. Instead we have pipewrenches. But, they are a LOT stronger than crowbars. If you liked this review, talk to me! Username : Dr. Pepper			"

												This is the first of the spin-offs to the highly successful Half Life game, when I say ""spin-off"" I mean that the game is set in the same universe as the original Half Life game except focused on a different protagnogist. Opposing Force is about a marine named Colporal Adrien Shepard of the HECU Marines of the U.S.A. who is part of a platoon given orders from the government to eliminate all witnesses of the Black Mesa incident. Upon arriving at the outer reaches of the lab facility, the chopper Shepard was on got knock down and after that Shepard got knock out cold and eventually awakes inside the Black Mesa health ward. He soon realizes that the lab facility is over run by hostile aliens and various marines as well as Black Mesa staff members are either dead or horribly mutated. What started out as a simple government cover up is now a survival game for Shepard. With the aid of the last surviving marines and lab staff, Shepard must try to escape from Black Mesa, if he can that is. This was a great attempt to extend the Half Life story by introducing a different character witnessing the events of the Black Mesa incident during the same time frame. A few familiar characters reappear in the game including Barney Calhoun who provided aid to Gordon Freeman and the mysterious G-Man whom you encounter in the last game is present in this game where you get to see what he was doing when not being spotted by Gordon. Similar weapons from the previous game are usable along with newer weapons. While familiar enemies are present along with new enemies who didn't appear in the original game that help make this game less of a carbon copy. The flaws from the first Half Life are also in this game, but highly passable as the game has a great story and plenty of new and familiar locations to explore. The plot contains elements straight out of Full Metal Jacket, James Cameron's Aliens, and the first Predator that creates a military filled game that will satisfy military game fans. If you like Half Life, then you will like this game just as much.			"

												MindblowThat was the thing that i felt when i completed this game. I think it's hard to find a game that inverts the story of the original one, put the player into the role of the antagonist party -at least the human antagonist- and still be a good game. Well, Opposing Force turned out to be a fantastic game, besides some bugs that i encountered through my experience it stood well and took a place in my all time favorites.The story it self, the new protagonist, new allies and foes, new weapons and locations, all of the things mentioned before (and much more) mix and the product is a well paced, action packed story. I won't spoil the plot and things that appear in the game, in the end, it's worth a complete run of the game, to find what new dangers a secrets are found in Black Mesa in this visit in the feet -and boots- of Corporal Shepard.

												The game is really nice, if you don't look at THE STUPID AI OF YOUR TEAMMATES.Seriously, at a point you have to bring a medic into a building to make him heal an engineer that will open the door. First, you'll notice that the medic won't follow you in the building. Second, after PUSHING HIM FOR 5 MINUTES into the building (that's the only way I've managed to do it) you'll be able to make him heal the engi. Now, you have to PUSH THE ENGI FOR FIVE MORE MINUTES out of the building to make him open the door. He'll do it and run into the sentry turret that was right behind it. You destroy the turret, go into a corridor, and find laser mines. I left the crouch button at the wrong time and DIED. I had to do it all again to continue. I didn't.*BIG EDIT* : The AI of teammates works fine if you just go on without bothering with them. I'm guessing the game teleports them where you're not looking, allowing them to get through difficult bits (for bots) of the maps and go where you want them to. This changes my previously negative review into a positive one, as the game has a lot of fun to offer past the point I got stuck at, via new monsters, new weapons, new boss battles, etc !			"

												As time has gone on since I played the first two Half-Life games, I've felt my finger twitch with Half-Life withdrawal. I've wanted to go back to the lack of cutscenes, smooth gameplay, and nailbiting enemies. So, I decided to go back to one of the original expansions for the game made by a young Gearbox Interactive.Oddly enough, it doesn't have the stench of Borderlands covering it, despite the insane new guns added.Half-Life: Opposing Force is a new story taking place during the Black Mesa incident, only now told through the perspective of the marines sent in to capture him, namely one marine named Adrian Shepard, who also has the similar affliction of mute-protagonist that Gordon Freeman has. You go through some of the same events around the crumbling science lab, while fighting a new range of alien enemies with a few new weapons. The game functions just like the original Half-Life. Slippery running, terrible ladders, and tight gunplay all bundled into one old-school PC video game wet dream. The new weapons are pretty effective. My favorite was the equivalent of the BFG from DOOM. No matter what size the enemy you're fighting is, one hit from the gun will immediately destroy them, which will come in handy with all the new alien species that have been thrown in to f*** up your perfectly fine day.All that aside, one problem that comes from Opposing Force is that the story isn't anything new. Sure, there's some new developments that bring further light to the conflict between the marines and their federal higher-ups, but it's just more Half-Life. And, yeah, more Half-Life is fine, but I'd just prefer the story do something a little more new than just follow the same events of Freeman, only through new eyes. It's just a 5 hour long version of Half-Life that wouldn't make sense to anyone that hadn't played the original game first.Opposing Force is still a fun 5-hour long campaign that I felt was worth the money I put into it. If you enjoyed the first Half-Life, you'll still love this expansion. It's just nothing really new or inventive, but as an expasion to an original game... does it really have to be? I'm giving Half-Life: Opposing Force an 8/10. It's a great little experience, but isn't quite as great as it's foundation on which it was constructed.			"

												I enjoyed this one and feel this is the best of the 3. The campaign is shorter then Half-Life but longer then Blue Shift. Compared to Half-Life it actually feels like there is a story to follow, and although there are no hints on what to do. The game doesn't leave you stranded without any clues.The exclusive weapons in this one are fun to use, although the fun ones come quite late in the game.The boss fight in this one is a little underwhelming, and too easy even on the highest difficulty which is really the only negative thing I can say about this game.In conclusion this one is the best of the 3 with an interesting perspective to compliment the original half-life and a interesting weapon selection. The campaign is a proper length just the boss fight feels rushed.			"

Overall the storyline and gameplay follows the same story and mission objectives as the original game but with way more guns and enemies. Alot faster paced and a few new added features such as climbing ropes to stop it from just being a repeat of the original game.

												This is one of the best expansion packs/add-ons ever made.It adds new weapons, new enemies, new game mechanics, not to mention a nice ""fill in the gaps"" or ""what the other half did"" addition to the story and narrative of the original game. I won't spoil much. It plays the same as Half-Life, albeit it is a bit more difficult towards the end and the new enemies will rip you a new one or two.Definitely get this if you yearn for more Black Mesa action!			"

												If you have played Half-Life and at least liked it then you should definetely check Opposing Force out!It looks like nothing special, coming from a different developer, but actually it doesn't seem so bad once you start playing. The game takes place at the same time as the original, but this time around you are playing as Adrian Shepherd. You are with the military and your job is to stop Freeman.The expansion offers some new weapons, enemies, locations, puzzles and another really interesting boss battle.It is, overall, the same experience from a different point of view!Pros:+New Content+Captures the Spirit of the Original+Decent StorylineCons:-Old Graphics-Nothing New as Gameplay8/10 - Good but not as good as Half-Life!

												Half Life: Opposing Force is one of the most unlucky gaming expericences I ever had. It took me 3 times to beat the entire game. Luckily its not the game's fault, and overall the game is fantastic. If it weren't for the Final Boss being slightly disapointing and Broken Miltary A.I., I would say it could've beaten Half Life 2 (My second favorite Half Life game). The weapons are completely Badass, the new Aliens are really cool, and the some of the Puzzels are really good.If you were to buy Half Life :Blue Shift or this, Buy this first.			"

												A really great expansion to another really great game. Opposing Force shows a different perspective of the events of Half-Life, and it is really great to see why some things happend while playing as Gordon Freeman in Half-Life that occured because of playing as Shepard in Opposing Force. The gameplay and graphics are still the same, but this time I personally feel like the weapons are more unique and fun to use than the weapons that Gordon had. My only complaints are that certain parts of the game can feel a bit repetative and bland, because you have already seen it once before. Also some parts are frustratingly difficult and if you have low health you may get stuck in a loop of death for a while, as there are even less health pickups than in Half-Life, and the final boss is pretty lame in my opinion. Other than that, Opposing Force is a super solid expansion to a super solid game.8.5/10			"

												In short: the best single player experience of Half-Life, practically no multiplayer available (=two players on one server during a recent check). The voice acting is great, especially ""Duke Nukem"" i.e. Jon St. Jon as various drill instructors. OF adds a whole slew of new enemies and new weapons to the game, so that the player has many different situations AND weapons options in dealing with them. There is only one Gargantua this time and killing it is completely optional, so there is no longer need to conserve explosives and RPG rockets. Roughly a half of the time you have a squad of multiple soldiers with you much like in The Thing to add some variety. Unfortunately, there are quite a lot of box-movement puzzles and crawling through air ducts again and again and again, so there is some boring content too. The story involves fighting against xenomorphs and stopping Black Ops from blowing up Black Mesa. The level design is really good sans the annoying rope mechanics. There are are some playthroughs of this game in 90 minutes and the multiplayer is dead, so consider carefully if this one is worth your five bucks. If I had to pick only one HL 1 product to buy, it would be this one. The original Half-Life single player does not even compare to this one.			"

												If you wanna play in order:Half-Life > Half-Life: Opposing Force > Half-Life: Blue ShiftI enjoyed it. Play it if you want to know more about the story and what happened to Black Mesa. Don't get your hopes up for anything as good as Half-Life though. I wasn't really immersed in this as I was it's predecessor. I'm not knocking this game at all. It's good, but it's not ""Half-Life"" if you know what I mean. Oh and one more gripe. The final boss of this game is pretty lack luster in my opinion. Now if you'll excuse me it's time for me to beat Blue Shift.Edit: I just read a review and felt as though I talked a little too bad about the game. Once again, it's good. That's why I'm reccomending it. The new weapons are great and really do add to the experience. I just said it's not ""Half-Life"" and I'm standing by it. That could be a good thing though. It's not just some clone trying to attempt to be as good as Half-Life and copy exactly what Valve did. It's a game on it's on showing you neat things and adding more to the original story.			"

												Probably one of the best Half Life games ever; and maybe one of the only good ""games"" Gearbox made. Opposing Force adds new weapons, npcs, and a whole new turtorial and lots of new maps that just fit into place perfectly, with only a few flaws that hindered the original Half-Life. I'd reccomend the Sierra version as not only does the re-release on steam forgets a few things, (The CTF Gamemode for multiplayer) but you'll also giving money to one of the worst companies to date (Gearbox). It's still a look at for not just any valve or FPS fan, but for anybody who loves Video Games as a whole.			"

												Opposing Force takes the already amazing experience of Half-Life 1, and added a whole new (figurative) dimension to it. This time, you witness the marine invasion from the eyes of a soldier, who is separated from the rest of his squad, and forced to try to escape. With tons of new weapons, and almost all of the old ones, Opposing Force will, at the very least, give you a lot of big things to shoot with crazy guns. I'm serious. One of the guns is a giant tadpole that vomits spores. Just go buy it. It's only $5. Don't you wanna kill big aliens with a giant alien tadpole?			"

												Opposing Force is a mixed bag for me. Pros: Opposing Force adds a few new weapons that for the most part are good.The game also adds new story to the Half Life games which is always good.Cons: The A.i in Opposing Force is just horrible and it's worse then in any other Half Life game.This is also the Half Life game with the most (and worst) glitches, I won't go into all of them but the worst is in a sewer part of the game and if you save your game during this part the whole game breaks and you have to delete your save files to fix it!I would still recimmend buying it because of the story it adds but watch out for the glitches.FINAL GRADE: 6/10			"

I would recomend instead that you buy the half-life pack when its on sale. That happens usually a few times a year.			"

												Half-life: Opposing Force is essentially an expanded DLC content wrapped in a standalone package.  In this ""game"" you take control of the enemy from the original Half-Life.  You are a member of the military force invading Black Mesa Research Facility.  You learn the story of this new character, and through the story of your own, you wind up intertwining with Gordon Freeman during a few of the major plot points of the original title, paralleling him the whole time.This turns out to be a genuinely good addition to the story, but isn't anything vital to the canonical storyline of Half-Life.I'd recommend this title to anyone who thoroughly enjoyed the original game, and wants to expand on its events.

												I remember this a few years ago when i decided to pick this up when steam was rolling along. There is a specific instance where when you are about to leave the last part of the Biome level and you have to use the Barnacle weapon to move on to the next area, and half-way through the transistion the game hangs up without fail and the only way to fix this is to get yourself a save point file that happens right after all of this happens.Other than that really, REALLY specific game-breaking error, this has a good singleplayer story expansion pack where you take part in Black Mesa's massive error through the eyes of one of the soldiers that are trying to wipe away any traces left of whatever that one dude Gordon Freeman may or may not have done. Your name is Corporal Shepherd, and you are part of a team that is supposed to kill this Freeman Character. The next events that take place in this expansion pack are what happens near the end of the original Half-Life game, and this is the part where hunting for this freeman character is the least of your worries.I think Gearbox Software did a pretty good job with this one, I mean after all, they did a pretty good job enough to where they started to do their own thing i guess. Bottom line on this game, if you crave for more Half-Life action after completing the original, this is the next stop.			"

												First off, wow. For a splinter game, it can hold it's own pretty well that I feel that I could safely recommend this game. The weapon choice alone pertain to a variation with half of the same weapons from the origin Half-life an other half existing only within this game. The title ""Opposing Force"" is a bit misleading in that corporal Shepard may work for the military, but his mission objective never quite reached him. The story development does a good job at providing Shepard with a reasonable excuse to not confront Freeman or have to kill any of the scientist. Similar to Blue shift there was a larger focus on the tactical part of the gameplay, yet intriguing puzzle still pop up at regular intervals.  Thankfully there are not too many cases of if-you-mess-this-up-there-is-no-going-back scenerios, but I've bumped into several mess-ups where loading to my last save was in my best interest. I recommend as you play through that you pay some attention to details around you such as a security guard going for a specail discount with a vending machine, and a scientist discovering the wonders of electricity in a way Benjamin Franklin would highly discourage. On another note, I appreciate the detail in adding night vision goggle instead of using a flashlight, but I still prefer the flashlight on the basis that it's easier on my eyes.  Too, you'll soon notice a mysterious set of aliens that never appeared in Half-life before. In fact, I don't think that these alien ever reappear within the Half-life series again. I could be wrong, but for now there's no that I could think of. Importantly, the game provided a satisfying ending. Don't believe me? Then you're welcome to see for yourself. Chances are someone did a thorough walkthrough of the game.			"

												I enjoyed this one and feel this is the best of the 3. The campaign is shorter then Half-Life but longer then Blue Shift. Compared to Half-Life it actually feels like there is a story to follow, and although there are no hints on what to do. The game doesn't leave you stranded without any clues.The exclusive weapons in this one are fun to use, although the fun ones come quite late in the game.The boss fight in this one is a little underwhelming, and too easy even on the highest difficulty which is really the only negative thing I can say about this game.In conclusion this one is the best of the 3 with an interesting perspective to compliment the original half-life and a interesting weapon selection. The campaign is a proper length just the boss fight feels rushed.			"

												Half-Life: Opposing Force is an awesome expansion pack to the original Half-Life, but this time from the point of view of a Marine. The storylines of this game run parrallel to the original Half-Life. It is nice to see the different perspective of people in the incident of Black Mesa. The squad experience is fun at times since it adds a little more depth of the situation that there are some struggles that you don't have the expertise to figure out on your own. Some of the iconic moments are still featured with some new exciting moments. This is a must play game to the Half-Life Franchise to get the whole scope of what's happening.			"

He has lots of anger towards to world because his mum gave him a girl's name. When he's not 360 noscoping noobs, Adrian solves puzzles and runs around fighting aliens and stuff. Occasionally you see Gordon run around, mopping floors and Gordon's creepy job placement supervisor wanders around watching Shepard and taking photos while breathing heavily.			"

												To me, this was the best in the Half-Life 1 series. Playing Half-Life 1 as a HECU soldiers sent in to Black Mesa to kill everyone in sight, especially Gordon who caused all of this in the first place. It shows you a lot more of the game, behind the scenes of whats going on from a different perspective.It gave you more weapons, enemies, and pretty much everything.They dont make games like this anymore. BUY IT.			"

												Be Adrian Shephard this time and feel the Half Life story again on his opposite side.This is, by far, the longest and most difficult game in Half Life series. Comparing it with Half Life and Hl: Blue Shift, Hl:Opposing Force has more action, more different kind of weapons and more enemies. However this game has less puzzle situations than the other two.

												Half Life Opposing Force is an amazing and enjoyable game introducing new characters and new content to a already awesome game (half life) and has a completely different feeling to it in my opinion than half life. Taking the role of Adrian Shepard as the marines is a whole new way off looking at black mesa. The way they tie everything up with the first half life is extremely enjoyable. The whole game is worth buying as it increase the thick atmosphere and story of half life. If your a fan of the lore and would enjoy a view of black mesa from a different perspective this is a very good grab and the whole game play and level design is just as good as half life's as well. A must grab for all half life fans!			"

												This is one of the best half life games. Even though it is short is has cool new guns and features like the LMG and rope climbing. The training room actually made me feel like a soldier in Boot Camp			"

												A very successful expansion pack for the original Half Life 1, so successful that it is not exaggerating to say that OF can be a stand alone game. Expanding the HL universe, providing new experience but still as thrilling as the original HL. For those who love HL, this game pushes you further into the universe of Half Life; for newbie, welcome to half life.			"

												God, I love this game. Not only does it have new weapons and enemies, which is something Blue Shift lacks, but it also goes in depth into some unexplained parts of the story, such as what happens to Black Mesa and why the Black Operatives are there. What a nice twist to the story. It also has free multiplayer. As of this review, I'm currently playing it through a third time, and have yet to get tired of it. I definitely like it better than Half Life.			"

												great new places to explore, new arsenal of weapons, and a great new arsenal of weapons. There may be a few glitches here and there so be sure to save alot of times(I recommend at least when 2 to 4 enemies are killed or platforming)			"

												Pretty good story expansion. Half life from the view of one of the marines was a pretty good idea. Pros: Easy to learn controls, decent graphics, hardly ever lags. Cons: Enemies seem to be more difficult than in half life, and enemies seem to be faster, and grenade happy. I give it a 4.5/5.			"
