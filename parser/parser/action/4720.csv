												I feel disgusting. I've been beating homeless people and torture victims to death with a shovel in the ruins of a special ed school. This is so I can find a man missing an arm and part of his face so he can tell me about who did that to him, so I can find the guy hunting THAT guy. I might go back and do it all again, too, because I only found five of the six rotten bird carcasses hidden in that particular building.Welcome to Condemned: Criminal Origins, the most grotesque window into urban decay masquerading as a game I've ever experienced (and yes I've played Kingpin). You play FBI special agent Ethan Thomas as he tracks down a serial killer known as the Match Maker through the derelict underbelly of what I can only assume is Detroit. Your quest will take you through offices, schools, libraries, and estates, each one in an incredible state of disrepair. These ruins are populated with murderous hobos of all shapes and sizes, representing a mysterious psychosis affecting the city in relation to a plague of dead birds.If that all sounds insane, you've got a good idea of what you're getting into. The game starts with a clever forensics scene where you get to use a spread of investigative tools to extract clues from the Match Maker's latest tableaux. Immediately thereafter the game shifts to skulking through dark halls and clubbing people with rebar. You'll come across plenty more opportunities to use your forensics tools, of course, but those moments are islands in a sea of hobo blood. There are also simple puzzles to solve, often by finding a specific weapon like a crowbar or fire axe to pass a roadblock. Again, you're going to have to kill a dozen people to find it, though.Combat-heavy games are usually light on horror, but Condemned is a remarkable exception to that rule. The vast majority of combat is hand-to-hand, with firearms being rare and brief escapes from bludgeoning foes. You'll be armed just as your enemies are, with pipes pulled from walls or tools scrounged from garbage piles. Opponents often approach silently, lie in wait behind corners, and attack in groups, putting you at all sorts of disadvantages. But more than that, combat itself can be a tense and horrifying endeavor. Your character is fully modeled, meaning you have feet you can watch that slow you down when you turn or try to navigate stairs. This adds weight and a delay to your actions, along with a palpable sense of vulnerability. Hits also have weight to them, a sickening one at that, and your enemies grow more twisted as the game progresses.The atmosphere of acute urban decay becomes one of the most effective parts of the horror, when you have gaunt, deranged vagrants crawling out of sewer grates and breaking down rotten walls to crack your skull open. Condemned does a fantastic job of making you feel alone and threatened in a world that SHOULD be benign. A subway station after hours becomes a nest of crawling degenerates, with creepy treks down the darkened tracks and desperate searches just to get past a jammed door or turnstile. The sound design contributes in a big way, filling the air with subtle, ambient dread and holding back stingers until they're most effective.The few problems I do have with Condemned stem from its age. As good as the design is across disciplines, the graphics have aged rather poorly. The major characters are blurry, lumpy figures that resemble reskinned Gears of War characters for how bulky and hunched they are. You'll also be seeing a lot of the same garbage piles copy-pasted throughout the lengthy levels. And while you'll get a few chills out of seeing enemies scamper past the next doorway, they literally never stop using that spook and it actually starts to kill tension around the 30th time you see it.There's a lot more to recommend about Condemned than to criticize, of course. Both the horror and the combat are top-notch, the investigations are a great change of pace, the sound design is incredible (especially the voice overs, unexpectedly so), and the story helps keep you rolling forward even if it does end in a pretty weird place. It's far from the prettiest game out there, and some of the design is very clearly from earlier FPSes, but if that won't bother you there's six to eight hours of spooks and splatter to enjoy. Condemned did a rare thing for me, which was scare me in a way I wanted more of, and it deserves plenty of praise and attention for that.			"

												Ever just want to rip a pipe out of a wall and crack someone over the head?   Don't try this at home or at your place of business :)While my play time on Steam will appear non existent, I have played Condemned every year since it's 2005 introduction. Containing multiple endings, Condemned, a first person psychological horror, offers the player a chance to experience some of the most well implemented melee combat that has ever been produced.  A great variety of melee weapons are available and weapons such as rebar, pipes and locker doors can be pulled literally right out of the environment.  Weapons are not limited to Melee.  Ranged weapons are limited in availability and include but are not limited to rifles, pistols and shotguns.  Ammo is limited to what is loaded in the weapon so shots count.  Run out of ammo?  Ranged weapons also double as melee weapons.  Melee weapons are rated by damage, swing speed, block time and reach.Condemned builds great atmosphere. Its story is told through the brilliance of forensic investigation using forensic tools and activley involves you in crime scene investigations. Condemned was released in 2005 and you can tell by the games character modelling however the environment that the game presents remains outstanding. The game's engine loads as fast as any engine I've seen and keeps load times to a bare minimum.  Great use of sound and nice visuals complement the immersive story.  The weapons of Condemned.In February 2008 all copies of Condemned were confiscated in Germany because of §131 StGB. Distribution in Germany is now prohibited by law.*Source:Wikipedia[en.wikipedia.org].			"

												Okay, so you've probably heard of this game before. It was developed by Monolith Studios alongside F.E.A.R., so yeah, there's good things to expect here. You play as Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent stationed in NYC who's framed for the murder of two fellow police officers and is being chased by the Bureau while he attempts to find clues and follow the trail of the real criminal behind it all. The atmosphere is superb and full of creepy noises and heart-pumping suspense to go with the eerie locales including (but not limited to) an abandoned subway, an abandoned department store (WITH CREEPY AS ♥♥♥♥ TELEPORTING MANNEQUINS), an abandoned school... yeah a lot of abandoned areas, hence ""Condemned"". Complete with these areas are enemies galore, all of which are pretty much mentally screwed up drug addicts, both minor and major. The combat is satisfyingly brutal, crunchy, and has a great weight to it with every hit. It requires precision timing when blocking too, and takes a bit of practice to get it right. You can pretty much pick up anything layed about to use as a weapon (really, even a friggin' desk drawer) and firearms come into play later on. Weapons are plentiful, and health pill cabinets are found pretty easily throughout the game. It took about 8-9 hours to complete for me, so it's certainly every bit worth the price you pay, even if you don't get it on sale. Really, if you're a horror fan, this is a MUST BUY!			"

												This was a game I picked up based on a bunch of recommendations from various imageboards and a few friends. For what it’s worth, Condemned: Criminal Origins lives up to the hype and immerses you in a world of filth, horror, and redemption. You play the role of Ethan Thomas, a FBI agent tasked with tracking down serial killers, who ends up wrongfully accused of a crime he didn’t commit. Your desire for exoneration drives you to follow a trail of madness with only your FBI lab tools and intuition to guide you.During the game, you will be spending your time doing one of the following: combat or forensics. In the combat phase, gameplay resembles that of a first-person shooter or beat-em-up requiring you to either aim carefully or time your blocking and movement so as to avoid taking damage. You also get a taser which is extremely useful in situations where you are facing groups or enemies with firearms. For the forensic phase, you will draw upon an array of tools to scan the surrounding area and collect the necessary information to continue the storyline. The implement used is automatically decided on depending on the circumstance and you are only required to point it at the very obvious area of interest in just about every instance, so there really isn’t much of a challenge. It’s basically just a vehicle used to drive the story forward. Regarding the story, everything is “good enough” and just about all the loose ends get tied up by the end so you won’t need to draw your own conclusions for the most part.Earlier in my backlog, I came across another murder mystery with a few similar themes (Deadly Premonition) and I’d have to say this is definitely the better of the two, at least story-wise. Be sure to pick it up if you want a little horror-mystery hybrid in your life. "

												Condemned is a deeply atmospheric and violent horror game. You're a crime scene investigator: you start off by visiting a crime scene and use forensic tools to determine what happened there. After the initial investigation you find out the suspect is still in the building and go to corner him, but in a turn of events he manages to grab your pistol and you get conked out. You wake up to find you're wanted for two murders you didn't commit and must now clear your name by tracking down this maniac killer through some of the eeriest parts of the city.Condemned is a standout game when it comes to horror because of its immersive level design. Environments are extremely well fleshed out and thick with atmosphere. The gritty realistic detail in textures is particularly impressive, especially for a 2005 game, and because the horror and scares are subtle and more psychological in nature there is a genuine tenseness when exploring a new area. Not to mention that most of the derelict places you wander through are so dark you're forced to go in with just a flashlight to light your way... it definitely recalls some of my creepier urban exploration adventures!

Besides having an immersive horror atmosphere, Condemned shines in its brutal melee combat. It's especially impressive how realistic the enemies movements to your blows are. The most unique part of the combat is you can pull your weapon arsenal right from the environment: pry out a rebar pipe, rip the door from a locker, snatch a metal sign to get bloodied up - every location has its own host of makeshift weapons to put to good use. Oh, and I like that the enemy AI will fight each other if one of them accidentally hits the other - nice touch. Admittedly the gameplay when it comes to the forensic stuff is forcibly linear. They shoehorn you into only being able to use one type of scanner or tool when you have an array at your disposal and you are basically only doing it to move the story along. It's still fairly interesting and interactive though, and the findings you report will give you clues into what's really going on and what to do next.

												Condemned: Criminal Origins features a story of a detective who ends up on the run due to strange circumstances. He's after a demented serial killer, and to catch him and clear his name, he must take to the underbelly of the city. However, something strange is going on. Homeless people that have taken to living in abandoned buildings and tunnels are acting needlessly aggressive and violent. But it's more than just that, something darker, more sinister is thriving in the unseen places of this city...Featuring a rather well-done and satisfying melee-focused combat system (seriously, not exaggerating, it has one of the best melee combat systems in a first-person type of game in my opinion), you'll find yourself exploring 10 different locations through the game, and periodically using some gadgets and gizmos for forensic sciences to try and track your killer. But of course, the best parts of the game aren't the combat or the detective work (though neither are bad!).The horror element in this game doesn't really fully reveal itself until the later half of the game, which I think is an interesting choice. The atmosphere in this game is fantastic for certain, but things start to get seriously creepy and a bit unpredictable about half-way in. It's interesting as most horror games like to sort of blow their load at the start and then fuel the survival element in the second half of the game with more and more difficult enemies. This game does get harder per say, but its horror element really starts to shine in its second half, and I even think there may be less enemies in the second half of the game as well.There are some very clever scares here, but honestly most of the horror comes from a really dreary atmosphere the game has, which is particularly strong in three specific locations/chapters in the later half. The story is interesting, though in this titles case I think you'll end off with more questions than answers (which might be for the best, as the sequel shows).It's not perfect. Most notably, the final chapter and boss are a bit disappointing (a shame as they're promising in concept but just not executed all that well), but the game is definitely worth checking out for any horror enthusiasts out there. Most of the title has excellent execution and atmosphere, and it truly is one of the best horror games to have released in the last 10 years.			"

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first-person psychological horror game by Monolith, renown for kickstarting the F.E.A.R. franchise, where the player takes the role of Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent who gets framed by a serial killer for killing his colleagues during a crime investigation. This sets motion for the events that are to follow in which Ethan, guided by his only trustworthy ally who believes he was not behind the killings, has to hunt down the real serial killer. In the meantime, Ethan also begins noticing the sudden increase in some very peculiar events that occur around him and to almost every person he meets.As a survival horror, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a “beautiful” experience. What I mean by that is that the game focuses more on eerie atmosphere and enigmas reminiscent of games like Penumbra. No overuse of cheap jump scares and excessive gory imagery. For me, this is what I always wanted in a horror game which in recent years Frictional Games have always successfully provided for my fix. But even when the game ends up using these tropes for one or two occasions, they are well placed in the game and not overstay their welcome. Sure, the game also throws in a few supernatural elements, which I do not want spoil for obvious reasons, into the mix later on that make the experience even more petrifying. Frankly, there are quite a number of things which Condemned: Criminal Origins nails perfectly, and one of them is certainly the stellar audio design. The moment you hear all that tromping upstairs or around you, you truly start believing you could bend a steel pipe by how tense your butt cheeks are. I am not joking when I am saying that I occasionally pondered whether the real name of this game should have been Condemned: The Ferret Tromping. Likewise, the great soundtrack compliments the atmosphere and fits with the tone of the game. You can feel the cold shivers running down your spine. Bloody violins.When not wetting your pants like a sissy, Condemned’s gameplay is mostly all about melee encounters. Even though you can use a few firearms, their ammunition limitation makes them only worthwhile and effective in the short term. I suppose the best firearm is the taser as it can momentarily stun your enemies, giving you a window of opportunity to either steal their weapons or take an effortless shot at them, but it is useless against boss fights. Instead, you will be spending the majority of the time with melee objects such as pipes, planks, sledgehammers, axes, crowbars and many more, smacking your opponents to death. Whilst the melee combat might not feel exactly like in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare in terms of variety of moves, every swing has a “weight” to it. Thereby every miss you make can decide whether you will stay alive any longer. Now each weapon in the game has its own benefits and downsides. Some can deal more damage but are slower to manoeuvre and others deal less damage but are swifter. Honestly, the melee combat is perhaps amongst the best aspects of this game as it makes you think and move tactically. It feels satisfying too.For a horror game, I think the AI in here is exceptional. Most of the human enemies will try to play hide and seek rather than simply attacking the player the moment they are spotted. Moreover, they do not just hide in one spot; they constantly switch their positions. This makes encounters unpredictable and always different in each playthrough. Naturally, there are a couple of scripted moments designed specifically to scare the player in the game, but thankfully these are very few.In terms of graphical fidelity, the game shows its age quite clearly. There is no denying in saying that it feels visually “consolised” as the textures do look all muddy and the excessive bloom (when turned on) reminds me of games on a Xbox 360 from 2006. But in terms of art direction, it does a good job on the various designs of the enemies you can come across and the environments that almost feel like you actually visited them in real life. Additionally, the second half of the game, from a level design stand point, is much better and scarier.Of course, the game is not without its fair share of problems. First off, there are sections in the game which require you to take down some sort of a obstacle like a (wooden) door to advance to the next area. Being in the possession of an axe most of the time, at least in my case, one would think that would suffice. But you thought wrong as the game explicitly tells the player that it requires a specific weapon, like a sledgehammer, to take it down instead. This leads to going back and doing a couple of fetch-quests looking for the right item. Plus, you cannot guess what item  will require next time. Luckily, the aforementioned item generally tends to be nearby. Now, my main gripe with this is the simple fact that it is purely stupid. I have an axe, why cannot I take it down? Why do I need a different weapon which has pretty much an identical function as an axe in the game’s context?Then there is Ethan’s walking pace and stamina. The game gives the player the ability to sprint, but only lasts as long as “running” from one end of the room to the next.  It is not even running; it is a very slow jog. You see, it totally makes sense walking slowly in the more atmospheric segments of the game where you are in a pitch dark environment holding your melee weapon and a flashlight in hopes that nothing will startle you, but there are many occasions where that is not necessary -- such as when you have to backtrack in areas which you have already cleared out. This can be rather irritating when you are forced by the game to walk so slowly. It feels like the developers were somehow scared that people would sprint their way through the game, breaking the immersion they tried to achieve.The next issue which I am about to discuss is not too serious, but the forensics investigations in this game are sadly meaningless since you are always told where and what to search for. Take your scanning equipment, focalise it on the object you want to analyse, press click and presto you are the greatest forensics specialist in the world. Personally, I strongly believe this is where the game missed its biggest opportunity to deepen its gameplay. Not only that, but it could have made you feel almost like a detective, looking for clues and making deductions.Being a very linear game is not an excuse for the repetitive gameplay. The melee combat is definitely fun and rewarding, but after a few hours you will realise that smacking people’s heads and balls is what you will be doing almost the entirety of the game. It can get tiresome after a while due to the lack of variety. Because of that, the level design can also feel a bit too claustrophobic at times with its very narrow corridors and awful FOV. See, this is where a more complex and appealing forensics mechanic could have been handy to bring some proper variety.And lastly, while the game’s story starts out very promising, leaving the player with many questions and interpretations, it falls flat right towards the end. You can already smell the Indigo Prophecy stench from miles away, and that is one nightmare I try to not remember. The approach of “show, do not tell” which is adopted in the first three quarters of the game is well executed, because you know, a mystery is ruined the moment you bluntly explain it, but the ending kind of ruins most of that. I even think the last scene of the game nullified your entire journey.In conclusion, Condemned: Criminal Origins ticks all the boxes for a solid psychological survival horror game. Despite some questionable design choices and a rather abysmal ending, it is singlehandedly one of the scariest experiences out there, and I am not saying that lightly. Clocking around 6-8 hours, I would say that it has about the right length, so if you like horror games, pick this one up.			"

												Ah the good old classical condemned criminal origins, a game not many people know of. A hidden gem as some call it.Storyline 10/10The storyline of the game is perfect, it has it's twists and surprises. You start off as agent thomas who's been framed for second degree murder and is being hunted down by the bureau. If you enjoy detective work and a great meaningful story this game is for you!Controls 7/10The controls for the game could have been better thought of, what annoyed me a little was the fact that there is no jump button...You use spacebar to kick. Another thing that seemed strange to me was the reload system, there is none. If you press the button R it just shows you how much ammo is left in the gun. What could have imporved it was if you could transfer one ammo clip into a different gun or just put it in your pocket.A.I. 8/10Its funny how the A.I.works in the environment of the game, they use walls and small debris to hide. I did notice the A.I. running around one box trying to figure out how to catch me better xDGraphics 10/10I honestly can't complain about the graphics, they were amazing. There is an option to set the graphics to the lowest where you can barely see the outline of a gun or set them to highest and see a loose screw on the ground. Options 10/10The game offers plenty of options to change the sound, graphics, difficulty. Unfortunately you can't change the fov ingame, you have to manualy go into the folder and change settings.Gameplay 9/10The gameplay is one of the most important parts of the game and this game got it perfectly, I didn't find a moment while playing where I was bored. As I stated earlier you are a detective so that means you get to do some detective work right? YEAH! You're mission is to catch the one who framed you, serial killer X and you do so by following clues hes left behind. Somehow you have pockets the size of buckets. Every time you find a clue you take out a different machine or device to catch fingerprints or dna samples which you send to your partner in crime, Rosa. Following up all the clues you start to wonder who the serial killer X really as. (It tells you at the end of the game.) This game took me 15 hours to complete without rushing and dying over and over xDFinal Verdict 8/10This game is something else, a game not many people realize has potential. If you ever get the chance you should play it. I had a lot of fun and many raging moments in the game, but that's just me being a noob xD			"

												One of my favorite horror video games. It's a really dark and twisted murder mystery in first-person perspective, with a lot of beefy and satisfying melee combat. The combat is very engaging and intense with smart enemy AI, almost like a fight in real life would feel like. There are guns too, but you can't rely on them completely since ammo is limited and hard to find. So when you do happen to have a gun to use, it is a special privilege. So you mainly have to resort to grabbing some 2x4 or pipe in the environment and whack some foos, usually freaky ♥♥♥ deranged hobos and psychotic killers.You also have a bunch of very neat investigator tools and a taser that aren't just tacked on gimmicks; these mechanics actually make the gameplay very different from other FPSs. The investigation work brings some adventure/puzzle aspects to it. In fact, calling this game an FPS really doesn't describe the game as well as it ought to, nor does calling it a survival horror game or an adventure game. It's quite a special blend of all those aspects. And yes, it is scary. One of the scariest video games I can think of. And with a compelling story, if you ask me.If you like Monolith's F.E.A.R. series, Condemned is made by those very same people and is every bit as good (perhaps even better, in terms of a horror game). If you want to play something unique and different (and also really good) in the FPS or horror genres, I highly recommend Condemned. Unfortunately, the also very very fun (but more action-y and melee combat-focused) Condemned 2 never got a PC version. Maybe someday, I hope...			"

												Good non-traditional horror game with one major flaw--it's the same thing over and over and over again.  Still, that thing (winding through the environment and fighting) is done really well, so I recommend the game.Melee combat is pretty challenging, and you'll likely die here and there. It's kind of one of those old school deals where you learn from your mistakes. The weapons, and there are a ton of them, all have their own feel, swing at different speeds, and are fun to use.  The health system is well designed. You always seem to find med packs when you really need them.  Overall, level design is really clever for a linear game with very little backtracking.Looking at this before purchase, I wondered how scary it could be running into homeless people.  Turns out, it's pretty darn scary, particularly in areas where the environment opens up and you can hear someone but can't figure out where the noise is coming from.  Sound plays a key role in the scares.To conclude, if you don't mind that the gameplay is basically the same all the way through, it's a good get for horror fans.			"

												It's been a while since I completed this game but I never took the time to write a little recommendation. I think it deserves one. It's a bit of an underrated game but it's also not your typical FPS. This is all about brutal and satisfying melee combat with an occasional gun you pickup that contains a handful of bullets at most. You also have some fancy equipment at your disposal for your forensic research. The games is developed by the same studio that brought us the first two F.E.A.R. games, wich is clearly noticeable. The game can be absolutely terrifying at times with a memorable jumpscare later in the game. If you are interested in an FPS with an intriguing story, you like the idea of a heavy focus on melee combat and you can live with heavily outdated graphics, this is definitely worth to take a look at.

												Condemned draws from the depths of our most primal fears: fear of the dark, fear of what is not seen, and fear unhealthy screams. This pestilential atmosphere and horrifying send the mat tenors of survival horror, especially when you pair the violence of the fighting. However, I regret that the gameplay is as sadly guided, Monolith not letting any initiative to the player.			"

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first-person survival horror game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sega. Released for the Xbox 360 on November 16, 2005 (and a PC port on April 11, 2006), it got mostly positive reviews for its atmosphere and the emphasis on melee combat, and was a moderate success for Monolith Productions. It went on to be considered as a classic of the survival horror genre, and is frequently mentioned as one of the scariest games on the market.What I Liked(+)The game starts strong; the first few cutscenes and gameplay sections present the story in an intriguing manner, and the tense atmosphere is consistent throughout the campaign.(+)Simple gameplay mechanics, but has some depth to it because of various weapon statistics like speed, blocking power, and damage; the enemy also has different behaviors and attack patterns, forcing the player to be tactical, rather than aggressive. Emphasizes melee combat over guns; there are only 1-3 guns available per level, and usually have low ammo if picked up.(+)The AI is as smart and cunning as those in F.E.A.R. (another Monolith Productions game) and behaves in a convincing manner. The player encounters a lot of aggressive drug addicts during the game, and they will make sure that your brain is splattered all over the wall by any means necessary; be it by hiding in the darkness to ambush you, whacking the back of your head when you're not looking, and disguising themselves as part of the environment for the perfect surprise. A neat way to deal with their numbers is to trick an enemy into hitting the fellow by his side, and they'll take their sweet time sorting that problem out - mainly in the form of a steel pipe to the face.What I didn't Like(-)Loses its traction near the end, and quickly shifts its tone from a slow-paced crawl to an adrenaline-fueled murderfest.(-)A lot of levels feels like filler content; added for the sake of prolonging the game. Throughout its 10 chapters, only a half of those actually presented something valuable to the overall story. Everything else is a walk through a checklist of places where spooky stuff might happen.And there you have it.			"

A pretty cool horror game with a story that has its pretty unfitting moments and an odd ending that didn't seem to make sense I found.The plot for the whole thing is pretty simple, you're framed by a killer of two cops and you're on a journey to find him. Throughout that journey you experience weird shtuff that can mess your trousers quite a bit. The story itself is actually a bit interesting to say the least however I don't feel that it was told all that well whatwith it just being a bit slow on the telling despite how somewhat short the game itself is (like 6-8 hours).As for the actual gameplay it's an extremely simple first person, mostly melee based combat; they attack, you time your block right, you get a chance to attack some more until they're down. If you're good enough you can have them start fighting each other. There are guns in the game but they're very limited and restraint; you can't collect ammunition and you can't reload them though you can turn them into very fragile melee weapons. The entire game itself is pretty linear and it has a habit of having you backtrace (ie. acquire item X from this location to open door Y that you passed through a little earlier) though I didn't find it to be unbearably strenous. Because you're a Serial Crimes Unit agent you'll also be using investigation tools to partake in some CSI stuff by finding evidence that the person who framed you left behind which what you find that advances the plot further can be interesting.The real selling point of this game however is the survival horror part; you start to hallucinate spooky shtuff, most of where you go gets extremely claustrophobic & obviously dark, and the game can be downright freaky to move around in. For the most part I found it very uneasy to even go where I was supposed to and more uneasy whatwith me being a bit bad with the subject of horror in general. That's how I prefer my horror anyway, making you feel terrified as opposed to using petty jump scares (though I tend to be bad with those as well and plus there aren't too many in this game I found).Get it for when it's cheap.

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a very nice surprise for the discounted price of 3 buck something. Yeah I’m dat cheap. But I hadn’t even heard about the game until this Steam daily deal popped up. I had this vision for the original F.E.A.R. when the game came out, it was the wrong vision. I pictured a game sort of like Half-Life 2 where you walk through a creepy environment without hair raising moments and minimalistic shooting with a focus on a horror story telling.Turns out Condemned: Criminal Origins was the original F.E.A.R. I was looking for. It was practically released at the same time as well, circa 2006. I’m guessing development was somewhat parallel.It uses the Lithtech Jupiter EX game engine that I completely endorse … aside from the stutter-like frame rate, given the fact I didn’t feel this present in F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin (which I highly enjoyed) it must have been some bug inherent to the engine’s flagship release batch. There are 4 different types of saves which are very handy, but the Auto-Save will usually suffice on normal difficulty.As with F.E.A.R. 2, I must say that I have been quite impressed at the amount of content that is presented level design-wise. Whenever you progress through the game, they (Monolith?) always manage to change the scenery completely and smoothly. One moment you might be outside in some playground, the next you find yourself in some school’s locker hallway, then the next you find yourself in some bloody basement. All in one map with different 3D models and textures. That’s something you don’t find often in a lot of games which choose to repeat the scenery until the next level loads.I really don’t want to ruin this game for anyone, but Condemned: Criminal Origins had probably one of the most original boss fights I had seen in a long time. It looked heavily inspired by what I would call Sinawali (a Filipino martial arts involving sticks/batons). Most of the game combat-wise is based on melee strikes and blocking. Sometimes you will find some guns with a few shots, to which you are able to use its stock as melee on enemies that aren’t wielding a gun themselves. You also carry a Taser which is very handy for stunning your enemies for a few seconds (or frying bladder weak enemies). Although a bit of an eye-candy, there are also four optional finishing moves. The key word being optional … which some games don’t give. Add some sidekicks into the mixture and what you have is a fairly interesting combat system.Enemy AI is impressive, they fight each other if one accidently gets hit by another. They also somehow crawl through the bottom of bookshelves and attack by popping out half way. Some even disguise themselves in a creepy abandoned store by standing still amongst mannequins. Crazy huh?I’d say the story was mildly entertaining. It perhaps was a little slow to start off with in the beginning, but it just keeps getting better and better, including what was written during level loading screens. There are some basic investigations done like clue finding on certain visual cues. I’d give bonus points for this to the developers as to be totally honest I’m sick and tired of games infested with Full Motion Videos. Maybe that was okay back during the PlayStation days when it was difficult to include videos in games on other gaming platforms … but these days I’d prefer more interaction to my story. And this game hits the spot with that. It wasn’t hair raising or shocking … it was just good old fashion creepiness to build endless suspense. Of course there were some cut scenes, but the game wasn’t entirely saturated with them. The cut scenes happened at the appropriate times in my opinion.Excellent job done in the sound department. They are definitely responsible for the creepy atmosphere to the game without creating edge of your seat moments.I think my only quarrel with the game was perhaps the weapon, hand, phone and character 3D models. LOL, I’m not sure what the artists were thinking, they kind of just looked like 3D box modeling monstrosities with baked textures applied to them. At times I couldn’t even tell if I was holding a crowbar or a snake with a head defect. But it hardly takes away from the atmosphere.Overall a very relaxing 7 hour experience. If you haven’t played this game before and enjoy being in a horror-like crime environment that won’t make you jump out of your chair with the sight of things like Alma Wade … then this is a must have.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Monolith Publishers: SegaInitial release: April 2006Genre: Horror, Melee, FPS#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationThe setup of Condemned is you play as Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent investigating a crime scene. In a rousing turn of events the perpetrator takes your gun and frames you for the murder of 2 of your follower officers and thus your adventure begins.  Condemned is not super long, roughly 5-7 hours depending on how long you spend doing side objectives. The game basically revolves around the cycle of investigating things for the purpose of clearing your name and well.. smashing faces with pipes. The gameplay mostly revolves around using melee attacks and while there are firearms, ammo is scarce and not always the most efficient defense. You are also afforded a taser effective at range for use of stunning and disarming other armed enemies. The enemies are all basically insane for narrative reasons I'll let the game expound upon. However, because of this behavior they often will start fighting with themselves and end up smacking one of the other enemies with a conduit in the back of the head affording you a much easier fight. The normal difficulty is not especially difficult. The animations are generally easy to read and a well timed block will set you right. Plenty of health packs as well; Not to mention quick save. This was my second playthrough and I had originally played on the X360. Some remnants of that version can be seen in that you spend some time looking for collectibles; Finding and unlocking achievements that aren't really marked anywhere as the PC version doesn't have achievements but still exist in the game. It's a minor complaint but one that feels out of place and worth mentioning. The game is indeed quite dated and for obvious reasons could use a texture overhaul. However, the gameplay is still great and the story engaging. Getting it to run in the resolution you desire my prove a bit finicky as the nature of the port seems to have minimal graphical options. THE GISTCondemned is one of those games I have a bit of nostalgia for and I'm glad to see it hold up 10 years later.Follow my curation for more "

												Don't look my Steamìs hours, I played this game so much on Xbox 360.Videogames definitely aren't just for kids any more. If that wasn't obvious after the barrage of 18-rated releases over the last few years, Condemned takes a gas pipe and beats you around the head until it's all too painfully obvious. Imagine the crazed villagers from Resident Evil 4 but more demented, visceral melee combat with the most brutal weapons ever seen in a videogame, dark and gloomy environments that could have been ripped from the most grim of horror movies, a heavy dose of the surreal, and then experience it all from an immersive first-person perspective. Condemned has already freaked out Xbox 360 owners, but PC gamers aren't safe any longer.As agent Ethan Thomas you're called to investigate a strange murder scene where the victim has been set up with a mannequin to create a dinner scene. After collecting evidence, noises are heard in the apartment above you, and a short fight later two cops have been shot dead with your gun, the killer has escaped and you're the prime suspect. Back at your apartment you start to see things and a mysterious man appears with stories about your special powers. With the cops on your back and the mysterious Vanhorn advising you to flee through your window, you set out to find the killer and clear your name.The game then uses the premise of brutally beating up violent mind-altered tramps, drug addicts and other members of society that the world has left behind, and sticks with it for its duration. You don't get much explanation for this, other than information on a disease that's killing birds and seems to be infecting humans too (albeit only those living on the streets). The actual core storyline revolving around the murders moves along nicely as you fight enraged tramps through a tube station, a shop, a school and more. It's all pretty grim stuff and over the ten or so hours it'll take you to get through it, you'll predominantly be smashing enemies in the face with blunt weapons and occasionally getting hold of a gun of some sort.It's certainly not going to win any awards for its depth of gameplay, but when this basic concept is so entertaining, it's easy to see why Monolith (the studio behind last year's F.E.A.R.) didn't try to add any more complexity. One button swings your weapon or fires your gun, another raises your weapon to block an enemy attack, and you have access to a taser (momentarily halting an enemy) that comes in very handy, particularly against enemies carrying guns. If you're brave enough you can kick enemies, knocking them to the ground and enabling you to brutally kill them with one of four finishing moves. These aren't essential to your progression, but they do add some variety to proceedings.The only diversion from the relentless beating is the odd bit of crime scene investigation. This is handled very well, but it's more or less given to you on plate, with the game prompting you whenever you can whip out some high-tech gadgets. Responding to the on-screen cue will make Ethan take out the tool he needs and then it's simply a matter of looking for something that shows up under the light, following the smell of rotting flesh using your detector, taking a sample or something similar. Your findings will be instantly sent over to Rosa, your friend in forensics, and she'll give you her findings with calls to your cell phone, giving you little titbits of info on the killer you're tracking. Given that the focus of Condemned is clearly the frenzied combat, the simple nature of the actual detective work is understandable, but some more depth would have added an extra dimension to the gameplay.There's not much light in Condemned, but the little there is, is used incredibly well. In trademark survival horror fashion every environment is dimly lit, with each object casting a menacing shadow. When you do see some brightness it's often blinding, offering little comfort over your previous adventuring in the dark. Fabulous lighting aside, Condemned does all it can to unsettle you: the psychotic enemies all look a little worse for wear and move with striking realism, blood and human remains litter the environment, everything looks trashed and a creepy black and white picture effect crops up from time to time, if only to mess with your head some more.You could dissect the game's presentation and pick out some frame rate problems and the odd dodgy texture, but when you're playing you really don't care. When a tramp smashes through a wall and charges at you holding a nail ridden plank of wood, the last thing on your mind is how next-gen it all looks. It's all made more unnerving by some truly deranged sound effects and horrible, meaty sounding combat. Round this off with some impressive voice acting from the main characters, and you've got one impressive package.As with Monolith's previous PC game F.E.A.R., you're going to need a high-end PC to play this as it was intended. A steady frame rate can be achieved by cutting back some of the more advanced features, but you end up losing some of the atmosphere that makes the game so great to begin with. Condemned moves at a slower pace than a traditional FPS, so you can get away with a less than spectacular frame rate. Be aware that the game forces you to play in widescreen, and unless you're using a widescreen display, the game will feature black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.Condemned delivers an experience that's worlds apart from what is usually on offer for PC gamers. At its core it's about as simple as a game could be, but it's presented in such a deranged and immersive way that it's hard not to get caught up in it all. Smacking someone around the face with a spade and watching blood spray from their mouth is a sight that will give many people the wrong view of videogames in general, but if you're old enough to play it and can stomach it, there's plenty of perverted pleasure to be had from Condemned.

A few years ago i just missed it and wanted to experience it all over again but no longer owned an Xbox so i checked online and steam and nothing,Every once in awhile i would recheck then the first day it came out on steam was the day i checked again and seen it.I was so excited was freaky weird that i would check that day and bam it was on there but i bought it right away.But if you are second guessing yourself on getting it just go for it,It has awesome combat you can literally rip a pipe from the wall and just hulk smash someone with it and the story is just an unforgettable experience!!!

												10/10 just for the AI.  You really feel like you are being stalked and every sound you hear causes you to frantically survey your surroundings.  As you get further into the game, there are more enemies per room and so you become desensitized to seeing shadows cross an empty hallway or hearing footsteps around you.  I wish they would have limited the interactions with enemies and made them more dangerous (remove the tazer) so that you are always on edge when those types of situations arise.  That being said, this is very much an atmospheric horror game that doesn't rely on jump scares (although there are a few of those too).  You are scared of what's around the next corner, even if you do become desensitized to some of the visual and audio cues.I've finished the game.  The story is engaging and the AI is incredible.  If a third Condemned is released, I hope they focus more on atmosphere and less on action.			"

												Chilling, terrifying, atmospheric. Three words that I would choose if asked to sum up this outstanding game. Have you seen the movie Seven? This Monolith Productions game has that kind of feel and vibe to it.Overall I prefer the first half of this game to the latter simply because in the later levels the story takes an unwelcome turn into the farcical and paranormal. Condemned worked better as an experience for me when the real evil of the plot was Man and not some shadowy evil entity. Still, a great visceral experience, and one I would recommend to anyone looking to have the wits ripped out of them. I've given this game a strong 8.5/10			"

												Although Dead Island was the first of it's kind that I played, it wasn't as realistic with the melee combat that this game prides itself in. Condemned has an excellent story, lots of action, superb AI, challenging achievements, and some mighty good scares. Did I mention the AI? Of course, I did. The AI is unlike any other game I've played. I love how your enemies can fake you out during battle. It sure keeps you focused, and every fight is a new experience. It's not as if your enemy has a set pattern that you can conquer in a couple tries, no! It's unpredictable and will push you to try different fighting techniques. Timing is key with the fighting system. And don't be fooled into thinking you can just whoop multiple guys at once like you're Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee...no, sometimes you have to RUN to survive. Choose your battles wisely, as well as your weapon. Choose the wrong one, and you can say ""Goodbye"".If you like unique gameplay, good concepts and storyline, and immersive atmospheres, then pick this one up. I'm sure glad I did.			"

												It's been a while since I've played a good horror game. Condemned: Criminal Origins was able to raise the hair on my arms with its creepy atmosphere, sounds, lighting, and supernatural events. Then there are the humanoids that crawl around on all fours--a chill shot up my spine every time I encountered one.You play the role of a detective investigating serial killers. One of them ends up framing you for murder and in your struggle to gather evidence to clear your name, you discover there is something even more sinister lurking out there. The story evolves slowly and constantly applies a state of terror that had me peeking around each corner to make sure the coast is clear. There are also some cool crime scene evidence gathering aspects to the game that kept it engaging.The game highlights melee focused combat allowing you to use pretty much any makeshift item as a weapon. There are also a few guns that can be found, but you won't find any extra ammo lying around so it's important to make your shots count. The game provides an extremely large number of enemies to bash through. Near the end, it almost hit a point of ridiculousness. But reaching the story finale was well worth it.Any fan or horror should not pass this one up.			"

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a very scary game because of the tension and the athmospere. It will have you on the edge of your seat for most of the time. The fact that u cant really 'run' from anything adds a lot to that. The detective parts are fun aswell.The only negative thing I can think about is the small variety of weapons to choose from.			"

												This game is really fun for being so old but i can say one thing it's worth buying if you like just chaos things happening. The bad things about the game is the blocking mechanic it seems sometime when you block in the perfect time the AI can still hit you but who cares the game is fun so buy it if you want to beat bad guys up with a locker door!.

Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first-person horror game that I recommend a lot!Gameplay It's a first-person beat-em-up game and also a FPS when you'll get guns.There are many melee weapons available in the game which you can find all over the levels,and also guns which are usually hidden around or you can get them from enemies.You also have a taser gun which is very useful when you want to stun and disarm enemies.Combat is really fun and challenging,when enemies swing at you,block/parry with RMB and quickly press LMB to attack them back.Each weapon has different stats(damage,speed,block,reach),and sometimes you must carry one specific weapon(like an axe) to be able to open some doors or locks.One thing I don't like in this game is that you can't carry more than one weapon,so if you want to take with you a pipe and a rifle,it's too bad,you can't.I've also found annoying the fact that enemies seem to have a longer melee weapon reach than you.After beating an enemy,there is a chance he'll fall on his knees and allow you to do a finisher.You can do one by walking in front of him and pressing the key shown(1-Ram, 2-Slam, 3-Snap, 4-Punch).  Beside all the beating and gunning,you must also invenstigate clues(fingerprints,fluids,particles,etc.)and crime scenes using investigation tools like laser light,UV light and a camera.During the game you can also search for collectibles.There are 2 collectibles available: dead birds and metal pieces.In every level/chapter you can find 6 dead birds and 3 metal pieces.(There are 10 levels in total)Story You are Ethan Thomas, a crime scene investigation agent which you must journey through some condemned buildings in the search of a criminal who framed you for murder,the Serial Killer X.The story is pretty good and overall it's...well,horror.It has some quality jumpscares here and there that made me jump a little.The game is quite short,I've beaten it in 8 hours.It has 10 levels/chapters and it's linear.It can get a little repetitive if you play too much in one sitting.Graphics&Sound Since it's a 2006 game,it doesn't look that great,some textures are blurry and low res.But it isn't bad either.The sound effects are great and realistic,very atmospheric,you can hear whispers,screams,footsteps,etc. throughout the game.Conclusion - It's a great horror game with good story and great combat mechanics.I'd say it's a 8.5/10.

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Ethan Thomas, an SCU Agent on the trail of an illusive serial killer that kills other serial killers. It's not the Punisher, though, that would be way too cool. 90's cool! Unlucky for Ethan, every hobo in the city is out for blood, either Ethan's or each others, and are causing havoc and violence across the city. I stole way too many television sets that night. I made a television fort. Your authority is not recognized in fort CNN. Guns and ammo are limited, so Ethan is forced to get down and dirty with said murder hobos through the use of melee weapons he finds in the environment. Each weapon has a set up stats that tell you it's total killing potential. Weapons also have a certain amount of durability before breaking, forcing you to find a new 2x4 or lead pipe to bash some poor man to death with. Your abilities are limited to a few moves, an attack, a defense, and a taser button that, by golly you're going to abuse, as well as a super kick that allows you to knock your enemies skulls out the back of their heads if the weapon just isn't doing it for you. The entire game is in first person, only leaving the view for cutscenes. While the combat itself is very basic, it makes up for it by being, pardon my buzzwords, very visceral and brutal. Hitting a hobo with your weapon has that mandatory crunch to it. Enemies react, stagger, and tumble around after being hit. Teeth fly from their mouths, their blood splatters across the floor, and they get very cross with you if you didn't outright kill them with your lead pipe or fire ax or human arm or whatever you got your hands on. The game calls itself a horror game. Then again I call myself a rich man who doesn't eat garbage but that doesn't make it true. It's very dark and atmospheric, but it's not really, well, scary. I never jumped or had a lets player level squeal while playing it. The environments are unsettling, but I never felt intimidated or frightened while going through hobo dens or subway tunnels. There is also an investigation segment that pops up every now and then. But it's never so in depth or complicated to make it anything more than a plot tool. Should you play, evicted: Conman beginnings? It's made by the guys who made FEAR back in the day, and it kind of shows. It's a pretty neat little game, especially considering it was a Xbox 360 launch title back in the day. I think. Was it? It's not ground breaking or overly amazing. But it's worth at least one play through. Condemned: Criminal origins receives 7 hobo battles out of 14 or something. Give me your old TVs, Fort CNN must become stronger.

												Mixed feelings for this game, mixed feelings...First of all it seems to run on the F.E.A.R. engine, which is cool but then I'm baffled at how low quality the textures are, especially on the characters. Its like the environment uses way higher quality textures than the characters do. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? Or why can't everything just look fine, instead it puts the supposed F.E.A.R. engine to shame by using blurry and low as hell textures on characters. F.E.A.R., for example looked better and it came out like a year earlier than this. Well enough of nitpicking at some of the visuals, cause to be honest most of the game visually looks pretty decent, but now on to other things.This game seems to do somethings more or less unique like for example: Ammo is pretty damn limited, and there isn't even such thing as getting ammo or reloading your guns. Instead you pick up guns from wherever, or from enemies you kill and they may or may not have a full clip in it. Also enemies can ACTUALLY RUN OUT OF AMMO! WOW! So if you kill an enemy that has a gun fast enough before he attempts to waste ammo on you, you can benefit from it and have a more full clip of ammo. Its like literally one of the first games I've seen do that for enemies. I wish more games did that. I'm staring at you Half-Life 1 and 2, where the HECU soldiers and Combine soldiers infinitely pull clips of ammo and grenades out their ♥♥♥ without instead eventually running out of ammo and doing some well coded melee fighting with you.Most of the time you have to rely on melee weapons and its somewhat dodgy mechanic of combat, but for the most part it works. You can die fairly easily, especially from certain weapons so you do not want to take combat lightly and screw around, even on easy mode. So get ready to time your blocks right and avoid damage as much as possible. Some enemies telegraph their attacks obviously, and some others fake you out so hard it makes you want to facepalm. They then get a free shot at you after you've wasted your block, which by the way isn't constant like say Oblivion or Skyrim. Why not make the blocking constant? And reward the player by only stunning the enemy if you block right before their attack strikes you.Also every now and then you have to gather evidence by using your fancy FBI tools and camera. I guess thats pretty cool, it does suck though at certain parts where there are enemies, making you vulnerable because to do ANY attack, you have to put your tool away, which takes about a second and a half and then slowly pull your weapon out and then finally be able to attack. Rinse and repeat about 10 times.One of my biggest complaints with this game is how ABSURDLY slow your character moves. And ""sprinting"" is barely faster than how a normal person would run. Especially going down and up stairs and ramps, it makes snails look like Speed Racer. I guess you could argue he's carrying a lot of tools in his bag but even then the speed at which he moves, even when sprinting, is RIDICULOUSLY SLOW!Overall, the game is pretty decent but it could of done a bunch of things better and made the experience more satisfying with a little more effort.

												This game still holds up as a horror survival game, but the most horrifying part of this game is climbing stairs.This is a port of the xbox360 version and as with many xbox to PC ports there are issues; one of which being the aforementioned stairs issue. When trying to climb stairs (or any slight incline or decline for that matter) the players movement speed will be reduced to the point that I fear stairs in this game more than the actual horror aspect; and trust me; there are a lot of stairs. You might be thinking this is a minor issue; but not so much when you have enemies chasing you and (I am guessing) almost impossible to beat on harder difficulties.Other issues include a common issue with chapter 9 the next area wont open unless you pick up the correct weapon and then drop it. Physics when killing enemies are flawed in the sense that they bounce or fly off in an over exagerated typical ragdoll fashion. This happens a lot of the time when landing a killing blow or always when landing an execution moves. I also saw lighting issues but I didn't tinker with any of the lighting settings.On a more positive note. This game has some re-play value with collectibles and ""achievements""(These achievements are simply left in the game from the 360 version and do not link with steam). As for the Story; you are a detective that gets framed then leading to you trying to prove your innocence whilst having to deal with psychotic enemies and at times; slight paranormal overtones. You will also get a choice of melee weapons that can be found almost anywhere from pipes on the wall to a shovel in the shed as well as firearms including pistols, shotguns, rifles and sub machine guns. You will also get a trusty taser but beware the cool-down time. Overall you could probably get around 6 hours of gameplay on the easiest difficulty and whilst the PC version is very buggy I do still recommend this game but I would also recommend getting it on the xbox360; after the painful amount of stair climbing I had to boot my 360 copy and no such issues were present. If you have no option but to get it on PC; it is still a decent game with a reasonable storyline just be aware that such issues as mentioned above were found.			"

												Condemned is the sister game of F.E.A.R. developed around the same time for the same engine and platforms. However while F.E.A.R was a game of excess. Condemned was a game of subtlty. In Condemned you play as a framed forensics officer who attempts to clear his name by chasing the real criminal, a serial killer. You follow in his footsteps as you examine the victims in a really nicely designed forensics minigame. Not only that but you must fight with the residents in the city you live in.Gradually it becomes more apparent that the world you live in is going mad. You go from subways, to libraries to eventually abandoned department stores and fight mannequins. The game also does not have a focus on firearms. You only very rarely get firearms and instead use improvised melee weapons to face your opponents.Condemned is a very rare kind of game in a sea of first person shooters. One that understands how to properly scare you and delivers an engaging story and cast of characters.			"

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a highly atmospheric detective-horror-shooter done from First Person view. The game covers it's bases in the melee department, with each weapon that you are able to pick up or switch with abundance (pipes, boards, fire axes, etc.) coming with its own set of combat statistics. If you are looking for a shooter, though, you might not enjoy the gameplay as each time you pick up a gun, you get the bullets in that specific gun, and are unable to consolidate ammo between guns. This tends to make melee combat your mainstay in C:CO.Being vage as to not give anything away, I can say that the story really pulled me in. Not because the main character was well-played or relatable, but because the game's environment--as previously stated--is highly atmospheric. You'll get a lot of jumping-in-your-seat moments as you play through the campaign.Overall, I give this game a 4/5, losing a half star each for somewhat linear combat at times, as well as the odd inability to pick up multiple clips of amunition for the same weapon. Everything else is pretty stellar.			"

												I give it 3 out of 5 stars (ie about average). Fairly short and very linear (I played start to finish in one long sitting). The ambience is nice, but there are a lot of frustrating aspects. You can only run for about 5 seconds, and even then its very slow. Worse is the fact you can only carry one weapon at a time, and you can't ""combine"" ammo for the same type of fire arm, so you will have to back track if you want to use those 2 or 3 bullets. Not that you need to use firearms at all, you should really learn to use melee weapons... because at the end it is mandatory (and they take away your taser too, so don't rely on that as a crutch too much). But even if you do forgo guns for melee, you will still have to backtrack a lot because you will need different melee wepons to open different doors. So slow movement + lots of mandatory backtracking. Finally many doors lock behind you for no reason (in game anyway), very often right after you pass first aid kits. So you end up feeling cheated there too. The fighting mechanics are usually ok, but there are issues. Enemies sometimes would shoot me through walls, including once through a ten foot thick concrete subway pillar. On the other hand if an enemy is crouching behind a knee high box, with their whole upper body exposed, my shots would (to their head) would have no effect - you have to wait till they come out of cover to shoot you. Enemy melee attacks for the most part can not be sidestepped; overhead smashes will auto-track you mid-swing. Also very often the range on enemy melee attacks is far greater then it should be. They would appear to miss me by about 5-10 feet, but I would still get hit. You are just expected to parry everything.By the end I felt like I has earned a blackbelt in Condemned-jutsu, the last level really forces you to master it to get by. The final boss fight though ends up being a little anticlimactic, as there are so many health kits around, you can almost ignore his hits and just keep whacking him. This became a problem at one point, because if you don't know what to do, you can whack him for ever and he will not die - you have to get him winded then press 1 (something I had never before had to do to win). If you ignore it and keep attacking, he will try to fight you some more. This almost became an infitnite loop for me.			"

												Finally after several years I decided to try Condemned out on PC, I remember seeing footage of it years ago and being impressed with the combat, but never really picked it up on xbox. **Couple things to point out right away in case you are having some issues with the game, there is an issue with stuttering and performance with some Logitech mice, but a simple single directX file can fix it if you search online. Ran really well on my windows 10 system after that, except when I try to quit the game it will force a black screen and a need to reset the whole computer.** Without going over any key story or any spoilers:Positives: Creepy atmosphereSolid jump scares that actually got me pretty badInteresting story elements that progress in an unexpected wayVisuals still hold up on highest settingsLighter collecting aspects(only used to unlock concept art which is a plus)Combat is balanced and I never ran into extremely difficult or overwhelming sections.Detective work was really cool, use of ultraviolet light should be in more games!Negatives:Your character has the lungs of an 80 year old asthmatic whilst sprintingYou walk up stairs like an 80 year old asthmaticThere isn't really any progression for your character, you never get more health or staminaBlocking doesn't always seem to work with weapons, strafing and flailing works bestStory can be rather thin at parts, I wish they went further into some of the world building which had interesting potential.Campaign was rather short, only took me 5 hours to beat it on normal difficulty.Overall, I would recommend Condemned: Criminal Origins, I believe I picked it up in an earlier humble bundle so you can always wait until a sale and give it a try if you enjoy first person horror games.

												This game is a coursebook for aspiring game developers on how to properly make scary games with style. Meticulous level design, astonishing work on sound and light (now THAT's what the word 'cinematographic' truly means) and NEVER a cheap thrill. It spooks you with minute details, it scares you with small stuff, it gets under your brain. An absolutely rad  and innovative game, which many other games subsequently borrowed from (but nobody quite achieved the same effect). The BEST melee fights I've ever known in a game, period.And guess what, it doesn't look dated in 2016. I dunno how Monolith did that, but it looks as cool and chillingly spooky as in 2006.In my opinion, Condemned 1 and 2 are the most awesome horror game franchise in history. Many gamers hold a serious grudge against those nasty people at SEGA who pulled the plug on PC port of the Condemned 2 (the game I actually bought PS3 for).Condemned 2 MUST BE RELEASED ON PC.			"

												It's an interesting old title. Definitely not Outlast or Silent Hill, but it's worth a shot.+ Nice atmosphere: Creepy and tense.+ Enemy presence: Enemies move in scary ways, they creep around you in the shadows, making noise and messing with you. They don't just rush into your face, they actually creep you out.+ Balanced combat: The combat is functional enough to help you and crap enough to keep you scared.+ The best jumpscares: Few but effective. That's the best way to do jumpscares.- Simple plot: I found the story too simple and the twist too meh for a horror game.- Short AF: I beat it in a seating and a half (~6H) and it was my first playthrough.It isn't even close to winning any kind of award, but it's not a complete waste of your time.

												Pretty cool game. I had not played this until now (2016). I didn't know it was on PC as well. I got this game for free with some promotion from some website I can't remember. I had tried the Condemned 2 demo on PS3 and I remembered it was quite cool and never played the whole game because I never played the first one....so here I am. The game is fairly short (6 hours or a little more if you are a completionist) and is very concentrated and immersive. Combat feels ok but of course a bit outdated (especially after great melee combat games like Mirror's Edge and Dying Light), still fun though. Graphics: it is a 10 year old game, yet it didn't disturb me graphically, it is very ok, you could even play in ultrawide, surround screens, or UHD resolutions if you wanted.Make sure you google for the 'dinput8.dll' which will fix the framerate on systems with Logitech devices (your framerate will be stuck at 6 fps otherwise). There is also a FOV fix to make the game work in ultrawide and multiscreen setups.I enjoyed it quite a lot and now I wish the second were on steam as well. I don't think this game is a masterpiece from the past, but if you never played it it surely deserves a playthrough.			"

												Condemned is one of my favorite horror games ever, but unfortunately this is very slipshod port.  The PC version (at least on Steam) has a lot of sound issues where various effects and music are either missing or so low that they can be barely be heard.  A notable example being a sequence where you're on the back of a moving and completely silent subway car, and missing music and effects from the department store level. If you have a 360 I wholeheartedly recomend this game.  If not, I would wait for a sale, and go in knowing that there are problems that won't necessarily ruin the game, but may hamper your horror experience.			"

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first person horror game, developed by Monolith, famous for the FEAR series.The game places you in the slow, clunky shoes of Agent Ethan Thomas, tasked with chasing down a mysterious killer. Rampant violence and insanity is flooding the city streets, driving the population of homeless people and vagrants to attack everyone and everything. Blood, psychosis, and brutal beatdowns await you within.The game has excellent atmosphere and sound design, and despite the rather aged visuals, is still capable of producing some legitimately creepy enviroments. The gameplay involves melee combat, guns, investigations, and simple puzzle solving. Unfortunately, the puzzles and investigations aspects, while interesting, lack variety or real depth, but serve as a nice break from the combat.A little rough around the edge, the game is still worth atleast ten dollars.7.5/10			"

												Wonderfully atmospheric settings that holds up today, hampered only by good, if reptitive, combat. A psychological horror game that isn't afraid to deprive you of FPS conventions for the sake of difficulty and mood. No crosshairs, ammo pickups, or crafting systems to be found here. Instead, expect inaccurate guns, visceral melee combat, and some great sound design.			"

												I remember playing this game way before Steam and I was so excited when I got it for free in a bundle. This is one of the games that will give you shivers down your spine. The combat is mainly just always the same and you switch melee a lot. Every once in a while you get a hold of another weapon but often there are only few bullets. Replaying it now after all those years, but I already know it's worth playing it. There are cutscenes regularely and there is a certain scare factor when you suddenly get attacked from behind while picking up a med kit or a weapon.I highly recommend it.			"

												I originally played this game on the 360 before its PC release. I freely admit that I haven't played it thoroughly since I purchased it during the Halloween 2013 sale.The actual game is fantastic. The gameplay is fairly unique, the graphics are acceptable for the era it came from, and the story/writing isn't too terribly appalling.It is worth mentioning however that the game presents a lot of problems on my modern PC. Randomly dropping to 5fps after certain cutscenes, sudden crashes, things like that.I also recognize now that the gameplay is, while enjoyable, quite clunky at times. The way the player moves feels a bit off compared to most FPS games, and the weapons ranges don't always seem to match their appearance. Neither do the enemy attacks, for that matter. Additionally, the voiceacting and dialog are both terrible, which creates a sort of harmonic resonance that serves to make both even more grating. You know the way that the smell/sight of vomit or rotting eggs has a tendency to make a person want to throw up? Well, imagine if someone ate whole rotten eggs (shells still on) and then threw them up in some kind of frenzy of blood-filled chunks and nasty egg yolks  -- it would be far more off-putting than either individual gross-out.Still, it's an enjoyable game, and well worth it if you can get it cheap.Recommended to anyone who likes something different from the usual, with the caveat that the performance might be a bit sketchy, and the polish is far from what we'd expect in a more recent game.

												So, this is one of those games that i played on Xbox 360 before i knew how to build my own PC, I was either 17 or just turning 18.. Blah blah enough with my life story.. I hated it on 360. Controls sucked... Graphics sucked at 720 and sub 30fps. It was ♥♥♥♥. However, I do stand firm that when it comes to horror games, sometimes it's best to look to the past. I did get this game for free from Sega via the Make War Not Love prize pack 2, but I will write this as if I paid $14 for it. I will edit it as I play further. Impressions so far aren't bad at all. A few people have said that there is not native controller support for xbox controllers. If you don't like using KB&M, download xpadder. Given that this is basically held back by being ported from the Xbox 360 in 2006, the graphics can be ugly... that should be a given in the mid 2000s. It does look way better than the 360 version, so if you haven't seen that version... I'm sure you can imagine. This still does come from the time where the skin and hair texures are combined. So, the default KB&M controls aren't overly complicated like in some Sega games which is a good thing even if for some reason you prefer using a controller. I will recommend this game(it is free at the make war not love website at the moment) Some people have said that playing this game for extended periods of time have made them feel sick. I didn't notice that too much but I'll put that out there for anyone considering this game just in case. The gameplay is fun, even though it starts feeling like you're just doing the same thing over and over after a while..			"

												Week Long Deal! Only 2,50 EUR for this masterpiece! It would be a sin not to pick this one up till the offer lasts.I did not know Monolith did not become defunct but was acquired by Warner Bros. I thought they'd really stopped developing video games for good. This all happened around the time they came out with Condemned. It was interesting to play this game after FEAR which was action-packed and you needed to quickly react and shoot enemies - at the same time the bullet time concept made it all easier. So, when Condemned came out and I saw this game did not really have any weapons in it I took a step back. I mean, melee can certainly be interesting but FPS games were never about close combat but by utilising a certain assortment of ranged weaponry. Yet, Monolith managed to make the game interesting till the very end by incorporating an exciting and mysterious storyline.You play an FBI agent who becomes a fugitive after a killer frames him for the murder of a police officer. Thomas, while hiding from the cops, tries to uncover the truth and visit long abandoned (condemned) buildings to find clues as to who this mysterious Serial Killer X might be. Throughout the game you can grab almost any object you come across. Steel pipes, planks, crowbar and even a fire axe is at your disposal to get rid of your enemies. These are not necessarily people you are after, but people who occupy these buildings - petty criminals or junkies just seconds away from a lethal overdose.Occasionally, the game lets you do some crime scene investigations. This happens when Thomas reaches a new milestone in his investigation: you have a variety of gadgets at your disposal with which you can collect samples and send them to your lab analyst - the only person who trusts you - for further analysis. That is how you can progress and go through warehouses, an old school, a library or the deadly sewers and eventually you'll reach an orchard to finally face the antagonist of the game.Condemned has an appalling story and makes you stuck in your chair until you complete the story and find out the fate of agent Thomas. It has a creepy atmosphere and it truly is a psychological horror. I do not know exactly how many such games are out there for the PC but this is certainly one of the classics.Once you pick this up and complete it you'll find out why I hate the developers for never releasing the sequel on PC.

												It pains me to write this review.It pains me because this is my second favourite game ever.I first got this game shortly after the aquiring the second one preowned, I didn't like the look of the first one seeing a friend playing it but the sequel looked amazing, I decided I needed to play the original if just for the story...My best friend bought it me for Christmas and I began;What started as a simple background research playthrough turned into hours and hours and hours of gameplay.On the Xbox 360 I have all the achievements, I have completed every difficulty(clocking easy after my third playthrough just to see how fast I could get through it), I have completed it without ever firing a gun, without using the taser, using every gun in every form(including reversing the firearms and weilding them as a melee weapon...I love it, it is one of the ten games I would take to prison for the rest of my life.So it breaks my heart to give this game a thumbs down, it is an horrible PC port, truly horrible.My rig is powerful enough to run nearly any game on the maximum settings and this game - on all combinations of settings - runs disgracefully, the keyboard and mouse system does not flow smoothly as there is a lot going on with the controls and you cannot even use your pad as the only options for it are to link up the thumbsticks, meaning you can accidentally (if you do  not understand the descriptions) map the movements wrong, it also means you cannot map the actions to your buttons and must swap between pad and keyboard.I was so excited to get my hands on this and could not believe my luck when it came free on the Make War not Love giveaway... It breaks my heart that I must at least make you aware that this experience will at least not be as smooth or enjoyable as it would be on a console...So Sorry Condemned: Criminal Origins.			"

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a story about the least athletic man in existence. You play a disgraced FBI agent, a man who the story tells us has almost abnormally high muscle and bone density, but who in the game is uncapable of walking over knee high fences or running more than a few seconds without needing half a minute to catch his breath. From this, an entire game is born.The game is a horror title, with the gameplay built around exploring abandoned facilities in a city gripped by madness. Deranged citizens constantly attack you as you explore, and very little of the combat is performed with guns. Almost everything is done with melee weapons taken from objects lying around. There is a satisfying clunkiness to the combat, but its simplicity lacks depth, and there's little else meaningful to take its places, The melee weapons also take the place that keys and keycards would in other games- a sledgehammer is needed to open some doors, a crowbar others, etc. This becomes contrived when the obstacles to get past are something like a piano blocking a stairway. In this world, no one is capable of climbing or jumping. In some of the later levels there are genuine chills to be found, but the gamplay feels rote most of the time. The pace is glacial, and for most of the game you are stuck exploring these places at a slow walking pace. Whenever a story sequence takes places, you are confined to a tiny area, unable to walk ahead. There are quite a number of moments, none of which are interesting, and the wait to continue the level can be agonizing.The story is preposterous, almost farcical, with motivations that make zero sense and a clueless protagonist. There's a major disconnnect between the protagonist's motivations and the actions the player takes.  It's hard to care about catching a serial killer who kills other serial killers in a game where the primary mechanics consist of the player killing hundreds of homeless people.I'm surprised the title took less than 6 hours. It felt like so much more. People interested in this game can walk-very slowly- away.			"

												I tried to finish this game. I really did. But the repetitive combat and awful, boring boss encounter in Chapter 8 broke my spirit and left me a shattered man. Unfortunately, the game just didn't age well, but at least it isn't the second one. Some of the characters look so big and round as if they were carved from giant blocks of meat.Ammo is extremely scarce, which means the combat relies mostly on melee weapons. The melee weapons didn't act differently from each other in interesting ways. At least the taser and kick helped to mixed things up, but couldn't keep combat from feeling like a chore. I grew bored of it and combat takes up a huge portion of the game.At one point, I encountered a section in Chapter 8 where enemies would keep spawning until the last one with the item I needed finally came in the house for me to kill. I had to repeat myself a couple times which caused my eyes to glaze over. I nearly passed on to the spirit realm. Enemies that seemed to hit me from much further than they should did not help the combat situation either. You can't hit me with a short pipe from five feet away.The investigation aspect also falls victim to the repetition. It's great the first couple of times, but then it loses its luster and only served to move the story forward instead of being interesting. It's a fairly linear game. I did not have to rely on the light tool to follow a trail of blood. I could just press forward and hit those progression points. They had some great uses of the tools later on in the game to keep the investigating aspect from becoming dull. I just wish they could have kept the quality bar high up the whole time.The story seemed interesting and I really liked the concept of Serial Killer X. That's a neat villain to have. I'm not very sure of the supernatural aspects. They could've stayed grounded, but I suppose they needed their explanations for why an FBI agent killed over 150 homeless people, drug addicts, and others with pipes and axes and stuff. Oh well.I can't recommend this title. It's not 2005/2006 anymore.			"

												Condemned is a story-driven detective thriller with supernatural horror elements. You are Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent investigating on a serial killer called the Match Maker. Story is pretty standard, but the voice acting is good and characters are interesting, if you're into that.The game alternates between Batman Arkham-esque sections where you use gadgets to analyze crime scenes and find clues, and other, more FPS-oriented sequences where you will fight all sorts of weirdos. Combat is reminiscent of Bioshock, with its improvised weapons (among other things a paper cutter, locker door and mannequin arm) and scarce firearms, which you can never find ammo for. You are stuck with whatever they contain. Some weapons also double as key items, using for instance a fire axe to break down a door or a sledgehammer to smash a padlock. Since you can only carry a weapon at a time, this creates an economy of weapons that is pretty unique. There will be some backtracking to access some areas, some of which are secret areas with collectibles.Combat is clunky. Hit detection is horrible: you can rarely guess a weapon's range. It seems rigged in favor of enemies. There is a taser that you can use as a last resort weapons that is slow to charge back, but can be used as a last ditch effort, I guess. Combat is basically melee 80% of the time (like I said, firearms are scarce), so get used to the dance of blocking, then landing a strike. Also, enemies have different patterns. When you do find the occasional shotgun or revolver, then the game falls into faceroll territory... for however many bullets you have. 4? 5? Sometimes less.That said, the game does have a unique charm to it, plot twists are cool. I found myself not to be remotely scared even once, which was a bit of a letdown, but there are a few jumpscares. At about 7 hours, the game never overstays its welcome despite its few flaws, and has merit that makes it worth the one sitting you're going to need to clear it. Get it when it's on sale and it's a solid purchase.			"

												★★★★★★★★☆☆ 8/10	Condemned is a truly fantastic game back in its time and still a great game today 10 years later, it's a bit nostalgic. This game was released back when I was a junior in high school, I remember my girlfriend would watch me play it just because we'd have fun laughing at the jump scares. I used to go out and rent it all the time and eventually I traded in a couple of my games just so I could own a copy. I'm not going to go through the pros and cons specifically I'm just going to say if you like jump scares and a decent story, for 14.95 you really can't go wrong.   Another point I'd like to add is after the release of condemned 2, sales weren't strong enough to ever come back with a condemned 3. Jace Hall the creator who owns the rights, from the last I heard he wasn't sure where to go with it and he's looking to grant someone the license to continue the series and by the looks of it PC was on the list. All I'm saying is supporting this game and picking up a copy couldn't hurt. It will only help in furthering the future in seeing another condemned project.So all of you indie devs, step your game up and grab ahold of condemned and give it the revival it needs. Here's what he stated in his original facebook post in January 2015.   ""Deep thought..and question...I helped to create a video game console franchise called ""Condemned."" I currently own the entire franchise.There have been 2 game titles released for the franchise, ""Condemned: Criminal Origins"" and ""Condemned: Bloodshot"" - they both did well, and I am consistently asked when a third game might be created.Since I am focused on other things, and will be for quite some time, this franchise is just sitting there.I am contemplating finding an interested and proven Indie development team AND PROVIDING IT TO THEM, so that they can take over the franchise and move it forward.As an indie, it can be very hard to get marketing/media attention for a title that you work on. This franchise is already quite known, has market demand, and is in an innovative genre/category.Should I explore this idea further? What say you all?""   "

 Condemned: Criminal Origins  This is a dark, first-person psychological thriller in which we play as a Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent who, in search of serial killers, is wandering in urban environments full of killer sociopaths. The game has an amazing and dark atmosphere and our goal is to find a serial killer and to use specialized equipment, our senses, firearms or even melee combat. I highly recommend this production, it has a cool plot, great atmosphere and soundtrack. Personally, I had a great time with this game.  "

												This is my kind of horror. And my kind of horror involves knocking the teeth out of crazed hobos in dark, decaying urban settings with pieces of building material. Best of all, the combat system is not just a pretty toothless face, as it tests your reflexes and has you ruminate over the qualities of many different, painful looking implements! And if you get tired of sparring, you can find a gun and shoot your opponent in the face! However, the story goes Indigo Prophecy style bananas toward the end, the game makes you find a certain weapon to use on a door to advance, and the actual investigation methods are boring. But afterwards you can cave in a vagrant's head with a crowbar!			"

												I got this game in steam after  i screw my retail dvd, i cant remenber the times i played this game (just like with F.E.A.R.) and never really got bored, its interesting each time i start until the end, the game have good pace, creppy when it have to be, and combat feel satisfying, even that you now have better melee oriented games, the graphics didnt aged well, but for someone like me that play doom and wolf3d all the time, they are awesome.The characters do good job presenting you the story, it isnt that deep but have a few turn arounds that keep you interested, actors also do a good job impersonating the role, everything is at right pace to give you a fun run if you are in the horror theme, and is complemented by a good melee combat, you can still use various weapons, but ammo is very limited and you end up relying more on your kick and melee weapon of choice that you have many to choose, like the casual pipe to a more strong hammer.The game really give you many options, and on weapons concern, you never feel to much overpowered, not even with the shotgun bc of the limited resources, and in the iconic mall level, be prepared for a blast experience, still my prefered of the game today.This game is definatly a must have for horror fans, and if you are used to play old games, everything is well done for a game of 2006, maybe if the levels were a little bigger and less ""on rails"", i could say it was perfect to match many new games that rely on eye canding was selling point disregarding the rest.

												Don't go in thinking that just because this game is quite old and the graphics are below par that this isn't good- this game is brilliant, not only in the horror aspect but the storyline too.I've played a small amount of ""horror"" games (yes I put horror in quotation marks because I wouldn't exactly consider a game like Amnesia a horror game, more an annoyance) but Condemned is different, it makes you feel uneasy, out of your comfort zone and yet for some reason you still feel the urge to continue, to find out what happens next and let me tell you, the ending isn't a let down either, despite it being a cliffhanger to Condemned 2.The game isn't just a bunch of jump scares. What makes you feel fear is the top notch ambient and character sounds, equipped with a brutal looking canvas to go along with it.A true fan of horror games has probably played this masterpiece already, however if you haven't- I would seriously reccommened it- hell, i'd reccommend it to anyone with the balls to go through the experience really.

(As far as movement goes, it feels like a bad console port - which it is)- Some of that clunckyness has also seeped into the combat mechanics as well - attacks don't register properly sometimes, movement is unaturally hindered- Gameplay can get really old, really fast - The monotonous gameplay is mostly broken up by occasional difficulty spikes- Cluncky, unpredictable combat + horrible checkpoint save system = some downright rage quit educing moments- Core gameplay ludonarrative dissonance - you're basically a top FBI investigator looking to clear your name by bashing the heads of a few hundred addicts, psychopaths and evil hallucinations- Jupiter Ex engine still has some nice visuals going for it (even after a decade), but this build of the engine is pretty badly optimized - expect glitches and frame rate issues even on modern machinesFor the most part, this game is an interesting counterpart to FEAR - a lot less action, gameplay and replay-ability, but more... experimentation I guess (with mixed results). If you've liked FEAR and you can endure an interesting (but aggravating) combat system and the B-movie premise, you definitely should check this one out.			"

												It's 'okay'. By the standards of Amnesia or Outlast or Cry of Fear, it's not that scary. It picked up on the tension in the last 20% or so, but the first 80% just isn't very scary. The weapon mechanics and investigation tools were interestingly different, but the game definitely felt its age.			"

												This game has some good jumpscares and great atmosphere, unfortunately it suffers from clunky combat, unresponsive controls, and repetitive gameplay. If you can get past that, the story, for the most part, manages to be thrilling and intense.  However, it isn't until the very end where the game gets ridiculous and silly. I would not recommend Condemned: Criminal Origins.			"

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first person survival horror game that tells the story of Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent framed for the murder of two police officers, who is now on the run to find the real murderer and uncover the reason for the suddenly increased violence in the city.Being developed by Monolith Productions and released shortly after the original F.E.A.R., you will notice a a lot of parallels between those two games in terms of story telling, visual style, atmosphere, lighting effects and so on, which, gameplay-wise, makes Condemnd a better 'sequel' to F.E.A.R. than F.E.A.R. 2 was.The story itself isn't exactly mind-blowing, but it keeps you going and the more you get to know about the happenings in the city and the identity of the serial killer, the more it all makes sense.As the game was originally developed for the XBox360, the controls are fairly basic stuff for a first person game. The only thing I kind of disliked is the lack of ability to jump in the game. It's not a deal breaker, but it definitely limits the freedom of movement as you always have to find a staircase, a ramp or similar to get to slightly higher places.While the game *is* first person and you *do* get to find weapons to shoot with, I won't go as far and call it a first person shooter because the action is clearly designed around melee combat. You will find projectile weapons like pistols, shotguns etc. throughout the game, but they are rather rare and mostly only contain a few bullets. If the magazine is empty, you can't reload the gun and will have to use it as a melee weapon instead. Most of the time you will be searching the enviroment for other melee weapons like pipes, desk drawers, fire axes, sledge hammers, wood planks and so on. They all have unique stats in terms of damage, speed, range and block, so you might want to try them all out instead of sticking to one type of weapon.Since you are a FBI agent, you also get to use a couple tech gadgets to analyze blood stains, finger prints, DNA trails and so on. At various key points in the game, the HUD will tell you to use the gear, so you will have to search a room or an entire area for evidence. It's a neat little addition and adds a welcome change to the otherwise entirely puzzle-free gameplay.Graphics-wise, the game doesn't provide you with too many options and, like many console games, suffers from low-resolution textures. The atmospheric lighting manages to cover that up for the most part, but in brighter areas it gets quite obvious. Then again, the game was released in 2005 and considering there are games released in 2010 and earlier that look worse, one can hardly complain here.One of the slightly more outstanding aspects of the game is the enemy AI. You will find the enemies run away from you and hide behind corners when you aim your flashlight at them, they will wait out for the right moment to flank you, eventually will beat up other thugs if they stand between them and you and so on. The AI is not that extremely complex, but then again, a lot of recent cover-based third person shooters don't manage to do that.While the campaign felt relatively long, it only took me roughly 6 hours to beat. There are no additional game modes or a multiplayer mode, so once you are done with the story, you can either re-play it or simply move on as, apart from finding all collectible items, there's nothing else to do in the game.So, if you liked the original F.E.A.R. and want to play a game with the same unique style, make sure to give Condemned: Criminal Origins a shot as this is the closest to F.E.A.R. you can get.

Condemned: Fifty pounds of wet-hot trash adorned with jars of ♥♥♥♥ and feces in a melted garbage bag chucked through your bedroom window at 5AM on a SundayImagine someone desperately flailing a metal pipe they just tore out of a wall to slap the life out of a hulkish, screaming shadow that just collapsed out of the floor above. Now imagine that you are peering out the skull of this pipe swinger, close enough to this decidedly unhappy individual coming at you can practically smell the week old sweat that's coated over them. A chopper's spotlight sneaks through the tangled threads of torn wood where this stinky man who is now fighting you crash landed giving you a glimpse of their incredibly unshaven, missing tooth mouthed, seven XXXL winter coat (sautéd in blood and vomit) wearing body.First person is what I'm getting at. It's unpleasant. Condemned is a game in which you must kill or be killed. This is worth saying twice. There are four people in the game who won't try to kill you, and one of them eventually can't help but drop the business end of a shovel over your dome (two of them also die within the first 10 minutes, which leaves one). Every other person you come across just has this INVIGORATING URGE to beat you to a jello pulp. They'll wait around corners, inside vents, in a playground, you name it: there's an angry man or woman usually with a blunt object or bullet blaster ready to bruise you there.Condemned is charmingly direct. The visually palpable foul stench directing you to a hairy mass in a brown trench sitting on a train station bench accumulating a filthy camouflage, motionless, a single purpose: to have one pass by so that it may wrap its crusted appendages around their neck. The store display mannequin coming alive in an unwanted instance, strutting right through its glass display case just to slap the loose arm of one of another of its kind against your face. It's always the same. You don't have to sit and mull over the morality in question during all this. You won't have the time to, but more importantly-- you won't want to. See, there's nothing to empathize with in your foes, other than their rudimentary special resemblance (even that of which is vague at times). No, this is deliberately meant to be a violent affair. Hit these people harder than they can hit you until they can hit you no more.There is in fact a story lying at the bottom of all this physicality. You assume the role of Terry ""Bulk"" Meatloaf, a detective who also happens to dabble with the idea of being a copper (though the only peace keeping equipment you have access to is a taser with the voltage knocked up to 'well-done'). Also at your disposal are several forensic tools which you will use to collect evidence on the serial killer you're after. These CSI-esque segments are very simplistic, but implemented sparsely enough that they make for a nice distraction when they show up. Oh, and you're not just a regular cop, you're a supercop...your mysterious past has given you strong intuition skills and enlarged your muscle mass to a freakish degree.The plot's got this whole 'PS2-game-tranformed-into-a-made-for-SyFy-movie-upscaled-onto-2005-video-game-hardware' feel going for it. The only dialogue that'll stick is the bleeding pain blather emanating from your foes as they are felled. By the conclusion you'll be facing off against a Hellraiser kendo stick twirling ninja demon in a barnyard. Who cares! This is about being strapped to a chair in an echo chamber and getting rocked with the sounds of objects forcefully displacing viscera. Just kick back, become one with it.Before you know it the white flash riddled credits will be abusing your eyes. You'll try to come to grips with it all, wondering if there was anything left for you to think over. There's nothing, of course. Hours will pass and you'll forget ever having played Condemned. Days later its very existence will fade from your memory. Condemned is the pleasant warmth you'd feel while perched over a fizzling dumpster fire.			"

												Bought this originally on PC on a whim, but I dislike M and K for fps games. So i was disapointed to learn that game does not have very good Xbox 360 pad support. So i found a cheap copy of it on xbox. WHatever version you get it is very good. The detective skills and the primal fear of defending your self from crazies is fun and full filling. This game defiantly has a ""Before Steam"" feel to it with its controls. But i'm sure most of you prefer MandK anyway. Check it out.			"

												This is yet another game that is good but a few steps away from greatness. As a game for a buck though, it was well worth it, even if it was a bit too short for my likings, only 5 hours. Remember, it was made by some of the same people who made fear and that work shows. The game has a great scary atmosphere that can turn even the smallest thing scary. Yet the game doesn't have an Alma character or jump scares so it doesn't go overboard. The fighting system is unique and I give it credit for that. Instead of reloading, you can only check the ammo in your gun and the game has a great system for melee weapons. The investigative tools are interesting but they just pause the game and aren't overly important in my book. The story is good, nothing special but good. My only complaint about the story is that it has an open ending but the sequel never reached PC. This all would have made this a great game except for one short coming, your character is slow. Your character moves at a very leisurely pace and even the running doesn't make you speed up that much. Going down stairs or even ramps is a huge pain because it takes forever. The point of games like Outlast or Amnesia is that you can run away from danger whereas in this game you can slowly walk away. Yes, it gives the game a steady pace but that pace is Slow. If the game wasn't so fricken slow, it would be a much better game, that and being longer. Still, it’s a great game for a dollar and I think everyone would enjoy it for a day.			"

												Ah, Condemned: Criminal Origins.The game looks OK, graphics are kinda in the ballpark for 2006 technology and some would argue they don't age well. The plot is a bit generic and forgettable, so don't expect a Spielberg-caliber story. Replayability isn't very good; once you're through, you've pretty much seen it all. For a long time, I found this game in a bargain bin.I'd imagine you're a little confused. If you look up, it says that I recommend this game.Those things that I griped about above are all negligible (at least for me). You don't buy this game because it doesn't look like Crysis nor do you buy it because the story will enthrall you like To The Moon. You buy this game because it will scare you. The sounds and environments alone were enough to make me contemplate turning the game off in fear before I even saw any sort of threat. Dark, derelict locations such as abandoned shopping malls, run-down subways, and remote farmhouses with an eerie soundtrack (fun fact: the soundtrack sometimes makes use of subtle shepherd's tones) drive the tense feeling of this game. When the atmosphere turns hostile and enemies rear their heads, you'll be seeing a range of things from ugly street thugs to nightmarish abominations. Great melee combat with solid controls help you wade through the horror, as firearms are a scarce commodity. You'll play most of the game weilding a pipe, electrical conduit, fire axe, or anything else that you find in the environment around you. Combat is engaging and satisfying; you'll be planning your melee strikes and kicks while blocking your enemy's attacks, sometimes executing a finishing move.I'm a big fan of this game, and how easily scared I am playing horror games I definitely got a lot more than my money's worth. If you can look past some drawbacks, this game is a great experience at an even greater value for it's price.If there were any bejeezus in my body at the beginning of this game, they were all gone by the end.

												This is a game I intended to play as soon as I heard about it. For a variety of reasons, I did not get to it until at least 3 years after release. I had played several newer games during those years, but I still loved every minute of Condemned. It remains my favorite first-person melee game—I can think of few games that have gotten my heart beating as fast as this game.Admittedly, there are times where it can be easy to get a little lost—I had to rely on guides to find my way through a couple of levels. If you adverse to using a guide at all, this may prevent you from enjoying the game as much as I did. However, if you are a sucker for brutal combat and insane stories (that last cut-scene sticks with me to this very day), Condemned may be just right for you.Full Disclosure: I played through the game on X360, originally. My time playing the Steam version is limited.			"

So I'll review once again, today I'll review Condemned : Criminal OriginsCondemned Criminal Origins, I have to say is a really decent game. Good story, good gameplay and decent graphics from 2006. The game told a story about an Agent from an organization called SCU who worked as an Investigator, revealed he has an ability to connect to Serial killer's mind. He was framed for murder and he needs to pursue the suspect. One distinctive feature of this game is its excellent horror theme.Other features include :Melee focused battles, you have guns but their ammo is limitted and you CAN'T reload themThe AI of this game is pretty smart, giving more thrill on engagementCrazy hallucinations and bits of jumpscareEnemies will likely beat you to death when your guard is downTasers, you can now shock criminals by their ballsChallenge on investigating crime scenes and other stuffetc.Not that much of a good review but there you go.

												I played this on the Xbox 360 when it first released. It is the first real horror game I have played, not considering the Resident Evil series. I am very impressed that the gameplay still stands solid after all these years. The story keeps you wanting to know more, however I was let down both times with the open ending. I thought maybe I missed something on my original play through. I didn't. I'll keep my lips shut about it. That being said it's fun to play and it's a great ride!

												Great game with a very creepy atmosphere. Combat can be a bit repetitive at times but the investigation parts really add to the game. Some of the music is pretty catchy and really blends with the events that happen on screen. It takes a decent amount of time to beat on your first playthrough, and there's a good amount of stuff to collect also. The graphics have not aged that well honestly (though it shouldn't be that big of a deal). Controls are pretty responsive, however the block mechanic seems a bit off.

Also try not to be too harsh on the graphics yes they are dated but the game did come out like in 06. Look its not a run and gun fps its a slow paced, melee spam game where you get sucked deeper and deeper into the story thus making you want to play it more to find out what happends and who is behind it all. 6/10			"

 Review - Condemned: Criminal Origins === Rating: 7.0 / 10 A good first person action / survival horror that will make you jump from your chair more than once. With a very well-crafted series of environments, excellent sound design, graphics style perfect for this game genre, and also challenging combat, this will surely be a title loved by any horror and action gamers alike. Not for long though.=== Pros & Cons + Pros ++ Excellent sound design provides very good immersion+ Graphics style and environments are adequate, well done and very well suited for this type of game+ Challenging combat + Good enemy AI thet will know when to attack you and when to retreat, making each enemy a real danger+ Plenty of secrets and collectibles are the joy of completitionists+ Tense and overwhelming atmosphere: it will scare the stuff out of you, especially if played at night+ Good variety of weapons, each with its own feeling in combat+ Collectibles and achievements will unlock extra stuff about the lore and story- Cons -- Poor variety of enemies: basically there is the skinny and weak one, the average one, and the big one, plus some special variants rarely to act as bosses- Storyline has its degree of mysteries which is good, but is still something that looks dragged out from a stereotyped police movie mixed with a stereotyped B-class horror movie, and has some inconsistencies and downright nonsense as you will aswell notice- Short duration: took me, at maximum difficulty and looking for most collectibles around, around 7 hours to complete the adventure- A bit too many medkits lying around in the endgame chapters, and firearms also===			"

												My expectation was for this to be a mix of investigation and action. While this does occur, Condemned is pretty weak on each. Combat is clunky, encounters are basic and predicatble, the game walks you through the investigations leaving nothing to discover, and the story feels either dates or unoriginal.Condemned is OK, but not remarkable.

												I got to say it's difficult for me to review it. The story is quite interesting the atmosphere is good. But what the hell with the ennemies in this game, you will face plenty of homeless, drug addicts, and zombie like guys, a tone of them which make the game quite repetitive. But also what the heck with these enemies why are they so numerous? Whats the story behind them?For instance. how can you justify  all these ""gouls like"" ennemies in the last level, it makes no sense. Well if you dont think to much this is an ok game, I still recommend it because it's a good gaming experience.			"

												Have you ever had a nightmare where you just can't move? You move slowly as if wading through mud, can't jump over obstacles or crouch under them, while being pursued by howling madmen? This is that nighmare. I mean, christ almighty it's slow. I'm not one to normally complain about a meandering pace but this is absolutely glacial. It's very atmospheric, but it'd be more atmospheric if I didn't move like a sumo wrestler on a treadmill.That said, I can see what the appeal is - or at least, what it was back in the days - in that the game is pretty effective at scaring you and making strung-out drug addicts genuinely menacing. The melee combat is... well, it's a matter of taste. If you really get used to it it's passable and a fair bit more visceral than most games (though not as good as Zeno Clash) but it's a pretty tough learning curve to get used to. The character moves incredibly slowly even in combat.That's not the end of the problems. The game talks about achivements and how you unlock them, but doesn't actually have achivements. Good job, Sega! The collectibles are tedious to find thanks to the snail's pace you move at, and they don't actually unlock anything useful (like a speed upgrade). You can't take bullets from weapons to use them in others, even if they're the same gun, so once a gun is spent just throw it away like a cheeseburger wrapper. Your protagonist carries around a literal ton of analytic equipment but can only hold one weapon, because apparently two handguns is just over his capacity. I can't recommend it, which is frustrating, because it feels like a flawed gem. Sadly, it's more flawed than gem, at least if you're entering this without nostalgia.			"

The ending was a bit hard, But a nice challenge. It took me a little over nine hours to beat this game. I creeped and explored, It made the game that much better. And well I can say it was a decent scare at times. A large selection of wepons throughout the levels. The graphics are dated, And honestly I didn't mind. The setting of the story really got me into the game. I really enjoyed it and only ran into one ""Glitch"" I can say. But it was an easy fix by loading an auto-save. Yes, I would recommend this game.

												Condemned is perhaps the scariest game on Steam.  Slender and Amnesia have nothing on this game that so perfectly balances terror and fear with punishing gameplay.  It's tough, unforgiving and scary and balls with hit recognition so gruesomely accurate that it would make the Boston Strangler cringe.  The blood efects and realism is Eli Roth level, so deliciously rendered to make you think that you're actual smashing an old, diseased war veteran's teeth in with a bit of pipe.			"

												I really, really wanted to love this game. I finished it when it first came out years ago, and what's strange, I played the PC port and I experienced extreme framerate drops all the time, it was basically unplayable. Then, I upgraded my PC, and I was able to play this without a problem, no framerate drops at all.About 4 years after that or so, here I am again, trying to revisit this game after a while. And even with a better PC, I'm experiencing the same EXTREME framerate drops again, even if I'm playing with everything on low. From what I understand, this is a somewhat common problem, some people experience it and some don't. There seems to be a fix also, but I'm sick of trying to fix lazy ports all the time. The gameplay is fun, the atmosphere is creepy, and all in all, this game is excellent. But with a sloppy port like this, I'm not sure if I can fully recommend it. It seems like it works for some people and it doesn't for the rest. If you're into gambling with this sort of stuff, go ahead and buy it. If you don't, stay away from this sloppy port.			"

												-RIG-i7 4770k, 980ti, 16gb RAM, win 7Cool game! Though it hasn't aged that well.Can definitely tell this was a Monolith joint. The inital set up and premise of the main character is VERY Point Man in F.E.A.R, and I almost wonder if this takes place in the F.E.A.R universe. It has the same grimey, dirty atmosphere that I so very much enjoyed in FEAR (mostly the original) and I mwould go so far to say - it's better in Condemned. The lighting especially is so well done and really a feat that holds up almost ELEVEN years later. God damn.The story is very interesting in the same way the original FEAR was. Crazy, insane, off the wall nonsense is happening and then it goes deeper. The lore of the series is real interesting in the way that it's just so weird and straight out of left field. I'll say it could have been a little bit better. I think Fear and FEAR 2 have held up a lot better in that respect.The character models are REAL ugly. And not in a way that's meant to fit in with the grimey art direction, they're AWFUL. The environment textures are pretty good, the lighting is great. But the models... I don't know what happened lol.The combat... is frustrating. There's a lot of different weapons, which is positive. So many times i saw an object and thought 'wonder if i ca- oh i can kill psychotic people with this. nice.' but they all play pretty much the same. There's big weapons, that have reach but slow and medium reach weapons that are generally faster. Weapons do have different basic stats but I don't find myself paying much attention to that. The melee combat is simplistic in it's design. Which is a good thing and kind of not. You either hit or parry. I could not for the life of me ever figure out how to time the parries. Now every enemy is slightly different with their attack aptterns and speeds, which is cool but it means i have a hard time teaching myself the patterns. So instead of engaging in a hit and parry, back n forth with enemies, i would hit and run backwards and then go back in for another hit once they misses with their retaliation. Which just isn't that fun and personally I found the execution moves a pain to instigate as it removed the momentum.There are guns that are sparcely found - pistol, revolver, shotgun, submachine gun. Much easier to kill enemies with the guns, as you might expect, but the shooting isn't great. I did find it kind of a neat idea that you can't pick up ammo. You use the bullets in the gun when you pick it up and then you gotta either replace it with another weapons or use the gun as a melee weapon. I think I would prefer a Resident Evil inv system or something... or at the very least a TWO weapon limit. so maybe I could carry a gun and a melee weapon. I just felt awfully restricted, which I guess is by design.I had a pretty bad bug where the lights/shadows glitched and these black bars glitched across the screen in certain areas mostly with flashing lights. I had to roll back to a TWO YEAR OLD driver to fix it. Ridiculous but apprarently this is a problem with the Litech engine that they have with many of their games.Another problem I ran into is that after playing for awhile the FPS dropped to 30fps. The fix is quite easy (google it), it's  simply downloading a file and putting it in the install folder. Other than these problems, the game ran rock solid 60fps, max settings.The game has a lot of problems. I'm sure it was a lot more profound when it originally released but a lot of it hasn't aged amazingly. However, I was compelled by the atmosphere and discovering these grizzly murders. I was incredibly driven to find out what was going to happen next in the story and I'm glad I played it. Guess it's time to track down a copy of Condemned 2 for PS3... WHY ISN'T IT ON PC????			"

												Terrible. I'm surprised it's so highly rated on here. Each level consists of slowly trudging through another very beige, very linear environment. I sware my play time would have been greatly reduced had the developer chosen a walking pace beyond something of a snail, you can't jump either, except when the game tells you (climbing is the same). Combat is reduced to learning your enemies melee animations, blocking, then clubbing them over the head with the dozen or so objects your allowed to use as weapons. There are guns, which thankfully reduce the amount of time your stuck in boring melee combat, but they are few and far between, and rarely have more than a few bullets. Atmosphere, which also seems to be lauded here, is pretty much cribbed from any number of 2nd rate psychological thrillers (Se7en, Session 9, etc). Hot garbage.			"

												Condemned was poorly made and poorly produced. The code is not good, your character will constantly stumble, objects in melee are closer than they appear. It was produced for Xbox 360 and it shows. All the non-junkie characters are built like they eat lions.That said, Condemned is unique in the way it treats horror. Nobody does what it does. The ""spooky"" segments sometimes come off as F.E.A.R lite, but the way it does horror and combat shows that you CAN do a game with scary gameplay when the protagonist still has a weapon. The whole ""fear of homeless"" thing, while dangerously close to classism, still makes for some really effective horror. The whole tone plays like a crazy over-the-top version of Seven, which I love.They made a sequel, Condemned 2: Bloodshot. Nobody likes it (they always cite a particular element that goes over the top, like this game didn't have the most ridiculous business) but everybody remembers at least one particular scenario from it, and for that reason alone they should have ported it to PC.Total playtime: 6.5 hours.Your experience of horror gaming is not complete if you don't have this game.

												This game is a strange one, it's not particularly remarkable in any one way. Nor is it particularly terrible in any way. It falls somewhere in between, somewhere around ""average"" with some very above and below average moments interspersed. Firstly, you will spend most of the game using melee combat and this is surprisingly meaty and more importantly, while nowhere near the challenge of something like dark souls, it is not so easy that it becomes boring. Just the right amount of challenging for a game which ushers you along at this pace and some of the fights are quite a bit more challenging than others.  I will say that one particular upgrade slightly trivialises certain parts of the game but it's not a HUGE issue, just something to be noted and something I actually enjoyed using.You pick weapons up from the environment in an organic way whether it be an electrical conduit, a 2 by 4 or a fire axe, there is great variety and actually do allow you to approach different enemies in different ways.There are some excellent ambient sounds particularly later in the game which really serve to get your mind thinking about the environment beyond what you can actually see at times. Along with some perfectly fitting tracks humming in the background which are somewhat reminiscient of the cry of fear OST at times though nowhere near as varied. Don't expect to be overly invested in these characters as they are relatively cookie cutter affair, not too mention the ""Plot"" itself is deeply haphazard in how it is presented and rarely are you given a moment to care about what's happening. It takes a while but eventually it's possible to kind of like and be intrigued by a couple ofcharacters here, if in something of a ""superhero movie"" type way. It's nothing impressive, thoroughly throw away fair. But sometimes entertaining in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way.There is a a pervasive and somewhat cheesy charm to the whole thing and as with anything which requires a relative suspension of disbelief for maximum enjoyment (and you will have to do that quite a bit here, one character gets KO'd and immediately acts as if nothing happened to them when they wake etc), this one is best played when you are in the particular mood to do so.Between some super clunky and repetitive ""this door needs a fire axe to be opened, find fire axe"" moments, not being able to run up and down stairs or over dirt (SUPER annoying and utterly pointless), this is a game which can really frustrate and is absolutely best enjoyed in short bursts, perhaps a chapter at a time.There a lot of people saying the game is scary but I personally don't think it is very scary at all. It's certainly not a true ""horror"" game in that sense. While there are undertones which prevent the game from frightening you as much as it could though there are some legitimately tense moments. And there is one moment in particular which was excellently done, wonderful use of sound effects as a means of frightening the player and it worked! One real pro is that it picks up quite a bit towards the end (too little too late though) and the nature of the ending even made me really want to play the sequel! Though don't expect it to be particularly narratively fulfilling! There is not much replay value here and while there are collectibles, I never felt compelled to specifically locate them. This game is about  moving forward, the nature of the envoronments makes backtracking a lot less fun than in other games so I just didn't bother.Average, competent, fun, tediousBoth surprisingly bad, and surprisingly good at times. If you are looking for a cheap and solid distraction between bigger games, something quite dark much not as much as it could have been due to the cheesy undertones, something that takes you from A-B while having a bit of fun all wrapped up in a relatively impressively eerie aesthetic, I would absolutely reccomend it, otherwise, I would not. Steam doeesn't allow me to write ""neutral"" but that is my overall score here despite the thumbs down!			"

Nobody likes it (they always cite a particular element that goes over the top, like this game didn't have the most ridiculous business) but everybody remembers at least one particular scenario from it, and for that reason alone they should have ported it to PC.Total playtime: 6.5 hours.Your experience of horror gaming is not complete if you don't have this game. Buy it.			"

												When it comes to horror in gaming, I'm gonna be honest: I find horror in gaming to be laughable to the point of not even being scary. Games like Slender, FEAR, FNaF, SCP, all they do is just make me laugh and never scream in horror. Sure, some might make me flinch a bit, but that's it. WIth that said, I had a lot of recommendations for 'Condemned: Criminal Origins' for a while now, with people saying that it's one of the best FPS and scariest games out there. Well, I'd like to know what game they were playing, cause this game is not the game they were talking about. This might be one of the worst games I've played in a long while. The horror elements are laughable to the point where they are BORING. When it comes to the much touted combat, it's lame. All you do is just left click to swing or fire your weapon, right click to block, space to kick and that's it. I dunno, I guess I'm use to more refined FPS combat in games like Zeno Clash and Mirror's Edge, but I expected a bit more when it came to this game with all the praise it got. I mostly stuck with the firearms whenever I found them or tasering the opponent, to which I found the taser can make most fights end in seconds with one well tase and one well hit with your weapon. The one good thing I will say about this game is that, well, the detective gameplay is pretty fun. Granted, it's not as involved as most games with this feature, but, nonetheless, it is fun. Now, I'm not one to harp on graphics (to me, graphics are not a selling point in a game), but WOW! Does this game look ugly! Even if I did get this on Day One, I'd probably think it's ugly! The character models are janky and not pleasing to look at (even the normal characters suffer this fate). The only other good thing I'll say is that the dialouge is well acted and fun to listen to....coming from the normal characters. The psychos dialouge are just cliched bad guys who want to bash your brains in dialogue. Out of all the games I've played, this is, hands down, one of the worst I played in a long while. Sadly, that means I can not recommend this to anyone at all. If you want a game that does first-person combat better, play either Zeno Clash games or Mirror's Edge. If you want a game that does horror good, get either the first or second F.E.A.R or Amnesia. Just avoid this game.			"

												This game doesn't stand the test of time, but I'm kinda surprised it was well recieved to begin with. Graphics are okay except for humans but the real problem lies in the story and mechanics. After finishing it, I still don't quite know what all the supernatural elements were about and the motivation of the enemies involved. There are a lot of junkies and random human enemies too but they don't quite have a motivation for attacking you and if they were hypnotized then that's not really explained. Nothing is in fact ever explained and the rules of world is left untouched. In terms of mechanics, the game's inability to allow the player to store a gun and bullets is a major drawback and not a creative way to create tension. It almost seems like the developers didn't know which direction to approach, a survival horror (without weapons) or a crime mystery. And while they probably meant for both, their execution was lacking. The horror was fine somtimes, in fact I had a couple of startles, but the supernatural element falters heavily.			"

												Entertaining, but at the same time very very mediocre.  Nice evidence collecting mechanic for gathering clues, but the game has other issues that make it far less enjoyable than it could be.  For one, you're apparently the most out of shape FBI agent ever.  Want to sprint?  Not for more than 5 seconds or so you don't.  And not sure if it was a bug on my end or not, but your walking speed drops to barely a crawl if you're on stairs, or any sort of incline, or even on an uneven surface.  Decent enough game, but could have been better.  Don't remember buying this, but worth installing if it's in bundle.			"

												I feel bad giving this game a negative review, but just know that it's either it's age or a really poor PC port that is getting the negative review. I've enjoyed ""Condemned: Criminal Origins"" a few times over the years, a few times on the Xbox 360, and once just now on the PC. The game still has the great atmosphere I remember, but the controls (at least on PC) are incredibly messed up. Ethan can't run up the stairs, instead he sticks to a slow crawl. Getting stuck in the environment is extremely easy, and graphics have not aged well (though, for ten years old, they're not the worst). If you can, I'd recommend the Xbox version over the PC version.			"

												I saw Markiplier play this a long time back, but I didn't know it was on steam. One day he mysteriously stopped his playlist on it and I was curious about the rest of the game. I finally was old enough to buy it and played it for myself.That was a big mistake.I'm the biggest p*ssy you'll probably ever know. I don't know why I willingly bought this game.GOOD:- Decent graphics for it's time.- Probably the best combat I have seen in a single game ever.- Tazer goes to Super Tazer. Prepare for 1-hit kills with SHOCKZ!- Great atmosphere.- Bunch of extras stuff. (Concept art, the such. I always liked when games did stuff like that.)- Good voice acting. I guess.MEH:- You can beat the game in 6 hours or even less. (I didn't collect the bonus stuff unless it was right in front of me, so that's my time for just going through it.)BAD:- For me: Little to no replayability. Could just be me and horror games, but there's really not much to it besides extras.- I had no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea what the story was AT ALL xD (You're insane? Something's... weird? The final boss was--... Unexpected. o.o)- The end of the game (Unless due to the previously stated) seems like it was thrown together just to quickly wrap up the game. The area you're in is so unlike any other in the game and I noticed the game started to look cheesier and cheesier. The final boss fight was detailed, but... The end area of the game made no sense. None. Zero. Oh, also prepare for nightmares at the very end.Overall... Yeah go ahead and get this game IF, and only IF you think you can stand thinking about nothing but it for the next week or so. That's what I kinda did anyway. Still thinking about that ending to today. Ugh. Trolldevs. "

A super a** long game with very creepy gameplay.

Much like ManHunt; you feel so innocent, so bystander-like as you KILL OVER 200304203402340 PEOPLE as an ""innocent cop"" to prove that you're innocent. While using any environmental weapon to kill anyone that opposes you.

This is a fun creepy game, it's not scary, it just feels like a sh*tty ManHunt copy. The missions aren't very intersting, the gameplay definately drags on more than it should, and the controls just suck a**!

It's a decent game, but I'd stick with ManHunt.

												Due to high praise for being very scary and one of the best horror games, I decided to give this one a try.It's ugly (even for last-gen console launch standards) with vomit textures and models, the story feels shoehorned in with the main antagonist feeling very uninspired, the beginning twist happens way too quickly to make any sense, the combat has no oomph to it...It really just does sound design well.

												I don't normally make reveiws but since i feel like it so i made one. Condemned: Criminal Origins  was a  horror/mysterious game, and i can say. This game is Damn amazing! The Atmosphere    has the dark, New yorked themed, infact the game takes place on New York City. The mele system is so amazing but it gets some time to get used to, you  have to perfectly time your hits, or what ever that called. ( you know what i mean)  I won't spoil the game  if you still didn't finish the game, but i gave this  a 7/10.			"

												This is one of the few ""scary games"" that actually managed to freak me out in places. Storywise, Condemned is a great serial killer detective mystery, and is very reminiscent of the movie Se7en. The gameplay in condemned is brilliant. You could consider it a first-person shooter, but gunplay is a minor element compared to the melee combat, which this game does better than most. The melee system lets you swing, block, and kick, and is incredibly satisfying. You can use just about anything as a weapon, and are required to use certain weapons for certain environmental taks (sledgehammers to open locks, fire-axes to break down doors), which makes you switch up your strategy. The way gunplay is handled is very interesting and well done as well. Instead of finding a bunch of random ammo just laying around everywhere like in most games (which even games claiming to be realistic tend to do), Condemned limits you to what ammo is in the guns you find, making shots a commodity. Once you run out, you either use your gun as a melee weapon, or toss it and find a different weapon, which is yet another way this game makes you switch up your strategy. This is an older game, so the textures are quite low-res, but the great art direction makes up for this and gives the game some brilliant visuals. All-in-all, I highly reccomend Condemned if you're looking for a unique and well-made first-person game.			"

												This underrated gem was one most people missed for the 360 at launch. This, game IS GREAT! VERY UNDERRATED!Cannot help for this game being released YEARS after the original, that the graphics aren't as sharp though, maybe it's just me, but I find the textures a bit muddy. But that shouldn't deter you from one of the horror genre's most AMAZING games! I think this is one of the only games  to give you a gun, yet STILL make you feel hopeless. It's pretty crazy, there is no reloading. just frenetically checking your gun for munitions! They do not make them like this anymore, this was a signal of a dying age of greatness. I think most of the OLDER titles are the best, most of the newer games just lack thefeeling the old ones have, and still retain. Give me The Suffering over OUTLAST any day. Speaking of which, I just bought that game. I find horror games are best. They usually can incite a feeling of desperation. Outlast does that. Onetime! The first time you play it, most games aren't even scary anymore, the heavy amounts of gore, it's just like, ""wow kid, nice shock value!"". I bought this to relive the original, and this has some issues, but nothing game breaking, and still retains that desperate feeling. Go ahead and buy this. This game is real nice for any horror enthusiast like me. 9/10I usually NEVER give perfect ratings, but this one is close, it just has a few issues. I mean it, if you like horror, get this.			"

												For a game reliant on close-quarters combat with timed blocks, there's not much worse than when hits aren't synchronised with the animation. It's correct about...  9 out of 10 times, but receiving the final blow right after you hit the enemy and he's still swinging his weapon /backwards/  for a counter attack can be extremely frustrating.Not bad otherwise though			"

												Condemned is a horror shooter that really emphasises on horror but is it a game you want to play ? In Condemned you play as Ethan Thomas, he is an FBI agent on the hunt for a serial killer by the name of Serial Killer X who kills serial killers the same ways they kill theyre victims. Theres only one killer left on SKX list and its a killer by the name of the torturer. So its a race who can get to The torturer first. This game is quite frankly one of the best horror games i have ever played. In the game you use melee weapons to take your enemys down raging from planks to manequin arms. The game also has weapons but be carefull since theres no ammo, once you run out of ammo you have to find a melee gun quick before the enemys get you. The game has really creepy enviroments that will keep you on the edge of youre seat. The game has some problems. Minor glitches that occur throught the game will some times make you replay the chapter but after some glitches is still a fantastic game so overall skip the lame games like Resident evil 6 and Outlast, and play a game that is frankly of the scariest game ever made i give Condemned Criminal Origins a 9.5/10			"

												One man, Johnny Condemned gets hired by the United States government to work alone in his own task force, using his special set of skills with his self-made specialized tools to eradicate the entire homeless population of New York City. In this game you get to play as Johnny in the middle of his murderous spree using various improvized weapons. Soon ♥♥♥♥ gets ♥♥♥♥ed beyond belief and I guess that you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off an ancient diety alongside killing all the homeless people and a demon (whose name is Big Demon Derrick i think) and he just starts following you around, murdering your assistant and writing your name in human ♥♥♥♥ alongside the walls before you corner him in a barn and murder him with a piece of plywood. Turns out he was the leader of the homeless people and was actually very powerful. After you kill him, the homeless diety decides that you should be the new Big Demon Derrick, starting Condemned 2. Haven't played Condemned 2. Good game. Also crashes constantly.			"

												I would suggest this game only for very patient people. This game is disappointment for me sadly because I like F.E.A.R. series (1 and 2). I could regret to buy this game but I got it for free from Sega Steam promotions.+ climatic horror atmosphere+ good environment, shadows and sounds building game's atmosphere+ at the beginning fighting is not tedious+ use of police tools- in the beginning story is promising but turns to like was from trashy thriller movie,- whole game you fight rusted tools with mad bums which becomes boring quickly,- fight system is not balanced especially on hard difficulty where you often die easily (at most in further and final parts of the game),- story not explains a lot of things- not fixed by developers problem with fps drops. I've solved this with disabling HID interfaces in device manager.			"

												I give up. This game is essentially unplayable.What I would LIKE to do is give Condemned: Criminal Origins a lukewarm review and describe it as the underachieving lovechild of Cry of Fear and Dark Corners of the Earth. Atmospherically its a nice mix of the former's crushing depression and the latter's underscore of paranoia, but the actual story is honestly too weak to live up to it.I would LIKE to elaborate on that point, but to do that I would need to actually be able to finish the damned game to give an honest opinion. But I can't, because it's a poorly optimized mess. Putting aside the FEAR engine's issues with Logitech hardware, the game simply runs like ♥♥♥. My laptop is not a beater, it can run Metro: Last Light just fine. And yet this game, which graphically looks more on par with HL2, couldn't drop its framerate much lower without being a slideshow, and that's on minimum graphics after making sure the Logitech issue was fixed.If the game runs fine on your machine then good for you, but frankly what I have played through hasn't made a good enough impression for me to care to dig thrugh the Internet's rubbish bins looking for another fix.

												A game focusing on melee combat which fumbles every possible aspect of melee combat.Enemies can block your attacks at will during any of their animations? Check.Enemies can hit you with a 2x4 whille you're 20 feet away? Check.Enemies consistently ignore the fact that you're blocking and hit you anyway? Double Check.The ol' ""Taser enemy, kick enemy, run away until taser is recharged, rinse, repeat"" method will quickly become your favorite when you are without a gun.The ""forensic investigation"" segments are repetitive and require no thought from the player. The game tells you when you need to investigate, auto-selects the proper tool, and gives you arrows telling you where to point it.			"

The level design wasn't great. Being forced to backtrack through it constantly was very annoying and made the game feel very dragged out .

												""overlooked/underrated"" games tend to have a significant flaw that can seperate its players, some enjoy the game while others think its terriblecondamned is one such game, its influencial (outlast takes a bit from here), has great atmosphere, some of the best enemy AI and some of the best horror levels out there. But the game is bogged down by its very slow pace, which can frustrate players that are used to faster games.you pretty much play the entire game walking, the character cant run/jog for a longer distance than a small room, you cant jump, crouch nor any movements other than attacking, blocking, walking or a short sprints. theres absolutely no platforming here, and everything happens on a horzontial plane, no  ups or downs, just left or right. (think doom)this can result to a boring and frustrating experience and can be tiresome at the 2nd half of the game, folks who are used to fast paced fps might also feel out of place as the combat relies more in timing than accuracy and reflexes. (you time your blocks and hits)if one can look past the pacing and gameplay design, theres a wonderful experience to be had, but if you cant, then it can be a very painful one.  "

The story is dark, the game is creepy and the action is heart pumping - do you take out the enemy with a gun and waste precious ammo, or do you grab a 2x4 and hope that'll be enough. The variety in combat is great, and the tension that builds from trying to defend in combat as well as counter attack is done well. A superb title from a once solid developer of PC titles.			"

I really liked the idea of a psychological l horror game based on the evil that men do, and the detective element sounded cool. Too bad it sucked ♥♥♥. The only reason I finished it was cuz' I'm OCD as ♥♥♥♥ and have to finish every game I start.Pros:*Interesting Concept for Story*Interesting choice of melee centric combat*Good sound effectsCons:*Un-skippable cutscenes*Hidden guns don't do ♥♥♥♥ (you shoot people over and over and somehow melee weapons are more effective)*Weapons that have no reach somehow have more reach in the hands of your enemies, and you will be damaged even if you clearly aren't hit in their attack animation*Poorly aged character models*Poorly integrated detective/story elements in which you must scan evidence and then talk on your phone. You can't move during these sequences and they happen often. *Not remotely scary*Poorly integrated supernatural elements that clash with initial tone*Sprinting is only slightly faster than walking*Sprint button gets stuck for some reason even when you clearly have stamina left*Tedious boss fights*You can't take ammo from one gun and transfer it to another of the same kind, so you have to back track to where you left your other gun, and as I said, sprinting doesn't really work*Unsatisfying ending*Blocking doesn't work*Blocking doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work*WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOESN'T BLOCKING WORK?!?!*Because blocking doesn't work, you just end up mashing to kill enemies, and they come often.*Relies on jump scares instead of atmosphere to scare you*Environments all look the sameConclusion: The only thing that is ""criminal"" about this game is charing 14.95 for it. I payed three ♥♥♥♥ing bucks for it and still feel ripped off. I hear the console version is way better.

												I wanted to like this game. I played it for several hours and made it through to almost the end, but a few major problems kept me from finishing it and liking it. Firstly, this is one of those ""gameplay first"" games where there are long stretches of walking and shooting before reaching plot points. Half Life did that and Half Life was fine. This was okay too.But there is no direction as to where your supposed to go next. I would spend up to half an hour wondering where I was supposed to go. And some areas can have such similar looking hallways and rooms that getting lost is kind of easy.I had to look up guides for the puzzles occasionally. I call them puzzles because, despite the quest hint telling me what I was supposed to be doing, I had no idea what I was doing.The combat is easy in the beginning and there are legitamately scary moments here. Legit scary moments. Then I fight a butcher lady with a cleaver that two-hit kills me and I have no bullets so I have to get close to her to melee and die repeatedly. It's the main reason I quit. I did not want ot restart the level and I could not face this ""boss"" nor did I want to.I looked up the ending and was srely disapointed. The plot actually does get really good and builds up with some interesting predicaments. I enjoyed it up until I looked up the ending, was disapointed. Get this on discount if you want resource scarce and good plot game. Just make sure you always have bullets in reserve. Or buthcer lady will force you to restart the level.   "

												Condemned is a first-person brawler with horror-ish setting and a hint of criminal investigation mechanics. Seeing the positive reviews and the fact it was developed by the same team that created one of my favorite games of all time: FEAR, I decided to give this game a try. Unfortunately Condemned turned out to be a quite disappointing and mostly dull experience.Most of your time playing C:CO will be spent being engaged in a melee combat, so you would think developers would put extra thought into this part to make sure it is actually fun, yet it is not the case. The combat in Condemned it sluggish and clunky, to a point were it gets boring and annoying pretty fast, luckily it also doesn't require any special thought on normal difficulty. The biggest problem here is how little control you have over your swings and how slow they are - with bigger weapons you might start your attack on a completely open enemy, but then notice he takes a swing at you so much faster, so it would be better to block it - but you can't! Once the attack is in motion you have no choice but to observe it being played out, which is rather unfair considering your enemies are perfectly fine canceling their attacks (faking). Speaking of blocking, at first you might want to try and be clever about how you approach your enemies, by anticipating their attacks and blocking them (or ""parrying"" actually, since you can't hold the button down, you have to tap it), but you will soon find out it a very unreliable method - press the button too early or too late and your block will whiff; press at the right time, but your enemy has a bigger weapon and you will be damaged anyway. Also, your block becomes even more useless once you start encountering enemies in 2vs1 and 3vs1 situations. Add to that the fact that med-kits are quite common and it will quickly become apparent that the fastest and most reliable method is to just keep swinging till everything dies, while ignoring any damage dealt to you in the mean time. On the plus side, there are some occasional firearms here and there to make things more interesting - saving those 5 bullets (more or less) for head-shots is quite fun.If instead of fighting you are more interested in Condemned's horror setting, then you need to know it is almost exclusively based on jump-scares and doesn't really try build any kind of tension. Maybe in one or two instances the developers tried to do something original, but most of the time it comes down to something jumping in your face. It also doesn't help that everything looks so blend, so rather than being scared, you will feel turned off by the low quality of the environments and, especially, the character models. Not to mention, for some reason, few significant cut scenes have their sound effects missing.Finally, forget about doing any kind of real ""investigation"" - gathering evidence just comes down to pressing ""X"" when the game tells you to. Afterward you can't really even go anywhere, as you listen to the analysis results, so in the end the whole thing is nothing more than a nuisance.Condemned: Criminal Origins might have been a decent game when it first came out, but by today's standards it unfortunately looks and feels like a budget game with almost nothing that would make it stand out of the crowd. 5/10			"

												The world's slowest walking simulator.I'm obviously coming to this game late, grabbing it 11 years after its original release during a Sega promotion.  It's just not worth your time.  Everything about it is so ponderous, it's like you're walking through treacle, the sprint button is useless, you swing your weapons in bullet time.How can melee combat be so dull?  If I swing a lead pipe at you, you're going down.  Not in Condemned however, where you take turns alternating swipes with enemies who react like it's WWE.  This game does not understand the mechanics of violence, it is the opposite of Hotline Miami.  Play Hotline Miami.			"

												Wasted all of my bullets in the first level, bad guy steals my gun and threatens to kill me with it. Proceeds to kill both of my partners with my 0 bullet gun. Actually, it seems that many of the homeless drug addicts you kill in this game have the ability to literally sweat bullets and proceed to use them to kill you, since while the shotgun I retrieved from a locked safe only had 3 bullets in it, the hobo around the corner had at least 15 rounds for his shotgun. I guess having strong enemies, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, and dark lit maps counts is all it takes to count as a horror game.I know I've only played an hour, and maybe it gets decent further on, but I didn't enjoy a single moment of the time I played. For a game that revolves around investigating and fighting, it's got some of the worst mechanics for both. All of the enemies I've fought so far have been actual drug addicted homeless guys that really have it out for me for no other reason than they're addicts. The melee combat is terrible. Your attacks are either too slow to attack consecutively or aren't strong enough to stun enemies. There's a 100% damage block you can use, but it's very hard to predict when they'll attack, as their recoil animations and their attack animations are nearly identical. Gunplay is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. You're only ever going to find guns with enough ammo for one, maybe two kills. You're then forced to use the gun as a melee weapon, where's it's good for a hit or three before breaking and doing negligable damage. Why use the gun as a melee weapon? Because this FBI agent apparently decided to burn his weapon holster after his gun was stolen, so you have to choose between carrying a gun and carrying an actual melee weapon. As for the investigating, it's so far literally just walking around with a magic tool out until you find a glowy bit, then you take a second tool to scan it or take a picture. There's one part where you follow a trail only visible with your tool, except that it's through a linear area and the story progressed without needing to use the tool. That's it. It's not any kind of puzzle, unless you count having to look at the controls layout every so often, since they didn't bother to give you any of the keybindings in game.Another big annoyance is medkit spacing. I'll find three in one area, use one, and decide not to waste the other two, so I progress, take some damage in the next fight, but when I go back for my medkit, the previous door has been mysteriously closed forever. I suspect this has to do with the game's age, and it needing to unload the previous area in order to load the current. It's still really annoying to have to clear a whole nother area before finding another cluster of medkits. You can find some randomly hidden in closets or on desks, but in a game where one enemy can take out nearly your full health bar if you trade blows, I think carrying medkits would have been a better choice.While I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the mechanics, the sprint feature is just terrible. You get a few seconds of hardly noticable speed increase and the bar takes ages to refill, to the point you've already forgotten about sprinting by the time it's refilled. And while I'm at it, I want to talk about how stupid the game's premise is as well. Early game spoilers ahead.So, as far as I'd gotten, the main motivation for our hero, Ethan Thomas, is that the serial killer he's hunting stole his gun (again, out of bullets) and used it to kill the cops I worked with. The local police force decides it's much more likely that what actually happened is a seasoned investigator decided to out of the blue kill the officers helping him on his case. At least, that's what the mysterious weirdo who showed up in Ethan's apartment said. I'm convinced this guy was just trying to make me look even more guilty by running from the police, but I don't care to play long enough to find out.Maybe I would have enjoyed it a decade ago when it released, but compared to other games you could buy today for $15, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a waste of time and money.

												If you can play Condemned 2 Blood Shot instead of this one (was only released on PS3/360) then do so. Condemned 2 has essentially everything 1 does but its a bit better in every way and somewhat less clunky and has more variety. 2 isn't a great game but both of these are diffrent and are not terrible games. Decent games atleast.The story is a bit hard to follow in both and dousn't really make alot of sense though it sets up some interesting scenarios for you to playthrough but there is so little variety in gameplay that what your doing in the first fight of the game is the same thing you do in the last essentially with the same weapons too.Elements like how to block or when to arn't telegraphed very well to the player either, you learn that axes suck at block and suck along with sledgehammers for anyhing but objective items and the 2x4 or metal pipe maybe the best weapon in the game aside from the machinegun. What kills the game for me is how you walk so slow. You can sprint a very very short distance but anytime you hit an incline or a decline whether its stairs, a wheelchair ramp, or a small pile of garbage in a hallway you start walking very slowly. I understand why they added this but in no way does it add to the game. Its a reason to not play this game alone. Its not fun to be forced to walk slowly whenever your just looking for the item or objective or at any other time. Enemies can run through these places just fine so good luck trying to get away from an enemy.The actual melee combat is alright, nothing new but still better than the Elder Scrolls game. Enemies will reach to getting hit somewhat realistically and will be staggered along with if you block they will also become staggered. The problem is no matter what weapon you use essentially the fighting is the same. Either a weapon is worthless or its one of the few great ones.  You do find some guns scattered around but your to stupid to know how to reload so ammo is bound to each guns magazine.  Some situations and enemies can be neat but for the most part the actual fighting isn't really that great especially when you have to fight an enemy with a gun. For this you really need to just taze them then take the gun. Thank goodness the tazer recovers charge over time.Since you are a cop you investigate certain crime scenes. These are just fluffer basically as you can't do them wrong. You whip out your light, find the evidence, take a picture, and move on. Really just a gate to break up the gameplay. You cannot mess these up. You are required to do one action at a time with one choice. Graphically the game is pretty good, not as good as FEAR imo but good enough especially for the time.Story is weird and confusing. Its very hard to follow and just really a background. Who really cares about it.Having played the original years back on PS3 I kept thinking to myself of diffrent areas and scenes that were obviously taken from the first game. I wouldn't say its a 1 to 1 port as they added so much and content was definetly new in 2 but they sure took alot of ideas from 1 to the point that your not missing anything by skipping to 2 unless you care about a story thats not very strong to begin with. Just read the wiki page and you should be setup for 2 if you care. I don't really feel like I gained anything out of playing this one though aside from being frustrated with it.Its alright and if you havn't played the 2nd and don't have a console it might be worth a playthrough, just don't expect much and you won't be dissappointed.

												Hmmm Im a little conflicted on this one....So if you played FEAR, this game is from the same makers and it shows.I quite like it overall, I like the characters, the voice acting, the story and especially the presentation.But my problems lie with the gameplay and unfortunatly ultimately...the story.The game is all about first person melee combat with weapons such as pipes, 2x4's, Fire Axes etc etc.Guns do show up but this is not an FPS, so ammo will not be found in the gameworld and guns only have a limited amount of ammunition so you dont use them much/often (but that makes it all the more fun when you actually get to).The melee combat is not a problem (for the most), my problem lies in the repetition of it.You basically just fight skin jobs of the same enemies, very very little variation throughout the game all the way to the end.Another part of the gameplay...is a bit of an ermm misdirection.Right at the start you come to a murder scene, you get to play CSI and find the cause of death and other clues and evidence on who did it.This is obviously really cool....but also pretty much entirely non-existent in the rest of the game.I dont know what the reason for this was but for the rest of the game its at best only: ""follow a blood trail here"", ""photograph a footprint there"".Actually investingating murderscenes is, after that first part, no longer a part of the game.This is a HUGE let down imo.Secondly, without spoiling I can say the game has a super open ending.There are a lot of unknowns building up during the game and in the end it barely explains ANY of it.(now I have the sequel which is console exclusive and ill see if the story goes on there....)Nothing more annoying then having mystery build up without a pay off at the end....So yeah, to recommend it or not hmmmm hard one honestly.In the end I found the game just alright, its not bad really, its just rather meh made more interesting because of the story that in the end goes nowhere sooooooooo yeah I guess I dont recommend it.

												I saw this on a top ten scariest games list so I decided to give it a go. Condemned: CO does have atmosphere that is immersive and mildly creepy (complemented by a gloomy soundtrack). This is the strongest aspect of the game and it is this, along with the semi-engaging story (with the hope for a satisfying ending or something that could conjure an interesting idea), that compelled to me play through to the end. After it was all over, I was ultimately dissapointed with this as a survival horror title. For one, there were no puzzles (which are a staple of the genre). Instead, you have fetch quests (i.e. find sledgehammer to break lock on door or find valve someplace to turn off steam). The fetch quests are not even difficult because the levels are fairly linear and you are not given the option to interact with many objects outside anything that can be used as a melee weapon. The enemies (maybe with the exception of the mannequins in the department store), were not disturbing at all. And this is a major complaint for a survival horror game because it, unfortantely, bogged down the dread/scare factor quite a bit. Most of the time, you'll encounter hobos running at or away from you with x melee weapon. To the game's credit, there are well executed jump-scares at times, but for the most part you see it coming (even when they are hiding behind a wall with one arm clearly hanging out). Combat system is clunky, as it should be in this type of game, but becomes repetitious after awhile. Thus, it doesn't feel clunky anymore and engagments with enemies felt more like busywork instead of terrifying encounters. The melee weapons do vary in damage and speed but the technique (block, hit, hit, repeat) remained the same. Occasionally you can find a firearm to spice things up a bit but primarily you will be using a melee weapon. When the story wrapped up, I was underwhelmed which was a shame because the set up was decent and had potential. This would've been forgivable if there were in-depth character examinations. Yes, you do learn about the characters but it's nothing extensive that makes you either connect with them or intrigues the mind. Thus, I had no desire to replay the game for the story/characters at all. If you're a fan of atmospheric games and on the fence, then I would recommend getting it on discount because, for all its faults, it does have redeeming qualties that made me (somewhat) glad I played it. It's possible that you might find the experience more terrifying than I did because, after all, horror is subjective. However, if you are looking for a game on par with something like Amnesia in terms of horror, then I'd pass this one up. 5.0/10			"

												At first I tried to play this on my Xbox 360, I used to have a copy of this game for that system, but you know, playing a FPS on a console? Not gonna happen. So when I saw the game being on sale during the Summer Sale, I just had to get it.For the game, it's nothing special. It's trying to be some kind of horror game, with a serial killer chasing you (I think, the story is not very clear) and you get to walk around dark subway stations and a dark house. The only thing it had going for it considering horror was when you stepped on glass or something other that would make sounds when stepped upon. Graphically it's nothing to write home about, it has been out for 10 years so it's not that surprising.Good thing it's short at least, so it doesn't drag on forever. I can only recommend it when on sale, so I'm gonna set it as ""Not recommended"". I wished it had a better story at least - are you the serial killer? Are you being chased by a serial killer? Is it just demons in your head? WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!			"

												After playing this game to completion, I can safely say that the only redeeming quality about this game is the melee combat system. It feels heavy, natural, and satisfying. However, it has its own problems like blocking lag due to a bad PC port.Everything else about Condemned is terrible. The VO is sub-mar, the story isn't compelling at all, and the ending is so cliche and throwaway. Moreover, the port to PC is plagued with FPS problems and crashing issues. I personally had several crashes during the final boss battle, which made me really frustrated with the game and left a sour taste in my mouth once I beat the game.Overall, the cons outweigh the pros for Condemned and I cannot recommend this game.

												Boring boring game.  I just didn't like the map design or combat, story was rather meh but then I can't fully comment on that with only 3 hours into the game.  Like Fear I don't like Monolith's level design, repetitive and dull, you got the boring sewer levels, boring metro station levels, generic hallways and rooms. In games like this I normally run through it but the main character moves so slow that it actually frustrates me, it just exaggerates the slow gameplay.  The solid gunplay in Fear kept me going but not this melee combat, I hated Dead Island's combat and disliked Fear's level design adds up to me not enjoying this experience, decent atmosphere is all I can say.  If you loved Fear's level design and Dead Island style melee combat you should like this game, if not then I wouldn't touch it.			"

												Condemned is a hobo murder simulator. It looks like ♥♥♥♥ and plays like ♥♥♥♥. You can't jump, you can't carry more than one weapon, and you can't reload any weapons you find even if you find another of the same type. I get that they are trying to be survial horror or something, but that is not something a real person would do. The final straw for me was when some enemies jumped a subway turnstyle and after I killed them, I could not do the same. In fact, there was no way to proceed at all because the contextual ""press E to do whatever"" thing wasn't showing up anywhere in the stage that I had access to. It's just not fun enough to hold my interest. I played and finished Condemned 2 which I thought was alright. This game is just ♥♥♥♥ though. I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Condemned: C.O. is promotioned as a scary atmospheric detective violent game for grown people. On fact, this all turns out to be a load of pure stinky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game is one of the most pathetic actions i've played in my life. It's boring as ♥♥♥♥, the combat system is a a bad joke, clumsy as hell. The game mechanics is unlogical and simply stupid. You can break through a wooden door with a fireaxe but you can't do it with a sledgehammer. You can't open a safe with a fireaxe, cause you are only supposed to do it with a sledgehammer. You can only carry 1 weapon at a time, no matter what it is, a pistol or a crowbar. But you can carry a whole ♥♥♥♥ing FBi crime laboratory in your pockets. Fights themselves become repetetive and unenjoyable very quickly. This game is simply boring and only is capable to scare a 10 yrs old girl. Btw this scary game for adults has no blood in it. no matter with what you hit an opponent, a wooden club or axe, you can never cut their limbs off or crush a head. Don't buy this game, it's ♥♥♥♥ty, boring and totally not fun. if you're looking for a violent, scary. bloody, fun game to play, consider buying good old classic like Manhunt or Suffering or Aliens instead of this ♥♥♥♥ing parody on a survival horror.

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a psychological first-person horror game that has managed to stand the test of time as well as any other title from its era. This is thanks in large part to the game's visceral combat system which focuses on melee weapons, as well as an intense atmosphere that will keep you constantly wondering what's just around the corner. This creepy atmopshere is further developed by quality level design and some good use of lighting and sound effects. Enemy AI is mostly intelligent; your psychotic opposition will sneak around quietly, strafe and block effectively, and won't just whale away on you when they see you. However, while the game holds up just fine from a gameplay and mechanics standpoint, there are some muddy textures and awkward character models that are less than appealing when compared to more modern games.If you're looking for a game that can provide some solid thrills and an immensely satisfying combat system, Condemned: Criminal Origins is as good as it gets. An underappreciated title that plays just as well today as it did 7-8 years ago.			"

												This was a surprisingly fun survival/horror game.  It introduces an interesting mechanic to balance guns by making you unable to hold ammo for them - the only ammo you can use for a gun is the ammo in the gun when you find it [often only 4 or less bullets].  Additionally there were quite a few serial killer MOs that were pretty interesting and it was always fun trying to track them down.  I will say that there was a pretty huge difficulty spike at the end that forced me to reduce the difficulty in order to finish the end, however.			"

												A modern(?) classic. A horror game from 2005 that still to this day does horror better than a vast majority of games that have been released under the genre title of ""survial horror"". You are not some super human who can fit an arsenal of weapons in your back pocket with a generous amount of ammo, no you have to scrap your way through confrontations and when you do get a weapon you have to cherish it and use it wisely as you rarley come across guns and when you do there is little ammo.Just like F.E.A.R the first game is the game to play as the follow up(s) pale in comparison. You dont get horror games like this often and with ths game being nearly 10 years old its sad to see how far horror games have fallen since this game and for how long the horror genre has been at a low.

												Survival horror FPS done right. Minimal jumpscares, choking atmosphere, and a genuinely creepy setting to keep you going. Controls pretty solidly for what it is, and though it might not win any awards, it doesn't stumble as badly as a lot of other melee-focused first person games do. My only real gripe is that the textures are really, really bad, but seeing as it was a 360 launch title, it's forgivable despite how jarring it looks when a hobo grabs you and gives you a look at his blurry, polygonal face.

												This game has an interesting, to say the least, story. The physics system and the fighting mechanics are mediocre but it's enjoyable. Also there are some bugs that will get you stuck on the wall or on a furniture but that has only happened to me twice. Voice acting is relatively good and the sound system is not perfect because sometimes it might glitch or the background sound might disappear. In conclusion, I recommend this game to those who like mystery and/or horror (not jumpscare horror) games.			"

												I like this game because it reminds of those B horror movies so bad they're good.  So, Ethan Thomas is and FBI agent in pursuit of a murder suspect.  He tells his boss on the phone that he's not crazy and not a killer, then he goes to abandoned buildings to slay several dozen civilians with a sledgehammer and a fire axe to ""gather evidence"" (he also rides the subway across town while covered in blood from all those people with no difficulties).  His FBI forensics contact thinks this is fine and continues to assist him.  He periodically receives phone calls from some random old man who trolls him with meaningless hints and then hangs up.  He staunchly refuses to actually work with fellow law enforcement because random old man assures him that going psycho vigilante is ""the only way"".  I could see this being an instant cult classic movie.			"

												Straight up, this is one of the scariest games you'll ever play. I don't mean to descend into hyperbole, but really scary games seem to touch me emotionally in a way that no other genre does. I played it through once when I owned it on disc and could never go back. Now I'm here again, nearly a decade later, and I'm pooping my pants all over again.If the movie Seven were a video game, this would be it. At the time, Monolith were killing it with this and F.E.A.R released in the same year, and both games do horror right, instilling a creeping sense of dread with such great level design that you never know where the bad guys are gonna come from, or when. Although whereas F.E.A.R is more an action game, every second of Condemned drips with oppressive tension and fear. The fantastic mix of sound design, restrictions to your combat abilities, and intelligent enemy AI, as well as the fact that the game is fantastic at diverting your attention and then having an enemy sneak up on you, make this an incredibly stressful and disturbing experience. THIS. GAME. WILL. CHANGE. YOU. Playing it in the dark with a pair of good headphones will be the best and worst decision of your life. Buy it now.			"

												Aged a bit but the suspense will get to you everytime. Whether that be muffled footsteps upstairs or crushing of rubble and glass behind that corner. Every sound will make you tighten your grip on the 2x4 nail or electric conduit. You can use most of the environment as an weapon. Except Bloodshot really varies what you can use better. The brawling action is addicting except for the momentary block making it difficult if you block at the wrong time. The enemies don't have attack patterns and will deceive you whenever they can. Dodging, attacking twice, hiding behind corners when you aren't looking, whatever they can do to beat you. That makes you hesitate sometimes which I love. Again Bloodshot has more random patterns whether that is a pro or a con. And finally the story is immersive but inconclusive. I like how Rosa isn't reading a book to you. Every clue leads to another piece of the story. Feels like you are doing an actual investigation. This made me spawn a bunch of theories about what happened, where they went, etc. Short summary: Immersive but inconclusive story, addicting brawling combat with varying makeshift weapons, and heart-pounding suspense. 8.7/10			"

												I've been a fan of Condemned: Criminal Origins ever since I first got an Xbox 360, and replaying it on the PC was just as enjoyable an experience. The focus on melee and improvisational weaponry despite the game's first-person view was handled rather well, and a refreshing change from the usual shoot 'til you get more guns and become bullet Jesus fiesta.The game's backstory is also rather interesting, and does a decent job of segueing from wrongful accusation to weird mystical whatsitsfutzery without the latter feeling too much like a cop-out. Supernatural shenanigans are ramped up at a slow but steady pace, and for the most part don't trump your reliance on humany ingenuity and/or stubbornness. However, a lot of what's going on seems left unexplained unless you really go digging, so the telling of said backstory is sub-par.Your character's investagatory abilities also come into play, but my feelings on the bits where you have to use them are middling. At some points, they feel situationally appropriate, and feel rewarding once you figure out what to do and where to do it. At others, investigation seems like tedious filler that could be avoided by something more action or brute-force based. Thankfully, these bits eventually come to a complete stop, leaving you to all the beatings you desire.One thing that I particularly enjoyed in Condemned were the environments. Despite everything being fairly dark and, in most cases, run down, almost every area has a distinct feel and different reasons to feel unsettled while you traverse them. My personal favorite is the school you eventually get to, especially the bit with the swimming pool. You'll know why when you get there.Despite the game showing its age in many respects, I recommend adding Condemned: Criminal Origins to your horror library. Now if only they'd release the sequel to PC as well.			"

												I beat this game years ago on the 360. I enjoyed it then, and I'm enjoying it  just as much years later. The atmosphere in this game is some of the best i've seen in any survival horror game. The game holds up extremely well, despite being 8 or 9 years old now. Would HIGHLY recommend to any survival horror fan.			"

												The FEAR game everyone forgot about.Rating: 8 out of 10, quite possibly the best implimentation of FPS melee combat in a game, shroaded by an amazingly atmospheric story. However, the effect is somewhat dulled by the game's extremely short length and clunky mission design.			"

												Story: The game sets on several areas filled with questionable numbers of psychopaths that I forgot about but they see to be near each other. It's about a talented agent and investigator named Ethan Thomas chased by his former Bureau officers for the crime he didn't commit. As he tries to survive his way through a bunch of psychopaths to find the real criminal and clean his name he encounters several supernatural things. The Ending is cheeky though didn't like it.Gameplay: In this game gun ammunition is scares make your every shot count, you can't even reload. You can use different kind of weapons such as plank, pipes, fire axe, paper cutter and guns (guns are not easily found). It feels like first person Dark Souls combat wise, block and attack. The enemies AI are hard to kill because they are as strong as you especially if they are in numbers although you can't use their numbers as advantages because they hate you as much as they hate each other. They will attack their allies if they got accidently hit by their alliesThis is one of those games that makes me dizzy for a while I don’t know why.Graphics: It did not appeal to me. It looks dated. Design: don't like the character designs they look fat on those clothes. Except the guys who haunt Ethan those guys are ok.Sound and Music: The music theme didn't match the atmosphere of the game.

												Let's get a few things straight.1. This is supposed to be scary.  And, yeah, it works ok.2. This is apparently supposed to be about police.  No.  It's frankly insulting to police officers.Pros: The melee combat is actually pretty awesome.  It drive you nuts at first but once you get the hange of it, it is brutal.  Unlike any other FPS that is supposed to be horror, this works really well, because your ability to fight back is... well not great.  This game is the same folks that made FEAR and you can feel some similarty, but where FEAR was rarely scary because you were the ultimate badass, in this game you will run away screaming.  I think a lot of games should copy the melee in this game.  It's clever, simple, and it works.  Just saying.  Additionally, the game is really quite creepy.  Not the storyline which is terrible, but the levels.  Very. Creepy.Cons:This game involves a guy who is supposed to be a great serial killer investigator.  But you will NEVER know why because he will spend the game being the most gullible idiot that ever tried to solve a crime.  Moreover, he will be treated like a child by everyone he works with.  They literally read things for him, because, I assume based on how he behaves, he can't read.  The evidence finding sequences are painful.  The only good thing about them is at times you are so creeped out you find yourself freaking out slightly as you do them  But they are nonsense.  Your character is a complete idiot.  Frankly, calling him an idiot is an insult to idiots.  He's an airhead.  He has no ability to think.  It's quite annoying that you can't.. move.  This is FEAR without... well any ability at all to do anything.  You can't jump or duck, except where the game invites you to.  Which is.. really weird.  Overall: A fun game.  but... could have been a lot better.			"

												I can't believe I didn't hear about this game until 9 years after release. The graphics are obviously a bit aged, but imo they hold up very well, unlike most titles of it's day. The combat takes some getting used to, but once you learn timing your moves it becomes a lot of fun. Especially since these enemies -will- irritate you enough that you'll want to beat them to death with a gas pipe.The storyline is quite interesting. It's like a mash-up of Silent Hill, Bioshock, and Outlast. It's got enough depth and quick shot moments that you'll want to pay attention.  My one complaint? The obvious one: No Condemned 2 for PC. Bad move considering you'll want to play the sequel immediately after this. "

												This game is just great. Me and a friend just One-Shotted this game last night and it was a blast. The combat is fun, the scares are spooky, and the ragdolls are just magnificent. We were fighting the last boss and an enemy I killed earlier was just spinning in the back, we laughed so hard the boss killed us. You will find a lot of ragdolls doin dumb things in the backround, i dont know if the testers just ignored it or loved it as much as I did. 7/10 on the fighting, blocking is slow and sometimes you get hit anyway! Enemy also has an invisible extension on their weapons and hit you from a foot away.8/10 story, didnt know what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on, nothing explained unless you get the collectables, and spooky scary dood is just there i guess?10/10 ragdolls  You ever slam a mans face so hard he flies 6 feet in the air? Then just spins in circles until your character ♥♥♥♥♥ himself laughing? I did.AI 200/10  Watched enemies unintentionally kill each other is glorious. The last boss guy got gang ♥♥♥♥♥ by two other enemies who were trying to hit me from super far away, all 3 ended up killing each other as I watched.Final Verdict: Spinning McSpin aramma approves! "

Afterwards, you stop off at your kid's school for a PTA meeting, followed by a brief jaunt out to the countryside to eat some apples at a farm.

												Good game for survival horror fans! Somewhat similar to the most recent Outlast games. Immersive atmosphere. Be prepared for a lot of melee fights with whatever you can find-gas pipes,desks,paper cutters,axes, sladgehammers and many other melee weapons. Fire arms is a rarity in this game so it's great for close combat lovers!On the minus side is the main character movement as it is slowed down way too much. pro-tip: you must use fire axe to beat the last boss!

												eeehhhh.... I actually have played more than 3 minutes that Steam has recorded because I was using the right-click context method(which sometimes Steam doesn't register - so I'm guessing this game is only using Steam as a distribution platform rather than as DRM?) to have it run on my DGPU as this game doesn't seem to be fully supported under Optimus.Now, game's a bit dated, but despite that, my Intel HD4600 was unable to play this game maxed out with all eye candy on @ 1080p60....average fps was 20 and jumps from a measly 10 to 40 at times, which is why I obviously opted to run it on my 980M.Ok, so you start the game off as some FBI agent solving a case and then suddenly someone else comes in and kills your campanians with your gun and the higher ups put the blame onto you as there was no other witnesses. So off you go - avoiding the cops to clear your name, stalking and trailing behind the person who killed the two guys that was there with you. So you find out this guy is like a serial serial killer; he kills the serial killers who kills the victims but with a twist - he makes them use their own methods of killing to kill themselves with.... so off you guy, following his trail, but always a couple or so steps behind as they're already dead when you rock up. So eventually your manage to catch up to this guy and beat some sense into him, but not before an old guy comes out and knock yo ♥♥♥ down. You wake up in some farm, get lectured by the person(not the old guy), then the old guy saves your ♥♥♥ but unfortunely took of your finger but at least you're alive. So now you go into the barn and find this mysterious dude who seems to be causing the problems. You beat his ♥♥♥ and his minions and win! Well not really, at the end your character apparently turns into the *mysterious* dude who cause the problem...? idk, it's confusing...I might have to watch for an explanation or go watch #2 to see if it continues the story.....Gameplay: You can beat down or shoot down enemies. There's also a block button so your block your opponent's melee attack and then come back with yours to knock their ♥♥♥ down!  You can also pull out your taser and tase their ♥♥♥! Hahaha. I didn't really like how he passes out after 20 or so meters of running. He must be some fat guy who can barey make 20 meters before losing juice.... But the thing is he didn't look all that fat to me...so should be able to do a 100 meter sprint no problem, here he passes out after 20!  Also no dual wielding, really? I get that you're probably using the left hand to hold the torch but about the times when you don't have the torch on? There's a couple of weapons which require two hands but you're still able to use the torch??! Must be shoulder torch(or clipped onto something) then or else it's impossible and if it is a shoulder torch, you should be able to dual wield! The only reason this came up because I saw one of the enemies who was dual wielding the pipes thingy and I thought aw why can't I do that too??!Also why is there no ability to pick up ammo for a weapon and add it to yours? I'm sure he's smart enough to pick up the last two shells from another shotty to fill up yours which only has 3 to start off with so it makes 5...or a way to pick up both melee and guns and swap between them depending on situations.....There are a couple or so jumpscares but they didn't really faze me that much because I was always mad when I keep missing swings or this fat character is too slow to catch to an enmey who's running away...hahahahaSound: Creepy and eerie atmosphere. The game surpports EAX 2 and 3, my lappt can't emulate EAX so I had to play without it...I could have played this on my tower as it can do EAX(all the way up to and including 5) but couldn't be ♥♥♥ really...hehehe, already had it installed on my lappy and too lazy to move files and install it on my tower...Graphics: I suppose not too bad looking when maxed out for a several year old game at the time of course. Runs silky smooth at 60 fps with V-sync on on my 980M, but when on HD 4600, plays like crap...hahaha, unless you're used to console fps which is usually 30 fps, then I you should be able to handle 10 fps. Of course this is with the game maxed out, when I first started the game, it giving me decent fps, like 100-ish but obviously wanted eye candy... heh, so turned everything up...Conclusion: Umm....Well, there wasn't any bugs or glitches I experienced, except that area where I got lost and didn't know how to get back out to the train tracks part and somehow got stuck in the barrels....and had to reload a save game to get out as I can't cheat my way out as I don't there exist cheats in this game.... I want to vote neutral but why is there no neutral vote?? Well, I suppose I did enjoy the game a bit so why not recommend it? Oh yeah, steam overlay doesn't seem to be working for me so yeah that's that going. COuld just be me because I was scouring the discussion forum and found some people having similar problems and some don't actually have this problem at all....weird...I still didn't really get the supernatural stuff though....perhaps my mind isn't meant to be paying games like this...If you like jumpscares and scary/horror(with a bit mind bending weirdness) like theme game, this is for you, if not take a pass.================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display; resolution 1920x1080.

												The game is. Good.  a straight 3/5 that neither wowed me nor gave me less than expected.  Since it paved the way for the xbox 360, one needs to keep in mind it's release date.  The game did startle me time to time and I did feel a sense of dread through its entirety, but when you get down to it, its a simple melee beatemup with some extra elements thrown in.  Sure theirs guns and ""detective work"" (shine light at stains) but the game feels rather bare for what really could of been done with it.  The overall plot was ok, although I found myself dragged out of the immersion by the sheer obsurdity of the storyline (example: wanted for potential cop based murder, watch as other cops die to thugs and nobody cares) voice acting passable and decent playtime.  Theirs achievements but I found myself unmotivated in satisfying their little collections.So in conclusion:  It is worth a spin, but I wouldn't spend more than 10 dollars on the experience.			"

												Just a short review, The game was ok.You play as an FBI agent thats following a killer, just as the job is going as routine something happens out of the ordinary at the crime scene (big surprise!!!!)The game has you using diffrent investigation tools to solve and follow your....I'll just keep quiet.The enviroment was very supenseful but didn't phase me as much since I've seen too many horror movies of cheap jumps. Some parts did remind me of F.E.A.R or gave that similar vibe but saying that I belive it was the same team that made it.also the game emphasises melee combat in which I liked alot. being able to use the surrounding objects as weapons: pipes off the wall, crowbars, shovels, paper-cutters, signs etc.When you had the option to use a gun it had very little ammo (or what was left from the previous user) you'd quickly go back to a blunt weapon.There was quiet a few collectables around the levels but didn't really really intrest me to go and get them.The game felt like extended movie it was short but sweet, I wanted to know more about protag along with other things I won't explain.I liked the game but I doubt i'd be replaying it again anytime soon. I hope the sequal gets a port on pc since at the time of writing this there is none. "

												...Great game...1st game I ever played on the 360 in 2006. Just as good today. But here are the few frustrating game quirks you will have to deal with... The block mechanic, no matter how hard to try to master & analyse it...it will so often be your undoing, it will be your demise so often..it is a severe problem, I learned to play without it in the end...attack then back-peddle worked much better. Sprint/run can also not be trusted...it feels like and acts like there is glue on the souls of your shoes...very odd. Next, once in a while when the AI & I were using the same weapon type, my melee reach was about a 1/2 or a 1/3 of their impact range. I really noticed this is the 'Orchard' level where we all used flaming torches as melee weapons. I had to get within about 4ft for a hit to register but they could hit me between 10-12ft away...that seemed very cheap & a real cheat by the game mechanics. Finally, you will always slow down to a crawl on stairs & you will often stick on the most minor of steps...odd as steps/stairs will not slow the AI...    Other than those oddities it's well worth a play thru...a short game which took me 5hrs in total to complete....so in the end recommended :-)			"

												Aged a bit but the suspense will get to you everytime. Whether that be muffled footsteps upstairs or crushing of rubble and glass behind that corner. Every sound will make you tighten your grip on the 2x4 nail or electric conduit. You can use most of the environment as an weapon. Except Bloodshot really varies what you can use better. The brawling action is addicting except for the momentary block making it difficult if you block at the wrong time. The enemies don't have attack patterns and will deceive you whenever they can. Dodging, attacking twice, hiding behind corners when you aren't looking, whatever they can do to beat you. That makes you hesitate sometimes which I love. Again Bloodshot has more random patterns whether that is a pro or a con. And finally the story is immersive but inconclusive. I like how Rosa isn't reading a book to you. Every clue leads to another piece of the story. Feels like you are doing an actual investigation. This made me spawn a bunch of theories about what happened, where they went, etc. Short summary: Immersive but inconclusive story, addicting brawling combat with varying makeshift weapons, and heart-pounding suspense. 8.7/10			"

												Beautifully, brilliantly grotesque. Seven years later this perfectly pulpy first-person brawler looks better than ever as the viewer descends deep into the abstract, hellish heart of human violence. In almost every respect from design to art to coding it is a well realized experience of tension, like Doom in an episode of The X-Files, in which demons called The Hate enter stealthily into a metropolis causing a plague of psychopathic madness as heralded by dead birds. The lines between reality and fantasy are so often blurred the viewer so often cannot tell if they are in the real world, hell, or if they too are touched by insanity. The combat is brutal, pipes or 2X4s torn from the wall batter opponents to mush, and exploration and investigation (though far too linear) break that up to move the narrative along. It's a grim experience to be sure but with an undeniable message: ""He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster.""			"

Sometimes the combat gets a bit repetetive and the story is not so intriguing, but the claustrophobic levels, the sounds effects and the melee fighting are a very good combination for an original take on the survival horror genre. Worth a try, but expect some very old mechanics.  "

												The combat is very boring and repetetive, the level design is boring and it has gamebreaking framrate issues. The only thing that makes this game remotely interesting is the investigation bits but they are few, very few! Not worth money imo!			"

												I played the second one and liked it, but am just now giving the original a go. I gotta say... I'm enjoying this. Yep. I'm having a good old time beating these poor, crazed vagrants to death with various detritus through a city so bleak it makes Max Payne's  snow-strangled nightmare look like one of the jollier levels of the Mushroom Kingdom... This takes me back to when violent video games still had that unpolished grit like digital equivalents to low-budget horror movies on VHS.			"

												eeehhhh.... I actually have played more than 3 minutes that Steam has recorded because I was using the right-click context method(which sometimes Steam doesn't register - so I'm guessing this game is only using Steam as a distribution platform rather than as DRM?) to have it run on my DGPU as this game doesn't seem to be fully supported under Optimus.Now, game's a bit dated, but despite that, my Intel HD4600 was unable to play this game maxed out with all eye candy on @ 1080p60....average fps was 20 and jumps from a measly 10 to 40 at times, which is why I obviously opted to run it on my 980M.Ok, so you start the game off as some FBI agent solving a case and then suddenly someone else comes in and kills your campanians with your gun and the higher ups put the blame onto you as there was no other witnesses. So off you go - avoiding the cops to clear your name, stalking and trailing behind the person who killed the two guys that was there with you. So you find out this guy is like a serial serial killer; he kills the serial killers who kills the victims but with a twist - he makes them use their own methods of killing to kill themselves with.... so off you guy, following his trail, but always a couple or so steps behind as they're already dead when you rock up. So eventually your manage to catch up to this guy and beat some sense into him, but not before an old guy comes out and knock yo ♥♥♥ down. You wake up in some farm, get lectured by the person(not the old guy), then the old guy saves your ♥♥♥ but unfortunely took of your finger but at least you're alive. So now you go into the barn and find this mysterious dude who seems to be causing the problems. You beat his ♥♥♥ and his minions and win! Well not really, at the end your character apparently turns into the *mysterious* dude who cause the problem...? idk, it's confusing...I might have to watch for an explanation or go watch #2 to see if it continues the story.....Gameplay: You can beat down or shoot down enemies. There's also a block button so your block your opponent's melee attack and then come back with yours to knock their ♥♥♥ down!  You can also pull out your taser and tase their ♥♥♥! Hahaha. I didn't really like how he passes out after 20 or so meters of running. He must be some fat guy who can barey make 20 meters before losing juice.... But the thing is he didn't look all that fat to me...so should be able to do a 100 meter sprint no problem, here he passes out after 20!  Also no dual wielding, really? I get that you're probably using the left hand to hold the torch but about the times when you don't have the torch on? There's a couple of weapons which require two hands but you're still able to use the torch??! Must be shoulder torch(or clipped onto something) then or else it's impossible and if it is a shoulder torch, you should be able to dual wield! The only reason this came up because I saw one of the enemies who was dual wielding the pipes thingy and I thought aw why can't I do that too??!Also why is there no ability to pick up ammo for a weapon and add it to yours? I'm sure he's smart enough to pick up the last two shells from another shotty to fill up yours which only has 3 to start off with so it makes 5...or a way to pick up both melee and guns and swap between them depending on situations.....There are a couple or so jumpscares but they didn't really faze me that much because I was always mad when I keep missing swings or this fat character is too slow to catch to an enmey who's running away...hahahahaSound: Creepy and eerie atmosphere. The game surpports EAX 2 and 3, my lappt can't emulate EAX so I had to play without it...I could have played this on my tower as it can do EAX(all the way up to and including 5) but couldn't be ♥♥♥ really...hehehe, already had it installed on my lappy and too lazy to move files and install it on my tower...Graphics: I suppose not too bad looking when maxed out for a several year old game at the time of course. Runs silky smooth at 60 fps with V-sync on on my 980M, but when on HD 4600, plays like crap...hahaha, unless you're used to console fps which is usually 30 fps, then I you should be able to handle 10 fps. Of course this is with the game maxed out, when I first started the game, it giving me decent fps, like 100-ish but obviously wanted eye candy... heh, so turned everything up...Conclusion: Umm....Well, there wasn't any bugs or glitches I experienced, except that area where I got lost and didn't know how to get back out to the train tracks part and somehow got stuck in the barrels....and had to reload a save game to get out as I can't cheat my way out as I don't there exist cheats in this game.... I want to vote neutral but why is there no neutral vote?? Well, I suppose I did enjoy the game a bit so why not recommend it? Oh yeah, steam overlay doesn't seem to be working for me so yeah that's that going. COuld just be me because I was scouring the discussion forum and found some people having similar problems and some don't actually have this problem at all....weird...I still didn't really get the supernatural stuff though....perhaps my mind isn't meant to be paying games like this...If you like jumpscares and scary/horror(with a bit mind bending weirdness) like theme game, this is for you, if not take a pass.================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display; resolution 1920x1080.

												This is a blast fromt he Xbox past! It's a great game, written by Monolith, if you can not tell. This was written along side F.E.A.R. Imagine fear with a melee basd combat system. The backdrops look like F.E.A.R. When you start the second level you would think you were playing Blood 2. Great atmosphere as Russ Abbot would have siad. But ""oh Mr Harry"" why do you walk so slowly over the rough ground? Tip toe throught tulips....If this carries on in the same Monolith mash up manner..... I can not wait for the crazy mech bit from Shogo Mobile Armoured Division!! Dig that crazy music!!!!

												Monolith Productions had a busy year in 2005. F.E.A.R. was a terrifyingly brilliant first-person shooter released exclusively on PC. Condemned: Criminal Origins was also released as a launch exclusive to Microsoft’s new Xbox 360. Despite the close time frames, the games differed on gameplay mechanics but both delivered on horror. F.E.A.R. played on the psychological battle in Point Man’s mind but Condemned built on the dread of the scenario. In F.E.A.R., the player felt very powerful with plentiful ammo, slow-mo abilities and resilient armour. But in Condemned, the player has to rely on whatever can be found lying around in grimy, dilapidated buildings. The feeling of vulnerability makes Condemned more of a survival horror than a straight-up horror.StoryEthan Thomas is a fairly green detective with a chequered past revolving his deceased father. Investigating a series of murders involving mannequins, Ethan is brought to an abandoned building where there is a new crime scene. Shortly after, Ethan becomes a fugitive but is still committed to investigating the case in order to clear his name. Moving from derelict buildings to deep underground tunnels, the feeling of unease is exacerbated. The enemies are mostly psychotic bums who seem to be under the influence of something (or someone). They attack Ethan with animosity maybe because of his uniform but then they attack each other as well.The story is quite light on exposition and takes some time for things to come together. But it does not impede the sense of dread in the situation.GameplayAfter losing his firearm, Ethan uses any blunt-shaped instrument that he can find. Pipes, 2x4s, sledgehammers, axes all aid Ethan in his defence. Sometimes the occasional gun can be found, usually with only 3-4 rounds of ammunition. The guns can be effective, especially when the shotgun is in close range. But it’s the melee combat that the game focuses on. Swinging sharp or blunt objects is very satisfying. The sense of weight and inertia is felt through the controls and judging the timing of the block offers a unique challenge. Larger tools such as axes and sledgehammers offer a lethargic yet heavier blow that can also break down certain doors. Although it’s odd how a door would sometimes prefer to be smashed open by a specific tool. An example is when a door requires an axe to be breached instead of a crowbar or vice versa. Strafing into a new position as the enemies swing is a better technique than blocking. Moving position causes them to miss allowing for a counter attack when they’re vulnerable. This tactic was used more than the block mechanic as Ethan doesn’t hold the blocking position and the timing can be quite unpredictable.Ethan’s taser can be used to temporarily stun enemies for a more orchestrated strike. His kick ability also helps sustain a more consistent attack during the swinging of a melee weapon. If the enemy is begging on his knees, the player can choose a finishing move such as a neck break or head butt. However, heeding the cries of the half-dead hobos will leave Ethan open to a surprise attack from them.  The other aspect of Condemned is the investigations. As Ethan was on call to a crime scene, he held onto his forensic tools. When prompted, Ethan will bring out a variety of tools specific to the evidence including a camera and a black light. His lab contact back at the station, Rosa, will instruct him on what evidence to search for and receives images from Ethan via text message. These sections are fairly scripted without the need to understand forensics. The atmosphere while investigating crime scenes is thick occasionally erupting with horror. But the slower pace differentiates from the piercing action sequences of the combat. Ethan’s torch helps navigating the darkly lit environments more easily but can alert enemies of his presence, ruining the chance of a surprise attack.Condemned: Criminal Origins is truly terrifying. Monolith knows how to make you jump out of your skin but also how to permeate fear into your psyche. The difference is fear is a layering of brooding tension, whereas a sudden shock would cause the jolt that releases a burst of adrenaline. Either way, Monolith succeeds at both. The sense of loneliness and enclosure is felt in every step, raising the heartbeat of any player. The squalid level design is quite limiting but its linearity allows Monolith to create the tense experience exactly as they want it. They sure know how a gamers’ brain works. Scare tactics are subverted and players are enticed into a seemingly predictable horror cliché before being thrown a curveball shock.TechnicalCondemned was a technical showcase for the Xbox 360. The HD graphics showed off the potential for the console. The sound of steel meeting flesh makes a squelchy thump that will equally disgust as well as satisfy. Often you’ll find yourself standing still in order to listen out for footsteps. Believing them to be your own you continue. But then it happens again. You stop. But the footsteps continue for another two steps. You are not alone. This kind of sound design perfectly compliments the already creepy atmosphere with a gloomy score underpinning the tension.VerdictThe horror…88%			"

												Let Monolith take you through a joyride with creepy atmosphere, scary visual effects that keep you on edge, a great story, and satisfying gameplay. Condemned Criminal Origins is a game where you play as FBI Detective Ethan Thomas who is framed by a serial killer for the deaths of his fellow officers. The only thing he can do is prove his innocence by tracking down the killer. But it's not a simple walk in the park, along the way you will fight violent civilians whose number has been growing in the city recently.The enemies themselves are so scary because they seem like regular people from far away but every time you get close to take a swing you see their messed up demonic faces. It's really cool. The enemies kind of behave how I imagine crack heads would. They usually have a melee weapon with them but they can, if forced to, grab a weapon from the map. Combat is really satisfying as you can swing, block (which causes a stun if done successfully), and kick. It's kind of like Kirby games because you can get different weapons mid-level that you choose depending on your mood (except for the scary crack heads). There are also guns in the game. Both you and the enemy can use it. The guns are more like a Get out of jail free card because it usually kills an enemy with one shot. There's also a taser but it's similar to the gun because it makes things too easy (except for one situation).The investigation scenes are also better than the ones in F.E.A.R. In F.E.A.R you are given more pieces to the puzzle of what is going on by pushing E on a computer and letting your friend talk about what you found. In this game you have to use forensic tools to find the clues rather than hit a simple button. For me it’s more satisfying to use the tools because you actually see the evidence and hear the results of its analysis.Only con of the game is that your character walks SO SLOW. His sprint is as fast as a normal walking speed but it only lasts 5 seconds. This is bad for two reasons. One there are collectable birds and metal pieces that you can find in the level. How do you expect me to explore when I am so slow. I go to a place where I think there will be a bird, there isn't, I try to run back to the path but I run out of sprint, I cry from frustration. The second reason why the running speed is bad is because some enemies (only a few each level) have guns. So you have to run towards them and take them out but you can't do that because you are so slow. The only way around it is to use a gun or the taser.Nonetheless this is a great horror game that gets under your skin rather than relies on jump scares. Definitely get it if you like F.E.A.R. "

												At first sight, this may be just your average hobo killing simulator. However, it's more than that :)It's basically a horror game with melee combat, so not exactly your traditional shooter (though guns can be used in the game). It's the creepy, tense kind of horror, and while there are a few jump scares, fear comes from the tense atmosphere.It's also worth keeping in mind that this game was released about ten years ago, and it shows, especially when it comes to game design. Condemned adheres to old game design philosophies, such as slow walking speed, backstory told via loading screen and documents (which are locked behind collectables), locking areas behind doors that can be broken only after a certain weapon has been found, etc.These are not negative points; they're just part of the deal - old game, old design. But if you have patience, you'll find a wonderful game, with beautiful level design (albeit linear), wonderful melee combat and a tense horror atmosphere.The only negative is that the game doesn't really make any efforts of explaining the story, so you'll have to collect all birds and metals to get some additional documents that explain the story. But it's worth it and I can say I definitely recommend this game. It's an old gem.			"

												This game has an interesting, to say the least, story. The physics system and the fighting mechanics are mediocre but it's enjoyable. Also there are some bugs that will get you stuck on the wall or on a furniture but that has only happened to me twice. Voice acting is relatively good and the sound system is not perfect because sometimes it might glitch or the background sound might disappear. In conclusion, I recommend this game to those who like mystery and/or horror (not jumpscare horror) games.			"

												One of the best homeless murder simulators out there. the voice acting is laughably bad, but the only problem is no port of the sequal. The satisfying gun mechanics  come from how the enemys react and die. 10 0utta 10 would shoot another homeless man in the mouth.			"

												This was a surprisingly fun survival/horror game.  It introduces an interesting mechanic to balance guns by making you unable to hold ammo for them - the only ammo you can use for a gun is the ammo in the gun when you find it [often only 4 or less bullets].  Additionally there were quite a few serial killer MOs that were pretty interesting and it was always fun trying to track them down.  I will say that there was a pretty huge difficulty spike at the end that forced me to reduce the difficulty in order to finish the end, however.			"

												A modern(?) classic. A horror game from 2005 that still to this day does horror better than a vast majority of games that have been released under the genre title of ""survial horror"". You are not some super human who can fit an arsenal of weapons in your back pocket with a generous amount of ammo, no you have to scrap your way through confrontations and when you do get a weapon you have to cherish it and use it wisely as you rarley come across guns and when you do there is little ammo.Just like F.E.A.R the first game is the game to play as the follow up(s) pale in comparison. You dont get horror games like this often and with ths game being nearly 10 years old its sad to see how far horror games have fallen since this game and for how long the horror genre has been at a low.

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a first-person psychological survival horror, developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sega.The gameplay places an emphasis on melee combat and puzzle solving.

												This Game Aged Allright. I remember this being a launch title for the Xbox 360 back in teh day. For a game in 2006 on consoles. I played it way back then and after playing it again, i remember how fun it is smacking destitutes with pipes.. Just like in New york Subways.			"

												While it's very short and somewhat repetitive, this horror classic was a proof of concept that tried it's hardest to be memorable and scary, and considering my now lifelong fear of cities at night, I think this game suceeded with flying colours.Never has beating emaciated drug-addicts to death with a fireaxe been so much fun- but it's always been that scary.

												Straight up, this is one of the scariest games you'll ever play. I don't mean to descend into hyperbole, but really scary games seem to touch me emotionally in a way that no other genre does. I played it through once when I owned it on disc and could never go back. Now I'm here again, nearly a decade later, and I'm pooping my pants all over again.If the movie Seven were a video game, this would be it. At the time, Monolith were killing it with this and F.E.A.R released in the same year, and both games do horror right, instilling a creeping sense of dread with such great level design that you never know where the bad guys are gonna come from, or when. Although whereas F.E.A.R is more an action game, every second of Condemned drips with oppressive tension and fear. The fantastic mix of sound design, restrictions to your combat abilities, and intelligent enemy AI, as well as the fact that the game is fantastic at diverting your attention and then having an enemy sneak up on you, make this an incredibly stressful and disturbing experience. THIS. GAME. WILL. CHANGE. YOU. Playing it in the dark with a pair of good headphones will be the best and worst decision of your life. Buy it now.			"

												At first sight, this may be just your average hobo killing simulator. However, it's more than that :)It's basically a horror game with melee combat, so not exactly your traditional shooter (though guns can be used in the game). It's the creepy, tense kind of horror, and while there are a few jump scares, fear comes from the tense atmosphere.It's also worth keeping in mind that this game was released about ten years ago, and it shows, especially when it comes to game design. Condemned adheres to old game design philosophies, such as slow walking speed, backstory told via loading screen and documents (which are locked behind collectables), locking areas behind doors that can be broken only after a certain weapon has been found, etc.These are not negative points; they're just part of the deal - old game, old design. But if you have patience, you'll find a wonderful game, with beautiful level design (albeit linear), wonderful melee combat and a tense horror atmosphere.The only negative is that the game doesn't really make any efforts of explaining the story, so you'll have to collect all birds and metals to get some additional documents that explain the story. But it's worth it and I can say I definitely recommend this game. It's an old gem.			"

												This game has an interesting, to say the least, story. The physics system and the fighting mechanics are mediocre but it's enjoyable. Also there are some bugs that will get you stuck on the wall or on a furniture but that has only happened to me twice. Voice acting is relatively good and the sound system is not perfect because sometimes it might glitch or the background sound might disappear. In conclusion, I recommend this game to those who like mystery and/or horror (not jumpscare horror) games.			"

												Looking back on this (played it on the 360 when it came out) it is not as good as I remember.There are still jump scares that are good. There seems to be no plot and the story isn't even emphisised. Combat is lackluster and the game attempts to hide the corridors with some small deviations. Worth it for the jump scares and if its cheap.			"

												Considering that this game came out in 2005, back when ""volume lighting"" was new at the time. This is one of those games that tried too hard to shove in all the graphical features in over quality contents. Even Flim Grain was in it, no way to disable that without disabling the whole shader.  Those are some bad times...Onto the story telling development... The game is rated M for mature. Mainly because of the violent and gore, however... it play out as if it was directed for teenagers.  Kinda missing the whole point where your intented player/crowd target are.You start out as an FBI agent character, you're in a building with bunch of drug addicts welding nailed plank and lead pipe trying to kill you. Some how it's ok for this FBI shoot to kill in order to defend yourself.  What did I do?  I shot them in their legs.  ONLY their legs and yet they die on second shot. Because the first shot doesn't even slow them down at all.  This really goes against the principle of working for law enforcement, during an crime investigation. Seriously... what the heck? You just don't get free-passes to killing anyone. Sure, I could kick them down, but that's still missing the point here. Being an FBI isn't an expressway to license-to-kill.As for the storyline, it's very poor. Doesn't take account of important details to form its plots.  Like when you get knocked out by power fusebox.  (yeah I know... how? there are no violate materials in it.)  An main character, a serial killer, took your gun and ran.  While we were still in the game building, he pointed gun at me later on when he cought me off guard.  He was able to fire 2 bullets from that gun at someone else who tried to rescue me.  What's the problem?  I already emtpy the whole clip in that gun before he took it from me. There's no way he would've gotten another clip.As for the gameplay, It's also poor.  It's trying to be an scare-tactic walking-around-in-the-dark-building, even though it's never really dark enough to get freaked out by minor things like rats runing across the room on cue.  There was too often that these hostile NPCs running across the doorways or other end of a hallway you're in as on cue scare event. Which doesn't really feel right for any of those moments.  Because they just go hiding for a moment and then attack you, even though you could see where they were the whole time? It's awkward. Didn't even need to use my flashlight at all.This game is a flop and I'm very much surprised to see that people are still rating this positively good after all these years.  Just what the heck, people?  F.E.A.R. (the game from Sierra) came out in the same year was far better than this game when it come to AI, scare-tactic. and story development.Didn't take very long to disappoint me.			"

												This was a surprisingly fun survival/horror game.  It introduces an interesting mechanic to balance guns by making you unable to hold ammo for them - the only ammo you can use for a gun is the ammo in the gun when you find it [often only 4 or less bullets].  Additionally there were quite a few serial killer MOs that were pretty interesting and it was always fun trying to track them down.  I will say that there was a pretty huge difficulty spike at the end that forced me to reduce the difficulty in order to finish the end, however.			"

												tl:dr: The scariest game from the pre-Amnesia era.From the makers of FEAR comes this FPS, which is one of the scariest games I have had the fortune to play.The story starts out interesting, becomes very intriguing, and is a pretty powerful driving force for the game, though the ending could have been handled better. The gameplay has two main elements. The first is the melee combat, which is rarely - if ever - done this well in FPS games. Using planks, rods, sticks, pipes, axes and sledgehammers, you feel the crunch of every hit, as blunt (or sharp) metal goes through flesh and hits bone, with the enemies reeling back, screaming, regaining their balance, only to come lurching right back at you with a swing of their own weapon. You really feel like they want to kill  you VERY F*CKING BADLY. Their cries of anger and their great animation adds a very real intensity to these encounters, so kudos to that. And a good thing too, because I can count on one hand the number of times I had a gun.The second element is the inclusion of investigation tools you have to use at certain crime scenes. It mostly adds color to the game , because mechanically it's not very challenging. Sometimes the game had difficulty registering that I was pointing the camera at a piece of evidence because I wasn't at the right angle, which was a bit annoying. But at certain points the gameplay embraces these mechanics and turns them into gameplay. The setpiece when I had to follow a line of paint in an abandoned house, which was only visible by the light of a UV torch was one such highlight. As you can't have an investigation tool and a weapon equipped at the same time, as the line crossed the floor, walls and ceilings, the feeling of vulnerability as I went from room to room, unarmed, staring at the ceiling, while hearing the sounds of my attackers following me in the shadows was immense.To sum up, this slightly underrated crime-horror is something I definitely recommend to people who enjoy sh*tting their pants. The interesting story and the intense, atmosheric and scary gameplay add up to a great game, which as far as tension goes, was only bettered by Amnesia. Buy it.8/10 "

												This is a very old game, so I'm not sure how useful this review is. I guess someone might read it, considering it's up for sale on the Steam store.Anyway. Decent game, mainly focused on melee. Graphics are very decent for the time, though you do have to jump through some hoops to make the engine actually work and give decent framerates (usually fixable by disabling HID devices in Control Panel -> System). The gameplay itself is pretty good, guns are pretty widely available so I actually used them most of the time. You are for some reason hamstrung with the limitation that you cannot carry more than 1 weapon at a time, even if it's something that you could conceivably stick in your pocket, like the .45 pistol. I guess your taser is already taking up all of your pockets. The walk speed in this game is hideously slow and the sprint meter goes down WAY too quickly, especially when you have to game the system and run back and forth killing dudes and then running back to caches of more guns (after all, our hero can't carry spare shotgun shells in his coat pocket). Sound design is pretty nice, very atmospheric and oppressive. There were a couple places where the music is too loud and jarring. The jump scares were mostly pretty predictable but thankfully there weren't too many of them.This game surprised me the most with the length. It feels longer than it really is, but I beat it first time through in 6 hours. For a game without much replay value (it's essentially a corridor with cutscenes), that's not very long. And even then, it probably felt longer because the gameplay was beginning to wear on me.I'm on the fence with this one. If it had a little more content, I might be more willing to recommend it. As it stands, though... buy it if it's 75% off or something. I would have trouble justifying paying more than 7-8 dollars for it.			"

												Survival horror FPS done right. Minimal jumpscares, choking atmosphere, and a genuinely creepy setting to keep you going. Controls pretty solidly for what it is, and though it might not win any awards, it doesn't stumble as badly as a lot of other melee-focused first person games do. My only real gripe is that the textures are really, really bad, but seeing as it was a 360 launch title, it's forgivable despite how jarring it looks when a hobo grabs you and gives you a look at his blurry, polygonal face.

 Curator-esque Review Condemned: Criminal Origins is an excellent first person horror game from the creators of F.E.A.R. that features brutal melee combat interspersed with crime scene investigation elements.  For its age and replayability, I recommend picking it up during a sale.   Condemned: Criminal Origins Review  Story Players take on the role of Ethan Thomas, a talented FBI agent specializing in the investigation of serial crimes.  Thanks to his perceptive instincts, Thomas builds a reputation for hunting down several notorious serial killers.  His latest case involves investigating the serial killer known as the ""Matchmaker"".  But soon Thomas discovers he has been framed for the murder of two police officers and must use every tool he has to survive the manhunt and bring the Matchmaker case to a close. Gameplay Condemned's gameplay can be considered survival horror with an emphasis on melee combat.  While guns make an appearance, they are few in variety and ammunition.  Guns cannot be reloaded but they can drop most combatants in one or two shots depending on their lethality.  When you invevitably run out of lead, you'll have to use other means to defend yourself.  Pipes, two-by-fours, paper cutters, even locker doors can picked up from the environment to protect yourself.  Ethan can perform a low kick to create reactionary distance as well but learning when to block an attack and when to strike is important to survival.  Enemies will try to feint you into blocking as well as swing wildly when struck adding depth to combat.  Thomas also has a recharging taser he can use to stun and disarm enemies, but be warned enemies will find another weapon in the environment if you let them. The AI of enemies also allows them to hide and wait until they can jump out and hit you. As an investigative agent Thomas is known for his sharp senses.  When prompted through a visual effect, Thomas can use one of several CSI tools to analyze evidence at a crime scene and transmit it to his lab technician, Rosa, for analysis.  There are hidden collectables to find in each level as well as an endgame decision to incentivize replay if you so choose.   Design Released in 2005, Condemned certainly shows its age in terms of textures and animations at times.  Textures can be muddy and some character models appear puffy or move oddly at times.  The game's pedigree comes through in the areas of lighting and sound.  One of the best examples of Condemned's strong points is the level where Thomas finds himself in a long abandoned department store, a level so creepy that few rival it in all the games I've played.  From the enemies you fight in the level to the ambient noises you can hear, every level has its own feel to it and it's own aesthetic.  The finale to the game is quite a spectacle and will definitely test your combat skills.The only major technical problem that I encountered while playing occurred during the subway level.  For some reason almost all sound cuts out for me during this level except for a select few noises like gunshots.  This lack of sound only occurred during this one level and while it ruins the immersion in this instance, I chose to overlook it since the rest of the game was flawless technically save for a minor progression bug (solved by reloading my save).  In the event you desire to fix the sound on the subway level, there is a fix you can find in the discussion forums for the game. Final Remarks I consider this game to be some of Monolith Production's best work.  If you have a love for any of those late 90's, early 2000's crime scene investigation shows, or want an atmospheric first person psychological horror game, this is a game for you.  My advice for how to play: at night,  lights out, and headphones on.			"

												(First let me say I have only played this version for 2 hours, but have beaten the 360 version of Condemned.)I really liked Condemend when I played it. It was a rather spooky trip through some terrifying environments. This game does feature some interesting mechanics; like how you check your ammo, and the ability to literally rip pipes off of walls. The atmosphere is quite good at making you feel paranoid, and the game doesn't have to resort to jump scares to scare you. And the melee system is well designed, and assaulting vagrants is so satisfying. You can also find guns but the ammo is extremely scarce and should be used responsibly.Though there are a few things that need to be mentioned.A huge majority of the game is walking around and hitting people in the face with pipes and junk which unforunately can  become repetetive. And I kind of feel that the story does have a few plot holes here and there; but maybe that's just me.But in the end I can safely say that I absolutely do recommend Condemned to fans of horror, and melee combat games.

												I like this game because it reminds of those B horror movies so bad they're good.  So, Ethan Thomas is and FBI agent in pursuit of a murder suspect.  He tells his boss on the phone that he's not crazy and not a killer, then he goes to abandoned buildings to slay several dozen civilians with a sledgehammer and a fire axe to ""gather evidence"" (he also rides the subway across town while covered in blood from all those people with no difficulties).  His FBI forensics contact thinks this is fine and continues to assist him.  He periodically receives phone calls from some random old man who trolls him with meaningless hints and then hangs up.  He staunchly refuses to actually work with fellow law enforcement because random old man assures him that going psycho vigilante is ""the only way"".  I could see this being an instant cult classic movie.			"

												I get really immersed and constantly yell ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" whilst beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of a guy.But in a serious review, this game is really fun. Due to being a avid horror fan it's been on my list for a long awhile now and I want to kick myself for not playing it until now. The combat is the main attraction: it is absolutely fantastic. Aside from some iffy encounters (In one fight it felt like I was playing Morrowind because nobody was hitting anyone) it was pretty satisfying.I like that sometimes enemies accidently hit each other then they start fighting. This game is one of few that I feel makes guns feel as scary and powerful as they are in real life. So unless I have one too, I'm scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ due to their long range and high damage. This is probably the only game where I counted not only my shots as I fired, but the enemies' aswell. I liked the investigation mechanic. Story is interesting and so are the serial killer characters. The MC's voice acting isn't that good, but everyone else I thought was fine. The game has a really great atmosphere which in my opinion is the most important part of a horror game (or horror in general). Though personally I never found the game scary (although I am a tough cookie to break.) Even the infamous mannequin section. I found it very amusing one of the collectables were dead birds.I only had one problem when some boards in the attic were supposed to disappear but they didn't, looked it up and solved the issue by waiting till they disappeared like they were supposed to. And with the final boss I didn't know I had to press 1 as it didn't say so when it gave me the indicator to grab him. Plus the game configure tool only has some weird random resolutions, so I had to edit the settings CFG file to run it at 1080, which it runs just fine at. Also keep in mind this game is pretty short, I beat it in just 6 hours. All in all I loved it though primarily just for the combat. I mean I cared enough to write a real review when I usually do stupid joke ""reviews"" like the opening sentence for this review.			"

												Don't let my playing hours fool you, the game is definitely not this long, i just try to do some no death runs once in a while. Anyway, let me start up by pointing out the flaws of this game.Sure the graphics are decently under mediocre and the story is so bad you can literally pull apart the plot and point out the plot holes to the point of hilarity, but ignoring all that crap nobody cares about... the gameplay is very fun! Theres a melee combat system that really gives you the feeling of OMPH when you whack someone. Watch a killer hobo spit out his rotten teeth after you give him a good whack to the head with a freaking sledgehammer, Watch as your enemy stumbles backwards while being repeatedly pummeled with a pipe you just ripped from the wall like freaking rambo. But the enemies while being homocidial killer hobos aren't completely dumb either, they will try to fake you by pretending to whack you, they will block your attack and return your kindness onto you if you aren't as good as utilizing the blocking mechanic. If you ever get bored of that you can pick up some guns and just shoot them to death instead. The guns has a OMPH feeling to them as well, shooting someone with a pistol in the stomach isn't synonymous with a light tickle like ""bullet sponge"" enemies in other game but you will watch them stumble backwards in pain, thus giving you that sadistic feeling of dominance and badassness all of us gamer psychos strive for for. The ammo levels for the guns are quite pathetic however, and you are actually unable to reload, so obviously the game prefers us to bash people to death like a real man would. The locations are quite interesting in theme with the ""condemned"" name of the title, i gotta give them that. Even for horrific graphics they still managed to build up quite the atmosphere of desolation and sometimes even fear. Not many games has this focus on melee so if you buy it this should be your incentive, if you buy it just for the gameplay  and laughing at the b-movie quality storyline you won't be dissapointed at all.

												Criminal Origins is a great game still today. It has a good storyline with a little bit of a twist, it isnt the best i have ever played through but together with the gameplay it makes the game good.The combat system is pretty simple, mostly melee but also guns at some times.I would have liked it the game would have been a little bit more scary. It has a few jumpscares but could have needed a something more to give it a even darker tone. Maybe make you use either the flashlight or a weapon.The graphics if you ask me is great for its age. It has a loot of options and you can get the game to look really good if you mess around with them a bit.Cons: I had 2 problems with this game.1. The controlls where pretty much messed up when i tried to play the game. I had to bind my own controlls. It isnt a huge problem but can get a bit annoying after a while.2. The fps, when i first started playing this game the fps was constantly below 30 fps. Which is crazy. But i read about it and it has something to do with the software from the mouse or the keyboard. I didnt really care about it and then suddently the fps went up and the game ran great. So my conclusion of Criminal Origins is that its a good game!Story: 7.5/10Combat system: 8/10Atmosphere: 7/10Graphics: 10/10 (For its age!)Controlls: 5/10I truly recommend this game for anyone that likes games with a little bit of a darker theme, and people that dont care about graphics!

												This is one of the funnest horror games I've played. It is dark, spooky, and all around totally epic. The only thing I can complain about is the slightly tanky control style, but I think it kind of works considering the fact that it is a horror investigation game. 9.5/10			"

Dated Graphics, Solid Gameplay and AtmosphereCondemned: Criminal Origins originally came out in 2005 for the xbox 360, and in some parts of the game, mainly well lit areas and cutscenes, it really shows. But luckily most of these dated graphics are hidden by the dark levels that make up the majority of the game, and these level have a great atmosphere that's perfect for a horror game.There are guns and a taser in this game, but the main feature and reason you will keep coming back is the melee. I don't care how many hours you've spent in this game; it is always satisfying to wallop a hobo upside the head with a pipe.The AI is also great and really adds to the atmosphere. The enemies will make you paranoid and will always keep you guessing, 'Why did he turn and run? Is it still in the room? What's behind me? Why is he asking for chang-'.Though as a downside, once you've finished the game and start replaying it, the investigation mode parts do become tiresome and slow the game down.In all, if you're looking for a horror game that has great melee combat, pick up this little gem. Here's hoping they will add Condemned 2: Bloodshot to Steam.			"

												When I think back to games I played that are about a decade old I'm filled with nostalgia and warm feelings, even when it comes to games that aren't that warm and fuzzy like Condemned: Criminal Origins I still feel the same and although its a bit ripe now its an old horror title that the first time around gave me much delight in playing.As with most older titles being ported to PC that aren't remastered things can and more often than not do go wrong, however it generally varies from player to player and hardware to hardware. For myself however I suffered tremendously bad Framerate and stuttering issues not to mention missing sound files within certain levels, now normally this is more than enough to turn players off to the idea of continuing their game but i'm nothing if not stubborn and so taking to the community I sure enough found many resourceful souls that had found solutions to the problems and more that I had dealt with, so put simply if you don't mind a bit of tweaking this game can be played from start to finish with grinding your teeth to dust in frustration.Maintenance issues aside this particular title predated Outlast and Amnesia and although it doesn't have the amount of clout that those have it was made with an older engine, even cranked up to maximum you will struggle to tell the difference in graphical quality but I digress gaming is not all about the graphics and the combat style of Condemned encapsulates my point nicely, dealing with the mentally psychotic and deranged populace you will have rarely any ammo to speak off and so it falls to you to use anything and everything you can get your hands on around you before you're ultimately twatted to death by a 2X4, the combat system revolves around speed and your ability to anticipate your opponents next move will he fake or will he just swear at you.What I am saying is that the developer has taken an approach to the combat system rarely seen in modern games in that instead of a enemy utilising cover trying to flank etc, instead these nutters might rush you all at once possibly taking each other out in the process or take to hiding if the fighting's too thick, the enemy you will inevitibly dance with come in a few different flavours and it will be down to you to decide on how best to handle the situation.Aside from the combat there are times where you will need to make use of the many scientific gadgets you carry with you in your bottomless pockets to investigate crime scenes gather evidence and look for clues pertaining to your goal and to further the storyline, all of which is pretty simple and comes with hints on how to use it, the only other thing to do in Condemned is for the completionists out there, scattered around the levels are collectibles in the forms of dead and/or dying birds and curious pieces of metal, why your character would want to carry rotting birds around with him in his pockets is beyond me but hey thats not for me to question.As I said graphically the gameworld isn't pretty but it is a decade old but if you are the kind of gamer who allows themselves to be absorbed into the game they play then allow the ambient sound effects and atmospheric music take you away to a horrid place where death is poised around every corner and who knows perhaps you'll get a jumpscare or two.

												This game made me:-Feel like I was playing a 105 year old FBI detective on his deathbed. Seriously, the walking and sprinting speeds are just ridiculous. I am not even mentioning the speed at which stairs & ladders are climbed. -Hate Thomas Ethan's Stamina. WTF! I think a veteran FBI detective should be able to run more than 25 f**king meters before gasping for some air. -Hate those skinny little a**holes that crawl everywhere and scare the damn out of you when they attack. I mean, what are they? Human? Animal? The devil? If human, what the hell affected them like that? Bet it sure wasn't the holy spirit. Other than that, Condemned: Criminal Origins is a decent horror game every horror fan must have. Combat AI is unparalleled and the visuals are stunning for the time of its release.(2006) Though the game might get a little linear for some people, especially towards the end, it compensates for that with it's perfectly timed scares and pschological horror theme.Also the crime scene investigation aspect of the game is an amazing and original idea for a horror game. Simply brilliant!I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.			"

												Don't let my playing hours fool you, the game is definitely not this long, i just try to do some no death runs once in a while. Anyway, let me start up by pointing out the flaws of this game.Sure the graphics are decently under mediocre and the story is so bad you can literally pull apart the plot and point out the plot holes to the point of hilarity, but ignoring all that crap nobody cares about... the gameplay is very fun! Theres a melee combat system that really gives you the feeling of OMPH when you whack someone. Watch a killer hobo spit out his rotten teeth after you give him a good whack to the head with a freaking sledgehammer, Watch as your enemy stumbles backwards while being repeatedly pummeled with a pipe you just ripped from the wall like freaking rambo. But the enemies while being homocidial killer hobos aren't completely dumb either, they will try to fake you by pretending to whack you, they will block your attack and return your kindness onto you if you aren't as good as utilizing the blocking mechanic. If you ever get bored of that you can pick up some guns and just shoot them to death instead. The guns has a OMPH feeling to them as well, shooting someone with a pistol in the stomach isn't synonymous with a light tickle like ""bullet sponge"" enemies in other game but you will watch them stumble backwards in pain, thus giving you that sadistic feeling of dominance and badassness all of us gamer psychos strive for for. The ammo levels for the guns are quite pathetic however, and you are actually unable to reload, so obviously the game prefers us to bash people to death like a real man would. The locations are quite interesting in theme with the ""condemned"" name of the title, i gotta give them that. Even for horrific graphics they still managed to build up quite the atmosphere of desolation and sometimes even fear. Not many games has this focus on melee so if you buy it this should be your incentive, if you buy it just for the gameplay  and laughing at the b-movie quality storyline you won't be dissapointed at all.

												Condemned: Criminal Origins is a psychological first-person horror game that has managed to stand the test of time as well as any other title from its era. This is thanks in large part to the game's visceral combat system which focuses on melee weapons, as well as an intense atmosphere that will keep you constantly wondering what's just around the corner. This creepy atmopshere is further developed by quality level design and some good use of lighting and sound effects. Enemy AI is mostly intelligent; your psychotic opposition will sneak around quietly, strafe and block effectively, and won't just whale away on you when they see you. However, while the game holds up just fine from a gameplay and mechanics standpoint, there are some muddy textures and awkward character models that are less than appealing when compared to more modern games.If you're looking for a game that can provide some solid thrills and an immensely satisfying combat system, Condemned: Criminal Origins is as good as it gets. An underappreciated title that plays just as well today as it did 7-8 years ago.			"

												Aged a bit but the suspense will get to you everytime. Whether that be muffled footsteps upstairs or crushing of rubble and glass behind that corner. Every sound will make you tighten your grip on the 2x4 nail or electric conduit. You can use most of the environment as an weapon. Except Bloodshot really varies what you can use better. The brawling action is addicting except for the momentary block making it difficult if you block at the wrong time. The enemies don't have attack patterns and will deceive you whenever they can. Dodging, attacking twice, hiding behind corners when you aren't looking, whatever they can do to beat you. That makes you hesitate sometimes which I love. Again Bloodshot has more random patterns whether that is a pro or a con. And finally the story is immersive but inconclusive. I like how Rosa isn't reading a book to you. Every clue leads to another piece of the story. Feels like you are doing an actual investigation. This made me spawn a bunch of theories about what happened, where they went, etc. Short summary: Immersive but inconclusive story, addicting brawling combat with varying makeshift weapons, and heart-pounding suspense. 8.7/10			"

												Having my fingers cut off by Chris De Burgh in a gruesome first-person sequence sure is fun! I love the part where I have to creep through a condemned (hueh) shopping center eerily similar to the one I regularly went to as a kid, avoiding the insane homeless and assassins dressed up as dummies! I mean, it's not like I've always been scared of that shopping center IRL after I saw someone had spraypainted Silent Hill slogans and the Seal of Metatron everywhere in the condemned upper level of it! It's not like that at all, honest!Also there's a sequence where you dangle off the back of a subway train that actually ♥♥♥♥ing terrifies me because I was conditioned to equate being anywhere near a train but on-board it as a death sentence.

												Spooky, twist, messed up with interesting easter eggs, and one hell of horror story with action in the mix.  The Envrioments are my favorite, hearing noises and voices speaking from the shadows always works ones nerves, combat is simple to pick up and fight other people, and te voice work is on the money.  Another thing I need to mention is how everything is set up, you find melee weapons, but so can the enemies, so its a consistant struggle to fight againsts enemies of all shapes and sizes.  Bottom line, if you like twisted stories with dark worlds to explore you'll love this game.			"

												I can't believe I didn't hear about this game until 9 years after release. The graphics are obviously a bit aged, but imo they hold up very well, unlike most titles of it's day. The combat takes some getting used to, but once you learn timing your moves it becomes a lot of fun. Especially since these enemies -will- irritate you enough that you'll want to beat them to death with a gas pipe.The storyline is quite interesting. It's like a mash-up of Silent Hill, Bioshock, and Outlast. It's got enough depth and quick shot moments that you'll want to pay attention.  My one complaint? The obvious one: No Condemned 2 for PC. Bad move considering you'll want to play the sequel immediately after this. "

												finally finished it, and now I can write a review. You may think that this is an FPS game, but you would be wrong! This game has guns, but they kinda suck. You can only have as much ammo as the gun came with, the only way to get more ammo is to get a different gun. Melee combat is the games focus. Combat is simple, but fun. You can hit, block and use your taser. You also have 4 different execution moves when the enemy is on his knees. The main problem I have with this game is that the movement controls are clunky and slow. You have two speeds, snail and snail that has been pushed by another snail, and your stamina bar runs out VERY quickly. And don't get me started on walking on the stairs... dear god. The game is also very creepy and there are some parts that will give you a mini heart attack. Walking around in the darkness with the only source of light being from your flashlight and hearing guys in the distance yelling at eachother and killing eachother is uncomforatable and unsettling. Then you walk around a corner and some hobo with a shotgun is standing there with you in his sights. TL;DR : Get this game, its amazing and you wont regret buying it. And I forgot to mention the story, its also pretty interesting and you probably would want to see what happens later. Now I have to go and finish the sequel...			"

												This game is just great. Me and a friend just One-Shotted this game last night and it was a blast. The combat is fun, the scares are spooky, and the ragdolls are just magnificent. We were fighting the last boss and an enemy I killed earlier was just spinning in the back, we laughed so hard the boss killed us. You will find a lot of ragdolls doin dumb things in the backround, i dont know if the testers just ignored it or loved it as much as I did. 7/10 on the fighting, blocking is slow and sometimes you get hit anyway! Enemy also has an invisible extension on their weapons and hit you from a foot away.8/10 story, didnt know what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on, nothing explained unless you get the collectables, and spooky scary dood is just there i guess?10/10 ragdolls  You ever slam a mans face so hard he flies 6 feet in the air? Then just spins in circles until your character ♥♥♥♥♥ himself laughing? I did.AI 200/10  Watched enemies unintentionally kill each other is glorious. The last boss guy got gang ♥♥♥♥♥ by two other enemies who were trying to hit me from super far away, all 3 ended up killing each other as I watched.Final Verdict: Spinning McSpin aramma approves! "

												An absolute gem of a first-person action game. Gritty and atmospheric with the best melee combat I've experienced in any game. It's a suspensful game, not because of jump scares but because of the atmosphere it builds around you. The enemy AI is top notch too.Example: Walking through a dirty, dank subway station I turn a corner to catch a glimpse of a drug addict duck behind a stone column. As I enter the room he opens fire; I duck behind the nearest column. Both guns and ammo are scarce in this game, so I knew I could weather the storm. A few shots, pause, he's reloading. He comes out again, one, two, three...four, five, six shots. I bolt out from behind the column and hit him square in the chest with a sledgehammer as he's reloading his pistol.			"

												Good game for survival horror fans! Somewhat similar to the most recent Outlast games. Immersive atmosphere. Be prepared for a lot of melee fights with whatever you can find-gas pipes,desks,paper cutters,axes, sladgehammers and many other melee weapons. Fire arms is a rarity in this game so it's great for close combat lovers!On the minus side is the main character movement as it is slowed down way too much. pro-tip: you must use fire axe to beat the last boss!

												Let Monolith take you through a joyride with creepy atmosphere, scary visual effects that keep you on edge, a great story, and satisfying gameplay. Condemned Criminal Origins is a game where you play as FBI Detective Ethan Thomas who is framed by a serial killer for the deaths of his fellow officers. The only thing he can do is prove his innocence by tracking down the killer. But it's not a simple walk in the park, along the way you will fight violent civilians whose number has been growing in the city recently.The enemies themselves are so scary because they seem like regular people from far away but every time you get close to take a swing you see their messed up demonic faces. It's really cool. The enemies kind of behave how I imagine crack heads would. They usually have a melee weapon with them but they can, if forced to, grab a weapon from the map. Combat is really satisfying as you can swing, block (which causes a stun if done successfully), and kick. It's kind of like Kirby games because you can get different weapons mid-level that you choose depending on your mood (except for the scary crack heads). There are also guns in the game. Both you and the enemy can use it. The guns are more like a Get out of jail free card because it usually kills an enemy with one shot. There's also a taser but it's similar to the gun because it makes things too easy (except for one situation).The investigation scenes are also better than the ones in F.E.A.R. In F.E.A.R you are given more pieces to the puzzle of what is going on by pushing E on a computer and letting your friend talk about what you found. In this game you have to use forensic tools to find the clues rather than hit a simple button. For me it’s more satisfying to use the tools because you actually see the evidence and hear the results of its analysis.Only con of the game is that your character walks SO SLOW. His sprint is as fast as a normal walking speed but it only lasts 5 seconds. This is bad for two reasons. One there are collectable birds and metal pieces that you can find in the level. How do you expect me to explore when I am so slow. I go to a place where I think there will be a bird, there isn't, I try to run back to the path but I run out of sprint, I cry from frustration. The second reason why the running speed is bad is because some enemies (only a few each level) have guns. So you have to run towards them and take them out but you can't do that because you are so slow. The only way around it is to use a gun or the taser.Nonetheless this is a great horror game that gets under your skin rather than relies on jump scares. Definitely get it if you like F.E.A.R. "

												In Condemned: Criminal Origins, the goal of the game is to move through mostly linear, filthy buildings in an urban environment, occasionally deviating from the obvious path to pick up meaningless collectibles, such as engraved pieces of metal and dead birds. During these treks, the player uses a variety of improvised and non-improvised weaponry to fend off legions of greasy hobos, pale-skinned crack ♥♥♥♥♥s, acrobats who cosplay as Sméagol, and f̶a̶t̶t̶i̶e̶s̶ tumblr users. There are light elements of forensic and puzzle gameplay that keep the story going, a narrative which is surprisingly easy to follow. The game is plagued by awkward combat, usually the fault of indiscernible attack reach, as well as a number of weird design choices. Some sort of make sense, in sacrificing logic for the sake of gameplay. I can understand why the player isn't allowed to pick up ammo, as the guns give a huge advantage, but other times it looks the developers got lazy in their planning. Why are there so many invisible walls? Why do defeated enemies take so long to telegraph their helplessness before I get options to perform special finishes? Why is there even a toggle for the flashlight? Actually, I take that back. There is only one reason to ever turn the flashlight off: when a pronounced visual effect comes onto the screen and intensifies the already high contrast. Otherwise, it might as well be kept on for the entire game. Often, it's dark enough to justify using it, it's not on a timer so it can be used whenever, and it doesn't do anything to alert the enemies to my presence. In fact, the enemies might as well not even exist until I pass a certain invisble threshold and they spring into the level with their canned, predictable routines. That's my main issue with this game, is how nearly every moment designed to deliver on the suspense is a triggered event which usually fails in this endeavor. Sure, other things, like cleverly-placed objects to trip over and ominously-moving furniture help to build that sense of dread, but when it comes time to actually scare the player, it's frequently something that can be seen a mile ahead of time, such as the truck-sized blobs of meat that think they can hide behind corners without getting stuck on said corners. Yet, as much as I've been ripping it a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this one is alright, at least for one playthrough. It's an odd combination of atmosphere, combat, and puzzles that would seem mediocre on their own, but coagulate here into a unique, if at first glance lackluster, experience.			"

												When I think back to games I played that are about a decade old I'm filled with nostalgia and warm feelings, even when it comes to games that aren't that warm and fuzzy like Condemned: Criminal Origins I still feel the same and although its a bit ripe now its an old horror title that the first time around gave me much delight in playing.As with most older titles being ported to PC that aren't remastered things can and more often than not do go wrong, however it generally varies from player to player and hardware to hardware. For myself however I suffered tremendously bad Framerate and stuttering issues not to mention missing sound files within certain levels, now normally this is more than enough to turn players off to the idea of continuing their game but i'm nothing if not stubborn and so taking to the community I sure enough found many resourceful souls that had found solutions to the problems and more that I had dealt with, so put simply if you don't mind a bit of tweaking this game can be played from start to finish with grinding your teeth to dust in frustration.Maintenance issues aside this particular title predated Outlast and Amnesia and although it doesn't have the amount of clout that those have it was made with an older engine, even cranked up to maximum you will struggle to tell the difference in graphical quality but I digress gaming is not all about the graphics and the combat style of Condemned encapsulates my point nicely, dealing with the mentally psychotic and deranged populace you will have rarely any ammo to speak off and so it falls to you to use anything and everything you can get your hands on around you before you're ultimately twatted to death by a 2X4, the combat system revolves around speed and your ability to anticipate your opponents next move will he fake or will he just swear at you.What I am saying is that the developer has taken an approach to the combat system rarely seen in modern games in that instead of a enemy utilising cover trying to flank etc, instead these nutters might rush you all at once possibly taking each other out in the process or take to hiding if the fighting's too thick, the enemy you will inevitibly dance with come in a few different flavours and it will be down to you to decide on how best to handle the situation.Aside from the combat there are times where you will need to make use of the many scientific gadgets you carry with you in your bottomless pockets to investigate crime scenes gather evidence and look for clues pertaining to your goal and to further the storyline, all of which is pretty simple and comes with hints on how to use it, the only other thing to do in Condemned is for the completionists out there, scattered around the levels are collectibles in the forms of dead and/or dying birds and curious pieces of metal, why your character would want to carry rotting birds around with him in his pockets is beyond me but hey thats not for me to question.As I said graphically the gameworld isn't pretty but it is a decade old but if you are the kind of gamer who allows themselves to be absorbed into the game they play then allow the ambient sound effects and atmospheric music take you away to a horrid place where death is poised around every corner and who knows perhaps you'll get a jumpscare or two.

												The game is. Good.  a straight 3/5 that neither wowed me nor gave me less than expected.  Since it paved the way for the xbox 360, one needs to keep in mind it's release date.  The game did startle me time to time and I did feel a sense of dread through its entirety, but when you get down to it, its a simple melee beatemup with some extra elements thrown in.  Sure theirs guns and ""detective work"" (shine light at stains) but the game feels rather bare for what really could of been done with it.  The overall plot was ok, although I found myself dragged out of the immersion by the sheer obsurdity of the storyline (example: wanted for potential cop based murder, watch as other cops die to thugs and nobody cares) voice acting passable and decent playtime.  Theirs achievements but I found myself unmotivated in satisfying their little collections.So in conclusion:  It is worth a spin, but I wouldn't spend more than 10 dollars on the experience.			"

												...Great game...1st game I ever played on the 360 in 2006. Just as good today. But here are the few frustrating game quirks you will have to deal with... The block mechanic, no matter how hard to try to master & analyse it...it will so often be your undoing, it will be your demise so often..it is a severe problem, I learned to play without it in the end...attack then back-peddle worked much better. Sprint/run can also not be trusted...it feels like and acts like there is glue on the souls of your shoes...very odd. Next, once in a while when the AI & I were using the same weapon type, my melee reach was about a 1/2 or a 1/3 of their impact range. I really noticed this is the 'Orchard' level where we all used flaming torches as melee weapons. I had to get within about 4ft for a hit to register but they could hit me between 10-12ft away...that seemed very cheap & a real cheat by the game mechanics. Finally, you will always slow down to a crawl on stairs & you will often stick on the most minor of steps...odd as steps/stairs will not slow the AI...    Other than those oddities it's well worth a play thru...a short game which took me 5hrs in total to complete....so in the end recommended :-)			"

												Cool game for it's time. Eerie kind of atmospheric FPS. A lot of melee combat, though. And even more crawling around figuring out which way to go. I think it still holds up mostly, even with dated graphics(volumetric lighting though, what's up). But game's greatly flawed. It feels clunky and rigid. Sprinting for example - you can't do it properly in so many situations it's not even funny. Game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ habit of closing doors silently behind you, so you can't go back for medkits or spare weapon. It gets continually more frustrating as you play. Also game frequently takes your weapon away in cutscenes and such. And when you treasure every bullet it can get you mad. You only have as many bullets, as you find already loaded in a gun, but your opponents can reload theirs. Sometimes there are no sound effects too. The cutscene on train is almost fully silent. What's up with that? I did not finish the game, since apparently i can't move at the start of chapter 7, but still i had some fun.			"

												Is it a good game? Yeah. Do I recommend it? Yeah. But I didn't really enjoy it for a very specific reason. I expected a game about hunting a serial killer but got what's pretty much a crazy person killing simulator. It's a phenominal horror game that's extremely tense but not exaclty what I was looking for. I suggest you get it but look into it a bit more. Similar issue that I had to F.E.A.R. but the aestetics of the game aren't as varied or pleasing so if you're not expecting or don't want an almost purely melee based game then you should look elsewhere.

												This is an old horror game that has aged pretty well. You're a police officer who is framed for murdering two people and you're on the hunt for the true murderer. It can get very engrossing as you get closer and closer to solving the mystery. The atmosphere is well done and the scares will keep you on the edge of your seat as you fill your pants with bricks. The PC port has some graphical and sound errors but there is a patch that can fix them. If you want a great horror game experience, don't hesitate to play this game.			"

												Really fun, scary, and atmospheric, just how I remembered it on 360 launch day. The only thing wrong with this port is that there are certain parts of the game where the sound cuts out/missing. I'm not sure what causes this but it only happends in a few sections of the game, it's not constant throughout. Other than that it was a blast playing this title again and I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for something different. Now...only if we could get Condemned 2: Bloodshot on PC.			"

												To me, this game hasn't aged a day. The melee combat is as fresh as ever except for the odd AI glitch or two or three. Pro reviews cited weakness in the weapon sounds and textures, as well as an overall unremarkableness to the game's decor. I do not see this as a weakness but as a return to form for the video game medium where a wall is a wall, not a symbol for industrial greatness or self-triumph, but rather, just a wall. It looks like the wall next to it, a wall which serves a purpose similar in function to the floor and ceiling, and just as vulnerable to destruction. Not that there is any player-controlled destruction of environments but enemies will try it out on the player while the game complements the chaos with drywall particles and dust from rotted wood. It's true that it could be called ""duller"" than some brighter-colored alternatives but the side-benefit is an easing-in experience where you are hypnotized more than shocked. I liken it, personally, to a water-color pallette.The game is decidedly lo-fi in some aspects but spares no expense procuring top-tier voice actors that deliver stolid and enjoyable performances. If you're a stickler for certainty, you may pass, as the story will leave you scratching your head somewhat. Deeper exploration will reward you with collectible quests that unlock further background information accessible through the main menu, as well as concept art from internal circulation at Monolith.Overall, a 4/5 game that you will enjoy many times over if you enjoy its core mechanic of bludgeoning homeless people's faces in with a nailboard.

												Man, this is a weird one. It's all love and hate for me. It tries to be a first-person brawler, shooter, detective and a horror, and neither of that it does well. It has some of the weirdest collectibles I've ever seen(dead birds for instance), unskippable cutscenes and OH MY GOD this game loves to waste the player's time - walking and even running speeds are infuriatingly slow(stamina bar is included, of course), and every time the character goes up or down a minimal slope(this includes all stairs), movement speed is reduced even further to unbelievable, rage-inducing crawl. This actively punishes exploration, which wasn't all that meaningful to begin with. Not to mention the plot, which makes very little sence and average at best writing.However, it still clicked with me. The game is genuinely creepy and very atmospheric, and thankfully horror does not rely too heavily on cheap jump scares. Combat, while not fleshed out mechanically very well, is visceral and heavy-hitting, and suprsingly good animations and gritty, realistic sound effects help immerse further into this weird experience. The very last level felt somewhat rushed and poorly presented, but nevertheless was an immensly satisfying conclusion, due to relying on the game's stronger points. Overall, I can't either praise or damn this game. It's hit-or-miss, and I was an inch away from giving it a negative review. At least it tries to be original, and I'd say mostly it succeeds.			"
