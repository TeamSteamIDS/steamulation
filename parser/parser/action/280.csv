												I know this almost goes without saying, but any gamer alive should play the Half-Life games. Even compared with the modern flashy big-budget single-player shooter extravaganzas of today (I'm looking at you, Far Cry and Bioshock), which are rightly heralded as amazing games, Half-Life makes your jaw drop at how amazing of an experience it is to fight throuth the crumbling Black Mesa facility battling humans and headcrabs alike. This game really makes you realize how much Jason Brody, Booker Dewitt, and every other major  fps protagonist since owe the man with the crowbar, Gordon Freeman. If you are a sane human being who can play a video game, there is no excuse for you to not play Half-Life. None!			"

												I've stayed away from the Half Life series for a very long time, solely because I didn't even have a Steam account! But I recently bought Half Life: Source and Half Life 2, and I must say, they've already become some of my favourite games.The formula in this game, although the game is 10 years old, still feels fresh to me, and feels like a new game. It's also one of the first games I've tried of this genre that I've actually enjoyed. The graphics are also fantastic for their age. Well done Valve!			"

												Half-Life: Source is the 2004 port of Valve's award winning game to the Source Engine. With just that knowledge, it would sound like Half-Life: Source was a gift from above, but it's anything BUT that. Half-Life: Source was critically panned, which makes you wonder HOW it has a ""Very Positive"" on Steam Reviews. Half-Life: Source is one of those games Valve chooses to forget, with the likes of the first Left 4 Dead and Ricochet. But, before we get into a review, lets go over the history of Half-Life: Source.The History:In 1999, Valve started development of Half-Life 2, the award winning squeal to Half-Life, originally running on the GoldSource engine. Around 2001/2002, the Source Engine was created, and it surpassed what the GoldSource engine could do, so, Valve planned to port Half-Life to the Source Engine to have it replace the GoldSource counter parts. In 2003, Axel Gambe got a hold of the full Half-Life 2 Source Code, raw map data, and a build of Half-Life 2, who later gave it to some friends, who leaked it. In those leak files, there was the Half-Life Source port, along with files to a Source port of TFC, DMC, and CS 1.6 (which was remotely playable, but at this time, this port was starting to become the game we know today as CS:S.) The port of Half-Life: Source was quite buggy and unfinished, which is to be expected for it being a leak of a beta. So, 2004 comes around, and then Half-Life 2 is coming around the corner, as a bundle with Half-Life 2, you could get Counter-Strike: Source (by this time is the game we all know and probably love) and Half-Life: Source. Half-Life: Source saw little change from the 2003 leak of Half-Life 2, minus some minor bug fixes and having the Half-Life 1 HUD. At this point, be expected Half-Life: Source to be just like Counter-Strike: Source, a re-imagining of the game, in HD (for 2004 standards), but what they got was a direct Half-Life port that didn't seam quite finished. This is why if you ask anyone why they don't like Half-Life: Source for the most part (especially pre-2013) you get told it's graphics were just the Half-Life graphics. But as stated before, Half-Life: Source was meant to replace Half-Life as a whole, but due to how poorly received it was, Half-Life Original saw another day. In 2006, Valve ported the Deathmatch counter part of Half-Life into the Source Engine, and if you thought Half-Life: Source was a bad port, you should of saw this game. All player ragdolls had broken physics, some weapons were broken (the Shotgun's double barrel sound is just the single barrel sound), and the gameplay was more like Half-Life 2 Deathmatch with minor HLDM gameplay stuff slapped in (the game even lacks the backpack pickups that were in Half-Life Deathmatch), the only reason I can see for this port, was just to give EP1 a pack-in game. Around 2007, Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source were ported to Source Base 2007, but due to the amount of bugs now included with the game, Valve didn't release this patch to the public, it wasn't until 2012 that the public knew of this update's existence, since in 2012, the whole 2008/2007 source code to Source Base 2007 was leaked into the public, it also confirmed that the Team Fortress Classic port was in further development than what everyone thought. But due to the amount of hate towards Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source would mean we would probably never seen of these ports.So, that runs down a good chunk of the history of Half-Life: Source besides one of the more major things, the 2013 update. Valve in an effort to ditch the GCF system and upgrade everything to VPK and have a better downloading system and a better game asset pack to engine communication, they created Steampipe, but since Valve decided it would be best to port all games to Source Base 2013, they decided to do that, and try to provide updates to all Valve games. In the same year, Valve canned the project, leaving a ton of games in a broken state, Half-Life: Source being one of them.So, this leads us into the review.The ReviewHalf-Life: Source was a mediocre port to the Source Engine, where it would be mixed who liked the game and disliked the game, since Half-Life: Source had that audience. Half-Life: Source is now a BAD port to the Source Engine, since those 2013 updates broke more than what it fixed. Not only did Valve cancel the updates to these games, they released the beta depots into the release depot to remove traces of GCFs. So, those games that had a good release depot, now have a beta released into them, and a lot of these betas were far from done. We now have broken Save/Restore errors in various NPCs, 2 out of the 3 tentacles in Blast Pit can harm the player or AI, one of the maps in Residue Processing will blind the player if your flashlight is turned on, skill configurations are broken (so now the AI is harder), Gonarch spit is now black squares, one of the maps in Surface Tension has a broken skybox, you can jump over a lot of things making it so you can skip half of ""We got Hostiles"" and skip various other parts in other chapters, all of the Chrome shaders are complete ♥♥♥ (they were never good, but this is just worse), and even more. It's sad when a 2003 leak is better and more playable than a 2013 update. Plus, if you load the HD Pack you get a GameBanana skin pack, since Valve was too lazy to port the assets their selves of even double check to be everything matched in the first place. But the icing on the cake is that, well, at first install, you can't even PLAY Half-Life: Source since Valve provided corrupted or outdated DLLs to Steam VR, so every time you reinstall Half-Life: Source you have to verify the cache of Half-Life 2 or Steam VR. Not only that, the person who was working on these updates, Alfred, shrugged off a few errors as design points.Half-Life: Source had potential to be a great port, to even be on par with the Original Half-Life (definitely should NEVER replace the Original), but its potential was lost with a company who couldn't care enough about the game, which is why it was left for about 6 years without an update.I recommend to play Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source so you can see what happens when a company just flat out doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.Even though I didn't review the pre-2013 build, I'm still going to give it a ratingThe Half-Life: Source that existed before 2013, I give that a 6 out of 10I give the current Half-Life: Source a 4 out of 10, avoid at all costs.Actually, I recommend you report both Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source, as it very unplayable and is using stolen assets. You shouldn't let Valve sell this to people, especially when people think this is the better version of Half-Life			"

												Would I recommend Half-Life? Hell yes. Would I recommend Half-Life: Source? Er, maybe. The original Half-Life was, and still is, an absolutely fantastic game. The story and how it’s conveyed to the player works extremely well, and the controls, gameplay mechanics, visuals, and sound are all phenomenal. Very few bugs, and certainly none game-breakingly noteworthy.However, this is where Half-Life: Source fails. This game’s major problem is its glitches and bugs. Some minor, some absolutely game-breaking. On one hand, you have scientist’s AI screwed up, running into open fire, constantly shooting off their response lines. On the other hand, you have some parts of the game where the textures and models go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, essentially simulating your graphics card melting.Even with the bugs, the game does try to make it up with some enhancements thanks to the Source engine. The water effects are slightly better (although in my experiences it’s just extraordinarily shiny and reflective), and the lighting effects are significantly improved, although inconsistent when walking into an area that needs to load. However, the HL2 bullet hole decals make it possible to create magnificent works of art with your crowbar on walls. Thankfully, the gameplay, controls, and overall look and appeal of the game is still there, unaltered. There’s no denying that the game is awesome. Half-Life in general is awesome. I just love how people on the GoldSrc version of Half-Life were complaining about the game having extremely old and outdated graphics, saying HL:Source is better in this field. Well, it’s not. A majority of textures and models are completely identical. Aside from the water and bullet decals, the games are visually the same, which is something I’m completely fine with. The regular version of Half-Life actually comes with the HD texture pack, something this port lacks. It essentially gives the game updated models to characters and weapons, and slightly enhanced textures in some areas. It’s nice, but not essential, which is fine.Overall, yeah, go ahead and get it. If this is ever on sale for cheaper than the regular Half-Life, and you own neither, by all means, go ahead and get it. You (hopefully) won’t regret it. "

												I'm not some trolling idiot, I actually love HL1... so please, at least read what I have to say before downvoting, don't act like that just instantly means I hate HL1.Yes, Half Life 1 is one of the best games you'll ever play.  Assuming, of course, that it was designed for its engine.  Meet Half-Life Source, a game that was made on GoldSrc then converted to show off the new engine they had made.HL simply wasn't designed for Source, and no effort was put into properly re-writing the game for the new engine.  The AI is bugged to eternally walk into any wall, I've yet to see a working hitbox, and HL1's graphics are better than this remake.  It's actually unplayable due to the scripted events being broken.  Sorry, that door isn't opening.So you may ask about the low playtime.  Well, when I realized I wouldn't be entering the test chamber, I tried skipping forward a few levels with the map command.  Guess what?  BUGS!  LOTS OF EM!  Nearly anything involving AI interaction would NEVER happen, half the time your enemies can't even hurt you (and vice versa), and a few levelskips forward, I even fell out of the world once when I got hit by a box.Overall, I'm scoring HL Source with a 3/10.  A complete waste of money you're seeing here, it's got to be some sort of joke on Valve's part.  It only scores anything because under the technical crapshow is the 1998 classic that, Xen aside, is nearly perfect.If you want to play the REAL Half-Life bug-free on the GoldSrc engine, click here.

												It's the original Half-Life, with less modding support, texture glitches, and improved water effects. If you already own the Goldsrc version of the game, the only reason to get Source would be out of curiousity during a sale. Otherwise, there aren't nearly enough additions to justify the additional purchase. Half-Life Deathmatch Source is fun...when you can find people to play it with, which isn't nearly enough. So, while it is as good as the original Half-Life, it is also nearly identical to it as well. You're better off buying the standard version, which is compatible with Opposing Force and Blue Shift, unlike Half-Life: Source.			"

												Original review from 30 Jul, 2012 @ 12:58pm ---	 This is more of a comment; Half-Life Source is Half-Life upgraded onto the source engine and with some minimal graphic enchanments. There really is no difference between this and Half-Life other than chapter selecting, gmod compatibility, and source enging modding and editing etc. Edit:With the current EA release of Black Mesa it made me think. A bunch of people on the BM forums are complaining about how it's a paid mod and all that junk, but really BM is a giant remastering, a complete overhaul built from the ground up in a whole new light, and yet Half-Life: Source still lingers around and has no real fresh thing about it other than it's simply on the source engine and there is no mod community for it at all.People should be getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at this than BM, because this has more reason for it. If BM was released by Valve, or just suddenly popped up without anything previously knowing about it, it would have no hate whatsoever. Half-Life: Source should not be sold separately because it has nothing to it that's worth a full 10 dollar price tag on it's own. It should just be bundled and sold with the original Half-Life.			"

												First, let's get the formalities out of the way. Half-Life is Half-Life. It's unimaginably fantastic. Half-Life Source is different though. It's essentially the same game, just on a more updated engine. And while that might sound like a good thing, Half-Life 1 wasn't designed for the Source engine. It doesn't fit. The updated textures look strange and out of place, it's buggy as all hell, and the AI is changed. That last one's big. Considering there's no cutscenes in Half-Life, any important scenes are done as scripted events. And with the AI different, they just don't act the way they're intended, making you miss important story points. I've also noticed that they move around a lot, so you'll get swarmed real quick, which makes the game go from challenging to unfair. It also doesn't help that weapon switching is unnecessarily slow in this one compared to the original, giving a horde of enemies barrel-assing around the corner ample time to punch holes in you. Also, with the new Source engine, any music that's playing is cut off when you move to the next map, and since there's music cues right before a map change, you'll hear the first five seconds of the song before it just stops playing. Seriously, if you want it, make sure you play the original first. I may have under twenty hours on the Source version, but I have over 130 hours on the GoldSrc version. And that's the campaign alone. Don't be stupid. Get the original.			"

												I was thinking if I should do a new review for this game or just not even cover it, but I decided to review so here goes.http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/70/ My original review of Half Life.Half Life Source is the remastered (if you can call it that) version of the original Half Life. With less game breaking bugs and better textures.At first when I started playing I didn't notice many different things as the game still looks a lot like the original Half Life. Apart from some different textures like the better models and water physics the game looks pretty much identical.My biggest problem with the original version of Half Life was that the game was incredibly buggy. I encountered many game breaking bugs. This wasn't the case with Source. Apart from one chapter where I encountered texture pop ins, I didn't encounter much more.In the end there's nothing more I can say about Half Life Source that I didn't say in my original review. It's a fantastic game and one of my favorite games to date. I highly suggest buying it if you haven't already and playing. Now which version do I recommend playing ? I suggest playing this instead of the original. But I do suggest getting the first one just for Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Final Rating:8/10 - Worth BuyingIf you liked this review please consider giving it a like and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

												There isn't much of a difference between this game and the original Half-Life. If you're deciding which to buy, it honestly doesn't matter. The water is nicer in this game and there are ragdolls and better physics. Other than that, it's essentially the same game. Don't worry about not getting the ""pure"" experience of HL1 because this is essentially it. Lower resolution water and people who just lay down and die without leaving a ragdoll for you to smack with a crowbar weren't the cornerstones of the Half-Life. Playing HL is an experience, regardless of trivialities such as this.I wouldn't get this by itself personally; if you really wanna pick it up, get it via one of the packs in the Store and/or wait for a sale.One interesting note though, you can load up the content from this game in Garry's Mod. If you have Gmod, this might give you some fun stuff to play around with.			"

												Half-Life is an amazing adventure, sci-fi, and FPS game from Valve.  Your goal is to escape the ruined Black Mesa (the same one that is rivaled with Aperture Science from Portal) while fighting the invading aliens.  Even though first person shooters are generally hated today becayse they are considered rehashes and uncreative, this game is the exact opposite.     You start off in a train ride on your way to some sort of test chamber everyone is talking about.  As you take the ride, you will see a lot of different places that you will visit later, so pay attention.  You eventually make your way to the test chamber when disaster strikes and aliens invade.  It sounds a bit cliche at first, but the game tells the story in such a great way that it works.  You eventually meet a security guard and encounter enemies.  The security guard then helps you, which brings me to my first point.    One amazing thing about Half-Life is that it gives choices.  When you meet the security guard,  you already have your first weapon: a crowbar.  Since a crowbar is a weapon, and there is a person with a gun in front of you, and you need to survive... well, you can see what most people would do.  About 20 minutes into the game, you can already get a gun early, or you can have the security guard help you, until he is apparently can't crawl through a whole that an average scientist can... what a security guard.  This is just one example, and there are a lot of security guards willing to help you.     Anyway, onto the graphics.  They're not as good as other Source games, but don't let that discourage you.  Games are meant to be played, not looked at.  Also, if you want to, you can make the game look like the original Half-Life.     I would reccomend Half-Life to pretty much everbody, as long as you don't get scared easily.  Trust me, you will get a bit scared.  There is a creepy atmosphere, zombies, and A LOT of tension and a feeling you are being watched.  There are no jumpscares are other cheap scares, luckily (I'm looking at you, Slender).  This game gets a 10/10			"

												Half-Life, the original game from 1998, is possibly my favorite game of all time for reasons of nostalgia, gameplay, story, and the fact that I don't mind the graphics. That being said... This version has taken that amazing game, ported it to the same engine as Half-Life 2, and neglected to fix the  massive  glitches. These include weapons that do not work properly, several graphical problems (If you use the flashlight in a few rooms, the visuals just about break.) Sure, the graphics are 'better' but all that is changed is the blood, lighting and the added ragdoll physics. But these clash with the textures, all of them much lower resolution, making the game look  worse	. I reccomend the original Half-Life, as well as it's expansions and sequels. And if you can't stand the graphics, then I reccomend Black Mesa Source. It's a  much	 better remake of the original Half-Life.			"

												As others have mentioned, the core game is fantastic.   However, the Source port is buggy to the point of distraction - the triggers and interactions that made the original non-Source Half-Life such a revolutionary, tight combo of story and game are broken: * scripted events involving hostiles seem to trigger wrong or not at all ( ""I killed twe-RECON! GO GO!"" )* wounded NPC's yell over and over and over and over at top volume.* Source physics on the jumping puzzles have taken them from hard to impossible.* Got as far as blast pit, which all sneaking tension is gone and replaced by an indestructable npc shooting the creature over and over again.Half-life (non source) is an awesome game, and it sounds like there may be a better fan-made port in the works.  But stick with the old version if you want the story, and I'm surprised Valve would let anyone curious for the mythos of Half-Life play such a buggy version.  I won't be returning it because hey, I paid $1.99 on a Steam sale, but it seems disinginuous to give a recommendation to this version.			"

I know it's a weird thing to complement, but could you imagine how stupid it would be if Gordon, or Chell (the protagonist of Portal) would speak?Cons:NPC's eyes don't have animation.Some minor glitches.Black Mesa won't stop ripping off Aperture Science.That last one was a joke.

												It's basically the same thing with prettier water, more comfortable flashlight, faster movement speed and ragdolls instead of original death animations. They fixed the Barney's miming of numpad sounds but broke a ton of other things like: specific weapon selection sound, gore, Barney's friendly fire, less blood on walls after shooting, the elevator lights are broken, music stopping after loading, echo in vents and larger areas, the subtle head bobbing, the weapons now have recoil and look more oily, the crowbar makes the same sharp sound when hitting stuff, explosions are less satisfying, transparent water, headcrabs don't move around they just stare at you. But on the other hand: crowbar is stronger, swimming is better, flashlight now casts shadows, the textures look crisper and nicer thanks to shaders, FOV is adjustable and higher in weapons, meaning you can see them better. If you want to play HL1 then play HL1, or try Black Mesa, but HL:S is still HL, so play it anyway, to enjoy the few nuances that make the game even better.			"

												Ive been a steam user for 9 years, i loved the goldsource games, i even have the original WON version of Half-Life. I Love the Half-Life series and its mods. This game is not one of the games i love.Sure it may look like the original half-life with uppgraded graphics. Sure it may ""Feel"" like the original Half-Life untill the bugs happen... When i reinstalled the game to see why i havent played this version of the game i finnaly rememberd..This game has gamebreaking bugs, that will halt your progress. First of all, let me list down the issues i had when starting this gameIf your steam is in any other language other than English, the main menu will say #clickeble menu ON EVERY OPTION. You will have to change the language on steam to English!When playing, sometimes when you explore before ""unforseen consequenses"" be sure to pick up your suit before you talk to the guard or else, your save will be corrupted.When in missile silo, where the tentacles are, resetting the power to the machine to later turn on the fuel, the hatch leading to the fuel will be permanently closed. For me there is no fix.When the game needs the user to open up the console and cheat to get it working, then you know its wrong.The game feels like it was halfassed. Every element in this game feels flawed compared to Half-Life (Goldsource). Where skripts to open doors will fail to load. Events wont happen. Buy Half-Life instead of this. I cant stress that enough..			"

												The attention to detail in Valve’s games has never been amiss and I’ve always been impressed by how much they put into this series. The setting for the game is an underground research facility, your character witnesses a catastrophe that plunges the facility into chaos. You have to fend off alien species to escape the facility and try to figure out what is happening. It’s a sci-fi game and that’s what gives it its character. The weapons especially get more interesting as the game develops, as you start to discover more and more alien technology.I used to love watching my dad play this as a kid, but I just never managed to be able to get very far myself until I decided to go back to it now. The Half-Life 1 series is extremely nostalgic to me and its great still being able to play these games despite how old they are. For me, they are great, but I imagine for people that have never played them before, they might just look awful. Despite that, I would hope the overall feel and story of the game would be compelling enough to make those people enjoy it anyway.Half-Life: Source has a few bugs here and there, a few of which I thought were going to be game breaking for me. But there was always a way around it. The glitches and bugs were tedious but given how old the game is it’s forgivable. The source engine reboot of this game changes up the game quite a bit. It was given new map textures, new weapon models, new NPC models and enhances to the sound. The changes are good, they definitely make the game look better. But I enjoy the original just as much, if not more. I’m used to and remember the old one. Which oddly, when I played this game I’m not too sure what happened with it. I downloaded the game, fired it up and played quite a bit in one session. Not noticing that it was all actually the old game assets. I shut it down and gave the game a break and when I booted it back up suddenly the new stuff was being used. Weird!Anyway, there is never a dull moment in this game, there is action and something new always around the corner. It’s essentially a first person shooter, but it manages to break it up in-between and give you enough else to do so that it doesn’t get boring. It’s all around a fun game and I think you should give it a try, even if you haven’t got that Half-Life nostalgia that I do.TL;DR : Old but great, lot of nostalgia for me. It’s a good first person shooter sci-fi game, give it a try.For anyone interested, My Review for Half-Life: Opposing Force:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/50/ "

												Worst way to play a great game. The source engine adds very little to the game. The engine’s properties such as realistic water look very unnatural with the surroundings.

												This is a nice remaster of the original Half-Life running on the Source Engine. So you will get better physics, lighting, shadows, and water. However you should know that this version has less mod support and can be very glitchy. During my experience one section caused the entire game's graphics to just glitch out that I'm watching a static image that I can't see what I'm doing! And I also hear other people saying the game crashes at certain moments in the game so I probably would recommend you stick with the original game.Rating 6/10			"

												There are two kinds of people who should buy HL: Source. The first is the person who somehow doesn't have a copy of Half-Life but really, really wants Source physics involved. The second is the rabid Half-Life fan who already has Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Eps 1 &2, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift and still requires more HL to fill the gaping void Gabe Newell has left in their heart.I plead no contest.Seriously, the Source remake didn't really add anything to the game. As near as I can tell, the only gameplay difference is that the crates don't spazz out as much when you try to pull them. Graphically it's mostly the same but the human characters all look significantly creepier. Well, all of them except the G-Man, and he was creepy to begin with.			"

												Most reviews talk of glitches and bugs but I never encountered a single one. Maybe I was just lucky or maybe the reviewers were lying. Who knows.But anyway. I wanted to check out Half-Life since I got sucked into the Portal universe (and hearing that Aperture Science and Black Mesa were linked somehow) and it was recommended that I get the Source version as opposed to the original. So I did.I actually really enjoyed the story. An experiment at Black Mesa goes wrong and it's up to silent protagonist Gordon Freeman to set it all right again. And despite being a scientist, he's a damn good shot with a gun or he'll really smart you with a crowbar. The gunplay feels good and movement is good, though sometimes jumps can be a little floaty.I never judge a game on graphics but either way, the graphics are good for a game of this agel, and a HD retexture is included. Both sets look good but graphics do not make a game.The gameplay itself is good and the difficulty has good progression, so you start with easier enemies and then as the game progresses, you face tougher enemies. Occasionally the difficulty can spike in places but this is usually doe to miniboss encounters, which is expected.Either way, this was definitely a fun experience and I would highly recommend it.

												For my review of Half-Life, check out my review of the original game. This is just a short insight on my thoughts of the Source version. Half-Life: Source is simply the original Half-Life ported to Valve's newer (at the time) Source engine, it doesn't bring anything new to the table aside from a few new menu options such as selecting a chapter, but it does improve a handful of aspects, mostly minor and technical. The most noteable changes are to the water, the ragdoll physics and the map lighting (in some cases). There are plenty of other minor things that you will notice after playing through once, it's like a new layer of polish, but nothing that would make me recommend buying this version over the original game as unfortunately the Source port has also caused a large number of bugs and errors to arise that were never in the original version. While some of the new features and mechanics in the Source engine are nice, the game hasn't really been updated to take those aspects into account, and thus, more problems popped up. So I have mixed feelings about Half-Life: Source, but I'd say that this version is worth playing through at least once if you are a Half-Life fan, it has a slightly different feel to it but ultimately I'd say to just stick to the original version of the game instead. It may be dated but that's what gives it it's charm.			"

												The game itself is great, but I don't like this version which is why I don't recommend it.  They added ragdoll physics and stuff like updated water, but that comes with a lot of annoying bugs and glitches.  Some better reviewer than me created a detailed list of all the changes from the original, so you can look at that to see if this one is worth a purchase. I bought this with a package so it was worth it in terms of price.  The game crashed a fair amount and on one level the textures bled everywhere to the point where I couldn't see anything.  I had to search for a fix and it worked but that was really annoying.  Also the skyboxes on some levels are lacking in textures.  I also don't understand why your character moves so freakin' fast.   It's awkward when you're trying to complete the game's numerous jumping puzzles.  However, this game is a classic that has influenced numerous subsequent FPSes, so if you buy this game you're owning a piece of gaming history.  I just think you should try to get the original version if you can, though Black Mesa looks interesting, too.  Update:  I played HL2 again recently.  I changed my mind about HL1 not standing the test of time as much as the sequel.  The more complex levels that you find in older shooters remain fun to play, and though I love HL2 its linearity makes multiple playthroughs less appealing.  However, some of the levels in HL2 are extremely well-designed and I'll always enjoy them.			"

												Is it worth it if you already own the original? YES!!! Now, please, come ON people! Stop hating it because it is ""the same as the original"". I will tell you why it is BETTER than the original. 1. If you beat the game but forgot to save, this game allows you to go to ANY point in the game. 2. It is a nice love letter to those Half-Life 1 and exansion players. 3. Yes, it is the same game, BUT, Valve wants new players to go try the 1998 classic, with better lighting, physics, and just some better mechanics that Gold Source could not handle. BONUS FOR GMOD PLAYERS. 4. You can't use Gold Source models in the game without addons, so now you don't have to. So I give this game a 10 out of 10. So new players who haven't had a chance to try the original, hope you like it, and people hating the game because the reason stated before, hope you know see reason Valve made this game!			"

												First of all this is not a remake (like Black-Mesa), it's a remasterization. Well this is the same old Half Life we all know, except that now it has some improved textures, mainly the metalic ones (incluiding floors), overall lighting, color intensity and all of the character models. The weapons are better looking too as well as your H.E.V. suit (it has nice details on your hands and arms. I recommend it, yes, but only to people that don't own the original or die hard fans like me that would take up any excuse to replay this masterpiece. The thing that bugs me (ignoring the glitches) is that this remasteriztion feels incomplete. Despite they added physics and the death's are more realistic and satisfying (plus the bullet impact splatter and the bullet holes on characters are a nice detail too) now you CAN'T hit them with the crowbar, it just passes through. The only way to ""hit"" the body is hitting the surface were it is and through the bodu. Only then it'll start moving and it is weird because the hit sound it's still the surface one. If they are re-releasing this too, they should have added something extra, like achievements or cards. I also hate that the impact sounds of the crowbar, even when you are smacking wood, it's METAL-HIT-LIKE SOUND. WHAAT????Finally, I have to say that I played Black Mesa. That is a remake, it has the essence of this game but changed some maps and things (the leechers on the water are gone and the enemies act and react different to the weapons, for example). I liked it and it was a good excuse to travel to Black Mesa again. I still prefer the originall one, but I salute the developers for making an outstanding job at it.			"

												eh its okayits basically the same as half life 1except they added higher res textures making things look shiny and some special shading for \""better graphics\""yeah honestly it just looks horrible and unnaturalthey added some different stats on some items and nmes and i honestly don\'t agree with these changes (although some of you may agree)also this game is bugged since they re released it all it took was an hour of gameplay for me to relize some gliches such as-missing textures-invisable beings (bad guys or good)-the entire map just breaking-the screen blacking out (yes i know this is for falling damage but sometimes ill reload and it\'ll still be there)-the game crashing-broken hit detection-broken voice (like sometimes you\'ll just hear a sciencetist just keep screaming or do the in pain sound when they are just fine and voice often loops this can make you want to leave this area ALOT quickierhonestly thats not all of them but this review is getting long as it isdon\'t buy this one go buy the one that dosen\'t have source cause playing this game is alot better when it isn\'t broken and the textures don\'t look just plain hideous in order to make it \""better\""2/10			"

												This is game is pretty good....it's a port of the original half life on to the source engine,many people say this game is too hard even on easy.OK,it kinda is,but if you have played other valve games this ones controlls will be familiar,when you play the game a lot of times you'll start to understand how the AI works,you know how every enemy in the game thinks,it's a lot of fun setting up traps where the enemies would teleport,the story is good,if you don't shoot everything in your way the story will be clear.Also I have to talk about the graphics,the game is more shiny and the water is shadery as well.The environments look more ""alive"".The only thing that everyone hates are ladders.THEY ARE THE WORST.

												PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYINGHalf-Life Source is just Half-Life, in the Source engine (BUT) it is broken thanks to SteamPipe.If you really want to play it you should buy it, but if the bugs hamper it too much go online and find a NoSteam crack (Not Illegal because you already paid money for it) and it should run greatly, and with very few bugs. (I have not run into any gamebreaking bugs (I am at the dam in Surface Tensions) I found 3 bugs: the box jumping puzzle the last box slides into the wall, does not affect gameplay. When opening the storm drain in Surface Tensions you can get stuck on top the valve, but I got off by using the grenade launcher.  I saw 2 Marines walking into eachother but that was right after a loading screen and they got out when they saw me.Now onto my review.Half-Life Source is a very well made game. (before steampipe) I would highly recommend doing my above method to play this game for anyone looking to get back into Half-Life, but thinks the graphics could be better. The water and skies look amazing, the lighting is good, and without the High Def Pack (It comes with the Steam version, enable it, it makes the game look very good)  the guns, the models, and textures are decent. I have found the recoil is  different (It reminds me of going from CS 1.6 to CS:S) but besides that normal gameplay is very much the same as The GoldSrc version. Please buy the bundle that includes Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, as it is also great. (This game also gives you more models for GMod 8.2-16) "

												The only reason, the ONLY reason I am giving this game a negative recommendation, is because Black Mesa is now available on Steam.  Half-Life is a fantastic game, but this version of it is a sloppy port at best.  Save yourself the heartache of playing this version and go buy Black Mesa.  Black Mesa includes Trading Cards and Steam Achievements, which this version of Half-Life, sadly, does not.Here's a link to Black Mesa, which is far worthier of your time:It has since come to my attention that the final levels are still not available in Black Mesa.  That was my mistake and I own that.  I still dislike this version of Half-Life.  If you REALLY want to experience the original Half-Life, I would say play the original game sans port.			"

												Half-Life is fantastic, but Half-Life: Source is far from a remaster. Whilst rag-dolls and improved water are nice, drawbacks like incorrect lighting in many areas, unnecessary reflections on weapons/models, and various source engine related bugs; it leaves a lot to be desired in a so-called remaster. That's not even taking into account the long loading times that weren't present in the GoldSrc version. Perhaps the only real benefit of Source is proper widescreen, but if you're like me you'll prefer playing Half-Life in 4:3 as originally intended. To summarise just play the GoldSrc version of Half-Life.			"

												I don't have any idea what Valve was thinking when developing this version of Half Life, because, aside from the improved textures, they didn't put any real effort into this piece of software at all. As this game should rather be seen as an improvement of the original game than a real remake, I'm not able to recommend it. It's terribly glitched and I sometimes got the impression that it wasn't even tested properly. (Scientists floating above their chairs, messed up AI, broken hitboxes on some bosses, etc.)If you want the original Half Life touch, play the old Goldsource version.If you want to play a remake that improves gameplay mechanics and the overall appearance, check out Black Mesa.

In retrospect, it's not perfect - there's a few points where you really struggle to find the best way forward  and a few levels drag more than they should, but otherwise, well, this is Half-Life, the thinking man's shooter.  The formula wasn't perfected until HL2, but this version shares it's gene pool, and that should be enough for most.			"

												Half-LIfe: Source is a, ehem, ""remake"" of Half-Life 1, which in this case means ""we took HL1 recources and transfered them off GoldSrc engine to Source Engine"". And yes, it contains single-player campaign of HL1... DeathMatch portion was released serapately later. Though now that you can only purchase bundle of Source with DM, it doesn't matter much. Yes, it comes with HD models from Blue Shift bundledSo, what remake brought? Nothing major. Just small things here and there. First, default things from engine changes - dynamic shadows from flashlight that HL2 Episode 2 brought into engine, for example. There is more of metallic reflective textures, that look ugly in the darkness. The water was changed into HL2 style one... Means more transperency yet the rippling animation was removed. Enemies don't have death animations anymore - they use ragdoll... Which sometimes looks clunky with low-polygon monsters. There are even occasional decoration object that now uses physics, like hooked boxes. And you don't throw boxes away over the hills when you try to move box sideways. At least it all comes along with HD Models pack from Blue Shift.One of the non-graphics changes got to be improved AI, which I also think came. NPCs always react finely, while in original they would often first turn around slowly to face the threat. Security officers that follow you don't get lost as easily, you can even forget about babysitting them. And where in original they had ""shoot at some aliens"" as high priority, ""follow the player"" seems to be higher one in this remake... Which means that they will not shoot a thing if they will be busy following strafing player. Guards are better at guard duty, yep. On one of the notes, flying enemy with huge brain in final parts of games is now more aggresive, attempting to get into your face, all the time!Some of the damage values were changed. The biggest example got to be clowbar, it got buffed... Now, just like in HL2, it takes only one hit of this tool to bring down Headcrabs and Barnacles.Some of small bugs in HL1 were fixed, some new small bugs were added. Oh yea, and music stops when you go to the next area. But overall, original is safer bet as mods for HL1 will work with original, not Source remake. But Source one isn't bad either. Much better looking today, at 2014 year thanks to engine updates, while at time of release it didn't look like it added much.Deathmatch multiplayer part of remake was released after single-player part and comes by default with bundle on Steam... But let's just say, it's dead and not worth checking out.P.S. I approve ability to start at any chapter, easier to pick up.			"

												Its like when you use converter on an audio file, but this time, it was done on a game. Gold src > Source. Water is now beautiful, but it doesn't fit this game anymore. Almost everything is the same, as it was in the original.  Some bugs disappeared, new ones appeared. Textures are pretty much the same. Models are better, but it's still the same pretty much. No new content of course. If you own the original Half life, then this might give you a bit different view on it, but Black Mesa looks much better, because they completely remade the Half life story using the Source engine.If you don't own the original Half life, then avoid this one.

IDK if it is original bugs or new bugs but with out noclip I don't know how I'd get through some of the areas.  Oh, the vent is half an inch too short to just walk through but an inch too high off the ground to just crawl through.  But still, enjoying the some what updated graphics and ragdoll physics.  Just started tonight and played through to Blast Pit before deciding it was time for bed.But other than the few times I needed noclip, the game is as good as ever and makes me want to buy BS and OF and then move through HL2, E1, and E2 all over again on my next day off.  I would say get this game if you love the series but if are new, maybe stick to HL2?  Some will whine the graphics aren't amazing, and I do miss the gravity gun(Best gun in any game ever) but this classic is classic for a reason!			"

												Hello Fellow Physicists,Half-Life, ah, one of my favorite game! I love Half-Life! The story is one of the best stories of a video game that has ever been created! The graphics may not be the best, but for the time that it was released, they were ground-breaking! Playing as Gordon Freeman during what's supposed to be the greatest scientific discovery of all time when things go haywire, what isn't there to love? This game leads to an even greater sequel, so it's most definitely a must play in order to get a true feel as to what is happening in Half-Life 2, and hopefully one day, Half-Life 3! It's a great game, and a must play for anyone who has played Half-Life 2 or any Valve games for that matter! I spent a lot of time on Half-Life on my old Playstation 2, and I still love the series today! Definitely worth the money!-Kyle James			"

												Half-Life: Source is the original Half-Life ported to the source engine. The source engine gives the game a slight graphical update, but it also causes some performance issues not present in the original game, such as longer loading times. It's also not entirely one to one with the original because of the source engine, but I still think it's overall faithful to the original game. Give it a try unless you can't dare to play anything other than the original version.			"

												Basically this is a version of the original Half-Life game with some updated graphics and the ability to pick what chapter you start on. Simple as that so the only real reason to get it is if you buy the Half-Life complete pack that includes this. Alternatively if you are just searching out a play through of Half-Life this is not a bad choice because you can play it with better graphics.  "

												Northing much to say which hasn't been said before. While this updates HL to the Source engine, I was left unimpressed. Some things were prettier but some gameplay changes had been made which, in my opinion, negatively affect the game. Graphical glitches (neither which happened playing the original HL or HL2) and the speed of movement are my two biggest complaints. That said, if you've never played HL before, this isn't a bad way to do it. It's in my Library and I'll not complain but I will be playing the original port when I do it again.			"

												Dear valve, Please fix the issue where music starts playing, then the source engine decides to load a new section of the map 2 second later, stopping the music before you can even get into it. This issue really takes you out of the game, and its an issue with both the source versions of the originals, as well as 2 and its episodes [though thankfully not as badly - the most notable time being the Water Hazard mission, where again, the music barely starts playing before it is cut off by a load screen]. This is the best franchise in gaming history and I hate that this one little issue messes things up. =( Even though the graphics are slightly more dated, people are better off playing the original version of halflife, which is a sad thing to have to say.-Faithfully, Concerned Citizen-			"

												I like Half Life. It is one of my all time favourite FPS games. I believe it is because of Half Life why I really came to like this genre. I have been collecting FPS games ever since. I hate its Source conversion. Why? Because it is not a full conversion but simply an enhanced version with the Source engine's features. You have better water effects and you also have better shaders, lighting, shadows, etc.But essentially, it is the same as the vanilla version was. If you do not use high-res textures in a room then using modern water effects makes the game look strange. You can easily see how these things cannot work together.Black Mesa is a much better way to relive the experience Half Life gave us 15 years ago. It is a total conversion of Half Life and what is more important: it is free. Download and install that one or simply reinstall the vanilla game again.			"

												For the record, my review of Half Life: Source can be applied to the original version of the game, except for a few asects that I touch upon regarding its transition to the Source Engine.By now, PC gamers everywhere have grasped full comprehension of Half Life. This monument of the videogame medium as a whole was VALVe Software's very first product; one that was by no means easy to produce, but was eternally rewarding. Half Life is still being played today and enjoyed by many people, and deservedly so. For it is one of those titles in videogame history that is recognized by many; even those who might have very little experience with the franchise or its modded stand-alone offsprings.Half Life puts the player in the shoes and HEV mark IV Protective System of everyone's favorite mute, crowbar-wielding, monster-slaying, marine-fighting theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman. The plot takes a humble beginning, as Gordon arrives to work--late--and prepares for what seems like a regular day at the Black Mesa Research Facility in the underground desert landscape of New Mexico. Perhaps a regular day, if not for the ""deviation from standard analysis procedure."" The player is let loose to briefly explore parts of the facility, allowing for a brief settlement before the experiment you are taking part of goes horribly wrong and all of a sudden that elevator you rode is out of order, that corridor you walked through is now covered in blood. That security  guard you talked to is trying to revive a scientist you had just run into 5 minutes ago, and that other scientist you talked to has turned into some weird mutant that is now walking towards you, though no longer with any interests of making small talk. Everything that the player had seen and gotten used to is now part of a horrific thrill ride; one that is action packed and will only get better from there.The game's story telling is absolutely fanstastic. It delivers a truly immersive experience by never leaving the first person perspective of the player and Dr. Freeman. It sacrifices cutscenes and cinematic mumbo-jumbo for first-hand experiences and uninterrupted gameplay. Said gameplay is very satisfying. There is a very good mix of firefights of varying intensity combined with puzzles and first person platforming. The puzzles can be a tad difficult at times, but just the right kind of difficulty to encourage perseverance and reward the player for their astuteness. Firefights are also quite fun; you start out making your way through waves of hostile inter-dimensional beings and later on fight none other than the few, the proud, the Marines, who pose quite an intimidating threat. The Marines really shine in the AI department, they're aggressive but smart enough to know when to retrieve. They have a sense of personal preservation unlike anything I have ever seen in any other videogame. They will try their hardest to kill Gordon, using any tools at their disposal, but they don't want to die, and will thus will make effective use of cover and defensive tactics. I would highly recommend purchasing the Source version of Half Life due to some added features such as much better particle effects, improved lighting and water effects, as well as the intergrated ragdoll physics. Those not interested in such added details could easily overlook the Source version and buy vanilla Half Life, seeing as how it is the same price on Steam as the Source version, but I would highly recommend getting this version for those who haven't experienced Half Life and are looking to get into it.You musn't dare call yourself a fan of Half Life or VALVe if you haven't played this game. Experience the original tale of a theoretical physicist trying to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility, perfectly remastered into VALVe's state of the art Source engine. It's a game you will not regreat putting your time and money into			"

												This is an epic game. If you consider yourself a true gamer, a gamer, or just someone who likes games, this goes without saying: Get this game. For the sake of this being considered a 'review' (not a bath of game-praise), I will give a slight reviewish thing.An epic game, with a satisfying-length story line, pretty good puzzles/obstacles, and also a pretty good fighting/shooting graphics and sound set. Keep in mind that I'm not going to say that much of anything is 'great', as this game is from a decade and a half ago. The regular graphics are ahead of their time (though not up to all modern standards), and the regular sound is good. This game is rated M (17+), but I've found it more to be a 13+ game since the graphics/blood/fighting is generally realistic, but is still old enough that it isn't in the ""this is disturbing I just shot this guy and blood exploded everywhere"" section. The aliens (enemies) in this game are generally unrealistic, and their blood isn't even red (more of a yellow-green hue), and the soldiers (humans, but still enemies) that you have to fight are, for the most part, completely covered in military armor and it's almost nothing like shooting another human. However, you are able to shoot allies (humans) as well, and if you do it's the same effect as the soldiers (blood flies lightly onto the nearest obstruction, character falls over, possibly shouts/groans in pain).That's pretty much all I've got. The jist of this review is: GO BUY THIS GAME. Okay? Good. Now leave me alone. ;)			"

												The port of Half-Life for Source engine. Unfortunately they just shipped the game to source, not giving a damn about upgrading graphics, for instances. So it's copy past Half-Life on a better engine. Nothing much here. Check Half-Life reviews and you'll know if you want to play this. Short version of my review is, if you want to know Half-Life's story, you MUST PLAY THIS GAME. If you want a challenge, PLAY IT. If you like long games, PLAY IT. Overall, YOU MUST PLAY IT if you like FPS games. 11/10 played it again 3 times already			"

												I do not understand the critisiams that this port has recieved. Scrolling down to the comments section, it shows that people are butt-hurt about a '♥♥♥♥♥♥ port of the origanal' and plenty saying to 'buy the gold source version'. I think that these reviews are unjust. Now before clarifing, I have not purchased or ever played the origanal game. That said, HALF LIFE SOUCE is one of my favourite games of all time. Now people may be salty at me because I have never played the very first valve game, but the hatred towards it is that people have encounted lots of glitches. I however, have encounted none whatsoever in the many hours of playing. To clarify, I dont have a great PC. It has a crap Intel HD graphics, 8GB of RAM and a Intel Core i3. After second reviewing, I have found that the negative 'buy the origanal 1998 version' fanboys are from the last 30 days. I hope to counteract this, as I think it its embarressing to see one of my favouite games be downranked by meer mortals that don't know what a better version of a game is if they saw it. Because this game fixes,1: Better Models (Player Arms, Guns, Enemies, with only a few odd looking textures here and there that are bearable)2: Source intergration (You can play the maps in Garry's Mod and can play Half Life 2 levels if you know the console commands)And before people complain for me to get the origanal, I'd rather get Black Mesa than even attempting to play a game still stuck in 1998			"

												I am recomending it for being a neatly upgraded version of Half-Life. By Upgraded, I mean that the water is very pretty. Despite my recomendation, I did encounter a few glitches. In the conveyor belt area, the graphics were popping around so badly, I could not see where I was going. There was also a game breaking glitch where I could not progress past a door and it forced me to cheat to get past the problem. Keep that in mind, if you buy it. But remember! Pretty water...			"

												Very immersive game. All sequences and character interactions happen in game and in real time. Creepy atmosphere and enemies. There are no major gaps in between areas, everything is sequential so you feel as if you're actually exploring throughout the entire game. Wide variety of weapons, alien weapons are inventive and unique. Puzzles are clever but platforming is clumsy. Long campaign for an fps. There's very little to the story, but the events that do occur are dramatic and keep you interested. Exploration is rewarded with secret areas that provide you with health, armor and ammo. Really solid old school fps and the start of a historic franchise. Deffiently worth it if youre looking for a unique fps. 8.0/10			"

												Half-Life 2 may be a timeless classic, but the 1998 original needed a bit of a re-surfacing to hold up in a modern gaming environment. Half-Life: Source is the entire original game running on top of Valve's ""Source"" game engine. This gives the game much better lighting, physics and overall gameplay.Strangely, though, it does NOT include the higher(er) resolution textures and models update rolled-out by Valve and Gearbox as part of the release of Blue Shift. Without it, it's the same low-res graphics through Source-colored glasses.Fortunately a third-party has adapted the update for use in Half-Life: Source. I highly recommend downloading it to make this the definitive version of Half-Life. http://hds.newmail.ru/eng_download.html "

												Half-Life is one of the best and most influential fps games of the last few decades, and I think most would agree. Half-Life: Source is an update using Valve's source engine. While it's mostly the same, from level design, weapons, ect. there are minor differences such as updated water, better lighting and ragdolls. But this version has a lot more bugs than it's Goldsrc counterpart. Some that i came across were a floating scientist in the Anomalous Materials chapter, invisible barnacle tongues and the tentacle in Blast Pit not doing any damage (although that might not be a bug as I've heard that it was severely nerfed and can barely hit you). As for which version you should get for a first time player, it's kind of a toss-up. On one hand, Source looks slightly better, can be played in widescreen and has the updated water/lighting, but the original has much less bugs and has many more mods. It's really just up to you which you want. If you already have the original, though, there's not enough of anything new to justify a purchase. If you want a true source remake from the ground up, then buy BlackMesa.			"

												Bought the complete Pack for $10 during the Winter Sale. A pretty good game, in my opinion. Graphics arent great at all considering the games we have today, but graphics dont entirely make a game. The story was pretty good. This game doesnt focus on just running around, killing everyone, completing the objective and moving on to the next stage. It has a good amount of jumping puzzles and scenarios that make you think about how to advance to the next chapter. I will admit i was stuck on the end boss for about a  good 30 minutes before i realized what i had to do. The end of the game definitely left unanswered questions. I will most definitely be playing the whole series. Overall, Half-Life was a good, fun game.			"

												Half-Life Source is a great idea on paper. A complete remake of the original Half-Life but in the Source engine with all the technological and graphical improvements that would bring. It is something a lot of us fans of the original would love to see. Unfortunately that is simply not what happened here.Half-Life Source only barely qualifies as being a port. They didn't change or upgrade anything, everything looks and feels the same and the only way you can tell it's a Source game is by looking at the game name.Graphics, animations, physics. Nothing has been improved to what Source is capable of. It is Half-Life running in Source sure, but if you can't tell the difference does it really matter?It is a great disappointment and a huge waste of money. If I had lost my copy of Half-Life back in the day I would have gladly shelled out the cash for a new copy so I could keep playing. But this isn't back in the day and this isn't the right Half-Life.

There's really nothing different between this and the original 1998 Half-Life besides Realistic Water and a new Physics engine. Infact this game doesn't really ""Enhance"" it at all. You could think of it as worse considering the amount of Bugs this game has and the fact that the recent Steam-Pipe update ruined everything and messed up the Shiny Shaders.

												Half-Life: SourceRun, Think, Shoot, Live.Developed by Valve and released in 1998, Half-Life was at the time considered the finest first person shooter (fps) of its generation and still remains today one of the best games of all time. After the release of Valves Source engine, like many other of their games, they decided to port Half-Life to it, updating some graphics, fixing bugs and introducing new gun models. When a mysterious alien artifact is tested at the Black Mesa Research Facility, a Resonance Cascade occurs ripping holes in the fabric of space and allowing aliens from another dimension to pass through to Earth. Awaking in the test chamber Dr. Gordon Freeman must fight his way through Headcrabs, Bullsquids and the powerful Vortigaunts as well as the U.S. Army who has been sent dispose of the Aliens and witnesses. Half-Life’s plot, although not readily apparent, is extremely complex and dense. It does explain clearly why you need to go from point A to B, however the backstory can be very confusing and still, some of it, remains unresolved to this day. It’s this complexity and mysteriousness that makes the game so much more effective.  Gameplay is one amazing aspect in Half-Life. Being both a puzzle game and an fps, Valve has equality weighted these two genres with lots of little puzzles throughout the game, some hard and some not, as well as lots of fun alien and solider blasting in-between with a large range of cool weapons. Your signature weapon that is now an iconic symbol for the Half-Life franchise is your crowbar, which although not as lethal as a rocket launcher or crossbow, is useful to complete small task like breaking a window or ventilation shaft casing. The soundtracks in this game always suit the environment and never fail to add to or significantly change the atmosphere of some scenes. The soundtracks consisting of electrical and techno sounds go extremely well with the chapters played in the border world Xen, The creepy number played at the start of the game while in the tram, blew the suspense factors through the roof and nothing goes better with the satisfactory of completing Half-Life than the iconic end credit soundtrack. Unfortunately, after most of the “feel good” soundtracks start you will pass a checkpoint that will que the next sequence and stop the song. The level design in this game is truly ahead of its time. There is not only significant attention to detail and lots of optional interactivity with the environment, but the game is constantly catching you off guard with jump scares from Headcrabs or collapsing bridges. What contributes to the level design more than anything are the elite graphics. In particular the water in various levels is amazing and hasn’t gotten much better in modern games nearly 20 years later. Overall this game is an artwork. The storyline is great and only gets better in later games, the gameplay is exciting and fun and the game is made exceedingly better with the incredible soundtracks, level design and graphics. I would recommend this game to anyone but in particular fps gamers as it is a classic and arguably one of the best fps’ of all time.

The second time I started it up, the models were the same as the original the only difference to the game is just better textures and lighting (somewhat better). I have no idea what thats about or if anyone else is having this problem. Really the only thing that keeps me playing it is that you can turn on fast sitch weapons which is like really awesome.

												Half Life 1, one of Valve's first games to come to the Source engine.Common question I get asked, what's the difference between the ""source"" and ""non-source"" versions?Really, not a whole lot. Textures look the same, lighting, story, all that. Only things that you will be able to pick out is that the puzzles towards the end are wired differently. This is why I would have someone play the Source version over the goldsource one.Should you play it? Yes.Do you have to play this to call yourself a PC gamer? Yes.Is it really required or a ""must play""? No.Many people would not be able to deal with the graphics, puzzles and ""lack of heart pounding action"". Sad to see people turn a title down due to those reasons.Speaking of graphics, you should be able to run this without problems. If you can't, get rid of Steam.

												Very immersive game. All sequences and character interactions happen in game and in real time. Creepy atmosphere and enemies. There are no major gaps in between areas, everything is sequential so you feel as if you're actually exploring throughout the entire game. Wide variety of weapons, alien weapons are inventive and unique. Puzzles are clever but platforming is clumsy. Long campaign for an fps. There's very little to the story, but the events that do occur are dramatic and keep you interested. Exploration is rewarded with secret areas that provide you with health, armor and ammo. Really solid old school fps and the start of a historic franchise. Deffiently worth it if youre looking for a unique fps. 8.0/10			"

Half-Life: Prettier Twin SisterPros: Classic, Dialogue, Gameplay, GraphicsCons: PlatformingOriginally released in 1998, Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre, winning award after award.  The narrative within evolved as allies and enemies would spout little tidbits about the calm, quiet protagonist.  Gritty and realistic, gameplay involved a myriad of enemies and traps.  Although a completely linear game, the setting varied from huge desert cliffs to claustrophobic air vents.At the time, most games heavily involved platforming and Half-Life was no exception.  Small annoyances can still be found, for example, trying to move along some ladders.  Younger crowds might find the graphics outdated and clunky.  But these faults are fairly insignificant for a game published more than a decade ago.A classic, revolutionary title that all FPS fans, serious gamers, and appreciative players should own.10/10			"

The storyline is great, variety of weaponry, level designs are confusing at times, and it has its fair share of jumpscares here and there. for a game back in its time this is a game i would highly recommend for anyone wanting to get into half life and some of the mods that came from it			"

												Half-Life was a game that was released in 1998 which was very old by today's graphic standards, but very great at it's time. Needing only a 500 MHz processor and a 16MB Direct 3D card this game was very much playable today, but since source came out (2004) the game's graphics engine was updated causing a 1.2 GHz Processor and a 64MB video card uping up the graphics, but still being beat by Half-Life 2's graphics later in the year.Gameplay:     The gameplay was very long and hours, even days to complete this 19 chaptered game in order to have the full experience, but I'm not going to tell what happens in the story like Half-Life 2's review because I'd ruin the story.     The enimies are harder in this game than Half-Life 2, but it's still able to be beat, but you will need to stratigize to beat this without taking tons of damage to yourself.Rating:     The final rating was 9.5/10 because it could've been less time consuming, but the story really counters that con anyways.Up next in reviews by Dead Kitty: Half-Life 2: Episode One			"

												On a scale of 1/10 i would give this game about 6/10 stars.The reason of that rateing is because the pros of this game is that it has some very very neet grapics not state of the art but it feels nice ,the move ments and controls are nice , it has stratigy obsticals allies and enemies , some enemies are tough to kill witch gives this game to the good battle point and feel , and some of the weps used in the game are nice as well,and it seems like its one of the first fps games with good grapics. but the cons of this game is that the grapics are kinda rusty kinda blobby ish and the obsticals are kinda hard to get through (but through this review i really dont care about its grapics to me its about the story line and through out the game it had a really nice story line on war and how or if like a an apocoliptic sanerio were to happen the story of a orange armored man known as the freeman comes and save the world so its not about grapics its about the story.....well to me and if your one of those people i recomend this game even if 6/10 geranted)so yeah i recommend this game if u want an over all good battle expereince or story line (btw sorry for grammer...i suk)			"

												Half-Life Source: It's Half-Life 1 with the source engine. HL1 is my most favorite game if all time. I like it better than HL2. I'm really happy they brought it to the source engine. It has some few minor problems. It crashes every once in a while. Sometimes, some graphics don't load. Despite those minor little issues, which happen rarely for me, the game is very nice and plays smoothly. I like playing HL1 on the source engine more than the original. It has better physics and fixes some problems with the original. Worth the money! Has a great, in depth story, awesome guns, great settings, awesome enemies, and the best protagonist of all time, Gordon Freeman. 10/10 Would crowbar headcrabs again!			"

												Half Life is a classic game, enjoyed by many in it's time, and even now. This however, is not exactly the original game, but more of a remake, built in the Source engine. In my review of the game I'm going to sum the whole game up, with an honest review on it's ups and downs - so let's get right into it.So let's start of with the storyline of the game. You stard of as a newly graduated Gordon Freeman on his way to work at the Black Mesa research facility. When you get to work, you have to get into a test chamber, where they are putting some kind of crystal onto a laser, but something goes wrong. The crystal messes with time and space and opens a portal to another dimension called Xen, through this portal, alien beings wreck havock in the facility. In the mean time the government here's of this, and decides not to help, but to kill everyone and everything involved. Nowadays, this story seems pretty generic, and is used in practically every sci-fi movie ever made, but this was made in 1998. Even still, I do think it was a bit lazy, but was a fun and exciting story nevertheless. The game includes many strategy based puzzles, and most things were very challenging, and some points I had to watch a YouTube tutorial on how on earth to complete parts. These puzzles were slightly annoying though at times, such as when the tram in 'On a Rail' and the conveyorbelts in 'Residue Processing'. Despite this, you always feel a sence of achievement after completing them, which is great.The original Half Life was a game that was made in 1998, and the graphics, while not horrible, are not great. This Source remake version was made in 2004, and the graphics are slightly improved, but I don't really think it matters which game you decide to play. I do think that the Source version however, was not ported over very well, as there were many scripted events that were broken, such as a security guard dying and so on. Also on the chapter, 'Residue Processing' which jumping from platform to platform, the screen will randomly show yellow, red and black splatters of colour across the screen, (see screenshot on my profile) which made the level almost impossible. Overall, I found this a great game to play, it was verey enjoyable, but extremely annoying and painful in certain chapters. I am going to give it a 7/10, purely because there was a lot of stuff that was broken, but aside from that I would reccomend you play it.			"

												Excellent buildup to Half Life 2. TBH, I would recommend you buy the Half Life complete, and not the games individually. You'll save a ton of money, and on sale it's fairly cheap.The story is excellent, the game is a bit on the hard side. There were points in the game that I had to beat without getting hurt once, because I had ~3hp. In one section, I had to clear out  about 12 soldiers and a tank  to get to the next area. It's really good. Sometimes a headcrab would pop out at me and give me a jumpscare.The source version is buggier than goldsrc Half Life, So I recommend Half life more. (non-source)7/10			"

												This game was on my wishlist ever since I played the original Half Life, because I thought ""Hey, Half Life with better graphics and physics? Yes please!"". At that point, I had already played Black Mesa, the fan-made mod for HL2 which is essentially Half Life with better graphics, better than this even!Anyway, the Negatives:- I had some graphical issues related to the factory levels with the conveyor belts, when I turned my flashlight on and look at water, the whole screen would mess up- Gonarch at two points refused to move, meaning I had to skip the entire chapter (but I could do that easily via the menu, I didn't need to use commands!)- Even enemies refused to move sometimes- Xen in general was pretty broken and messy, so if that's your favorite chapter, be warned!- You can't gib ragdolls by hitting them anymore, nor can you move them around like in Half Life 2The Positives:+ The graphics and physics are really nice, everything feels more real than the original+ Destroying shelves and boxes and whatnot is way better and more fun+ The Flashlight was improved a LOT, as well as lighting+ Unlike Black Mesa, all the levels were exactly the same and the enemies behaved the same way as they did in HL1+ The Menu was improved a lot, as well as saving and loading and the whole GUI+ Movement is still the same, but it felt smoother to me and less clunky than in HL1All in all, I'd only recommend this game if you have played Half Life 1 already and want to play it with slightly better graphics. I wouldn't recommend it over Black Mesa if you want a Half Life game JUST for the graphics, only if you prefer the gameplay and feel of the old game and want to see it with a slight twist!If Half-Life 1 was a 96/100, I'd give this game a 88/100!

												Unless you have Garry's Mod and want to play around with HL1 stuff, don't get this version of the game. It's just HL1 in a different engine with very minimal graphical upgrades that don't really fit with the old graphics in my opinion. And if that wasn't mediocre enough, it's filled with bugs. So, unless you enjoy getting seizures from graphical errors and like to watch scientists as they magically float above their chairs, get the regular GoldSrc version instead.			"

												Don’t get me wrong Half-Life is an amazing game, a masterpiece in fact that really stands the test of time. However I cannot in good faith recommend this version of the game. Considering this is supposed to be a remade version of the original game it has too many bugs to make it worth a buy. Now these are not bugs from the original game that they just didn’t fix, the game introduces NEW bugs and glitches. While I myself have never experienced anything game breaking or crashes (although I have heard of it happening). I must ask you what's the point in getting it if it's just worse than the original? Not to mention you're missing out on the huge mod scene of the original game.			"

												So why would I write a review for a game that's been out for like over 10 years and that is one of the greatest games on Steam? Well because I wanted to, but all other things aside this game is a great game hands down. Now I know it is a remake of Half-Life on the Source engine so it does do things a little bit differently sometimes from the original game. But the original game in a nutshell is basically that you are a scientist named Gordon Freeman on a project doing with specimens from a dimension called ""Xen"". You arrive at work late one day to test a rather unstable specimen, causing a sort of bridge between the dimensions of our world and Xen. You must fight through these monsters that teleports through this bridge and find out whats causing this catastrophic event. You must also fight the military who are trying their best to quiet this event by killing all of the monsters and the faculty of Black Mesa. Shooting is very satisfying in this game and it goes by the traditional ""You are Hulk ♥♥♥♥ing Hogan and you can put 20 guns in your pockets"". Which means you can carry stuff like pistols, smgs to rocket launchers and alien weapon things. Overall I give this game atleast 9.5/10 in my book. (If it was IGN I would give it a 20/10)			"

												Half-Life Source is a slightly enhanced version of the 1998 classic. This supposed remake retains most of the original game's textures, models and animation but favours towards the better world effects available from the new Source engine of the time. Half-Life Source has a Havoc powered physics engine with enemies and objects obeying Newton's three laws, picture-quality water reflections and expanded scenary - now built as geometry rather than painted on backdrops. Also, the sound and presenetation now borrows heavily from Half-Life 2.My opinion of Half-Life Source is rather mixed, befuddled even. HL: Source feels very sloppily put together and thrown over. Valve could of and should of done a complete overhaul of the game. It's lukewarm reception from the many alienated players of the game led to the creation of Black Mesa Source, a total conversion set to unofficially reimagine the first game on the source engine. I implore you to wait for it instead. Otherwise, buy the original.			"

												Half life. One of the original games that almost every PC gamer has heard of or played. Half life puts you in the shoes of a scientist from black mesa. Gordan Freeman. A experiment goes horribly wrong and causes a ""Ressonance Cascade"" (not sure if i spelled it right) which allows aliens from another world (dimension or universe) to come to earth. The complex goes wacky and communications are out. Troops from the surface are coming down to rescue, as the science team says, but they plan to kill everyone who was involved.You must fight the troops and aliens, and make your way through their homeworld to defeat Nihilanth that controlls everything. Once Nihilanth has been defeated, all the vorticaunts and aliens are free. Gman then teleports you and gives you an offer. Work with him. Or be teleported to thousands of aliens and be slaughtered with the text that says. ""You Died"" You choose to work with him.On to Half Life 2...Pros:A classic CLASSIC game that every PC gamer should play.An amazing storyline that features some of the best moments in gaming history.Made by Valve.Cons:You havent bought it yet.Its a upgraded source code that's a little broken. Sometimes there are glitches but I havent come across any or crashes.10/10The. Best. Game. In. History			"

												HL:S doesn't offer much from the original HL beside the engine: ragdolls, water reflections and HDR support, but other than that, it's pretty bare. There is absolutely no new content, and many textures, models and maps are broken compared to the less-but-still broken version of the original Half-Life on Steam. If you want to only focus on the single player campaign, I suggest purchasing a disc copy of Half-Life online. However, if you want to jump in to a multiplayer server, purchase HL1 from steam, as HLS has a very dead multiplayer community. I think that the only upside of purchasing this is the ability to use its content in Garry's Mod. I am not a hater of HL, but this is a very bad buy.			"

Also half life mods wont support this, so you should get the original half life instead. You won't regret it.In short, this is a nearly direct port. Buying this for Garry's Mod might not even be worth it if you want all of those models. Look out for a sale.			"

												TLDR: Great game, dated graphics, horrible bugs/glitches in this version. I recommend playing the original.The benefits in this version are mostly water effects, slight lightning improvements, enemy ragdolling and easier object pulling/pushing. Most of the disadvantages are listed below.The story is simple and the game's got many weird elements compared to the current FPS's, but it's still a great game and a classic. Looks like it takes like 9 hours to complete when you loot every place, but know where to go and what to do.To list a of a few really annoying or game breaking things, many compared to original Half-Life:-HITBOX/HIT REGISTERING PROBLEMS!    -The blast pit monster doesn't do damage to you or the security guard who's supposed to die.    -The leeches have almost non existent hitbox.    -The helicopter doesn't seem to register hits from gauss or RPG (didn't get it to even smoke).    -The gonarch or whatever has a crappy hit registering.    -The final boss has a crappy hitbox (I have beaten him in normal half-life with hard difficulty many times and this was 5 times harder in easy difficulty)-HORRIBLE VISUAL ARTIFACTS in ""residue processing"" and somewhere else too.-NPCs go ""YAARRG"" every 0.5 seconds if they are damaged.-The crowbar makes a metal hitting sound when you hit any object and so gets really irritating when destroying boxes.-The boxes take more time to break with crowbar, which adds to the previous annoyance.-You jump higher than you should (IE You can jump crouch straight on top of a box in the laser tripmine building)-The barnacles lower their tongue really slowly, but they can catch you when their tongue isn't lowered yet. This leads to some funny scary moments though.-Missing dialog/AI problems.And if you're new to Half-Life (and don't know whats supposed to happen or where to go):-You can jump crouch above one vent in ""we've got hostiles"" vent maze section, get behind a fence and get stuck in an area you've been before (your auto saves will get replaced by the being stuck ones too).-You see only blackness through the dam turbines, which has lead people to think it's not the right way and get stuck.-You can shoot the scientist through the glass in ""apprehension"" and the game doesn't end, so you can't get the door open.-The missing dialog/AI problems can really confuse you.If you're hard-core and want the authentic Half-Life experience, buy the cds and patch the game to 1.1.1.0, cause the steam ""original"" version is bugged in many ways too nowadays. I would actually say that this Source version has better working AI in general than the other steam version.			"

												As of today 2/27 this game is weird. It seems buggy as heckI dont really understand, from what Im reading the game was fine when it came out? But now its near completely broken I think. There are glitches EVERYWHERE and other weird going ons. I don't really understand how Valve could have broken so much in this game with updates?Technically speaking there are supposed to be very little changes, controls feel like you would expect in Source and are good and accurate when compared to how the old GoldSrc games control today which can take some getting used to but isn't bad. The way everything is rendered and shaders are diffrent, things look a bit more crisp but all models and textures are old. They actually look uglier to me than the standard HL1 non-hd models which I feel are the best to me visually. Ragdolls are added but thats really the only physics addition. Everything else from gibs to med packs uses the old HL1 physics where it simply falls or for gibs bounces and bounces. The water looks nice but does not fit in when everything around it looks cartoony. It ruins the dam scene for me atleast. Also they made some small changes in areas that I wasn't a huge fan of, mostly just looks related stuff and nothing big or something worth whining about. But of all the ports of HL1 I have played, which is only the PS2 and Source port, I like this one less. Atleast the PS2 version was objectively better than the original on PC when it came out in 2001. The orignal was released in '98. The Source port came out in 2004 and has none of the new content found in the PS2 version including the Coop expansion, Half Life Decay. I have not touched the Dreamcast version nor have I ever owned or played the Dreamcast aside from maybe one time at a family friends...maybe..its been probably near a decade since that. I also have not played the Linux or Mac ports but honestly I have no reason to ever want to us Mac OS. Linux is gaining ground though.Also the expansions are not present. Just basic Half Life 1.Present in this current version there is a huge problem with hit boxes on tanks, helicopters, and enemies of that type. The Gonarch also seemed to not take damage alot of the time when I was hitting it. Its just iffy and I want to say broken. Also with source some of the design decisions that were taken with Half Life 1 just seem awful. Vorts never missing even though it feels like your moving like Speedy Gonzalez just feels like bs and Xen still sucks. Yeah, Xen always sucks. I hate it so much until you get closer to the end and fight the nihlanth/final boss.But Half Life is still half life and its still fun. But this just isn't better in any way than the original aside from a few negligible graphics points. Black Mesa Source is what this game should have been, except for the fact that they did change alot of the game and removed some points and added others. This game should have just been Half Life but graphically updated with some small gameplay upgrades. Its just not what it should have been and falls short of the original.			"

												Now, I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs that I've read some other people complain about, but since I need to complain about SOMETHING, here is my review.Hitboxes: They normally work fine. Except the time I wasted 10 bullets shooting a barnacle realising they all go through it. Had the same problem with houndeyes during the Blast Pit chapter. The real problem was with the Apache helicopter during the Surface Tension chapter where most of my rockets seemed to go through it, so unless you're lucky or skilled enough to hit it in a specific spot, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.The AI was really ♥♥♥♥in' dumb in some situations. I'm not saying that it was perfect in the original GoldSrc version, but how did they manage to dumb it down?Also, some textures and sound files were missing.tl;dr - Stick with the GoldSrc version.

												There's no doubth that this game is a classic, i remember playing it back in the 90's when it was just getting popular, magazines and gamers all across the globe were praysing Half Life for basically everything that could've been considered ""good"" in a game. Whether it was or not the gem that people claim even to this day to be, Half Life hasn't aged very well. The problem ironically doesn't last on it's graphics or even voice acting, the problem with Half Life it's it's game design, playing through the popular mod ""Black Mesa"" I can assure you that each and every single problem was solved on my part, the game was incredible, it had fantastic set pieces that played across perfectly as you played through the game having fun and confort all together, but this classic is just invaded with problems such as bad controls, difficult platforming, ""sluggish shooting"", and so on. Maybe you can get some enjoyment here and there if difficult first person platforming goes well with you, as it for me, it just tends to give me a headache.			"

Valve published it, this is *the* valve brand, I bought it on steam and I expected it to work. I didn't even get to do any gameplay, before I was fuming. During the car ride in the beginning alone the game had to stop and load (!) four times! When I finally got out it had to load around every third corner. Don't make me laugh and say it's my rig. I live in the year 2014 and I expect a game from 1998 (or even 2004) to work properly and without loading every 30seconds!			"

On the other hand it's filled with new sorts of bugs that would happen from time to time, nothing game breaking, just be prepared to encounter dumb A.I. and issues with the hit detection here and there (not sure if that was in the original Half-Life as well due to me not encountering any of this sort in my original playthrough.To sum it all up, it's just a prettier, faster and more polished experience. If you have the original Half-Life just stick to that.If you find Half-Life: Source on a discount, it's worth it, otherwise, just get the original as mentioned above.			"

This was, (and probably still is), Valve's Greatest Achievement. I speak for all the ports and versions,(Original 1998 Release)-Buggy-Classic Feeling(Source Version)-Physics Engine-Fixed Most 98 Bugs-Added More Bugs(Black Mesa)(I don't know much about)-Physics Engine-New Models +Textures-Female Scientists-Probably Moar Bugz(Playstation 2 Disc)-HD Pack Installed-No Physics Engine-Bugs Are Rare(There may be more that I don't know about)I Love The First Half-Life So Much, I Was Literally Gordon Freeman for Halloween Last year, (Looked more like a short mexican doctor with Gordon's nametag though).

A classic game that does not need introductions.This is a classic that defined its genre, and 16 years after its release is still very enjoyable.The ""source"" version of it is a reimplementation of the original game on Valve's then new engine and offers a slightly better graphic experience, although much of the visual artifacts have been left unchanged, with low-count polygons models and low-res textures.In terms of gameplay one has to think to how computers and games were back in 1998.  Seen with modern eyes some of the game mechanics are repetitive (especially towards the end, where increased difficult = more badass monsters from previous levels to kill), but again, if you are going to play this game now you should definitively approach it as a movie-goer would approach a black&white film from the 40's.

												I'm sure this game was amazing at the time the original Half-Life came out. However, by todays standards this game leaves much to be desired. While I enjoyed the story telling from the eyes of the main character ""Gordan Freeman"", I found the actual gameplay to be disappointing for the following reasons:1. Movement is far too sensitive. Gordan moves very quickly. This wouldn't be a major concern except that this game includes plenty of platforming elements and this over-sensitivity makes certain parts of the game as well as ladders annoying and frustrating. 2. NPC's act glitchy. They will repeat grunt/pain noises repeatedly even when they are no longer being harmed. I have even seen some get stuck running in place without any obstacle stopping them. Enemy AI can be abused.3. Sound. The sound for the starting gun and crowbar are overly loud while the sound for other weapons such as the assault rifle are nearly impossible to hear.It's an old game obviously, and it shows. By todays standards I cannot recommend this. I am only continuing for the story so I can start Half Life 2.			"

												The game is great: because it's the Half-Life we all know and love. However, recently Valve has been neglecting this versions as far as bug fixes go. The ported it to a new engine and now it's been riddled withe bugs (for some time now) and they have not yet fixed them. Go get the Goldsrc version or download Black Mesa.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥♥ all around. The graphics were worse than the original. The sky looked like one of Buckmister Fuller's geodesic domes. Using the flashlight in a tunnel resulted in strange planar artifacts that occluded the view. The final level never completed, even after the big boss was killed. It would have been better just to play the original.			"

												Having heard some good things about Half-Life, I finally purchased it one day. As a huge fan of FPS games, I wanted to like this game.Sadly, I didn't. At least not as much as other FPS games I've played, such as Doom, Quake and Unreal. Those games are better than this on many levels. For one, they didn't have annoying platforming with mechanics that just barely function. They also didn't include frustratingly difficult human enemies that drain your health from 100% down to 5%, sections where you had to run and jump through enemy hordes and traps because the game suddenly decided to not give you any ammunition, or areas you couldn't get out of if you happened to find yourself lost in them.Half-Life, on the other hand, did include all of those things, and those are the reasons why I only enjoyed it so much. While the game shines in its presentation, it falls short on its gameplay, at least for me. Unless you're into stuff of the aforementioned sort, I can't say I'd recommend Half-Life either.			"

												If you still have not played this game and intend to because you expect some greatness as what possibly hyped Half-Life 2 so much, you are going to find out that this is a huge waste of time, as I did. This game aged quite a lot, back when it was released it could be considered good due to having some puzzles, top-notch graphics, a different story, which is introduced with a lot of suspense but ends up simpler than when it began. But, if you have already read about it because you have already played Half-Life 2, you know everything you need to, and you would be very disappointed to find out that all the story details that made Half-Life 2 so great were not in fact introduced in Half-Life 1.Skip this game and play something that is more worth your time.

												Half-Life was an amazing game back in 1998. It's one of the few games that I remember playing, and completing during that time. I would recommend Half-Life to anyone who hasn't played it, but for those who have, it just doesn't hold up over time. It's just not the same as playing it back in the 90s. Then again, many things aren't.This source version of the game, doesn't do anything for me. The graphics are better, but that makes the game... ""less scary"". There is way too much lighting. Areas that used to be dark, and spooky, are now brightly lit, and the emenies aren't scary at all, because the newly done models, just don't have the same effect as the older, darker models.I remember nearly running from the room when the game originally came out, because it was just too scary. The new graphics, and brightly lit models, just put me to sleep.I find this source edition to be even less interesting, because it gives you instant access to every level in the game. So there is no challenge anymore. There is no reason to play the game from the start (there is no reason to save), because you can just pick any level you want, and start there. That might be fun for some people, but as soon as I saw that was an option, I was instantly turned off. Sure, this is an option, and you don't have to play it that way, but just due to the fact that the levels are all open, is a turn off for me.If you're looking for this game, because you think it's going to take you back to the 90s... Don't be surprised when it doesn't have that same effect.			"

												It's a garbo port. Simply put, they just redid some of the textures/water and called it a day, failing to account for how the small differences between Goldsrc and Source could completely change the game. Twice Source's slightly different jumping physics led to me ending up in areas of the levels that rendered them unwinnable (and not obviously unwinnable for a good 5-10 minutes, either), the first boss is completely broken and can't even hurt you, and the new soldier AI makes the soldiers go from ""reasonably difficult"" to ""lord help me I'm being swarmed and have nowhere to go"". In the end, a slight graphical touch-up just isn't worth dealing with the myriad of problems this port introduced.			"

												The game that rebirthed the FPS genre, launched a torrential downpour of mods from a dedicated fan community and pioneered new storytelling techniques in games. Admittedly, I only finished this game just recently, so without having any sort of nostalgic connection to it, I was not as spellbound by Half-Life as some gamers were when it was new. But I enjoyed myself all the same. It's a game drenched in atmosphere that manages to tell an amazing story with a sense of brevity unmatched by most modern AAA efforts. The dialogue is unintrusive and to the point, and the game focuses more on the environment and atmosphere to tell its story, much like games such as System Shock and Thief. It also manages to balance shooting, exploration and puzzling in a way that never feels stale or drawn-out. All in all, if you still haven't played Half-Life, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.			"

												Great game aside from terrible design elements.  It creates ways that no matter how good of a player you are you cannot just get past if you are on lowish health.  It forces you to save often for these such cases.  Examples of this are the dog room and CONSTANT FALL DAMAGE.  It is just silly to have a health check like that; no counter play.			"

												Bought this a couple of years ago, and wasn't impressed at all. Should have just bought the original Half Life. This is basically just the regular Half Life with ragdolls, and some better shaders. But the ragdolls suck because you can't gib them after they die like you could in the regular half life. It's a waste of time. If your looking for a Half Life 1 with better visuals, get Black Mesa, it's far better. Or just get the regular game and the expansion packs.			"

												essentially Half life but ported to the source engine (an outdated one though)the only thing it adds is source's lighting, water and ragdolling to some enemies (very crap ragdolls might I add)the ability to select chapters is a nice thing, but of course we made do with console commands etc.however this isn't enough to count as a remaster.as a matter a fact there is significantly less gore in this one than the originalmost of the sounds are just recycled from HL2.and last but not least because it doesn't use source 2013, the game doesn't function properly anymore.at least we have BlackMesa, now thats a remaster we want.

The game is a FPS, with the worst graphics (which was good at the time) is still so exciting, scary(the jump scares) and in the game, resources are limited which force you to conserve unlike the conventional games I've played. In the end, Half life shows how valve was good back in the days(not saying their other games suck). Go buy it and support Valve (lel)			"

												Half-Life: Source is half-baked and woefully in need of a hefty extra dash of Source. It's a shame. Pushed to pick my Desert Island PC game, I'd sadly set aside the likes of Deus Ex and Combat Mission in favour of the orginal Half-Life. It was an astonishing development in the art of video gaming and there's been nothing quite like it since in terms of story-telling flair, variety and visceral excitement.Applying ""Source technology"" to Half-Life should, therefore, have been a masterstroke.Sadly not. It looks barely any different.Here's what to do: forget Half-Life: Source, download the Black Mesa remake, and prepare to be astonished all over again...   "

												Well, actually, this game has a lot of issues. Really. Not just unrealistic things like in the original one. No. The big issues. For example,  the level Residue Processing has strange graphic glitches that can be fixed by switching off Multicore Rendering in video settings. I have some researches via Internet and found out that this is not only my problem. Also, tentacles, monsters from Xen, don't make any demage as they suppose to do. Guards and scientist after one hit scream randomly forever. I don't think that this is how it should be too. And these are not only mine too!!! Internet proofs it for me. Shadows of weapons are going through the table and so on. This is really annoying and bad remake. It could be better. It have to be fixed. But now it doesn't worth money at all. I used to think pretty nice about Valve's job, but this one made me kind of change my mind to worse.Edit: if you want to have fun with first Half-Life, play original version, not Source (I've completed original few times, I guess). I didn't check, but I don't think they've repaired it or will do it ever.			"

												How to start...Half life 2 is an AMAZING series and it really is a great series including Ep. 1 and 2 as well.Half Life on the other hand, in my opinion, is ridiculously convoluted and difficult for it's own good.I have spent hours, LITERALLY hours of my life trying to make this game function correctly. multiples upon multiples of times I have died the exact moment a loading screen comes up, the downside to this is that once those screens come up, it autosaves with no warning. This means, if you're like me anyway (Not saving every 5 seconds), you will lose ALL of your progress and have to restart. It is also extremely difficult to figure out the path you are meant to take to complete your task out of Black Mesa, this isn't exactly a downside as older games are all mostly like this and won't just hold your hand, which I am a fan of. Personally, I do not recommend playing this if you value your sanity and sleep, as you will be losing the entirety of both while you try to fight the game just to finish it.That being said, this game does add to the amazing story and universe of Half Life/Half Life 2 that we all love as well as the FPS mechanics are perfect and defined an era of games.I give Half Life a 4/10, it just doesn't hold up well at all and is rather dated			"

												Unlike the original Half-Life, which is in my opinion the best game of all time, Half-Life: Source is a buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ with broken AI, broken hitboxes, sentences.txt written by an intellectually disabled dead squirrel, broken weapon recoil, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ standard HL2 user interface, ear-♥♥♥♥ inducing SteamPipe save-load freezing which often results in the game crashing, poor optimization, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (optional) HD weapon models that look like they were ripped straight from Gamebanana in 2002, broken multicore rendering which causes strange graphical glitches in certain areas of the game and it uses the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ default Source 2K4 movement system and footstep sounds along with poorly implemented Half-Life 2 water textures and HL2 barrel models that don't fit with the rest of the game. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever compared to the original game and it should be removed from the Steam store because it's just the same game with more bugs and better water.			"

												Has NOT aged well... I really can't stand it. Yes, this game is important to history, so you should at least try it at some point, but I don't think it's worth anything anymore. At this point, it's a relic that represents a landmark in gaming history more than it is a game. My main gripes are its absolute adherence to old-school shooter design with the modern (as we know it) narrative design layered over it. It was revolutionary at the time, but so many games have come along and done what it did so much better that it's impossible to look back on this and still say it's good on it's own terms. Maybe Black Mesa will change my opinion on it (especially if they put in PROPER full controller support), but until then? Find some way for a friend who already loved Half-Life to let you play it instead of buying it for yourself is what I have to say.			"

												Played this game for about 2 hours and in that time I saw numerous bugs, and none of the elevators worked... They were all bugged into the wall. The reflections in this version are also very odd, none of the items even look real, and the explosions (as many other players have mentioned) look much worse in this ""source"" version. The graphics really arent better at all compared to the original one that's here on Steam and the bugs make it almost unplayable. Trust me, play the regular version of Half-Life and avoid this game breaking ""source"" version. - Rocky			"

												One of the best FPS games I've ever played.Level design is good. The strict hallways in the beginning, the more open areas in the middle and the alien world in the end are all nice to play. There are some more difficult sections in the game, but nothing you can't overcome with training and skill.I like the weapons. My favourite is the crossbow that makes a funny noise when you launch it to obliterate someone's brains. The Xen weapons are also nice, but like in Halo, I prefer human technology.Buy it. The updated Source version isn't even expensive.			"

												The crappy port of the original/former greatest PC game of all time. Get 1998's Half-Life instead. This is Half-Life with a ton of additional bugs (thanks to broken Steampipe updates and some original poor porting),new water textures, added ragdolls, barely improved skyboxes, motion blur, broken AI, screaming scientists,glowing floors and bloom, (which doesn't work). Not good! And whaddya know the port was done by Gearbox. Some of the alterations to the gunplay and weapon properties already affect it negatively but what's most shocking is how buggy it is and how many lenghty loading zones that weren't present in the original Half-Life have been added. Some load zones even intterupt the music just as it starts. The 2013 Source Pipe update didn't do it any favors either and in fact making it far worse and unstable to boot! There is a 50/50 chance the game will fail to start for players for some unknown reason. Stranger yet is one level is even uglier than it was in the 1998 original shockingly by making the map look far less expansive:

(The last picture is from Black Mesa's faithful remake.)If you've ever seen a picture of a scientist floating above a chair then the picture was in fact taken from Half-Life: Source as that bug never happend in Half-Life 1998. Oh and here's an example of one of the many bugs ingame:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696258149Note the lack of sky and the fact that my HEV suit has dissapeared. Not to mention that when a game released on the Source engine is prone to crash more than a game released on 1998 on a modern PC you know something  has gone awry. There are also instances where new Half-Life 2 textures are right alongside badly ported Half-Life 1 textures leading to a George Lucas remastered effect. Not to mention some broken scripting, missing music and textures shining as bright as the sun in dark rooms. The orginal runs flawlessly and works in widescreen and in terms of gameplay still holds up quite well with the obvious (Doesn't bother me.) exception being the graphics which are more than a little dated. Oh but of course you could always just toggle to use the HD models instead. If you wan't a version of Half-Life with subtle improvements to atmosphere, immersion and better graphics and that actually take full advantage of the Source engine get Black Mesa instead. In fact both the Black Mesa mod (Black Mesa retail/Steam edition runs on Source 2013 and recently so did Half-Life:Source.) and Half-Life: Source run on Source 2007. Half-Life: Source was so crummy that we have it to thank for inspiring people remake Half-Life on the Source engine themselves. If Counter Strike: Source was just 1.6 visuals rendered on the Source engine with a plethora of new bugs and weird changes to the gameplay (Unlike Counter Strike: Source which is a whole new game.) you would have pretty disapointed wouldn't you? This doesn't do much of note visually and adds longer loading to really hammer the nail in the coffin. Oh and Source SDK doesn't work with it either. This is pretty useless and I don't reccomend getting it in the year 2016 where as I would still whole heartedly reccomend the 1998 original or even the unfinished Black Mesa.My review for BMS can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/362890My review for Half-Life: Source Deathmatch can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/360 "

												I highly recommend this product if you want to venture Half-Life 1's campaign in Garry's Mod, with the ability to spawn every one of your favorite Xen aliens/monsters. If you're a fan of the Half-Life franchise and wan't to relive the gameplay of the first game in a polished and new light, then you're better off installing Black Mesa: Source. Compared to the original version, Half-Life: Source offers absolutely nothing new to the table. The game basically lives up to its name, it's Half-Life 1 imported and playable on the Source Engine, nothing special.			"

												Now, it's an AWFUL game. Half-Life WAS an OKAY game, for it's time. Now this isn't because of age I have multiple reasons.*THE STORY*I blew up something and now there's aliens?If the story was padded with interactions with characters it would be alright, but you have no sense of direction. I literally spent the game shooting things and aimlessly pressing buttons. I'm not a stickler but this was done horribly. I just walked, shot, pressed buttons, jumped, and turned wheels. The story is just awful in the first. The security guys are useless as well. They just say stuff that doesn't matter, giving you vague objectives. What kills the story is that everyone and everything feels lifeless. You can hate me but it's true. The game is LITERALLY 13 HOURS OF SHOOTING ♥♥♥♥ AND PRESSING BUTTONS WITHOUT ANY PERSONALITY. No one was funny, no one was cool, no one was my friend. It was a chore to play this game. Hell ,if Gordon was suppose to be an extension of the player why do we barely interact with people. THEY JUST SAY ""SURE I'LL RISK MY LIFE 4 U ♥♥♥ IT BIG BOI!!!""*THE GAMEPLAY*Oh god, even on easy everything was a bullet sponge while *YOU* THE GUY IN A POWER SUIT DIES IN LIKE 4 HITS!Killing ♥♥♥♥ didn't even feel satisfying, it got so boring that I turned on god mode the last 4 chapters. IT'S NOT FUN AT ALL. THIS PIECE OF *BLEEP* IS STILL BUGGY AS ♥♥♥♥ ON MY NVIDIA GTX 640 INTEL I7 QUAD CORE AND 16 GIGS OF RAM! There was screen tearing and crashing. What. The. ♥♥♥♥. It didn't do much except the EXCEPTIONAL PHYSICS ENGINE! The gameplay remained tedious with a few sequences of platforming and escorting people, that is too far apart and too far in between. How does it hold up today?It doesn't.I give Half-Life Source a 4/10. "

												Overall a fun game, but it is very plain.  It only took me 18 hours to complete, but it had become boring after only 8.  I finished just for the sake of completeness. Though I guess I'm not a big shooter game fan to begin with, it just seemed like the same thing over and over again after a while.  Shoot this, shoot that.  The storyline sequences happening in ""real-time"" instead of having cutscenes was pretty novel, and it was a snippet of a neat story involved, but other than that this is just a dusty old historical piece.  I would only recommend it to hardcore FPS fans who want to relive a milestone of the genre.  But even then... why not just get Black Mesa?Oh, I should note that I had a bug early in the game, before any real action had taken place.  I couldn't walk through a door.  I had to work it out a using a cheat to ""no-clip"" through the door.  It ran just fine from then on.			"

												against better judgement, i decided to purchase this game. the sound and physics in this are atrociously bad and the game is with no doubt, riddled with debilitating bugs, not the squishy kind. simple tasks that shouldn't be difficult become jarringly impossible because of the way your player moves in lightspeed mode, and the sounds... headsplitting. the graphics are goofy, but forgivable for its time, dont expect this ""source"" version to be much different from the original, if anything, it makes the game worse off. im a big fan of the half life universe and the only real thing i want out of this game is the story, and unless you're a fan of this original, source or not, i'd wait for a black mesa: source full release before i gave it a go, again. save your munnies.

												Short version: Go buy Black Mesa. If you want to know why this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, by all means, proceed. HL Source is the only bad Valve game ever released. It's honestly unbelievable how awful and fundamentally broken this one is, Valve managed to take their most iconic game- not to mention the one which launched their company to stardom, and absolutely deprive it of quality. For 10 bucks, what do you get from HL Source? An unplayable mess full of broken scripted sequences, broken NPCs, unbalanced weapons and damage systems, infuriating glitches, levels so broken you can't win, levels so broken you can't lose, just a total disaster. I hate to repeat myself so much, but this game is a broken mess. Even the Garry's Mod content is pretty lackluster, you'd be better off with a free mod like Half Life Renaissance. Oh, and for fans of the HD models that came with Blue Shift, don't even bother. For one they seem to be modified from the original release (why bother with such tiny changes?) and most importantly, the models are incomplete showing wireframes, and even the sounds on the guns like the M4 and SPAS-12 are missing altogether. The ""selling points"" of HL Source include a HL2 style chapter select, improved Source Engine lighting, HL2 style water, and ragdoll physics. That's it. For ten bucks. How could Valve have gone so wrong? Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat Source offered complete Source remakes of their predecessors, so why are we stuck with this awful port instead of a real remake, like the mod Black Mesa? And more importantly, why hasn't Valve even bothered to make this garbarge at least functional? It's full of little distracting mistakes any HL series veteran will notice immediately. Just a mess.I will say the Deathmatch multiplayer is fun. You can actually get this in a pack of other Source multiplayer titles without having to get HL Source. DMS has a lot of the same problems as Source, but luckily the abudance of great community made maps makes it worthwhile.  "

												If you're looking for a HD version of Half-Life 1, this isn't it. Get Black Mesa instead! http://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/There is no real reason to get this unless you need it for Garry's Mod mounting (and even then...). This is a port of the original game that does not improve on it in any meaningful way, and actually introduces a few glitches and out-of-place elements. Basically: either play the original or Black Mesa.			"

												While I can see why the game was so groundbraking back in 98 it just doesn't hold up well.There are some good moments in there but for every good one there is one frustrating and two boring ones. Visually game doesn't look good. It is not a matter of old graphics but lack of atmosphere and artstyle. Areas look quite similar to each other for the most part.Gameplay is just painful. Half-Life exists in this awkward spot between old-school shooters and new Modern Military Shooters. You move fast and have access to many weapons at once (they are quite a boring tough) but many of your enemies especially in the late game use attacts which can't be dodged. It gets really annoying really quickly. Also first person platforming. And movement. Gordon slides all the time. You will die repeatedly by falling off something.			"

												This version of Half Life is inferior on a gameplay standpoint. While the Source Engine may improve some sections and add very little to the game, the whole expeirence is almost the exact same thing like the 1998 original, except with one horrible addition that practically breaks the game at most parts, slippy jumping physics. While it may not be noticable at first, the crane platforming section early on in the game becomes extremely infuriating and tedious because of the slippy jumping in this port.The original had tight jumping which made platforming work very well, but here it can make new comers hate the platforming of Half Life; which already has a mixed reputation from some audiences. Save the money from this version of the game and just buy the original 1998 version. You are not missing much here, if anything for that matter. If you want Half Life Source that a certain group of modders envisioned back when this was released, then check out Black Mesa. If you are in some dire need of Gmod models and whatnot, then wait for a Steam Sale to pick this up.			"

												By the time I picked this game up back in 2004 it was already a old game, but HL is single handedly responsible for me getting back into gaming, and switching from console to PC.Back when I was a kid I always prayed that one day they would make a videogame that was like a virtual reality where you could move around a real enviornment and interact with objects. Prior to Half-Life I had only played Woffstein3D and doom for PC. Doom was great but it wasn't really interactive or very realistic. Half-Life was a dream come true and it will always be my favorite PC game of all time.For all those youngling's out there who grew up with Call of Duty and the like, you probably won't like this game. The graphics are old now, and the pace is slow. However if your still relatively new to gaming then please do yourself a favor and try it. Hell it even has a training room for those who don't have experience controlling a character in first person.The only difference between HL and HL source is that source has slightly improved lighting and textures in certain areas. Its worth getting over the stock version, but then again if you really want to experience the game as it came out back in 1998 then sure get the original.			"

												I finally got around to playing the original Half-Life, wanting to expand my knowledge on the universe that Valve had created.This is possibly the worst Valve game I have yet played. It has aged poorly. I guess if I had the fortune of playing it upon release I would appreciate it more, but I just can't understand how it managed to garner so much praise back in 1998. Perhaps there were some major changes that affected gameplay when they released the Source version in 2005?The AI is completely broken. You can edge around corners and slowly pick off immobile enemies by shooting their feet. If they can't see you their AI won't kick in. Pretty terrible mechanics. Apparently the AI was taken from Half-Life 2 when HL: Source was released. It doesn't show it.The controls are way too twitchy. It's almost impossible to succesfully climb down a ladder without dying the first time. You often go sliding off edges as if Gordon's feet are made of ice. It was certainly a frustrating experience.There is also absolutely no story or character development. None. You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist. You open a portal to another dimension. You close the portal. The end. Everyone you meet along the way is disposable and has no distinguishing features or names.There is no explanation for any of what is happening, there is no lead up to Half-Life 2. The reasons for the military presence are not explained, neither is the fact that they are replaced with Combine forces in the sequel, however many years later.The only connection between Half-Life and Half-Life 2 is Gordon Freeman and the G-Man. That's it. The only recurring enemies are the headcrabs and Vortigaunt, the latter of which are apparently on your side for some reason. Who knows how they ended up on Earth if the portal was closed.This was an amazingly empty experience, void of any story or sense of progression. I understand that was Valve's and, especially, Gabe Newell's intentions, but it just doesn't sit right with me.I know my opinion will go against the grain and, while I did enjoy the game overall and appreciate how it is placed within the Half-Life universe, I still can not overlook the many smaller flaws that become overbearing during gameplay. I have to wonder if these issues exist in the original Half-Life game or if they are exclusive to the Source version.			"

												Is Half-Life truly the greatest game of all time? I can answer that question with one word.No.My friend had been pestering me for months to play this game. I had heard so many wonderful things about it, “It’s the greatest game of all time”, “It has an amazing story” are just two of the many great claims I’ve heard about this game. I’ve got to say, I’m extremely disappointed.After launching the game, I’m greeted by some pretty abysmal graphics. The original game was released sometime around 1996, so poor graphics are to be expected in the original version of the game. What’s not to be expected is for there to be poor graphics in the remake/remaster of the game (Half-Life Source). If the graphics are this bad, I might have well just played the original version.At first I put this aside; a game with bad graphics doesn’t always equal a bad game. I decided proceed through the “tutorial” area until I actually reach the real part of the game (in which you get your first weapon). I was quite frustrated to find out that I had to use a crowbar as a weapon, which in my opinion is quite a bad design decision. You are going to get a gun later in the game anyway, so why not just provide a gun earlier in the game? Another thing I can't work out is why did they put glasses on the main character? It doesn't seem very badass for the main character to wear glasses.I then struggle to play though the game due to the dry story and boring combat mechanics. I honestly don’t know why everyone thinks the story to this game is so amazing. A science laboratory gets filled with aliens and you need to escape that laboratory. The story doesn’t get any more complicated or in-depth than that.You also see a man in a suit from time to time. I don’t see the point in this since you never get the chance to fight him. He is clearly the bad guy in the game, but instead of fighting him at the end of the game, you just speak to him instead. What a disappointment.Take my advice. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.			"

												Nerd Simulator: SourceIn Half-Life, you play a desperate whiteboy vrigin who embarks on an interdimensional journey to get laid.You start the game as Gordon Freeman, an anti-social loser who's an ordinary scientist at Black Mesa, when suddenly things take a turn for the worst, and it's time for the geek to face his bully.  Gordon is faced with overwhelming odds as he is forced to finally interact with other beings.  His first instinct, grab a crowbar and start killing things.  The standard mindset of any internet dwelling whiteboy.Avoid at all costs. "

												Honestly, you shouldn't be playing this game unless you want the ""full Half-Life story experience"". It really hasn't aged well, first-person platforming is horrible, and the enemy AI has pretty terrible power scaling (any time an enemy is in your field of view it just aimbots you, meaning you can't actually have fights without taking massive damage). It's a good history lesson, but I don't think this game deserves high reviews. Play HL2 instead.			"

												Nutshell: 6/10 - Get the original Half-Life if you want a bug-free experience, if you already got Half-Life 1 and want a remake, get Black Mesa, if you're a hardcore fan of Half-Life (or valve games in general) then it may be worth getting this game.Pros: - Slightly Improved Graphics over Original - There are some HD textures here and there, looks a little better than original, however this is a remaster/source port, not a remake, if you want drastically better graphics, get ""Black Mesa"". - Decent Source Port of the original Half-Life. If you want a source port of Half-Life, go ahead.Cons:- Riddled with minor bugs - They are not game-breaking, and I haven't had the game crash yet, but when you run into bugs, they are very noticeable and will slightly ruin the experience, it might also cause FPS drops on lower-end laptops, for those budget gamers out there wondering how well this game will run.- If you want to play Half-Life 1 and you use a weaker laptop (a lot of gamers do), get the original Half-Life which runs far better on lower-end computers. The graphics improvements of this port are hardly noticeable but it does drop FPS noticeably.- Valve, why are you making ports of previous titles instead of making Half-Life 3?In summary, if you are a hardcore collector of valve games and need this to complete the collection, then go ahead, don't expect anything amazing though.

												Half-Life is one of those games, a game you will spend hours on without even knowing. Its a game that has really left a impact on me as a gamer and is so good its still being talked about now. Half-life is a master piece in story telling and non-linear gameplay, and with its HD remake ""Black Mesa"" out now for free there's never been a better time to slip into your H.E.V suit for a Sci-fi, puzzle solving, alien and zombie killing EXTRAVAGANZA!!

												Half Life Source is amazing. I first picked it up last year and I loved it. I still love it. However I'm playing it again now and I'm experiencing a TON of bugs. Like in the part in Residue Processing with all the conveyar belts the map is really glitching out making a bunch of things I clearly don't remember seeing making it really hard to navigate. Another is the securrity guard from blast pit who yells ""EAT LEAD YOU OUTERSPACE OCTOPUS!"" doesn't get killed from whatever that thing is called making it not pay attention at all to you etc. I'm not saying this is a bad game at all in fact I highly reccomend it it's just it kind of needs to be fixed up a bit.

Stronly reccomended to play. It has an awesome story, sound, levels and gameplay. Back then this was THE game to play among with other real-time classics like Deus Ex and System Shock 2.Now i play the Source version, but i still know how good the classic one is. It's not been my childhood, i've discovered this game since i got Steam back in 2009, but man, i'm glad i've found this out.So i got to play it and as i said; it's one of the best game i've played.Go play this, you really need to, because you miss one hell of a classic game if you don't play it.

Definitely get the Half Life or Valve Complete pack to get the most bang for your buck, or wait for Black Mesa (the community created revamp of Half life with improved graphics, etc).Only difference between HL Source and HL is some improved audio/textures and stuff I cannot name off the top of my head.

While Half-Life's gameplay might seem like that of a typical sci-fi shooter, it gives an amazing story that will keep you glued to your keybaord and mouse.

												Although people expected more from this port when it first came out. I think it deserves some credit. It reduces buggy-ness of the original game. Includes chapter selection and a few preformance changes.One of the main reasons I prefer this version over the GldSrc version is because, on that version, I get INTENSE lag spikes if a lighting update occurs.Although, I think it's a good choice for the person who wants to play Half-Life again, but more reliable on the technical side of things.

												A very good and original game, I can see how this game could've been so influential back in 1998 because of all the tiny details that you didn't get in a FPS game then, things such as interacting with your environment by means of pushing boxes and knocking out vent openings and leading guards and scientists to open doors for you, to name a couple of them. The game keeps you entertained throughout its duration and doesn't get boring once, you're either gunning your way through an area full of enemies or solving a puzzle to get through a different area and testing your resourcefulness and intelligence; the horror aspect is eerie and creepy without resorting to many jumpscares that today's ""horror"" games do so much of.The game hasn't gotten old either, you can still play this game today nearly 20 years since its release and it will still deliver as enjoyable if you don't mind the old fashioned graphics and audio, of course!

												Half-Life: Source is the game that basically started my gaming addiction. Fun, complex, nerdy and serious game. A story about physics, aliens and corruption with a nerd hero. Easy puzzles like put A in B or just pull a lever located somewhere. You could find that graphics are old school and I wouldn't question that, in fact, Half-Life is old school. If you want to play for fun, go for Half-Life 2, if you want to play and inmerse in Half-Life universe, this game is the first step to take. There are no major differences between normal version and Source. It might use some graphics improvement but nothing more than that. Both are old style graphics; don't expect HD textures in here. Just enjoy your Half-Life trip!			"

												Often when we look back at games we wince at the idea that we once thought it was good. When we look back at Half-life, we find new things each time.I've played it hundreds of times when I was younger: battling through the first few missions and eventually confronting the craft millitary grunts who are sent to kill me, then giving up. But, as a more seasoned gamer (and have a better grasp of the ""quick-save"" concept!) I've managed to fight through to the very end a few times and save BlackMesa, and the earth, at least for a short while.From the moment you first fade into the tram ride at the start, to when you first grasp the crowbar, to when you have you back pressed against a wall listening for footsteps of black-ops assassins, to when you're in an Alien world killing an invading overlord, Half-life remains atmospheric, sharp and is excellently considered, balanced, challenging and most of all fun.It's become gospel to gamers, and it's one of my favourites.

												In a nutshell, this is Half-Life ported to the Source Engine including all the benefits the engine provides.  I chose to play through this one instead of the original because of the more advanced engine.  Gordan Freeman must fight his way out of the Black Mesa facility after a terrible experiment release creatures from another dimension into our dimension.  The Government sends troops to silent the experiment and all survivors within the facility.  It feels like a classic FPS such as 007: GoldenEye, which is good then again it is from 1999 and Valve's first game.  There isn't much reason to play this other than to learn of the history before Half-Life 2.  For 1999 standards I give it a 9/10, for its 2004 release 8/10.  Right now, a 7/10.			"

												By far it's sequel's superior. As soon as I started getting into the action, I realized what all the hype was about all these years. And don't even ♥♥♥♥ with Black Mesa until you've played this. Don't wanna spoil, but Black Mesa doesn't have about half the game (from what I've been told. I still haven't finished this one.)But I played Black Mesa first, and the gameplay in HL:S is so much more balanced and fun. The graphics, obviously, have suffered over the years. But if you like shooters and feeling like you accomplish something when you play games, or even love a ♥♥♥♥ing weird ♥♥♥ narrative told without the protagonist ever speaking, this game for LITERALLY EVERYONE YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS.Unless you're a chicken, who's more scared of stuff than me. This game has more than a few horror elements later on. Regardless, great game.			"

												Truly a bar raiser for the time, this FPS has timeless gameplay that has aged very well in most aspects.  The Source version is even better than the original with improved physics and full water simulation.  The textures are exactly the same however.To get the most out of this game, in my opinion, you have to download the Black Mesa mod for it.  It vastly improves the textures, adds fancy graphics options, has reworked animations as well as a lot of redone voice acting.  It allows the game to have wonderful, modern graphics paired with the excellent gameplay of the original.  Best part is, it's free!			"

												If you want to see what 15 year old game looks like with better water effects and ragdoll then give this game a try. Although it is the original HL game just with some added visual effects, I would suggest playing the original. This version just seems odd having pixelated floors but fluid moving bodies of water.

												One of the best classic games out there. Story, vision, in-game rules etc are great, but I don't like gameplay sensitivity. Some controls are super sensitive & some are much less sensitive.This is remastered edition of original Half-Life which runs on modern Source engine, but still graphics needs serious improvement. I'd suggest Valve to re-develop this great game from scratch with modern graphics & special effects.			"

												Half-Life: Source is exactly the same as its Goldsource counterpart, except it has been ported over to the Source engine, with better lighting, better shadows, better water, better physics and ragdolls, better blood particles and better sprites. But that's about it. It's the same game. Nothing changes.It is a nice complement if you buy the complete Half-Life franchise pack though. And it has many model and texture mods that make it look great. But if you're looking for an HD remake of the original Half-Life, I'd recommend you grab the Black Mesa mod for Half-Life 2 instead. It features a lot of new stuff while keeping the original storyline and locations.			"

												Often when we look back at games we wince at the idea that we once thought it was good. When we look back at Half-life, we find new things each time.I've played it hundreds of times when I was younger: battling through the first few missions and eventually confronting the craft millitary grunts who are sent to kill me, then giving up. But, as a more seasoned gamer (and have a better grasp of the ""quick-save"" concept!) I've managed to fight through to the very end a few times and save BlackMesa, and the earth, at least for a short while.From the moment you first fade into the tram ride at the start, to when you first grasp the crowbar, to when you have you back pressed against a wall listening for footsteps of black-ops assassins, to when you're in an Alien world killing an invading overlord, Half-life remains atmospheric, sharp and is excellently considered, balanced, challenging and most of all fun.It's become gospel to gamers, and it's one of my favourites.

												If you want to play HL in the source engine, than this is THE version for you! They don't realy change to much of the game. But some graphical things are pretty much improved. Some puzzles also include a brand new twist because of Source's physics engine. The body's are now fully dynamic and so is the flashlight. You're now able to add motion blur and other new graphical stuff that makes the game look a lot better. They also keep the tone and mood from the first game by including all of the original textures. But some of the sounds (Like the foodsteps) are directly from HL2 witch makes the game sound alot better. And if you're a fan of the HD content the original Half-Life had, they included all of those moddels into this version. Witch makes it look even better. So if you're a HL fan, this game will stand nicely in your game library.p.s: Sorry for my english. Its not my main language. "

Now the changes, Ragdoll physics, Water textures etc very minor things, this is all because this is Half Life running on the Source engine that games like TF2, Counter Strike GO and Half Life 2 run on however this does not mean that it will change the graphics drastically. Now i do prefer the Original over this one however that does not mean this one is BAD.

I explored everything . well 90% atleast.Second time i'm completing the game. Made It in 5.7 hours. Still exploring most of the spots and all that ♥♥♥♥.So Keep that in mind.The Main reason you may be reading all these reviews is because you have no idea what's the difference between Half-life and Half-life Source. None. I'm talking about the script and story. No difference. On the other hand, The graphics are improved, some monters are improved and changed the look of them. If you don't want to spend money, don't buy it. If you are a HL fan buy it. Get the speedrun record. do it. The Record is 20:49 minutes btw. So good luck			"

												I love this game. It's fun, and just such a classic.Its that simple. Its just good.Although aged, I think this is the best half life game out. Hard to put down, fun, and an alright engine. I love the animations like on the Shotgun and Tau Cannon, and the way you move flows very well compared to the other games imo. Few downsides, one of them is like said before, its age, but it never affected me. Black Mesa is a good re-do of the game and if you can't stand old games but want to play as close to the story and gameplay of the first half life, buy that but I personally had more fun playing this than Black Mesa due to the different and simple engine.The AI is pretty crappy, and towards the end or the last few chapters (not xen, but on earth), it felt rushed and pretty annoying with the tanks and all that but thats the challenge.One problem I had with the game is the skybox sometimes bugged out but it wasnt unbearable and sometimes unnoticed. And in one level, the game was taking a dip and some textures flipped to a dealable scale, to flat out eye straining.Such a fun game, I played it at least 3 times, and had fun everytime.			"

												!!important note!! I do not recommend this version of half-life. The reason why is because the source version contains many bugs and glitches. The last two chapters had missing textures in them, so of the weapon textures were horrible, they were too shiny, some of the enemies bugged out and weren’t attacking. 	If I were you I would buy the original version which is similar priced. What I liked about the game•	Brilliant story. A story with unexpected events and leaves many unanswered questions. •	Top-notch level design. I enjoyed exploring Black Mesa, finding secret ammunition stashes. •	Challenging, throughout the game there are many puzzles and obstacles to get past and the combat can be quite challenging as well. •	Brilliant soundtrack. •	A great arsenal of weapons.•	I loved the introduction to the game and the game had a brilliant ending.  What I disliked or was disappointed with•	The source version of the game. Buy the original version.  •	Wasn’t keen on the final boss fight. I found the final boss fight to be a bit confusing and frustrating.  Conclusion It’s an absolutely fantastic game. I highly recommended it. I hope the series continues. 90/100 A must buy for any fps fan.			"

												A classic worth playing. Great example of minimalistic storytelling (there is zero exposition in this). There are no pauses or breaks in this game and the intensity grows until the big finale. Very challenging--but fair--difficulty that has you conserving ammo and searching every nook and cranny for all the secret staches. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, but the ending certainly leaves you wanting more (fortunately there IS more).			"

												Is there a gamer on the planet that doesn’t know Half-Life yet? Would we have Steam today if Valve had not made Half-Life? Good questions but I’m really supposed to write a review about this game. The atmosphere is dense, story compelling, action super fun and challenging, controls responsive, and game world buzzing with weird lifeforms. Half-Life sort of faces the same conundrum as Crysis as in the sections where you fight the human soldiers feel a lot more fun than blasting the aliens. In this game, though, the difference isn’t that huge. The aliens are menacing but you feel like a badass when you get them to submit under your shotgun fire. The only thing that really made me wanna drop the score is the fact that the difficulty level on the game is super cheap. And by cheap I mean you’re gonna die a lot. You can save whenever you want but that doesn’t help too much when you gotta perform a stunt obstacle course where a single wrong move makes the difference between a live Gordon Freeman and a dead Gordon Freeman. You need to be a bit of a masochist to play this game, but if that’s not a problem, you’re gonna love every second of it.			"

												I remember seeing this in a game magazine when the internet was still a shaddy thing, the graphics were amazing and it was yet to be released, it was expected to be one of the best and most promising game releases of 1998. I still remember how 'stupid' the name felt to me at the time, little did I know the weight this franchise would carry in the next 14 years.I first touched this game at a friends house, it was amazingly brilliant, it looked like a movie, it WAS a movie, something that had never been done, a game with a movie-category introduction, it was something groundbreaking in game history.This is a must-play-before-you-die for any hardcore gamer.

												Truly a bar raiser for the time, this FPS has timeless gameplay that has aged very well in most aspects.  The Source version is even better than the original with improved physics and full water simulation.  The textures are exactly the same however.To get the most out of this game, in my opinion, you have to download the Black Mesa mod for it.  It vastly improves the textures, adds fancy graphics options, has reworked animations as well as a lot of redone voice acting.  It allows the game to have wonderful, modern graphics paired with the excellent gameplay of the original.  Best part is, it's free!			"

I'd suggest Valve to re-develop this great game from scratch with modern graphics & special effects.			"

 Half Life: Source Atmosphere- This game brings me back to the times of Goldeneye 007 for the nintendo 64, which anyone growing up in the 90's played non stop. This is no suprise seeing as the this game was released in 98, unfortunately PC gamers were not as popular at my age when this game was released.Review- Were I to review this game in 1998 , I would have been blown away by the story and gameplay, but seeing as this is 2015 I cant say that I am blown away, but I can appreciate a classic game during this day and age for what is was. Half Life is a fantastic game, and anyone who is a collector or can appreciate classic games must buy it, there is a reason it is still on the top 50 games of all time lists everywhere you look.Combat- Ok let me first say, the shooter part of this game is done fairly well, but the crowbar combat is super bad, the game like you to be in just the right spot and swinging your crowbar perfectly for you to kill things with it, which is not a big deal since you won't be using the crowbar for combat really unless oyu run out of ammo haha.Story- THE STORY BECOMES FAR CLEARER WHEN YOU PLAY HALFLIFE 2. Half Life has a great story, but it is not easy to pick up on , you have an idea throughout the game of what is going on and who you are, but at the end is when you really get a sense of what is to come. I will not discuss the story to avoid spoilers, but PAY ATTENTION to what the NPCS are saying and especially the man in the blue suit. There is no Journal or logbook, so you just have to remember what is going on. That being said, Half Life 2 is a must pick up after you play this.Replay Value- Next to none unless you want to do the achievment system, or if you want to beat it on a higher difficulty, but in my opinion the NORMAL diffculty is actually pretty challenging.Rating- 8/10, Receiving an 8 because of length of the story, there are times when you just want to get to the end and you feel it is being dragged out by needless extra puzzles that are just there to annoy you(the puzzles are not hard), but regardless great game must play.

												This was supposed to be a revival of the original 1998 game 'Half life'. It was supposed to be a recreation of it in the newer source engine. Unfortunatly though, instead of fully utilising the power of the newer engine valve barely made use of any of the new features and the features they did incorporate eg ragdoll physics were very poorly done. It was also heavily plagued by large amounts of bugs throughout the game. This was supposed to be something amazing but unfortuantly it turned into a massive failure and the backlash from that caused multiple other valve games to not recieve remakes or the remakes were cancelled halfway through, these included team fortress classic and counter strike. Although counter strike luckily did get that proper remake, that we now call Counter Strike: Source. Luckily though for the fans of the original Half Life a proper remake was created but not by valve. Instead it was made by some very very dedicated modders, the remake was originally a free mod by the name of 'Black Mesa' but has now been made into a standalone game. Unfortunatly though the zen levels have not been remade yet but are being worked on by the team o f modders. I would not reccomend playing this, if you want to play half life then either you can play the original or if you want something newer then try black mesa. Additional Notes: I have played this all the way thorugh but my time doesnt reflect it even remotely becuase i lost my time thanks to a glitch/bug			"

We all know it's excellent.That aside, the Source version, though buggy, gives you graphical options which just weren't there before, as Half Life (non-source) does look like it was rendered on a potato, be honest.With Black Mesa here, Source doesn't have so much of an appeal to most anymore, but to those on a tight budget, I would recommend this over Mesa, until there's a sale.

Well on close examination the game is identical. Yes the lighting is slightly smoother and some textures are slightly different. I wouldn't say they're are better, they still look rather outdated. Just different. Where this version fails is all the bugs. I can only imagine this didn't get play tested at all. They simply dumped the first game into this engine or remastered process and never looked at it again. There are so many little bugs that bothered me. One annoying bug is where I had a few guards with me and if they took damage and yelled they wouldn't stop the yell, they would endlessly react to the pain, even though they werent getting attacked anymore. Really irritating. Where i finally gave up was when you first meet the marines, there is this high octane music, that i remember from the first one. It's like matrix style and gets you into it and really adds something extra. However in this version just after the music starts you hit a load screen to the next area, and that kills the music, it just ends. And then you're left in silence again. It's so awkward and I was so into the music, that it was just enough to me. However on the old version which I started playing again everything is fine, no bugs. I can't play this version if every little element is broken or missing. Just max out the graphic settings on the old version it will look nearly identical to this version and it plays a lot better. Don't waste your money or time on this. I have also read that the final boss in this version is also almost unplayable so yeah don't bother. Most horrible version of a classic game i've ever played.			"
