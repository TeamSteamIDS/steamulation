												PixelJunk Eden is a tough game to describe. I am not really sure what the developers' intent was with this game... on the surface, it looks like a sort of casual interactive art piece showcasing a synergy of music and colors. But once you get deeper into it, there are increasing levels of challenge (and frustration), which go against the laid-back casual vibe. But what is it, exactly? I'm not really sure... I guess my best simple summary would be to say it's sort of like an unholy union of the artistic games ""Flow"" and ""Flower"" on the PS3 (if you've played/heard of those). Anyways, you play as some sort of little bug thing that can jump around and stick to plants. By jumping into floating spores, you release pollen that fills in seeds, which when filled, sprout new plants that allow you to reach new areas. You just keep exploring in this way until you find a special glowy thing called a ""spectra"", which ends the level. There are 15 levels (or ""gardens"", as they are called), each of which contains 5 spectra. So there is plenty of content to play through. While no major mechanics are introduced after the first few levels, the game mostly stays interesting throughout, due mostly to the diversity in the look and music. Each garden has a unique vibe, due to the music and color palette/design. As each spectra is collected, the levels evolve slightly to introduce more visual elements. It's a pretty neat effect. As I mentioned earlier, while the game is fairly simple at its core, some frustration creeps in during the latter portion of the game due to the introduction of really annoying enemies and some slightly more challenging platforming bits (the sometimes wonky controls don't help, either). It's nice for the challenge, but it also sort of goes against the enjoyable casual feel of the early parts of the game. It felt somewhat like the game had an identity crisis to me... but I dunno, maybe it's just me. That said, it is still a super enjoyable experience if you go into it not expecting some sort of blockbuster. It's a great experimental art piece that is perfect for those times when you just want to turn your mind off and get lost in a spaced out state of sights and sounds... and yes, that means it's definitely the perfect game for you if your favorite time of day is 4:20. But even if not, it's still an enjoyable experience and worth checking out.			"

I am in love with the art direction in PixelJunk Eden. It has become my go-to game for when I've had enough of killing things, blowing things up, and other related virtual mayhem. Or, after rage-quitting the last five games in a row because they are deliberately obtuse or sadistically difficult, it serves as a good reminder of why I play games in the first place; to have fun and feel good about myself. PixelJunk Eden has those ""Man, I'm good"" moments when you clear an area, in the same way that very well done puzzle games do. It can have it's frustrating moments, like falling 50 stories after a long and complex climb, but they are always user error and not the fault of the game design. Difficulty progresses naturally and not without commensurate upgrades and new abilities. Time is made a valuable, albeit renewable, resource. It has the perfect balance of relaxing and challenging that makes it highly addictive to play. Adding to replay value are the achievements for clearing an area a second time or for activating all of a certain interactive object. The soundtrack is generally pleasant, in a techno-jazz kind of way, but I occasionally found it irritating and so played that area in silence. And as I've said, I do love the art direction, although some screens in the higher levels are downright hard on the eyes. It is still one of the most fun, refreshing, satisfying and addictive games I've played in a while, well worth the full price.

												Let me start by mentioning that I'm not very fond of platform games. Never have been. They usually feel way to linear and restricted to me, and hardly ever offer exciting game mechanics.While PixelJunk Eden technically is a platform game, this label wouldn't do much justice to it, as it truly is so much more! The game mechanics are simple yet innovative and the gameplay is very fluent. The player can move around freely over the entire map, explore every corner and in the meanwhile develop the map as it grows with you (by seeding plants).No need to use the keyboard; the mouse does it all for you. This however doesn't mean it's a simple point-and-click game. Different combinations of mouse buttons make you jump in different ways and it all feels very natural.The artwork is amazing and the 15 maps all offer something new. The minimal house music compliments the game very well.Is there nothing negative to mention about the game? Of course, there always is. While the gameplay has the potential to be very relaxing, the timer that decreases your health can be stressful. You have to pick up crystals to recharge it, but these are not always around in the later stages of the map and it can be a little frustrating to die just before reaching your goal. In my opinion your health shouldn't be affected by time that much, but rather more by the enemies you have to defeat. These do some occasional damage, but more often interfere with your jumps.Overall a very nice game with high replay value. You can play for just 10 minutes or for several hours, which makes it a game you can easily come back to. Even the main menu is fun to play around with.			"

												After watching the PixelJunk Eden opening trailer on Steam, talking about how groundbreaking the design and soundtrack is for the game, I was very excited to play it. However, after only 30 minutes in the game, I was sorely, sorely disappointed.First of all, you need to dissociate this game with the console versions. According to a good friend of mine, the game is far more fun on the console, because it has multiplayer. PC does not.The game involves you controlling a little bug thing who has to leap about flowers to activate ""Spectra"" while gathering enough pollen to grow plants (never explained). The game has absolutely no story whatsoever. The game revolves around the process of shooting your silk, spinning around and guesstimating where you are meant to go next, which almost always leads to 90% of your time thinking ""what the hell am I meant to do?""Anyway. I played 9.4 hours of it, completing the ""Eden"" aspect of the game, and would not recommend it. -Nilesy			"

												A pleasant palate cleanser of a game, well worth the price of admission if you’re after something a little different from the usual platforming tropes.At it's heart Eden is a simple platformer, each level or “garden” has five items to collect, with a cumulative total of these items unlocking additional levels. To traverse these levels you have a jump and grip/swing mechanic, the physics involved in which are slightly “floaty” therefore offering a good degree of mid-air readjustment. Reaching the higher areas of a level requires the player to pollinate plants, a process achieved by picking up nearby items, or destroying enemies in the vicinity, with larger pollen rewards generated for destroying multiple enemies in a single jump. Players are required to accomplish all of this against the clock, though that clock can be topped up by acquiring some items dotted around the gardens.There are no great bold innovations to be seen here, the pleasure of the game is derived from the fact that the design of the game mechanics, the visuals and the sound all come together to make a very pleasant gaming experience. In an odd juxtaposition of perception and content, the easy going almost Zen-like meditative vibe of Eden in the early stages is tempered with some really rather infuriating moments in the later in the game, but that’s alright, because you can simply drop back a few levels and do a run through an earlier level for no other reason than the fact the world of Eden is a very pleasant one to visit.Finally it should be noted this is the definitive version of the game, controls redesigned for mouse and keyboard, several annoyances ironed out from the original PSN version (Thankfully you no longer have to collect all 5 items in one run to clear a level), all of the Encore content included, and the addition of a nifty “warp” function which allows for the rapid repair of any mistimed jump.

												Pixel Junk Eden is by these people http://www.q-games.com/ and I am now very interested in them.This is a game where you could judge it quickly by face value, but you really need to stick with it to understand and see the beauty of it. It is a REALLY good puzzle game.The objective is to control a bug through spinning and rolling and make it hit spores and then collect the pollen so that it germinates nearby seeds which will grow further branches which you can now latch onto. You must navigate each map with your grappling silk hook and find five spectra (glowing bulb spirits) so that you can unlock more maps. There is a total of 75 spectra in all. The game is visually impressive with it's abundant in  your face vibrant colors and patterns and it's comprehensive list of trendy instrumental music scores. It's peaceful and relaxing, but it is also very fast if you are to take on the challenge of getting the whole five spectra in a single course in a single run. There is no dillydallying then. The further you progress the more interesting the different mechanics of the game.What I love about this game is that there is NOTHING like it. Well done to the developers for producing a UNIQUE product and visual. It's constantly on sale and I would say it's worth more than what it goes on sale for. High Praise.			"

												While beautiful, this game is actually bad and boring, and there are some annoying points that really break the flow of the game:- That techno must be the worst pairing I've ever seen between a game and a soundtrack. The game's supposed to be relaxing, and the music stressed me a lot.- Instructions are also terrible, you receive wrong/incomplete hints all the time (like, they say you need to press the drop button to drop fast, but you have to press the spin button as well). Also, some controls are a bit counter-intuitive (when you wanna jump from plant A to plant B, you have to press the jump button twice, or else you'll be caught by your own silk thread... the silk thread could've easily worked for as long you hold the jump button, for example). Also, after clearing 1/3 of the game, I was still wondering what ""orbitation"" is, even after they've mentioned a few times (as if I already knew what it was).- The ""health"" mechanic (I'm not even sure if you die when they run out) with the crystals is just another thing that breaks the flow of the game, making you stop to collect those orbs, or whatever they're called- Each level has 5 Spectra you need to find (like Super Mario 64's stars). It would really be great if you could find them all in one go, but you're removed from the stage every time you get one. Not only that, but if you unlock a new level, you're forced to try it immediately. So, if you're like me and wanna complete a level before moving to the next, you'd have to enter the new level only to quit it, then navigate back through the hub to where you were (which is not always an easy task). It totally breaks the flow.It's not a bad game, but it's just meh, and those negative details ended up ruining the whole experience for me.			"

												Let me begin by warning the completionists out there like me: PixelJunk Eden will frustrate you and waste hours of your time if you let it. Don't be tempted to go for the ""Open All Seeds"" achievements on any but the first few gardens (levels). The game gives you no tools to find any seeds that you've missed and most of the gardens later in the game are huge with at least a couple seeds in really obscure locations. To top it off there is a finite amount of life rejuvenating crystals in each map so there is a very real cap to how long you can spend searching before you can't sustain yourself anymore, die and have to start all over. I likely would have given this game a higher rating had I stopped playing at 10 hours instead of 20.And what a pleasant first 10 hours it was. The experience included eye-catching visuals, a unique and fitting soundtrack, simple yet challenging enough gameplay and some good level design with plenty of variety. It had a relaxing feel to it. In the early to mid levels health crystals were plentiful enough that I hardly paid attention to the life bar. I'll admit that the soundtrack didn't appeal to my tastes but there seems to be a lot of praise out there for it. There were a couple tracks I liked and the rest at least weren't grating.In my mind the life system that is constantly ticking down and needing to be refilled was a very poor design choice for this type of game. In a game all about exploration, collecting things and taking in the sights and sounds, why impose an unnecessary time constraint? It would have been better to let players set their own pace and have a more standard health bar so that the enemies still have teeth.Despite my gripes I’d still recommend this game if you treat it casually. Bring too much hardcore gamer mindset to it and it’s likely to go sour on you.			"

												I would describe this game as a 'relaxing challenge'... lol. I Have never played another game like it. The music is awesome and thats enough of a reason to play it, but the gameplay is very enjoyable as well, it gives you a great sense of exploration, and satisfaction when you find a 'spectre', especially on the difficult later levels. It also can make you feel very desperate at times when your health starts going low and you need to find something to eat, because you need to constantly find food in order to stay alive. Possibly the most 'original' thing I've ever played, and in a good way. 9/10.			"

												Pixeljunk Eden made its way into my library on a whim and it turned out to be a solid decision. This is a good game to play for relaxing and quiet time. Gameplay consists of leading a small creature from plant to plant or to rocks via jumping or spinning. In later gardens there are additional movement and puzzle mechanics which complicate the game in a positive way. The game introduces new mechanics slowly, which keeps frustration to a minimum. There's some need for planning and quick movements at times, but it's not a game that relies 100% on twitch reactions. The main goal is to find all 5 spectra in each garden and there are additional challenges such as collecting all 5 spectra in 10 minutes or unlocking all seeds in a garden. You can go as quickly or as slowly as you want through gardens, which is a very attractive freedom to me. It has an odd graphic style which is pretty fresh. Each garden has its own graphic style and color scheme, which change as you collect spectra. The music is made by an independent Kyoto artist and is a good selection of electronic trance with light beat (get the soundtrack bundle, it's worth it). Overall, this is a solid puzzle game that has a lot of fresh and interesting attributes - a great thing to play and just relax with.			"

												Bubble bubble, cough and snuffle, pixels grow and my bong bubbles....There was a thing...probably still a thing, called 'trip toys' back in the day.  Stoners, acid heads, etc. would get toked up, find something flashy that would keep them transfixed for hours.  PixelJunk Eden is a digitized trip toy that will keep you transfixed, much like a cat hopped on catnip and a laser pointer! The setup's simple.  You have a little dude, you right click to jump, left click to swing on a bit of silk.  Jump, climb, explode pollen, grow seeds.  Explore, find a seed, repeat.  Sounds simple?  Because it is simple.  But it's captivating in that simplicity, which let's face it...is a great quality in a trip toy! The gameplay's not all.  The music is absolutely fantastic.  Trance-like as it starts, the music is atmospheric and driving.  As you climb higher, grow your garden deeper, the beat picks up and the strains open up even more. So yes, I made a lot of weed jokes there because...they go really well together.  But hey, I'm not condoning nothing here, right?  Besides, PixelJunk Eden is just as catchy and engrossing without all that other stuff and you should be playing it.  It's going to keep you entertained for a few hours, guaranteed.			"

												A great game.  It is hard to explain exactly why, but it is unique and beautiful.  Don't let other reviewers fool you into thinking this game is just powder-puff because they label it casual or relaxing.  There is a very nice element of challenge to this game and it can downright frustrate the hell out of you when you can't find that last Spectra.  Sure, it has no real enemies--not in the typical sense of monsters trying to eat you or mangle you in some way, but it has its own obstacles/opponents you must face.  It will relax you at times with a very electro-zen soundtrack that puts you in a trance, but it will also captivate you and give you hours of non-linear adventure gaming enjoyment, if you just open your mind to a little different style of play.

												So in this game you are like a little fairy-bug thing, and you jump and swing around and collect pollen to grow plants so that you can jump on them and go higher up to find and collect magic seed-things for your garden.  Or something.  I'm really not sure and I don't quite care enough to figure out more.I bought this game on sale for 99¢ and it's a pretty nice game to zone out and click around in.

												8.7/10 - One of My Favorite Casual Games to Play!This game won't be for everyone but I can't say enough about it! There is enough going on to actively play or go at it half-heartedly while watching a movie; I really love that flexibility. I've played most of the Pixel Junk games and I am always impressed; even casual platformers are done with epic style and professional development. My favorite PJ game  is still 'Monsters' but this game puts forth a strong effort to change my mind!You play as a ""Grimp"" or bug-like alien creature; who must navigate plants and monsters in order to find ""Spectra"". These are essentially just level objectives or stars and complete a stage of that level. The game is pretty lengthy; there are about 15 diverse levels with 5 stages in each; taking about 10-30 minutes each stage! That's AT LEAST 25 hours to complete this entire game, I anticipate much more! The graphics are really impressive for how much of a minimalist style there is!Worth the $10; I'd recommend grabbing the whole collection on discount!

												PIxelJunk Eden is the type of game you casually play and have fun. If you liked gameplay such as ""World of Goo"" or have nice sounds like ""Dust: Elysian Tale"" you would want to try this game out. You are basically a creature that eats spore-like stuff jump around pretty much the whole game where you acquire and unlock ""Gardens"" which are considered areas/stages in the game.  Upon unlocking other gardens you unlock other abilities such as rope swinging on a plant, defying time and whatever, making a dive attack and so on. It is a game you would play on your spare time. So here is my short review and here are my scores:Before I procede, I am basing this review on Indie games so don't compare this scores to actual big games out there.Story: 4/10 (Not Considered in Final Score)For this type of game i won't consider the story for the total score since yeah this game is more of a casual game than a full length rpg/adventure/other-things-that-needs-story-game. You would rather be curious and actually interested on how the developers thought of a concept of a creature unlocking gardens and defeating or collecting spores. Really i don't even know what to call these things.Graphics: 7/10It has a really good 2D vibrant visuals but the movement around the plants, spores, guardians what not are too slow and would make you even drowsy if you aren't playing with any soundsSounds: 8/10""Funky Club Music""Contrasting to the mild and calming visuals the funky club music actually matches it. Making the game a bit more exciting and you could probably even bop your head while you play. The background music in this game is just that good.Gameplay: 7/10For an indie game going with the casual type of gameplay is always a good choice. It's basically kind of an arcade game where you jump and hop around collecting stuff, no not like mario but more of that ""LocoRoco"" game (Search it up). Imo it has one of the best gameplay for a casual indie gameTotal Score: 7.33 / 10Verdict: Would definitely recommend this game if you are into that casual games. It's on sale in steam right now at 75% (Holiday 2013) you might aswell get it but there are other games that might be better for your $2.50 (I got mine on 90% $0.99 so i took the advantage and bought it ;D). Oh and one more thing the game also has ""Steam Trading Cards"" for you to collect. If it's not on sale for at least 50%, i won't recommend you to buy it.  "

												PixelJunk Eden is not the average game.  It's quite odd.  It's a mixture of a platforming game, with action elements, and at the same time it's really none of those. PixelJunk Eden is a game where the player is a creature that... well really he's like a spider, he's able to use silk to swing around plants and fling himself from point to point.   He can kill enemies to gain ""pollen"" that allows you to open seeds, that allow the player to reach farther in each level.  The goal of the game is to explore, and find these items called Spectras.  The Spectras allow the player to open more Gardens, and... well that's about it. It's a weird odd little game, with a very mellow vibes, and wonderful relaxing gameplay.   Until you play multiplayer.  And then the one issue I have with this game appears.  Instead of a wonderful relaxing game, it turns into the most frustrating hellish game.  If one player makes a mistake, there's a 50/50 chance of the game following the mistake, and then everything goes to hell. But the single player game itself is a thing of beauty, hypnotic beats, simplistic gameplay and an amazing difficulty curve that takes the game from simple to very challenging over the course of the game with out any real noticeable difficulty gap.  There's a few different mechanics in the second half of the main game (Which is the first ten gardens), but nothing is impossible, there's just a little skill required to accomplish each goal. Overall PixelJunk Eden is exactly what it is.  A relaxing game, that has a good amount of difficulty, featuring a perfect blend of gameplay and beauty.   The only time it gets out of that are is with the multiplayer, and I would say that's the one major flaw of PixelJunk Eden, a weak Multiplayer.  However it's a perfect 10 dollar game, easily worth far more than that.  It gets my highest recommendation.  It might not be for everyone but it's a fantastic experience.			"

												   I started out playing Pixeljunk Eden on the PS3, its original platform(I think). I loved it! It is a colorful game, and the techno soundtrack puts you at a decent pace which relaxes and calms you(or maybe techno gives you a headache?). It doesn't really have a story-you're a small creature growing colorful silhouettes of plants by collecting flora-looking objects called... wait, let's not spoil it. But in short this game, even though boiling it down to its structure makes it seem tedious and repetitive, keeps you engaged and interested, even when calmed while playing it. It's unique too! I especially liked how the levels changed colors and became decently harder as you played through them. And despite it being timed, you can replenish the timer so you have plenty of time to do other things while playing. The negatives of the game pretty much fix themselves.   I have only one problem with this game, and it's just on this port-there aren't many video settings, which means if the game runs slow for you you're pretty much doomed. And it runs slow for me. It's an absolute killer. But as long as you have a powerful enough machine, this won't be a problem at all, and you can enjoy it as much as you want. Another con is that it used to be a co-op game where you could play online with strangers or your friend could pick up the other controller and join, but if you never cared for multiplayer, that's not a problem either. I'm also noting here for people who started out playing the PS3 version that the PC controls are a bit awkward to adjust to, but it's definitely not impossible.   In short? The game has vibrant, well-animated artwork, its physics are sensical and easily adjusted to, the goal is simple and you can start it up whenever without worrying about where you were in the gameplay. I recommend this!			"

												Mildly positive recommendation.Pros:* relaxing music* lots of exploration.  it feels quite nice to be able to sweep up the pollen, open up the seeds, and find the spectra.* can be played with mouse only -- an ideal game for playing one-handed.* gameplay can fit in short spurts if you want it that way.Cons:* ugh, the momentum!  while it's fair, it keeps on making me miss my jumps and other things.  Might be nicer if it were set laterally 2D rather than up/down 2D, so there were no gravity effects.  (NOTE: when you jump off, your momentum resets to a jump momentum in the direction you jump.  you don't get the momentum of the object you were standing on even if it was moving.)* having enemies that interrupt your movements, and having a time limit.  (running out of time just sends you back to the original starting point of the stage, though.)* cursor occasionally hard to see against various features and background.Overall, a generally enjoyable experience for chilling.  Occasionally irritating when you miss a bunch of jumps/landings in a row, but overall decent.For reference: I've completed the first three gardens, and unlocked about 6 gardens so far.(Disclosure: I bought this game on the Steam store when it was deeply discounted.)

												Okay. I'm assuming this game is pretty ""indie"" and not ""mainstream"" based on the amount of people that have reviewed this game. From what I can gather based on the amount of time I have played Eden, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you are someone who likes blazing action and twists around every corner, this is not for you. This game is purely casual. Yeah, ok. Call me a ""♥♥♥♥ing casual"" but seriously? This game is soothing in every way, soundtrack, art style, and level design. The art style is very simplistic, something I love. Overall, this game is just a casual experience that really, in my opinion, sucks you in. So buy it! It may seem pricey for what it is, but I got it for 99 cents in the winter sale, so just buy it!

												I got this game gifted to me, and was really happy to be able to try it out. I like having games I can play when I want more casual, relaxing gameplay, and PixelJunk Eden serves this purpose very, very well.If you like artsy, atmospheric platformers with good pacing, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are spectacular! The artstyle and background is very refreshing - the theme is plants in a garden (in a variety of colors depending on the level). The sounds and music are very good and add to the relaxing atmosphere emitted by the game. The controls are fairly simple and easy to learn - instructions are given whenever a new mechanic is introduced. The tutorial is quick and painless - your primary objective is to find these special items throughout the level. The learning curve is minimal - the most you have to worry about is completing your objective before your time runs out, however, it is quite easy to obtain the collectibles that increase your time limit.During gameplay, there are various pollen-like objects floating around the area, and hitting them will cause the pollen particles to float toward the nearest ""plant-budding"" area. When enough pollen has accumulated within the circle, touching it with your character will cause a plant to sprout. These structures are essential because your character can stick to any part of the plant, allowing you to jump/move to higher areas. Later, you will unlock a rappel ability, allowing you to swing for a finite amount before propelling yourself in a particular direction. Furthermore, if your rope touches any time-increasing collectibles or pollen-objects, they will automatically be collected.You have a time limit, and collecting certain items will increase your limit by a few bars (the larger object will refill it by a great deal). As you progress through the game, you will also unlock a teleport-reset ability (very useful for when you accidentally fall a large distance), however, using this requires you to spend a portion of your time limit gauge.  As you collect more of the spectra (level completion) items, you will eventually unlock more gardens. Interestingly, whenever you first unlock a new garden, you MUST complete at least one portion of that new garden (get the first spectra item). Also, as you unlock more gardens, the appearance of the main menu area will liven up with beautiful plant-like structures. There are also various random hint nodes all across the menu that you can move to in order to receive fairly-helpful advice.Overall, if you are into atmospheric platformers with a unique artstyle, you must try out this game.Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												PixelJunk Eden is one of those 'Arty"" 'Indie' games, the kind you can't seem to describe. You play this little figure with floppy ears on its nose, hoping from one plant to plant in a giant garden, smashing into these drifting spores to create more plants, gathering amoebas to help stave off the timer while you look for five 'Spectras' in each garden. Its not a profound premise, but at least original.Let's say it right now, this is a pretty game. When you find a rhythm you'll fall into a zen mode watching your character zip around on a dynamic and pleasing back drop, charmed by the smooth animations of the blossoming plants swaying slowly in an unfelt wind. Its accompanied by a minimalist electronic soundtrack done by graphic designer 'Baiyon'; I never heard of him either nor would I say his music is that memorable. But the rest of the design team must of been proud enough too give him top billing. But I think that is my biggest problem with the game.Its too self indulgent...Because of PixelJunk Eden's engrossing and viberate art style, actually playing the game can be very troublesome, very often, not to mention slow. The controls require careful study to ensure you've executed a jump successful, else you being falling a ways and starting you long climb again. The game will let you recover yourself, but the penalty too do so makes it seldom worthwhile. And if you fall all the way to the bottom of the garden, you come to understand how easy it is to get lost in a garden (but the menu is the worst for this, of all things), The game is also very unforgiving with its timer, too many times I'm desperately seeking out a batch of amoebas to spare my life; and yet the scant enemies in the game are a total pushover, requiring an intention bump to split them up and second strike to finish most of them. All in all it almost feels like the gameplay mechanics were an afterthought.Oddly this game kindly reminds me alot of the Diddy Kong Racing remake for the Nintendo DS back in 2007. That otherwise stirling game was ruined by its♥♥♥♥♥♥poor impletation of the DS controls as much as PixelJunk Eden was hurt by its ruling design aesthetic. Perhaps if the games had a slightly less intrusive style I could come to grips with its gameplay. But like many other indie Magnum opus' out there, PixelJunk Eden is just too 'Arty' for its own good.			"

												PixelJunk Eden is an exploratory platformer well worth playing for those who like their grinding to have tangible results.  Enemies turn into  what amount to keys.  Doors are plants you get to watch grow.  If you can find a space then you can work to change it.Bonus points go to the developers for adding optional gamepad controls back after fan outcry.Negatives include a timer which is sometimes made even more frustrating by the absence of maps.  The latter pulls double duty on the hub world where figuring out how to navigate between gardens can sometimes be a pain.			"

												PixelJunk Eden is hard to describe to people.It is really addictive & very easy to lose a few hours into.The music , simplicity and vibrant visuals really draws you in.Once you get into the game it starts to get more challenging making it more interesting.I really like how they made the mouse controls for the PC version.I had previously played this on PSN and really enjoyed the controls using the dualshock controller so was intrigued to see how the mouse controls were.(there is also an option for classic controls which work well with the xbox360 controller)I would recommend this game as something to pass the time when you want something different to play.The only downside to it is that it doesn't run in windowed mode.I also experienced problems initially due to no windowed mode as my firewall notifications were hidden, causing the game to blackscreen & hardlock the system (this was sorted by manually adding the game exe to the firewall whitelist) "

												Crisp, high-definition graphics and a thumping soundtrack.

												Pretty, relaxing, a kind of modern cross between Bugaboo The Flea and the lonely trek of Rare's Bubbler. Lovely, although easily slipping into ""monotonous and pointless"" if you don't like this sort of thing. The garden designs get a little annoying later on, but are never impossibly challenging. If anything the biggest problem is the lack of a map, but the layouts are sparse enough that you can hold them in your memory, particularly if you concentrate on one garden at a time. Recommended if you want a spell in the chillout room of gaming.			"

												A very relaxing, casual yet challenging game utilizing simple swing, jump, and warp mechanics to collect glowing plant-shaped things called 'spectra'. With each additional spectra collected the player unlocks additional levels or 'gardens' which unlocks further areas to explore each with its set of obstacles and challenges getting in your way of collecting spectra.Within each garden, the player is fighting against time (shown at the bottom as a slowly depleting bar) to find spectra. The player has to collect pollen and grow plants which acts as platforms which the player can utilize to gain access to previously unreachable areas.The beginning of the game may feel confusing as there are no clear directions and spectra may be frustratingly hard to find. Controlling the little character can also be quite infuriating at times especially when a failed jump may delay your progress substantially. However the objective of the game IS to explore and find these spectra, so the lack of direction is just part of the game experience in my opinion.The art in this game is very pleasing to the eye, composed of a fusion of various shapes and colors. The music is calming and somewhat mysterious, very fitting of the visuals. Overall the game is rather enjoyable and something I would definitely recommend to try. The price may be a little high for some, buying it when it is on sale would be wise.			"

Now including gamepad support, the PC port improves in little touches -- the five Spectra are now collected individually, instead of in one run, and the mouse controls are surprisingly easy, allowing for one-handed play. Downsides include the continued presence of the synchronisation meter (a potentially stress-inducing timer, but usually easy to refill) and the absence of multiplayer.An artsy, bumping-electronica platformer that's cute, fun, mostly relaxing and good in short or lengthy sessions.The Pixeljunk series, and Q-Games, are one of the few franchises and studios that make me anticipate the next game.

I don't know what to say besides the music is amazing, endless and simple. The enemies are pretty crazy in the later gardens but there are videos that can show you where everything is in a sense. I really liked that the Steam edition came with the DLC, the extra 5 gardens where really amazing and it extended the life of the game very well. I always like to mention what I paid for a game or where I got it, because that can effect my review, but I feel like I may have caught this on a Steam sale and picked it up for nestalgia since I had never beaten it. Now I can live out my days knowing how godly hard perfecting this game was. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT AN EASY GAME. This is not one.			"

												Part exploration game, part platformer. It's beautiful and relaxing at first, just swinging around and exploring the world. You jump and spin around, collecting pollen and growing plants, which allows you to explore more of the garden. The controls remain simplistic, but as you progress to new gardens, the environment has new mechanics which are cool, interesting, and sometimes downright frustrating. That won't stop you from coming back for more though!Non-linear gameplay allows you to skip forward to any garden you have unlocked or replay any previous garden, and there is no set path for exploring within. Growing new pieces of the garden looks and feels like you're painting new pieces of the environment. It's engaging, both visually and mechanically.I enjoyed the music at first, but I couldn't listen to it for long. The ever-present pulsing beat made it feel like I'd been in a nightclub too long. Game options allowed me to turn off the music but keep the sound effects, so I could turn on my own music instead and carry on playing.			"

												This game is great, its relaxing, fun and challenging at the same time. The atmosphere of the game allows you to feel very relaxed yet the challenge of completing the garden is fun keeps the game exciting. The visuals of the garden can be a little disorienting at times as I have gotten lost the field sometimes; but thats part of the game. Each stage is unique it its own way and accompanied by a specific soundtrack for each (as I have experienced so far) it keeps the feeling of discovery alive in this game. The controls are easy to learn and as you unlock new gardens you get new skills and enemies. I feel that this game is a part of a new wave of games to come, or a type of game to blossom further. With calm visuals and a winning soundtrack; PJE is a game that will keep you happy.			"

												PixelJunk Eden is not your traditional platformer because there are no platforms. Instead you collect pollen to grow plants and flowers which allow you to leap and soar upward to new heights. The game offers hallucinogenic visuals and complementary music. It's a soothing game for the most part, that is, until you find yourself plummeting to the floor because you missed that last jump. Climb higher and higher to find Spectra in each garden to unlock more gardens. Each garden gets progressively harder with enemies that stand in your way. Simple, yet challenging, Eden definitely offers a gaming experience like nothing else.			"

												I played this game a lot on the Playstation 3. It was great. I remember trying to collect as many trophies as possible. Loved the style and the music; very soothing, but I hated the timer (I hate time based missions in general). Thankfully Q-Games has managed to add some new features which make the game less frustrating. Now you have no reason not to play this wonderful game.[Rating: 83/100]			"

												I adore the Pixeljunk games on PSN, and I'm glad to see that this one has made its way to PC. If the others do, I'll probably re-purchase them all well just to support the developers. This game is, at its heart, a platformer, but the experience is enhanced by the abstract stylization and the awesome soundtrack by Japanese artist, Baiyon. The timer on the levels may make the game frustrating for some, as it ""forces"" a pace that one may otherwise decide to do leisurely. While the controls have been ""reimagined"" for the PC and mouse usage, I still find the game more comfortable and intuitive to play using a gamepad, especially when navigating the trickier parts of the levels high up (though the new checkpoint system also mitigates the frustration of falling back to the ground). For any fan of music games and/or platformers, I think it's definitely worth the full price and more than worth any sale price. I'd highly recommend picking up the soundtrack pack.			"

												Trippy. @.@ Definitely an adjective that behooves this 'silk-wire' 2D platformer...yet, Pixel Eden is simultaneously the most relaxing *and* most absorbing game I've played in some time. Each of the maneuvers links with the rest subtely; each of the levels presents a fresh take on the seed/Spectra target. Baiyon's contributions to the art and audio direction are simply impressive, to my view, and Dylan Cuthbert has got my attention in the realm of gaming now. Give it a look-see if ya'd like to try somethin' a little less hectic. =]			"

												Has some pretty visuals and decent music (sometimes gets a bit repetitive).  The controls are pretty basic as they are essentially limited to the mouse.  There are a good number of levels to complete, but there's really not much variety in enemies and you are tasked with collecting five objects per level, which can become a bit tedious.  The game hasn't ever crashed and I never encountered a bug, which is good for an indie game.  My main problem is if you fall down, you're pretty much resigned to climbing all the way back up (at least for a portion of the game).  Worth it if you can get it on sale.			"

												PixelJunk Eden is a pretty unusual game. The gameplay is somewhat open, in that although there is a goal in each level (search for and collect the ""spectra""), there are a few different ways you can approach it. You can just jump around as much as possible, searching around for the spectra, fleeing from the occasional enemy, and sometimes making a mistake that lands you back at the bottom of the level. Or you can focus on collecting pollen and building the branches - playing it safe - until you just happen across the spectra naturally.The game is (intentionally) slow paced. Each level is basically the same as the last except that you meet new enemies and unlock new abilities as you complete each ""garden"". The soundtrack has a very ""indie"" feel to it, but it's decent - just a little repetetive.It runs decently on my 4 year-old low-end laptop that only runs TF2 at 10 fps. The game is clearly designed to use a mouse (some of the abilities require a scroll-wheel), but I have no problem playing it on my touchpad.In the end, I'm not entirely sure why I enjoy the game, but it serves as a good way to take a short break from work/studies and relax. It's carefully designed to be moderately engaging but almost never frustrating.			"

												It's not bad, but it's not really good either. I just don't wanna give a thumb down (since I reserved that for shouting-f-word-while-playing game).The worst part of the game is opening instruction, totally confusing. Until you play it like for 2hr and get to know the game, you might enjoy the game.It also did a bad job on designing when you go for challenge, i.e., no collectable item counting, no timing, and no quick restart. You'll only get a summary report after you've done a stage, which is really bad since each stage require 10-20 min to complete.Game machanic is still unique and enjoyable, however.			"

												An amazing, atmospheric platformer not quite like anything else. The PC version fixes the most annoying aspect of the PS3 release (having to get 1 spectra, then 2, then 3... then 5 per level) drastically cutting down on forced repetition.Worth it for the grooves and trippy visuals alone, but the gameplay is quite fun here, especially with 2 or 3 people playing co op (though some harder levels make co op a fussy affair). If you want something a little different, this is a great game. Each new level feels like a fresh adventure and I felt myself willing to progress if only to see what would happen next. The world evolves each Spectra (collectible ""goal"" items) you grab, adding more and more vibrancy to the flat and stylistic levels. Controls are unusual but fun and have their own sort of skill.

												I'm aware that PixelJUNK Eden is supposed to be relaxing experience through music and art but in addition to poor gameplay I feel it fails miserably in those too. First of all you play this little pink fetus that's floating in your typical mushroom kingdom. You can only jump and guide the flying a little and that's it. You can hit things that start growing more platforms for you to grab or jump at things that give you points. Too bad that the jumping feels terrible and here where the relaxing never happens: you can't be sure which parts of the ""flowers"" your fetus can grab and which are the ones that you just fly through. You keep on jumping upwards but if you can't get a hold you drop back down and start the climbing again. This is not what I find relaxing. Then there's the art which comes down to your preferences. I disliked the shroomy atmosphere and the soundtrack that puts you into elevator mode for all eternity. If it's club music I start going out to libraries instead. More action, more fun and probably better beats too. Luckily I got this game from a bundle so I basically didn't pay a dime for it. There's also been some news about indie gamemakers fearing for their income and this game is one of the examples why the market isn't what it used to be. This game is pay2lose.			"

												Not a very bad game, but not a good one. The experience becomes more frustrating and boring than fresh very quickly.There are only a couple levels and you have to do them over and over to collect things that don't do much except unlock another level.You have to complete each level in a limited time (but you collect crystals to gain time too) and it doesn't reset between getting out and back in the level.What does reset is your long ascension to the top if you die, miss a jump (often) or collect all mission objectives. You have to start from the bottom, taking quite a long time to get back to the top. If it's after dying, ok, but if it's after missing a jump, the crystals you collected along the way don't reset, so you'll have less of them to gain back some time.The levels get too colorful too, in a distracting way, with a soundtrack that sounds like crap half of the time (that might be more closely tied to my personal preference than any of the other points though).It's not the worst game, but I don't recommend it in any way. It's more bad than good by the end.			"

												This game is an evolving 2d platformer that fails to entertain due to pacing issues.You play as a missile that tosses himself around to get randomly generated flying building materials so that he can build more platforms, which lets him reach higher heights. The missile repeats this, over and over, until he can get THE special building material that he uses to unlock more stages; the newer stages repeat the same gameplay but with more jumping tactics and enemies that drain your character's health. Repeat this 75x and you basically get the game. The in-game music sounds like it was selected from a ringtone catalog; like bad house music. The platforms are phallic.			"

												I'm halfway through this game and I still don't understand what I'm doing, but I know that it is fun. Eden is a near-hallucinatory experience with a fantastic soundtrack, established style, and unique gameplay. If Dig Dug stopped digging and decided to roam the trees and coral mountains of distant worlds in pursuit of the mysterious Spectra- using nothing but a grappling hook and mastery of momentum, the result might be similar to Eden. You can't fly in Eden, instead you must master the game's physics and use the environments to your advantage. I think that somewhere hidden in this game is the implication that you are a sort of bee/spider-angel spreading pollen for God in the gardens of Eden. But then... where do all of these music references (encores and oscillators, etc.) fit in to that idea? I don't know... I prefer to think of the character as a representation of Albert Hofmann climbing trees in his back yard after Bicycle Day, but that's just me.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I just can't.  What the hell was the hype about? I can only assume it's because it was aired on the PS3, and the people playing this are new to this sort of platformer.    One of the first games I played back in 1983 or thereabouts was called ""Bugaboo the Flea"", and involved a little flea, trying to jump left or right to climb out of a hole, while a pterodactyl stalked him.  If you like this game, go back and see the similarities to that game, and then tell me with a straight face that this is totally original ;) Good:  The music is oookay.. It's not Circuits or Bastion, but it's okay.  The graphics are minimalist, but nice..  Rotatey-scaley-sprite. The controls are oookay.  Take a bit of getting used to, but it's manageable with a touchpad... The first few levels are designed to be fun and casual.. Enjoyable...Bad:  But Level 8 is the watershed..At level 8, the game goes from fun to absolutely dowright, massively, fist-clenchingly shoutily, infuriating.  As you can see, I put quite a few hours into the game.. Most of them trying to get the last ""spectra"" in Level 8.  I got pretty good in the end.. I could pyoing up, bounce, swing, pyoing, bounce.. etc..  over to the last island... But... If you♥♥♥♥♥♥up and fall off JUST ONCE, you must stop and go find more energy, which takes energy....  If you call, you must start aaaaaall the way from the begining. Using the ""jump reset"" uses too much energy... If you rush about, get energy, swing over..  you cannot  make a single mistake, cos getting energy, takes energy... What makes it worse.. I think there's a one-way switch at the very end that , once switched, means you cannot proceed!  You MUST exit and start the WHOLE THING over again!!!   I tried to undo the 'flip' but it wouldn't!   Here's a MASSIVE Tip for you.  Before you collect the fourth spectra, make sure you have ALMOST ALL of the plants grown to get down to the fifth one, or else you will be stopped cold at this level.I can see which way this game is going...  - Make the islands smaller and smaller.   - Move the 'seeds' further and further offscreen requiring more blind leaps. - Add more enemies that come and snap your silk while trying to line up a perfect jump - Make the drop back to the beginning further and further.Gah!   The energy thing just made this game too effing infuriating for me.  If it was used up slower,  or there was more energy dropped by popping pollen, that would be less aggravating.. But the way it is now... Naw.  I got better games to be playing.   This one just makes my blood boil.  My wife, hearing me shout ""F*** YOU!!!"" at the game for the umpteenth time, just said ""If it's not fun, why are you playing it?"".  I just looked up, thought ""dammit, she's right!"", and uninstalled Eden.  I couldn't be happier right now.To all my friends who may read this:  Do not play this game.  It's a time sink, with levels designed to just get harder and harder, and pee you off more and more.  Go play Circuits, Bastion, Kerbal Space Program, VVVVVVV, Terraria,   anything.. just not this.

												A generally great game brought down by one odd design choice. The time limit, specifically; it goes against the nature of an exploration game like this mostly is. Fortunately the main stresses of the time limit can be avoided by playing the game ""incorrectly""; open all the seeds (or just as many as you need to if you don't care about the achievements) before getting any spectra, and you tend to have plenty of time to get everything without having to worry too often. That aside... pretty great game. The art style is fantastic, the gardens all are pretty unique too. There are gimmicks in some of them that vary in quality, but only are really a bit too obstructive in one level. The Eden Encore levels, also, are all quite good, better than the main game even if they're generally more difficult. All-in-all if you can learn how to play the game to get the most enjoyment out of it you will likely get a lot of enjoyment in the end.Note: Don't care for the music, personally, but it's not a major issue.

												If you've played the PS3 version... you'll find this version to be different. It's not bad but it's the little things that you notice, I would recommend the Steam version of Eden if you really LOVE Eden and you love supporting PixelJunk in all there fun games otherwise it's not a completely polished port and seems below PixelJunk's standards from what I am used to on Playstation.  While it *supports* controllers after enabling legacy controls, it lacks support for bluetooth controlls. I use a PS3 Controller via SCP and this is the only game where I have to remove the bluetooth drivers and connect USB to use the controller.  Jumping will always throw a thread, need to double jump to just jump... feel unnatural. This was not the case with PS3 version where you help jump when you wanted to hold onto your thread.   This may just be my memory, but I recall all skills (reeling in, drop attach, etc) being available off the bat. Now you are forced to play certain levels before you unlock those skillsOtherwise it is pretty and everything you love in Eden... Haven't attempted to use multiple controllers... not sure if local co-op is functioning.			"

It's pretty relaxing, could be played with mouse only and it does not require a lot of your time, so the game is not needy or grindy at all. Just exlore, jump from plant to plant, collect stuff, polenate stuff, grapple-hook to stuff... And stuff. Yeah. It's a nice game.			"

												Honestly wasn't impressed. The atmosphere, art direction, and music was solid, but thats about it. The platforming is ok, but control over the character isn't very good. There is like no direction on where to go. If you have collected a certain number of ""whatever theyre called"" and you go back to a level there is no indication where the other ones are. Sometimes the screen flashes but thats not every time and only when you're close. This leads to a lot of wondering around. Also they are sometimes in a space that you can't figure out how to get to. The level map has no direction as its just a bunch of random circles in an open area....something much more streamlined and helpful would have been nice. The swinging is really touchy and doesn't work like its supposed to. Sometimes you won't press the button but it will keep making you make ropes on things. Other times you will press the button and it won't make a rope. Controlling the swinging doesn't work as easy as it should. Also the jumping feels a little too floaty and has a lack of control in the air. There is no story as well. The game is jsut very repetitive, you just collect seeds to grown plants and try to wander around and get higher to collect a seed to open a new area. There are like no enemies and they don't really do anything. There are no bosses and every level feels the EXACT same and you do the EXACT same, but with a different background. The other big problem is the progression structure. I don't know why pixeljunk thinks adding in this stupid collectible game to move forward is a good idea, but it's stupid here. You have to replay levels to try and find more seeds to open up more. I got multiple seeds from every level I played and you have to get more from each one as you progress. I had beaten every area I had and still had to get 4 more seeds to progress 1 level further. With the lack of direction of where to get them I just got sick and gave up. It's not as good as shooter. 5.5/10.			"

												I love these Indi-bundle random games I get.  I do however feel bad for some reason when I do not invest a lot of time into them. I am just about ADHD with games and most lose me in 1.5 hours.... this one did just that.A fun and simple game.  The basic idea is you jump around hitting things and touching the broken parts to cause circles to fill.  Once they fill a plant will grow... leading to the object you need to finish the level.  Has 10 normal levels and a bonus area with more levels.  I stopped around level 6. It slowly introduces new abilities like teleport, ect: but overall I found myself bored after an hour since the gameplay is not challenging.If you like simple indi-games.  This is a decent run - I think you can 100% this game in 6-8 hours.			"

												Most of the time, when I wright a review on steam I go into detail.I cant, this game is just extremely boring. You move slowly, the jump feels awkward, the game play is not engaging on any level. I would go so far to even complain about the 'music' but I don't think it would be correct to say that it was bad, just that... well it was not my cup of tea. Don't waist you money, even if this thing is on sale its not worth it. In the mean time, how about you go take a look at Savant! I picked that up today, havent wrote anything for it yet but, if you want to spend a bit of cash so badly, pick up Savant insted. Its only 2 USD and it will be the best 2 dollars you have ever spent on steam.			"

												I think I'm playing a swinging happy spider who is collecting pollen and DNA chunks in order to make some seeds grow, and then jump on higher plants and reach the higher spectra (you need the spectra to go to the next level). The music is ambient trance, and gets dull after a while. The levels are also quite repetitive. The colors are beautiful, the motion is fluid, but due to the dull music and the repetitive nature of this game, you might get bored soon. You could say that psychedelic trance and fluid motion and colors would make this game a great videowall for clubs, or a good game if you get high on magic mushroom. I'll try to beat this game, but I can't promise I'll make it through.			"

												There's a lot of things I really like about this game, but two main things I very strongly dislike. I really like the atmosphere created by the game - the music, the colors, the concept. I also really like this type of ambient puzzle game. I bought this game really hoping for a good, relaxing puzzle game that I can play when I don't really want to think about much, and the game definitely delivers in this regard.But two things really break it for me. Entering and exiting levels sucks. You can't just pick a level to play in. You have to search all over for the entrance to the level. And if that particular level happens to net you one of those things that you're collecting, it will shoot you out of the level and on to the next, wether you're done or not.The second thing is the energy. Sometimes, I just want to be able to float around and explore, but I am always having to worry about how much energy I have and finding those energy capsules so I don't die. This game would be so much better if you have the option to play with or without energy. As it is, it adds a level of stress to the game that I really just don't want when I'm playing a game that I want to be able to relax in and turn my mind off while playing.			"

												I have to say that Eden is probably one of my favorite games when I'm looking for something to play that isn't going to frustrate me. The entire concept of making the maps evolve and grow, along with the fluidity of transition between levels makes it entirely possible to lose yourself in the game and play for HOURS!The music is fun and poppy and changes with the levels, as do the backgrounds and even the physics in certain maps!!! Ain't that stellar!? You get an incredible amount of content for a very reasonable price! And the system specs aren't ridiculous so it's great to play on a regular, non-gaming laptop to pass time!I love it!			"

												I didn't know exactly what I was going for. I just added it to my wishlist because I thought it looked cool. I just bought it during the summer sales and I definitely don't regret doing so. The music, design and gameplay are nice and well executed. What I found weird is the inversion of the mouse buttons which is not very instinctive, but you can revert it in the settings so no biggie here. I love the big number of levels, the only thing that disappointed me is that you need to redo the same level more than once looking for spectras to unlock the next garden. The enemies are annoying, but not really challenging. It's probably one of my favourite casual games among those that I own on Steam.			"

The music is really good and the mechanics are somewhat simple. I think that it is pretty cool that you only really need to use your mouse. Infact, every move you can do in the game is mapped to your mouse. I would definitely reccommend it to a casual gamer that just wants to kill some time.			"

												Playing this game is euphoric, it combines a wonderful soundtrack with a unique style of gameplay. You move through the world by jumping, swinging, and grabbing your way around 'plants' that you collect 'pollen' to grow.You can stay in the lower gardens where there are less difficult levels or you can continue on through around 15-20 levels —a significant increase from it's PSN counterpart.(if I recall correctly) They also added a few cool new features such as the warp back to your last jump point at the cost of remaining time—Overall 9/10 8/10 Due to lack of multiplayer unlike the PS3 ver. :(No real action, but a great casual relaxing acrobatic puzzle game that you can even play with friends.

												If you are looking for a game that will captivate you without keeping you up at night, this might be the game. If you are looking for a well done soundtrack to compliment the artistic ambience of a game, this might be the game. If you like to collect items and explore new 'worlds,' this might be the game. If you answered yes to all three, then this is probably the game you want to get. Replayability is defintiely there, so don't think this will be a game you finish and never come back to. It's a low key, relaxing game about making plants grow and collecting spectra in the garden. No real story line, but for a laid back game that's not necessarily a bad thing. Not to mention the ability to have a remote chance of getting all the achievements--they aren't ridiculous or require a ton of work to get!This game is so much fun! The music is very well done and the game has all the perfect components of casual platformer; you should totalyl check this out!			"

												I purchased this game during the winter sale and have been playing it on and off. The visuals in this game are amazing and the level designs are creative and each unique in their own way, each level has a different feel to it. There are a few draw back unfortunately, first and foremost is the music, it's a repetivive dance track that varies in each stage but to me after hearing the same loop for the time i spent on the level i found myself turning the music off. My only other gripe with the game are the controls, it's very hard to get your player to go where you want it to go, enemies are hard to take down in odd situations, and you may find yourself doing the same jump several times over (i did, i believe it was level 6 or 7...very odd jump to get one of the required 'Spectras'), granted it's an odd game where (i think) your a little...something, collecting pollen to sprout seeds to find these little fairy looking things (Spectras). All in all it is an enjoyable game, something you can sit back and relax before the controls drive you mad. For me the level designs, look and concept of the game keeps me going back for more.			"

												Playing this game is euphoric, it combines a wonderful soundtrack with a unique style of gameplay. You move through the world by jumping, swinging, and grabbing your way around 'plants' that you collect 'pollen' to grow.You can stay in the lower gardens where there are less difficult levels or you can continue on through around 15-20 levels —a significant increase from it's PSN counterpart.(if I recall correctly) They also added a few cool new features such as the warp back to your last jump point at the cost of remaining time—Overall 9/10 8/10 Due to lack of multiplayer unlike the PS3 ver. :(No real action, but a great casual relaxing acrobatic puzzle game that you can even play with friends.

It's also frustrating at times when you get high up and accidentally miss a jump and fall faaaaaaar down, but you never feel like you can't get back there with a little work.Edit: I have learned a game mechanic that lets you teleport to the most recent ""latch"" - fixes issue above.

												PixelJunk Eden plays as much like a high-flying physics momentum game as it does a platformer.  If you enjoy physics puzzles and collectathon games this is probably a must have game.  I really enjoyed how the mechanics in this game lend themselves to varying levels of difficulty.  If you break up multiple enemies in one jump, it allows you to progress faster so learning how to find those opportunities is critical to efficient runs.  The only annoying part of this to me was having to worry about energy management; it didn't seem to add much difficulty but would just generally get in the way of the fun parts of the game.  Even after you've beaten the game there's plenty to go back and do if you're up for mastering each level.			"

												This is actually a really beautiful game.  Its simple premise makes it very enjoyable.  The music is great, and the graphics are gorgeous.  It is a port from the PSN, but even there it was top of its game.pros: it is simple.  You guide a creature around a garden and try to find all the spectra.  These open other gardens, and provide energy to the existing one.          Kids will enjoy  just about everything in this game, albeit, for short time. It does get more difficult as you progress.         Decent replay value.  It has leader boards and keeps track of time and previous scores.cons: it does get a bit frustrating.          a little too difficult to call it casual.A must have if can get it on sale, or a bundle.  Otherwise you may think its tad pricey for the style of game.			"

												Pixeljunk Eden is an indie game developed by Q-Game. The music for the game was composed by a man who is referred to in game as Baiyon. Indie games are projects involving smaller teams with stricter budgets and often showcase a much needed level of creativity in the gaming industry today.The game involves a tadpole like creature soaring seamlessly through lush environments and vibrant flora in order to collect a special type of object called Spectra.The levels are referred to as gardens and the player takes an active role in their creation. Various floating pollen clouds are scattered through the gardens and touching them causes the closest un-blossomed flower to begin to bloom.As the plants grow the garden bursts into life and new visual imagery and heights can be reached. As the player continues through the gardens the flowers blooming become increasingly larger and more detailed.The music in the game is what sets it apart from a lot of other games in the gaming industry. Entirely composed by Baiyon, the soundtrack showcases amazing techno and sublime trance that adds to the immersive experience of the game.Pixeljunk Eden is a captivating and innovative game idea that offers players of all ages a visually spectacular and musically rich experience.

												I got this game in a humble bundle years ago., if you don't own this game yet, you are missing out by miles.I have since sampled the other pixeljunk games and I conclude that this is their magnum opus. The game itself is simple in its operation: jumping, spinning, web-slinging and ground (or sky) pounding your way through an Eden of sound. The more life you spread through the area, the more intense the music becomes, the higher your score gets. The interplay between light and sound in this game is simple, pure and effective, making what might otherwise be a monotonous game into a true gaming gem. The artful style of this game shines high above pixeljunk shooter's comparably infantile gameplay and the overly simple faced pixeljunk monsters. But the style alone does not make it great, the gameplay too is razor sharp. Simple controls allow for intuitive movement through the levels, using momentum and quick reflexes to reach speeds and heights neccesary to awaken the furthest reaches of each garden. The control of the game allows anyone to get into the game proper, and ride the difficulty curve as they please. This is a fairly low-stress game, as long as you keep an eye out for nasties and try not to fall all the way back down, you'll find very little pressure from the game to be fast, or efficient. There is a draining health bar, but suppliments are so common in-game it serves most purpose during combat. It does also create that special spark of drama, leaving a combat on low health and half-way up a garden, and urging you to find more dust quickly. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a good long while, featuring cool and relaxed electronic music, that provides enough rhythmic backbone without being overly intense or dramatic. The game as a whole is fairly clean from modern gaming cliche and is a welcome change from pretty much everything.So, if you are looking to relax into a hypnotic electronic music arcade game art world from an arena of high-maintenence, major league, time-limited, bland and corporate gaming, Pixeljunk Eden is the game you need to buy.PS, it has world and friend ranked leaderboards if you didn't want to relax ;>			"

I've played both the PS3 version and the STEAM PC version and the PC controls are WAY better than the playstation controls. That space bar press that saves you from falling really far is essential for not running out of time in the hard levels.  "

												Got this game back when it was released on Playstation Network. Never actually finished it or anything, but loved the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. The music is awesome and in perfect synergy with the rest of the game.Recently picked this up for a very good price on Steam and been enjoying it again on PC. The Steam version includes the Encore DLC pack which is nice. Controls we're a bit weird for me at the beginning because I used to play the console version, but now I think it's actually easier with the mouse.I saw a lot of reviews / posts about this PC port is a fail, but I think they resolved these issues by now because I haven't experienced any issues so far.The only thing I cannot say for sure about this game is wether or not multiplayer got ported too;On the PS3 version you could hook up an extra controller and play with up to 3 friends, this was awesome, but is there anyone who can confirm it works on PC too? The ""amount of players"" indicator is showing in my garden, so I would assume so, but I can't test this at this point because Windows 10 preview doesn't play well with DualShock Controllers yet :PAnyway, if you love atmospheric no brainers with an awesome soundtrack, be sure to get this game!

It is a nice distraction from all the other violent games out there. Really nice ambient music, the game is really good for relaxation. However, you may not do much relaxingt when you hit the other more difficult levels, but you could always go back and replay your easier favorite levels. The replay value of this game really blindsided me, there are few games that I can really play over and over again. This is one of them.			"

With keyboard and mouse (mostly mouse), I've found the controls real easy, so far at least. Haven't found anything negative about this game, so am happily surprised with it. If you don't want to get it for $10, wait for a sale (or you could get the humble deal and get a whole bunch of other games too), I think it's certainly worth giving this game a try.			"

												Most infuriating ""zen"" game I've ever played.Think of this like one of those old nes ""tower platformers"". Your goal is essentially to get to the top of your garden, but if you miss a platform or the physics engine is bored, you'll fall to the bottom and have to work your way back up. The physics of this game make me cry. The platforming is sticky, but really, REALLY floaty, to control yourself in midair, you have to hold down the mouse button, but if you want to land on a platform you have to let go of the mouse button before you reach the platform. Trust me when I say this is far more annoying than it sounds. You'll more often than not have the floaty controls send your little dude plummetting to the ground, which should cause you to not be very ""zen"".The physics are slightly broken aswell. If you're on a spring board, and are being pushed upwards by the kinetic force, if you then JUMP as the spring reaches its apex, you should be launched into the air, right? haha, no. In Eden, that is the WORST thing you can possibly do, as this will make you fall through the platform. To get the biggest air you need to press the jump button when the platform has the most POTENTIAL energy, in other words, springboards in this game work the exact opposite of how they work in real life.If you can get used to the appauling physics and infuriating gameplay though, Eden is actually pretty fun. Solid idea, pretty graphics, rewarding completionist title and great soundtrack. If you don't have a heart condition or anger issues, please try this ""zen"" game.			"

												Great casual game with a subtle but catchy soundtrack. The art style is visually pleasing along with the colours and effects. This some-what simplistic game fits great when you want to play some casual but still stimulating game when you're not in the mood for more aggressive games.The gameplay is simple but can get challenging as you progress in Gardens (stages)However, the game does become monotonous after playing for a long time, so highly recommended in small doses			"

YouTube™ Video: Should I Buy? PixelJunk Eden - (Quick Video Game Review) 

			Views: 2,606		

			Quick Review of PixelJunk Eden http://store.steampowered.com/app/105800/		

GeneralThe trailer video for this game is as terrible and useless as the game itself is brilliant. The best description of this game that I can think of is ""zen arcade"". You control a little character which can jump and swing about, collecting things and generally exploring.I found that exploring each garden (ie. level) with its different ""ecosystem"" and striving to make every seed grow to be a great deal of fun. There is a lot of replayability if you enjoy beating your own, or other people's high scores.All in all, I would say that this game is interestingly quirky, and I love it for that.GameplayThere are five fancy looking icons (called spectra) on each level and you need to collect them. That's about the entire goal of the game. In order to reach the five icons you need to collect pollen to make seeds grow so that you have more plants to climb up and swing off of. Although this sounds quite simple, if you're like me, don't underestimate the joy of exploration.The gameplay itself is rather relaxing and is (usually) enhanced by the colours and art style. I say usually because there were some levels where I found the moving background to be very unpleasant and disorientating (although I do realise this is meant to make the levels more challenging, I don't like feeling ill).ControlsI found the movement controls to be engaging, easy to grasp and a little harder to master. It can become frustrating when you're trying to release from your swing at the right time in order to get the perfect trajectory to hit quite a small landing pad which isn't even on the screen when you launch! This makes some levels quite challenging, but I never felt like it was completely beyond me to get through them.StorylineThere isn't a storyline per se because there isn't anything much to read. It does feel like you go through a journey with your strange little character, and you get a sense that you're restoring order to the gardens in some way.I'd say that this game's story is more about your own experience of playing it rather than anything else. It was interesting.SoundThe music is very upbeat, modern and abstract to my ear. You may infer from that statement that I'm not a fan of modern, abstract music, however I didn't find the music in this game to be obnoxious. It creates an interesting atmosphere and certainly supports the stylized concept the creators envisioned.GraphicsGenerally I'd say that the graphics aren't astonishing, it's more about the design of the game. It has clearly been designed and has some interesting layered effects to give depth to each garden. I fully appreciate the careful balance between texture and flat colour to create a bold contrast and powerful visual environment for this game.Each level, or garden, is randomly coloured each time you enter it. This gives the game an interesting design aspect because it's essentially experimenting with variation of colour and repetition of shape (garden layout).For most readers though, the important thing is that the graphics make the game what it is, and they are functionally relevant.Pros+ easy to learn, hard to master+ replayability of gardens+ bold graphic style creates a unique world+ real sense of free exploration despite finite garden sizesCons- purposefully disorientating levels can cause motion sickness- the bold style gets old after a whileHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.Rothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot comFootnotes*Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see. The primary price I list at the top is the price that I bought the game at.**I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise. Remember that these are external websites and I'm just trying to be helpful - I'm not responsible for the content on the other end.Edit Log18/02/2015 formatting			"

												Nice platform game where you play the part of a bug jumping from flower to flower in a psychedelic garden, looking for seeds.Beautiful and original graphics together with nice music make for an original and relaxing experience.The game mechanics are a bit unusual since you can do mostly four things: when you're on the ground either jumping or ""playing Spiderman"", when you're in the air either floating or jumping back to the ground. The advanced levels usually ad some twists to the above, in order to keep the game fresh.The game is not perfect though, and has two issues.The first is that the some of the  advanced levels are quite difficult and unforgiving, transforming what should be a relaxing game into a source of frustration. The second is that some levels are really huge, and since there is no minimap you can easily get lost, making you waste quite some time looking for your target.			"

												I am a bit ambivalent about giving this game a rating. It's a game... barely. There is not much content here, it's more sort of a floaty tech demo. It could easily have been one of those free Flash games.Still, I like it enough to give it a thumbs up. But, buy it when it's under €5,-.ProsGraphics are quite nice (simple, but nice).Music is soothing and fits the style.When things go your way, it's a nice relaxing experience.ConsIt can barely be called a game. It's a one trick pony.Falling... when you fall to the ground it's really frustrating.There is a time limit. Why? It induces needless stress in a game that's supposed to be fairly zen like.Did I mention the frustration of falling already? ;-) "

												Awesome game! Reminds me of Capsized, which is one of my faves. Both games are about flowing to the music, though Capsized is much more combat-oriented. Eden is much more casual, more of a lounge experience with classier electronic music and more modern-looking art design. Even the level (or ""Garden"") selection screen is a part of the gaming experience. Attaining full achievements has become an addiction for me with this one, though I don't know if I'll be able to pull it off. This title has jumped to the top of my favorites list. I almost never give a full  10/10  score for a game, but for this one I think I have to.			"

												Good stuff. I suppose technically it'd be a puzzle platformer in some sort of loose sense, but the puzzles are mostly about exploration, and the platforming is very floaty and mostly involves swinging around on a tether, not precision jumping on platforms. It's really about how you get from here to there, and you're not usually particularly in a hurry to do it (there is a time limit, but you can collect things to restore how much time you have left), and you don't even necessarily know where ""there"" is other than a general direction until you find it. The controls are very simple, and there are only a handful each of enemies and basic elements the levels are constructed from, which are introduced one at a time throughout the game, but despite that each level has a distinct theme and personality and feels entirely unique. There generally isn't much especially difficult in the game, but it feels satisfying to fully explore a level and complete everything in it after you've discovered everything about it.			"

												Pixeljunk Eden is an indie game developed by Q-Game. The music for the game was composed by a man who is referred to in game as Baiyon. Indie games are projects involving smaller teams with stricter budgets and often showcase a much needed level of creativity in the gaming industry today.The game involves a tadpole like creature soaring seamlessly through lush environments and vibrant flora in order to collect a special type of object called Spectra.The levels are referred to as gardens and the player takes an active role in their creation. Various floating pollen clouds are scattered through the gardens and touching them causes the closest un-blossomed flower to begin to bloom.As the plants grow the garden bursts into life and new visual imagery and heights can be reached. As the player continues through the gardens the flowers blooming become increasingly larger and more detailed.The music in the game is what sets it apart from a lot of other games in the gaming industry. Entirely composed by Baiyon, the soundtrack showcases amazing techno and sublime trance that adds to the immersive experience of the game.Pixeljunk Eden is a captivating and innovative game idea that offers players of all ages a visually spectacular and musically rich experience.

												I picked this game up for a trifle on one of the holiday sales and sat on it for months without any enthusiasm for what I expected it to be.  When I finally started playing it, I was pleasantly surprised with what I found.  The concept is simple (jump and swing about on a 2D map to collect goodies while avoiding unfriendly encounters), but the execution is elegant and easy to enjoy.  I have not come across anything terribly difficult (though I still have a lot of the game yet to play, so that might well change), but the goals take enough thought and effort to give satisfaction when a stage is completed.  This may not be a hard-core gamer's game, but it is a relaxing time killer that is easy to break into small doses (just be warned that you will be sorely tempted to play ""just one more round"" when you really have other things you should be doing).

												Got this game back when it was released on Playstation Network. Never actually finished it or anything, but loved the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. The music is awesome and in perfect synergy with the rest of the game.Recently picked this up for a very good price on Steam and been enjoying it again on PC. The Steam version includes the Encore DLC pack which is nice. Controls we're a bit weird for me at the beginning because I used to play the console version, but now I think it's actually easier with the mouse.I saw a lot of reviews / posts about this PC port is a fail, but I think they resolved these issues by now because I haven't experienced any issues so far.The only thing I cannot say for sure about this game is wether or not multiplayer got ported too;On the PS3 version you could hook up an extra controller and play with up to 3 friends, this was awesome, but is there anyone who can confirm it works on PC too? The ""amount of players"" indicator is showing in my garden, so I would assume so, but I can't test this at this point because Windows 10 preview doesn't play well with DualShock Controllers yet :PAnyway, if you love atmospheric no brainers with an awesome soundtrack, be sure to get this game!

The entire concept of making the maps evolve and grow, along with the fluidity of transition between levels makes it entirely possible to lose yourself in the game and play for HOURS!The music is fun and poppy and changes with the levels, as do the backgrounds and even the physics in certain maps!!! Ain't that stellar!? You get an incredible amount of content for a very reasonable price! And the system specs aren't ridiculous so it's great to play on a regular, non-gaming laptop to pass time!I love it!			"

												I didn't know exactly what I was going for. I just added it to my wishlist because I thought it looked cool. I just bought it during the summer sales and I definitely don't regret doing so. The music, design and gameplay are nice and well executed. What I found weird is the inversion of the mouse buttons which is not very instinctive, but you can revert it in the settings so no biggie here. I love the big number of levels, the only thing that disappointed me is that you need to redo the same level more than once looking for spectras to unlock the next garden. The enemies are annoying, but not really challenging. It's probably one of my favourite casual games among those that I own on Steam.			"

												A very fun (even if frustrating at times) game with interesting visuals, simple mechanics and a great soundtrack.Each level feels different from the others, and most of them have unique conditions and configurations so there is variety within the simple frame of the game's mechanics. A few of the levels also feature puzzles that make completing them more challenging.Upon collecting a spectra in a garden (level) the game will pull you out of the garden and it may unlock a new garden to visit even before completing a previous one. After you have fully completed a level, you can play it again to collect all 5 spectra with no interruptions, or to try to activate all seeds and earn the corresponding achievement.The ""menu"" interface is also unique, since it is an actual garden (Eden) that you have to navigate in order to reach a the game level you want to play. An ""encore"" garden is also unlocked after you have collected a certain number of spectra, and in both vanilla and encore Eden gardens there are ...secrets to be found if you explore them after you have collected all the respective spectra.I've had much fun with the game, even though at times (especially before mastering the game)I was frustrated by not being able to properly navigate my avatar (miscalculated jumps, failed to grasp branches or grab onto a rock). The game even offers a mechanic to counter miscalculated platforming at the expense of some ""energy bars"" which can be replenished by (generating and/or) collecting crystals.			"

Here are the reasons why:- The controls are unintuitive, they give you hints early on to teach you about your various abilities, but as this is not the type of game you want to rush towards completion you could end up forgetting what you learned by the next time you play- The level design starting with level 4 is very bad, some spectra are super easy to reach, others are almost impossible to reach and rely on luck- The score and menu screen is a cluttered mess, I am sure no one ever looks at the score screen....- Whenever you unlock a new level, you are forced to play it and get a spectra before you can go back to the previous level and continue collecting spectra there- Whenever you get a spectra, you are forced to leave, view the score, and then go back in, this kills all immersion- It can be very tedious to navigate from one level to another. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if it weren't for the last two problems mentioned above- The music ranges between being really good and really bad.- This has the worst trailer out of all the games on steam, a title that used to belong to Escape goat 2's inane excuse for a trailer before they uploaded a normal one.

												A pretty good port of the PS3 game.  Some mechanics have been tweaked a little and if you've played the original that will be offputting.This is an indie platformer with quite a bit more than average aesthetic theme added to it.  Maps are very large and there are numberous goals that must be reached within each map, each with their own special trait.  Some are mundane (boosting pads to leapfrog you over barricades) to the mindboggling (counter-clockwise rotational gravity), and the game does increase in difficulty a fair measure as stages progress.  The aesthetic is again, very strong here.  The gameplay may not be very innovative but the style is far from generic.This comes with the DLC stages from the PS3 version already included, but not immediately accessible as the stage progressions have been altered slightly.  There are no online modes and offline coop has been removed, but it was an unuseful mode in my opinion as it was detractive rather than additive coop (more likely to hinder progression than assist).

												beautiful, unique artwork. the game starts out really relaxing and you are just kind of bouncing around making the flowers grow and you easily stumble into the goals. the later levels get much more difficult as enemies and gravity and sharp edges are added to the mix. I've played both the PS3 version and the STEAM PC version and the PC controls are WAY better than the playstation controls. That space bar press that saves you from falling really far is essential for not running out of time in the hard levels.  "

												This was one of my favorite indie games from the PS3, and I'm loving it more on my PC.  It's wonderfully immersive yet does not hinder casual gameplay.  Pick it up and play, then put it down and play again, or just lose yourself for hours in an abstract wonderland of motion and color.  Either way, PixelJunk Eden has a lot of fun to offer any kind of player.			"

												Pixeljunk Eden is an indie game developed by Q-Game. The music for the game was composed by a man who is referred to in game as Baiyon. Indie games are projects involving smaller teams with stricter budgets and often showcase a much needed level of creativity in the gaming industry today.The game involves a tadpole like creature soaring seamlessly through lush environments and vibrant flora in order to collect a special type of object called Spectra.The levels are referred to as gardens and the player takes an active role in their creation. Various floating pollen clouds are scattered through the gardens and touching them causes the closest un-blossomed flower to begin to bloom.As the plants grow the garden bursts into life and new visual imagery and heights can be reached. As the player continues through the gardens the flowers blooming become increasingly larger and more detailed.The music in the game is what sets it apart from a lot of other games in the gaming industry. Entirely composed by Baiyon, the soundtrack showcases amazing techno and sublime trance that adds to the immersive experience of the game.Pixeljunk Eden is a captivating and innovative game idea that offers players of all ages a visually spectacular and musically rich experience.

												Good stuff. I suppose technically it'd be a puzzle platformer in some sort of loose sense, but the puzzles are mostly about exploration, and the platforming is very floaty and mostly involves swinging around on a tether, not precision jumping on platforms. It's really about how you get from here to there, and you're not usually particularly in a hurry to do it (there is a time limit, but you can collect things to restore how much time you have left), and you don't even necessarily know where ""there"" is other than a general direction until you find it. The controls are very simple, and there are only a handful each of enemies and basic elements the levels are constructed from, which are introduced one at a time throughout the game, but despite that each level has a distinct theme and personality and feels entirely unique. There generally isn't much especially difficult in the game, but it feels satisfying to fully explore a level and complete everything in it after you've discovered everything about it.			"

The art style goes hand-in-hand with the music: electro, techno or whatever label you want to put on it. Very little is explained, yet very little needs to be explained, as you unlock new ""abilities"" you get hints that tell you how to use them. As you go around in Eden you collect pollen and grow new plants in your gardens and all that jazz. Awesome stuff.			"

It's okay for people who like that kind of music, but to me it just seems like a jumble of sounds and it gives me a headache. In my opinion, more slow, ambient music would have been more fitting.

												Please note, I am only about a sixth of the way through the game currently.So far, I have really enjoyed this game, the core mechanic is fun and unique, thie music is great, and the visuals are absolutely stunning. The game gives you a new ability every time a new level is unlocked, which vary from very useful to things I barely use, but they seem to be varied enough that the game won't become dull as it continues.The only real problem I have with this game as of yet is that the tutorial, what little there is, relies on a great deal of incomprehensible (at least until I'd played the game for an hour or so) jargon, making it quite difficult to start playing, however, once I got past the first couple of levels, things were starting to make a bit more sense, and thus the game became a great deal more enjoyable.Overall, probably an 8/10.

												A very simple game with incredibly aggravating controls. This is immediately apparent from the opening menu, which must be navigated the same way you navigate the levels (by jumping around). You would think you can navigate from one menu option to the next with a single jump right? You wish. Going between gardens is a chore in itself.Tedious, boring, and frustrating.			"

			Quick Review of PixelJunk Eden http://store.steampowered.com/app/105800/		

GeneralThe trailer video for this game is as terrible and useless as the game itself is brilliant. The best description of this game that I can think of is ""zen arcade"". You control a little character which can jump and swing about, collecting things and generally exploring.I found that exploring each garden (ie. level) with its different ""ecosystem"" and striving to make every seed grow to be a great deal of fun. There is a lot of replayability if you enjoy beating your own, or other people's high scores.All in all, I would say that this game is interestingly quirky, and I love it for that.GameplayThere are five fancy looking icons (called spectra) on each level and you need to collect them. That's about the entire goal of the game. In order to reach the five icons you need to collect pollen to make seeds grow so that you have more plants to climb up and swing off of. Although this sounds quite simple, if you're like me, don't underestimate the joy of exploration.The gameplay itself is rather relaxing and is (usually) enhanced by the colours and art style. I say usually because there were some levels where I found the moving background to be very unpleasant and disorientating (although I do realise this is meant to make the levels more challenging, I don't like feeling ill).ControlsI found the movement controls to be engaging, easy to grasp and a little harder to master. It can become frustrating when you're trying to release from your swing at the right time in order to get the perfect trajectory to hit quite a small landing pad which isn't even on the screen when you launch! This makes some levels quite challenging, but I never felt like it was completely beyond me to get through them.StorylineThere isn't a storyline per se because there isn't anything much to read. It does feel like you go through a journey with your strange little character, and you get a sense that you're restoring order to the gardens in some way.I'd say that this game's story is more about your own experience of playing it rather than anything else. It was interesting.SoundThe music is very upbeat, modern and abstract to my ear. You may infer from that statement that I'm not a fan of modern, abstract music, however I didn't find the music in this game to be obnoxious. It creates an interesting atmosphere and certainly supports the stylized concept the creators envisioned.GraphicsGenerally I'd say that the graphics aren't astonishing, it's more about the design of the game. It has clearly been designed and has some interesting layered effects to give depth to each garden. I fully appreciate the careful balance between texture and flat colour to create a bold contrast and powerful visual environment for this game.Each level, or garden, is randomly coloured each time you enter it. This gives the game an interesting design aspect because it's essentially experimenting with variation of colour and repetition of shape (garden layout).For most readers though, the important thing is that the graphics make the game what it is, and they are functionally relevant.Pros+ easy to learn, hard to master+ replayability of gardens+ bold graphic style creates a unique world+ real sense of free exploration despite finite garden sizesCons- purposefully disorientating levels can cause motion sickness- the bold style gets old after a whileHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.Rothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot comFootnotes*Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see. The primary price I list at the top is the price that I bought the game at.**I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise. Remember that these are external websites and I'm just trying to be helpful - I'm not responsible for the content on the other end.Edit Log18/02/2015 formatting			"

												Nice platform game where you play the part of a bug jumping from flower to flower in a psychedelic garden, looking for seeds.Beautiful and original graphics together with nice music make for an original and relaxing experience.The game mechanics are a bit unusual since you can do mostly four things: when you're on the ground either jumping or ""playing Spiderman"", when you're in the air either floating or jumping back to the ground. The advanced levels usually ad some twists to the above, in order to keep the game fresh.The game is not perfect though, and has two issues.The first is that the some of the  advanced levels are quite difficult and unforgiving, transforming what should be a relaxing game into a source of frustration. The second is that some levels are really huge, and since there is no minimap you can easily get lost, making you waste quite some time looking for your target.			"

												Although the control scheme feels awkward at first, investing a few hours in this game pays off with a great ""I'm finally getting good at this!"" kind of feeling. It's very enjoyable in small, half-hour doses, and there's plenty of achievements for completionists. The music, art, and level design are all original and interesting, if a bit sparse. It's not for everyone, but I definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for something a little off the beaten path.			"

												Eden is one of my favorite games for PS3 and it is a high quality port to PC. Right now, it's dirt cheap on the Steam sale so snatch it up before it ends! Eden is a very abstract game where you swing through gardens and pollenate plants to ascend higher and higher towards your goal. Like most Q-games, the descriptions do not do them justice, you must experience to fully appreciate. It has a very trippy style and sound and a perfect sense of momentum. Get the Bundle that includes the soundtrack because you will want to listen to it even when you aren't playing. I play Eden with a controller because I'm used to it like this, but the controls map well to a mouse now that it is on PC.			"
