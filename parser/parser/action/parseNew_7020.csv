												Author's note: CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REDUX!!!! =DRogue Trooper.A good video game adaption of a very great comic! Sure, it's old. Sure, it's got a few bugs. Sure, it's got an awful multiplayer mode. But if you want a legitimate ""Rogue Trooper"" experience, this game is worth buying!CharactersRogueAn interesting character. He's young and feels betrayed. He makes it his life mission to take down the man who exterminated his kind. Pretty straight-forward person, but his ironically-named buddies (biochips stored in his equipment) make playing singleplayer more of a variaty. Voice actor was pretty good at playing the character. WARNING!!! SPOILERS!!!At the end, he refuses an offer from Millicom (the creators of Rogue and the other GI's) and escapes in a shuttle. I wondered, ""What next? What will Rogue do now that he's completed his only mission? Perhaps there are more villains?"" Might be interesting, if they make another game.GunnarPleasing both the serious and silly audiences, the rifle ""Gunnar"" is cocky and sarcastic. Think of him as a little bit of Deadpool mixed in with FPS Doug (the ""BOOM! HEADSHOT!"" guy). Makes remarks on your shots and combat skills, and is always eager to kill some Norts.BagmanA tough guy with the ability to recycle any salvage you aquire into health and ammo. Also upgrades weapons. This guy is really helpful during combat. He automatically reloads your gun for you in the middle of a firefight and applies a medpack to replenish your health when you get low. Instead of relying on your health and ammo bar, Bagman announces when you get close to running out or dying. Great addition to the game.HelmHe's a middle-aged character, among the 3 Biochips. He can hack computers, drive vehicles and provides a radar for you. I don't think he talked as much as the others, but he was really lively when piloting a vehicle. Removing him for computer hacking and driving removes your radar, making you rely on plain sight and instinct while he does his work. Great challenge.Traitor GeneralThe villain that causes Rogue to go, well... rogue. You don't really see his face during the beginning of the game, until you catch up with him for the first time. After that, you'll never forget him. He acts like a stereotypical general or other high-ranking men in the Army & Navy. Runs from the protagonist, sends his little army men to fight his battles and even hides behind a shield and watches people die! Totally makes sense. Hahaha.WARNING!!! SPOILERS!!!When you beat the game, Rogue finally confronts the Traitor General and gives him the scare of his life! Despite that, the post-credits scene shows that he survived the huge bombing the Southers did to his building. I've played many games in my life, but that scene seriously disappointed me. Rogue goes after the guy for revenge, kills him, then he lives again? Seriously. That just feels like a dull, rehashed-to-death plot twist.GameplaySingleplayerGood singleplayer. Collecting salvage and upgrading weaponry was pretty fun. They also give you a few ways to handle a situation. ""1. Go in guns-a-blazing or 2. Sneak around, silently killing Norts like a blue ninja."" You have the tech and knowledge to help you with both solutions. And characters that provide comic relief!MultiplayerAwful. Would've been much better had they spent more time developing the concept.ReviewPros+ Good singleplayer.+ Good story writting.+ Good cast of characters.Cons- Dated graphics.- Short campaign.- Poorly executed multiplayer mode.Overall Review Score: 7.1 "

												A fun but chunky third person shooter with a cult-classic feel. The game is rather under the radar in its popularity because a lot of people didnt like it but the game does do a good job in just being fun. The story and characters are bizarre to say the least but the action and explosions of a war shooter is what this game delivers well in a pretty fun single player story. 7/10			"

												I've just played through Rogue Trooper for the first time and it is nothing if not a bit of a strange one. Look at that release date: 23rd of May 2006. I almost can't get my head round it. This is a game released two years after Half-Life 2 and yet so much of it feels so much older. Primarily because it looks so much older but also because the levels are so clearly demarcated by stats summaries and cut-scenes. That aspect of it feels pre-Half-Life, never mind pre-Half-Life 2. A clue to why it has these throwbacks is because although this was released six months after the Xbox 360 hit the shelves it was only ever released for PC, PS2 and Xbox (and much later Wii) and was clearly fighting against the limits of those two ageing consoles. And yet in spite of this the game has aged very well.Crucially everything that was good about the game in 2006 is still good now. It is still pleasingly varied in terms of the gameplay. The guns still stand up and feel like they pack a punch. There is also a very pleasing amount of freedom regarding how levels are approached. It is all very linear but there is almost always a choice as to whether to go semi-stealthy, cover-based or all guns blazing. It also doesn't overstay its welcome. At the time as a full priced game I think it would have felt rather too short but today it feels about right. I don't think I'd want to spend that much more time staring at that few polygons and for the price I paid I'm more than happy with this little slice of history.One final word of warning through. The game is keen on its non-interactive cutscenes which often feel like they steal the most dramatic moments from the player. Every significant villain is defeated in a cutscene rather than at the players hands and that just isn't very satisfying. Still a good game and one with some unique features that will likely be of interest to fans of the shooter genre.			"

												Despite it being a bit clunky and it can have its moments of lag, It is a highly enjoyable game. The ways you can  upgrade your gear and take down the ""Nord Scum!"" is brilliant. The voice acting is great and the dialogue too!The plot structure of the game maybe very wacky and out there but, if like me, you've read the books and loved it then it's a must play. But don't let that put you off if you're just now looking at it!It is in my list of gems.One of the true epic games of the 2000 AD series, Cannot recommend this more highly!			"

												A cult classic.Made with pride and passion, actually respecting and honouring the quality of the source material, this masterpiece deserves to be played by every serious gamer with a particular love of Arcade Shooters.The cut scenes are of the very highest quality.It's very open tactically, I mean surprisingly so, there are many ways to approach each and every problem, thinking and playing smart is rewarded.I love the original comic strips and this for me is the best game based on a comic character I have ever played, specifically in the way it captures the very essence of the original concept, the way they did the character introductions, and they are 'characters', well rounded and well voice acted, never taking itself too seriously, all the while delivering a truly unique, challenging, exciting and interesting gaming experience, even for those who have no interest at all in the folk lore of Nu Earth.It absolutely succeeds as a game in it's own right, one of the PS2's finest moments.

												This game is truly an underrated classic. I know that is heared alot thease days, but that is the truth. Rogue Trooper is based of the comic series of the same name.Taking place in the future, you take control of the sole surviving ""Genetic Infantryman"". Rogue. The G.I.s were engineered to survive un-aided in the heavily poisoned and acidic atmosphere of Nu-Earth, the focal point of the war between the Norts and Southers. Betrayed by a general, the GI's were all but eradicated. Rogue was the exception. Thanks to a failsafe during their creation, the GI's have a Bio-chip implated at the base of the neck. The Chip downloads a GI's personality upon death for transport in another GI's gear (Mainly: Helmet, Rifle and Backpack) For cloning upon return. Armed with his dead comrades, Rogue stalks the hellhole of Nu-Earth for the traitor. But enough about the plot, what about the gameplay? At it's simplest: Rogue Trooper is a cover-based third person shooter. However that does it no justice. The main ""gimmick"" is that your squad is your equipment. Gunnar has a wide variety of firing modes. From Rifle to Sniper to Mortar to SAM. He even has a Sentry function. Helm is specialized in hacking and creating a holographic decoy. Finally, Bagman can supply you with Micromines and anything else you need. If you've got the salvage for it that is. Yes, you supply yourself with grenades, ammo, medpacks, and Upgrades. Whether you enjoy running and gunning, sneaking, or ambushing this game has got you covered.			"

												An enjoyable, short, third-person action game where you are a specially engineered commando.  The graphics are dated, but good enough not to be distracting.  The voice-acting is very good with each of your ""squad"" members speaking up in several situations, wheter it is story related or a grenade is incoming and you need to get out of the way.  The music is ok, nothing really memorable there.  You can upgrade your ""Rogue"" by aquiring salvage that you get by finding it on dead enemies or  hidden around the maps.  You use the salvage to upgrade your weapons or to craft more ammo and medpacks if you run out of anything.  You can also use salvage to get new weapons such as a beam rifle, mortar and more.  Rogue also uses multiple powers help you in several situations.  He has one where you can place your gun down on the ground, and make it a turret when you want to activate it.  Holoprojection can help you distact the enemies by making them think you are standing next to them or wherever you want to place it.  Overall, if you enjoy third-person action shooters and don't mind them being a bit dated this would be a good choice.			"

												Frankly 2000AD game conversions don't have the greatest reputation in the world. When the ""ok at best"" Dredd vs Death is considered one of the high points you know it's not a great list. However, Rogue Trooper breaks the mould by being a pretty damn good stand up game which allows for a fun use of tactics, has characters that work, is a really enjoyable shooter and is actually fairly faithful to the subject material. It is, however fairly short. I finished it in 7 hours or so. So basically if the price is right, grab this little gem.			"

Posted: January 31, 2016
												In brief: fun FPS, decent storyline, good cutscenes. Very linear, perhaps a little dated, but pleasantly varied and satisfying. No online multiplayer these days.On the hideously poisoned and war-scoured planet Nu-Earth a genetically-engineered supersoldier known as Rogue Trooper fights in the endless war between Norts and Southers. The atmosphere is deadly to unprotected humans and the ordinary footsoldiers must fight in cumbersome pressure suits, but the Genetic Infantrymen (GIs) are immune to the poisons in the air and strut out without so much as a shirt on their supermanly blue chests. The game begins with the first deployment of the GIs and the ♥♥♥♥♥torm which immediately ensues.The gameplay is fairly typical snap-to-cover shooter fare. Rogue packs a pistol and assault rifle at the outset and acquires additional weapons including grenades, mines and a mortar. The weaponry is powerful when correctly used, and choosing the right gun for the situation is very important when the game gets hard. Use of emplaced weapons is sometimes optional and sometimes obligatory, and there are a couple of levels in which Rogue boards a vehicle and uses its guns in a duck-hunt fashion. These sections, despite their on-rails pace, give the player a break from the game's exploration and resource-management angles.The game's resource is scrap, salvaged from dead enemies and flyblown junkpiles. The resource system explains how Rogue manages to keep himself supplied whilst operating in enemy territory, and is the game's only major departure from the comic-book setting. Scrap is converted into supplies by Bagman, Rogue's biochipped backpack.The biochips are a key feature of the storyline. Their job in the comic was to provide dialogue opportunities for a character defined by his lone wolf status; they also exercise some control over Rogue's gear, allowing them to make a material contribution to fights. In the game each biochip offers unique features including a decoy mode; notably, Gunnar in the (you guessed it) gun can act as an independent sentry and provides an auto-aim function which makes the weapon very powerful indeed. With a little practice it's possible to get every Nort infantryman with a headshot or tankshot, even when Rogue's on the run. The tankshots are very satisfying as the oxygen tanks inexplicably blow up after a second or two and send the luckless Nort flying.The opening levels walk you through the basics of Rogue's gear, and once you get the hang of it the combat can seem easy, even on the hardest setting. The real challenge at the higher levels is in the scarcity of resources, a restriction which obliges you to conserve ammo and explore the game's tactical possibilities. Most situations can be approached in multiple ways; stealthy murders bring scrap bonuses and a fun little cut-scene of Rogue snapping a neck or plunging in a dagger.At the easier levels it's possible (and fun) to just blaze headfirst through pretty much everything. Level structure is essentially linear with some alternate pathways and the AI, whilst not stupid, is predictable enough. Note that there's no manual reloading, something which I guarantee will annoy you when you're sniping. The game's also quite short – less than 10 hours to complete the campaign, probably a lot less if you try.The story, told in biochip banter and game-engine cutscenes, is one of its great strengths. The voice-acting is very good and the script is solid, as it should be – it's written by Gordon Rennie, who scripted the second run of the original Rogue Trooper in 2000AD. The cutscenes are very well produced and really transcend the limitations of the engine with inventive camerawork and striking characters. Some players have remarked on the game's lack of boss fights, as most of Rogue's major opponents are dispatched during a cutscene; for me this wasn't a problem as Rogue's key enemies are all physical weaklings in comparison to him, so mano-a-mano boss fights would seem forced and implausible. The climactic all-in fights in the game's later stages are enjoyably chaotic as it is.Multiplayer I can't say much about as it's no longer available for online play, Eidos having shut down their RT servers several years ago. LAN play is possible and the multiplayer maps can be played with AI enemies.Overall: fun game, if you're a 2000AD fan who plays shooters buy a copy without delay.			"

												I saw a lot of reviews that had a negative because multiplayer was not very good and the graphics were not a beautiful as those of todayFor those who appreciate a single-player campaign and do not particularly for multiplayer, this is a game for you. This video game is actually based on a comic book series (maybe still running, not certain). This game features a resource collection method, which you will need to use so that you can purchase upgrades and get bullets, you do not pick up bullets of any kind from anyone, which was a nice change I must say.Sadly no Steam Achievements, and you will probably have completed the campaign in about 7 hours (I just finished it myself)I got this during the Holiday Sales week real cheap, would recommend waiting for it to go on sale.

												""Rogue Trooper"" is a third-person cover-based shooter with fun gameplay mechanics, a decently long campaign, and atrocious AI.Based on the same-titled graphic novel and with the game garnering a sort of cult-like status with plenty of player statements testifying to its uniqueness, in reality I was expecting more.The storyNot worth repeating. Generic army conspiracy story of the most basic kind, told via poor cinematics (both in terms of actual graphics and directing). DO NOT believe the ones saying about how good the plot is, because it's not.GraphicsGood, but dated. The game is from 2006, after all. For the setting, which is basically a wasteland planet, you get a decent amount of variety in level designs.SoundMeh. Nothing special, really. A few good score tracks.GameplayThe most important part of the game, its saving grace in a sense. Your character is really three soldiers in one, given that he installs biochips with his dead comrades' personalities into his equipment. This gives you a variety of options when engaging the enemy. Since the levels are completely linear, this gives you the possibility to truly choose your approach in an organic way: stealth, guns-blazing, or a combination of the two. Neither gameplay style is forced on you at any time. This is good, but...... on the other hand it's also not that good. Neither approach features any reward at all. Even in the stealth-based missions, it's completely the same if you just pull out your big guns and start unloading. going Rambo is almost always the easiest way to get through a level (since the game on HARD is really not that hard at all), and by the later levels I ditched the sneaking altogether because...... the AI is so damn stupid, you just want to blow them all to hell for being such dumbasses. You take out a soldier, and his companion standing a few feet next to him won't notice anything. You take out the whole area, blow things up. No one else comes to you, and you're thinking: ""OK, with all the shooting, everyone who was here would've come out. The area is cleared."" And then you round a corner and find a solider casually facing away from you, oblivious because, well, he was around the corner and didn't register a thing.Also, the game has no boss fights, really. And all the killings of the main bad guys is done via cutscenes. This takes a certain sense of accomplishment away from you, the player.Finally, the campaign mode on HARD will last you about 8-10hrs. The last difficulty called MASSACRE is locked initially. The game has no collectibles or achievements of any kind, so there's no true replayability.Conclusion:A game whose only saving grace is the novelty in the gameplay where you can choose on how you approach the level. Everything else is average, or below average. Recommended only under these conditions: You're a fan of 3rd person shooters, and ""Rogue Trooper"" is on a massive sale. "

												When the chips are down and your Blue Man Group buddies are dying all around you, what do you do? Take a knife, dig it into their necks and rip out a computer chip with their brains backed up on it. Duh. Then you stick that chip into whatever piece of equipment you have handy and, hey presto, a talking gun. And backpack. And hat.Then you put the hat on a computer and it can hack it. Your backpack can make lots of grenades and things for you. Your gun shoots stuff. Wait, no, it already did that. Now it shoots stuff while quipping one-liners. It's an action movie hero gun.If you're not already swimming in a sea of imagined joy at the thought of all that yet, let me add a little excitement by saying that Rogue Trooper also is an excellent romp through a war-torn planet. It's definitely a console port, but a great console port, one made when developers had mastered the last generation of consoles and had reached the pinnacle of the design possibilities the tech provided for.

												In my opinion this is one of the most underrated games of all time. Great graphics for its era, solid and varied gameplay, a likeable main character, an engaging story, 8-10 hour single player campaign, and excellent level design make this a must have for anyone who plays action games. It has aged very well, and still looks fantastic despite being made for the original xbox console. This game was one of the first to implement the chest high cover system, beating the similar and more well known gears of war by several years. If you're like me and are a fan of 2000AD comics this game will be a dream come true to you, but even if you've never read them you will still think this game is awesome. With stealth gameplay, special up-close kills, a well implemented cover system, impeccable controls, and a reusable gun turret, this game has something for everyone.You won't get better value for $10, that's the truth. Buy this game now!			"

												Still one of the finest third person shooters of all time.Great gameplay in expertly crafted levels, broken up with some on rails turret sections (and a literally on-rails protect the train sequence). I was enjoying this in 4K recently - to get it to run in this resolution, you simply select it from the in-game graphics menu. Considering I have problems getting contemporary games to run in 2160p, this decade old title demonstrates some fantastic coding.Further, if you're familiar with the Rogue Trooper character (which many UK 30-somethings will be) it's a delight to see interactive entertainment handle the 2000AD stories with such obvious love. Rebellion (who own 2000AD now, I believe) also made a great Judge Dredd (Vs Deth) game. Pity there's too little interest in these licenses for new games, guess we'll have to do with more Sniper Elite titles.			"

												Nostalgia is a powerful thing.This game was something I grew up playing all the time, and as a kid, I enjoyed every second of the game.Is this game still good, capable of holding its own against the newer crowd?Let's find out.Gameplay is what I'll be mainly focusing on, since that is the biggest point of this entire review.The gameplay holds up just as well as other, newer games, something I can give a lot of praise for. It is a mission structured game with linear story progression. However the game isn't linear in how you play it, you can appraoch many of the missions in a variety of places, save the odd mission or two. This adds a massive amount of replayability since you can approach a mission stealthy or murdering everything and everyone in sight. The game feels like it belongs still, as though it won't be dated by anything other than its admittedly average graphics.This game isn't really bogged by nostalgia, its still pretty fun and decent.8/10			"

												Rogue Trooper is a bit of a flawed gem. Although it's a few years old now, its' graphics are still fairly good by today's standards. The music, though used sparingly, is above average when present but the story line is nothing particularly special. You are a futuristic clone agent sent to destroy the faction controlling Nu Earth. The games' mulligan is that your comrades can be kept alive in some fashion by pulling the chip located in the back of the skull, where they can continue to narrate your progress through the game. The third person perspective, normally something I do not care for in shooters, actually works fairly well, although the aim assist is so good that veteran players may find the game too easy. Unfortunately the Steam Overlay must be disabled to run this game, and widescreen, though supported, is only available up to 1280x1200 resolutions. None of Rogue Troopers minor flaws detract from the overall experience however, and this game is a fairly good buy.			"

												A 3rd person shooter with the ability to take cover and even though it might be a bit buggy sometimes, it still remains fun. And the best part about the combat is that even though you are mostly alone, the parts which you are not, the AI acutally do kill the enemy but are a bit stupid so if you don't support them they will die and even though i dose not matter, it feels more fun with allies.The story is very intressting, you are part of a gene-modifed infatry battalion (the G.Is) which is a part of the Shouth faction and you fight the North faction but i don't want to spoil more than that you and your buddies are going to shoot alot of Northerners.Great game if you don't care for graphics but do care for gampelay and story.

When I ran into a fight with a big armored suit, I would let my gun do the fighting while I ran around with my pisotl. Works perfectly in the final boss fight as well.I played this game start to finish three times thus far. I bought it on Steam for the 3rd run.A good game, FPS fans that like Stealth as an option will like this game.			"

												An above average and largely overlooking third person shooter based on a series of graphic novels about a genetically engineered super-soldier fighting baddies on another planet. All your supplies must be crafted-- ammo, grenades, health, upgrades-- using scrap scattered around the levels or salvaged off dead bodies. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.My biggest complaint would be the lack of context for the story-- where am I? Why are the Norts fighting the Southers? What is that giant black-hole-looking thing in the sky? The cutscenes are well choreographed and do a proper job leading you into the next set-piece, but I wanted to know MORE about the universe.Also, I wish the game were longer. This is more of a compliment than a complaint, though. The levels themselves feel just long enough and the game features many memorable quirks and twists on standard gameplay to make it a memorable experience. Sniping an enemy's air tank and watching him run around in a frenzied panic never gets old.8/10			"

Sure, the graphics are a little dated now but this just means it flies on a modern card or plays well on a fairly low spec machine.Plot seems to have stayed close to the original comic run as well, which is an added bonus. Starting off at the Quartz Zone Massacre and introducing the ""Bio-Chip Buddies"" in the opening chapter.			"

												Initially gave this a not recommended due to stability and incompatibility issues. But that's just because i'm lazy sometimes...go to steamapps, common, Rogue Trooper, executable, and in properties change it to Windows 7. May be Vista or something else in your case, just try. Ten years after release this looks very dated indeed, but plays well enough and is a fond trip down memory lane to when stuff like this, Kill Switch and Gears was still relatively new. If you like the comic then obviously you will like this, but even if not then it's a decent third person shooter with shades of Killzone in terms of feel and mission structure (which in turn was heavily influenced by the Rogue Trooper comics). Some features don't work properly, like controller support, but mouse/KB is generally fine for this. Even at two dollars or so this is not a great buy because it's just too dated, but it's not bad.

After playing Medal ofHonour Warfighter which was basically a broken game I will take older graphics any day.On that basis and that I had great fun with it and tore through it in a 3 day long weekend, (I did not want to stop playing) I will give it a 9/10 (caveat for older graphics).Oh yeah, some great music in it too.Recommended :)			"

												Ever wonder what it would be like in a video game if your gun could talk to you? How about your helmet and backpack? Well, Rogue Trooper's premise is basically that. You play as a cloned super soldier whose toughness cannot be contained by the confines of clothing or armor, and get orbital drop-pod'd into a warzone on an alien planet that has pretty much gone to hell with your squad and a whole bunch of other Dr. Manhattan lookalikes. Naturally, things go awry, one thing leads to another, your three squadmates become a part of your equipment, essentially possessing your gun, helmet, and backpack, providing abilities such as setting up as a turret, deploying a hologram, crafting new upgrades, and most importantly, banter. The gameplay holds up despite the age, controlling much like any other third person shooter with added cover mechanics to boot. Your playstyle is restricted only to your imagination, for the most part: whether you want to move from cover to cover shooting dudes in the head, sneak around and stealth kill enemies from behind, set up your gun to act as an automated turret while you flank, distract foes with a hologram as you snipe from afar, among other possibilities, is entirely up to you.As with almost every other game in existence, Rogue Trooper does have its flaws, however. Controls can be finnicky at times and can take some getting use to (most jarring being how blind-fire is a contextual action instead of simply firing without aiming when in cover), the campaign is rather short and feels like it ended far too quickly, your possessed equipment's chatter can get repetitive and sometimes annoying, and the multiplayer mode is, to my knowledge, entirely dead unfortunately (although you can still play either of the two multiplayer modes alone). The biggest issue I had however was one particular mission stuttered the framerate so low that a dolphin could count the frames per second with one flipper. Granted, I play on a toaster of a laptop, but up until that point, the framerate for the game was decent enough to play. It made the game impossible to play, to the point that I had to go about finding a way to skip the mission entirely. That may not be the case for all users, but it was what affected my experience the most personally.All in all, Rogue Trooper is a damn fun game and has aged well. If you like third person shooters, a neat story with interesting background lore (you can even unlock encyclopediac entries on almost everything you encounter in the game), the unique nature of your equipment talking to you, the thought of having blue skin, or the comic series of the same name, Rogue Trooper may interest you.

												Brilliant gameNice visual quality, plenty of freedom to shoot up the villainous norts in a variety of ways. Solid single player action and story with some great nods to the classic 2000ad publication. Overall, 8/10.			"

												An old game but a decent game.It stands up well years later.I was surprised it had cover mechanics in the gun play, done well.I played the Judge Dredd vs Judge Death years ago too and that was also a decent game, same developers I think.If you can get either of these cheap then they are worth it, or if you are a 2000AD fan then you will find they got a decent treatement by Rebellion.Hard to give a mark out of ten for an old game but I will say this, it was BUG FREE! After playing Medal ofHonour Warfighter which was basically a broken game I will take older graphics any day.On that basis and that I had great fun with it and tore through it in a 3 day long weekend, (I did not want to stop playing) I will give it a 9/10 (caveat for older graphics).Oh yeah, some great music in it too.Recommended :)			"

												I played this game when I was in first grade, that was 9 years ago, and now coming back to play it once more, was a dream. I never got to finish the campaign until now, and it just fills me with nostalgia, and when I booted up the first mission, I felt like a kid again. (Only slightly less r3t@rded.) But oh man, this game really is good, even without the nostalgia, the 3rd person camera is great, the combat is fantastic, the gun sounds....oh that one really brings me back, the GI's gun without the silencer is just... pure power, it sounds like you're really doing damage to the Norts! The only thing I wish was back would be the multiplayer... damn. I remember talking people into playing with me on it and we always had a blast, I don't know why the multiplayer always drew me in, but I wish more people really did play the multiplayer with me. Anyway to sum it up. 9/10 A Hidden gem, that's worth the price, few bugs here and there, but it's expected from a 10 year old game that gets no support.			"

												Ever wonder what it would be like in a video game if your gun could talk to you? How about your helmet and backpack? Well, Rogue Trooper's premise is basically that. You play as a cloned super soldier whose toughness cannot be contained by the confines of clothing or armor, and get orbital drop-pod'd into a warzone on an alien planet that has pretty much gone to hell with your squad and a whole bunch of other Dr. Manhattan lookalikes. Naturally, things go awry, one thing leads to another, your three squadmates become a part of your equipment, essentially possessing your gun, helmet, and backpack, providing abilities such as setting up as a turret, deploying a hologram, crafting new upgrades, and most importantly, banter. The gameplay holds up despite the age, controlling much like any other third person shooter with added cover mechanics to boot. Your playstyle is restricted only to your imagination, for the most part: whether you want to move from cover to cover shooting dudes in the head, sneak around and stealth kill enemies from behind, set up your gun to act as an automated turret while you flank, distract foes with a hologram as you snipe from afar, among other possibilities, is entirely up to you.As with almost every other game in existence, Rogue Trooper does have its flaws, however. Controls can be finnicky at times and can take some getting use to (most jarring being how blind-fire is a contextual action instead of simply firing without aiming when in cover), the campaign is rather short and feels like it ended far too quickly, your possessed equipment's chatter can get repetitive and sometimes annoying, and the multiplayer mode is, to my knowledge, entirely dead unfortunately (although you can still play either of the two multiplayer modes alone). The biggest issue I had however was one particular mission stuttered the framerate so low that a dolphin could count the frames per second with one flipper. Granted, I play on a toaster of a laptop, but up until that point, the framerate for the game was decent enough to play. It made the game impossible to play, to the point that I had to go about finding a way to skip the mission entirely. That may not be the case for all users, but it was what affected my experience the most personally.All in all, Rogue Trooper is a damn fun game and has aged well. If you like third person shooters, a neat story with interesting background lore (you can even unlock encyclopediac entries on almost everything you encounter in the game), the unique nature of your equipment talking to you, the thought of having blue skin, or the comic series of the same name, Rogue Trooper may interest you.

												It isn't Halo or CoD4, but it does have charm and a few good ideas built around a half-decent, if derivative story of the hunt for the traitor general... Plus it's based on a 2000AD franchise that isn't Judge Dredd. i don't regret playing it at any rate. ^_^ "

												One of those rare times when an obscure comic character gets a video game and it turns out pretty good. If you have ever read the comic of the same name you should play this. If not, its an average third person shooter with a decent story and semi-decent graphics (For the time)As a fan of the comic I rate it a 8.0As a gamer uknowing of the supporting material 7.3			"

												Is good! But only the singleplayer is good. The multiplayer function isnt available because GameSpy closed all of their servers ""Good Job""!			"
