												Is it an amazing game? No. Is it worth picking up on sale? Yes. It's a pretty generic, on-rails shooter with a buddy AI. It doesn't excel, but it's worth a few dollars. Its story is also pretty much Team America: World Police, but it isn't meant to be satirical.			"

												took 144 hours of gameplay but me and my friend just beat it on extreme difficulty. All 10 levels will make you cry with hate, then joy once you beat it. If you want to die early and often this game is for you!!! We used hamachi to play co-op. We beat it on hard first to unlock extreme difficulty but forgot to back up save files a couple times so we had to start over three or four times. Game is hard. bet you cant beat it co-op in less than 144 hours of gameplay. (I think we started playing before steam started recording hours) Bottom line this game entertained us for years... Literally.			"

												For a co-op oriented FPS made 10 years ago - Conflict: Denied Ops is surely not that bad, as the most of reviews for it here on Steam. In fact, I like the game. Despite all the usual stupidness of scenario, voicing, AI behavior and so on. But... the servers are closed, multiplayer is dead, and the game ain't popular (like Kane & Lynch 1/2, for example), so I doubt it's gonna get many positive marks from the new age gamers.In Conflict: Denied Ops you play as a team of two CIA operatives, one is a Jackie Earle Haley-like marksman with SR-25, and other is big and sturdy sturmtrooper with machine gun and grenade launcher. I'm fixing on the weaponry, since there will be no guns swapping during the missions, you'll be using the same pieces again and again. Which is more, the spreading of bullets from your main guns is something really out of control. So, if you'll try to play the game, you'll might end up like me, with picking everything with the pistol shots, thanks to the lower spreading of this weapon. Other than that, there are plenty of red barrels over all levels, to make the game more Michael Bay-like. And... there are silencers, to play (optionally) some levels ninja-style, for extra challenge of patience.The story is obviously the weakest point of the game, with the US invading Venezuela (due to some political power crisis), some african compounds and even polar Russia (killing bad russians making nukes and optionally helping some good russians). The voicing is bad, the dialog lines even worse. On the bright side, the video inserts between the levels are well made... for what it's worth.Overall, the value of the game is limited by your patience for aged on-rail FPS games with somewhat unstandard mechanic. You might like it, you might not. The game isn't really a hidden gem you'll be missing. On the other side, there are not too many co-op oriented shooters which are still kicking, so, as one of them, I'll mark Conflict: Denied Ops with 5.8/10 and positive vote. You might get it as a part of some bundle, but, I don't think  that you need to really go hunting for this game in your library.			"

												Let me explain, I have great memories of the first 4 conflict games from my childhood. I went back and played them recently and although they have their problems, they're finely crafted squad based shooters that make you think a little and manage resources (mostly in global terror). I see now why this game killed the series for good.Just about anything you can think of that made the other conflict games great is not here. first off, they've limited the squad from 4 to 2, which makes planning as basic as setting up the sniper, and then going rambo, or putting the heavy gunner in a suppression position and sniping. This was the MAIN part of conflict that they mostly just threw out the window. the swap to first person is not aweful, but there are little to no HUD elements and things like your screen becoming red or vision blurring at certain points. I would usually applaud minimal HUD, but that's something a ""strategy"" game depends on, and before conflict would just give you information that is easy to interpret, rather than making your screen red or whatever. You also have the fact that the missions are all literally just s****y call of duty levels, where there is little choice in how you apporoach things and explosions happen everywhere. I can go on and on, but the point is this game killed a great games franchise and turned it into a co - op cod clone with squad controls that almost shouldn't be there and feel pointless.			"

												First off, I recommend this only on basis of having played it in singleplayer, I couldn't get the co-op mode to work with my friend (it might be possible locally, but I'm fairly sure the online service it used has been shut down permanently).The story is all in all kinda meh, and very generic. But the gameplay differs somewhat from most other shooters, it has a bit of a Delta Force feel to it at times, even though the player characters sometimes seem like the clumsiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s around. It can be a frustrating game to play, because you can die very quickly, through no real fault of your own - but being very aware helps, the enemies tend to circle around and try to outflank you, which is made possible by level designs that are sometimes much more diverse and maze-like than what is the norm for the genre.The graphics and sound are unimpressive, but not downright bad either, it does the trick well for people who are more gameplay-oriented.It's not a very long game, but it gave me a few good hours of fun. I'd recommend buying it on sale.			"

												What is this? What did I just play? H-How can such a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥exist in my library? Surely this must have come in a bundle, but even then..... I gave money to this? Well anyway, here we go. You play as what appears to be a stereotype of a young black male, full of ego and confidence, and an old white soldier who tries to keep things professional. The two character's cultures clash as the black guy repeatedly calls the white guy hick, who, in return always shows dissapointment in his partner's actions. Okay so I played the first level and half of the second one, the game was going nowhere quick and with only 4 weapons to play around with, I was done. Uninteresting, uninspired. I'm sure in the final two levels, the two characters will have formed a strong bond because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥they've seen. Hell may have broke Luce Tom Waitts, but not these guys. In the end I'm sure when the black guy calls the white guy hick, it will be out of respect and he'll get respect back. Seriously, other than stupid writing there's nothing to talk about. This game sucks, go, get out of here. Play Red Orchestra, and if you don't like that check out Far Cry 3.			"

												Wow. Conflict: Denied Ops would've been a great game in 2000. It has many of the earmarks of an early FPS. Limited weapons (and when I saw limited,I mean LIMITED - each guy carries one weapon. ONE), terrible AI, a non-story, horrific dialogue and in what I believe are a few case, respawning enemies (WTF). Unfortunately for this game, it's 2013 and gaming has come a long way. This is what I would call a ""McFPS"". Very bland, generic and brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But strangely enough, I finished it. You get 10 missions (some of which you get to choose which ones you do first) featuring a variety of environments and I thought some of the level design was actually quite good. I didn't even pay attention to the story. The dialogue was so stereotypically bad (the white guy is a redneck and the black guy talks like some dude on the block) that I just skipped the cutscenes and went into the action. And there lies another problem. The difficulty ramps up GREATLY at the end. Some levels you can finish in a bit over 20 minutes but towards the end you will die a bunch because of a respawn or a guy will run at you and kill you and your partner with a bullet a piece. Checkpoint saves FTW! Oh yeah, enemies can be hard to kill because of the combination of crappy hit detection, missing because your weapon can't hit anything even when using iron sights and everyone but you is a bullet sponge. Still. Would I actually recommend this game? No. I got it for under $4 during a Squeenix sale and I've paid less for better games. But I guess if you feel the urge to travel the world and kill people...well, find something better to play unless this is all you have left. 5 out of 10.			"

												You are in control of 2 men one uses machine gun the other ues rifle- pretty clear the game let you choice the way you wanna play. However it takes age to aim and shooting without aiming is extremely lacking of accuracy, which forced me to use machine gun. AI is quite dumb you have to keep giving order or the other guy will not follow you up. I guess I meet a bug just right at 1st mission, where I steal a penzer however the other agent dies on the way chasing the penzer, which requires me go all the way back to put him back to life...Not very intriging, Probably a good game at that time but not for now.

												Right, well I just undug this from my dusty game crate, it appears nowdays this game isn't worth buying due to the shutdown of it's COOP features and so, but here's my experience from 2008 and so. The game itself was pretty fun at the time, I used to play with a good friend of mine and was quite an intresting campaign going around with your friend and riding hovercrafts and APCs and so, I didn't take much out of the game it isn't really that impressive otherwise the graphics are expected of that time and the gameplay except some times is just stale, your run and shoot game with no real millitary aspects, I disliked mostly on how you had to go to ammo crates to get ammo for your gun since you was locked to just these two guns. Other than that it's really all I can remember but I'll state again.Game isn't worth it with the AI partner and now since the multiplayer has died sadly it's nolonger  good to play.			"

												A subpar shooter that forgoes almost all of the squad based tactics that made the other games in the series different, if not good. Instead of a squad of four soldiers with weapon specializations that could utilize any weapon you could pick up you have two soldiers that have very different intended playstyles. The shooting mechanics feel sloppy, guns have no real impact (the .50 cal handgun feels functionally identicle to the 9mm handgun), accuracy is nonexistant.Seriously, don't get this game. It's bad.

												Conflict: Denied Ops is, in essence, a ""dumb"" buddy shooter, where the AI will follow some basic commands, but it's nowhere as smart as Star Trek (the game), and the boss battles are... uh... annoying as heck, as you've basically been left to handle a big threat yourself instead of getting a little help that you should have gotten all along. The end result is somewhat exciting, albeit a bit ""bland"" sort of shooter. There has been a history of Conflict series... This is the 5th game, having started with Conflict: Desert Storm. It actually came out back in 2008, so I'm playing it 6 years later. How does it hold up? Not too badly, actually, but definitely a bit... tedious and boring. Backstory is simple enough... You're working for some unnamed intelligency agency doing black ops work. You're either the white old sniper Lincoln Graves, or younger black machine gunner Reggie Lang. So where are you fighting? Some tin can dictator ""General Ramirez"" of Venezuela want to take over the country and sent his men to take over a major refinery, and threaten to deploy nuclear weapons if US ""meddle"" in his country's ""internal affairs"". US is obviously disturbed so they sent in Graves and Lang to investigate leads track down what nukes is Ramirez talking about, and neutralize him if possible. So you ended up chasing leads all across the world, from arctic circle to Africa, from east coast of the US to South America... and so on. The game basically is a series of shoots where you shoot your way into the enemy base, surviving ambushes here and there, turn here and there, while you keep getting updates about your objectives, as you often get secondary objectives.  Most involves hacking a computer / defusing a bomb and so on. Of course, when you are trying to get out, then you get your big boss battle, where you often had to fight a gunship, a VTOL jet, or a tank without help. on the other hand I've also seen Alamo boss battle where you need to survive getting shot at from all sides. There is a stealth mission or two, where you can do it much easier if you stay stealthy, but it isn't always possible. Most missions have secondary and optional objectives, usually ""protect a VIP / rescuee"", whom needs to survive the final battle to count. Autosave is few and far in between (at checkpoints), and that's annoying too. Obviously a lot of the boss threats have to be dealt with by Lang, who is also armed with a rocket launcher. Your player character gets extra capabilities and/or equipment as you play the single player campaign. Sniper rifle gets an underslug shotgun (and later upgraded to full auto shotgun) and suppressor, as well as cornershot (hold gun around corner without exposing body, and use camera to take the shot). The short LMG gets underslung grenade launcher as well as faster cycling rate and better stock to absorb recoil. You also gain new grenade types, such as prox mine and incendiary in addition to standard frag, smoke, and flashbangs. Each also gets a silenced pistol for close range stealth work. The graphics were quite good for 2008, though obviously out of date for 2014. However, there is a lot of destructible stuff on the map... cartons / crates, explosive barrels and gas cans, trucks, etc. And it's quite satisfying to pulverize stuff as your ammo (but not explosives) is unlimited. There are periodic supply chests available for you to restock. Sound has some odd problems. Most of the time it works fine, but at times some of the reply dialog can disappear. When you order a ""move to"", you're supposed to get a verbal acknowledgement like ""On the way"", or ""moving now"". Sometimes, nothing. Also, the ""crates breaking"" sound is not very distinct and sometimes sound like shots or suppressed rounds being fired. This game is the ""don't get hit for a while and you get cured"" type shooter, but by the end game, one or two serious hits WILL likely take you down. All in all, Conflict Denied Ops is one of those ""product of the time"". There's nothing that really stands out except the ""swap character"" system, which had been done before too. It's not horrible, it's merely horribly average.  I do recommend it if you can find it cheap. It's not Modern Warfare, but it'll scratch the itch for some shootable environment.			"

												One of the worst games I have ever had the misfortune of seeing on special. Avoid this game, the weapons don't even seem to load for some reason. I couldn't be bothered after that.			"

												Is this was Army of Two was based of?Sure as hell got the same core aspects.Except for the fact that this is a FPS game and that it has clunkier controls.It would give it a 6/10, why I am skimping on the rating is because I never truly experienced this game since NOBODY ♥♥♥♥ING OWNS IT.AND THAT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BETTER, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												POS game!!!! This game has sound in menus, and then in the game no sound at all.  Its one of those weird old games that way, and it hasnt ever had a patch I'm aware of and being square enix, doubt it ever will, just look at their cruddy Tomb raider ports.Should be illegal to sell these kinds of games on steam that do not work with any modern computers.  I cant vent enough my hatred of broken games, what is real bad is this game is digital it is not real, in real life I could smash this game into tiny pieces for displeasing me, and steam robs me of that since its digital!Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												Pressing Q and E rapidly to lean is like playing Skiing Simulator 2014.If you really dislike someone, I wholeheartedly advise you to gift them this game.10 out of 10 doctors agree that a few seconds exposure to this game will give you brain cancer.			"

												If you want a game that's all about enemies that shoot through walls and won't die from a headshot. This is for you. Bought this game as part of a build your own bundle from the humble store so I could get 90% off, so I guess I can't really complain much. It's worth the 45 cents that was paid for it. Just don't buy it for any more than that.			"
