												So what is GUN? Basically, it is GTA in the wild west. Yep, a few years before the critically aclaimed RDR we had GUN, the lousy PS2 port that gladdened every western aficionado's heart. And it still does. The pros of the game: - solid albeit pulpish plot - great voice acting - the soundtrack that puts you in the right mood- some RPG elements that really work - a variety of side missions- you can ride a horseThe cons:- the map is rather small and the main story is quite short- few side missions are ludicrous- graphics (remind you it is ps2-port and not a good one) Well since those good people from Rockstar has not been too eager to bring RDR on PC, we can still get GUN. Close enough. :-]			"

												Bad to the bone--that's how GUN makes you feel. This extremely violent wild west adventure is one rootin', tootin', shootin' good time. The short six hour campaign story is great and some of the side missions are pretty fun too. Good voice acting, cool slow motion quick draw mode, and a nice assortment of weaponry round out the pros. The highest resolution I could play at was 1280x1024 so most of the visuals look pretty dated. But overall, a really fun game. It's a blast of dynamite--literally.			"

												I feld the 'Cowboy' urge but didn't want to replay a 'Call of Juarez' again. Don't get me wrong, the 'Call of Juarez' series are the best in Western you can get on Steam. After some searching I found 'Gun'. All those positive reviews couldn't be wrong even if the game was 'dated'. The reviews are right. Great Western game with some realy nice mechanics. If anything the old graphics only adds to the atmosphere in this game. So if you've played 'Call of Juarez' and you're in need of another cowboy game.....you found it.			"

												Gun is the great western game from the PS2-era, namely, 2005 year. Oh, sure, it is dated! But last time I checked, Rockstar still keeping its Red Dead Redemption to consoles, so there is still none a better open-world cowboy game on the PC.One thing Gun did good, the shootouts, were bested by the Juarez game series. But if you want an open world where you not only shooting deadbeats, but also shepherd cows, hunting buffalos, and, yeah, running mail quests, while riding your mustang… you still got only the Gun option.And it is a good option. Not only it is playable from the box, unlike many other 10 years old games, which Steam is releasing… The Gun is a very worthy still – in all aspects but visuals.“Open world” in this game, of course, can’t be compared to the newer games, like Fallout New Vegas. It is a vast territory somewhere diluted inhabited oases. You riding between them, reasonably expecting an ambush on every turn, behind every bush. By the way, horses are your best friends: you really don’t want to walk all the wilderness back to town. So don’t shoot them, and don’t allow others do so. Speaking of shooting, gunplay there is rather primitive, as you can expect from a console game, but at the same time, it allows you to enjoy a decent arsenal of the time, and unleash all the knots of the plot and game logic. So it is okay.About game plot. Although of course it is made full of cliches, in the endline, it is a good scenario. Not sure I want to read a book about, but, as a part of game, being sounded by good actors, it feels natural.As I said earlier, besides main quests and that dabbling revenge pursuing, you have many other opportunities to feel at home with Wild West around you. Visit cathouse, drink whiskey, play some poker, do some ranching, mining and hunting… both on animals and on wanted criminals. And of course, you can be a Sheriff in one place, and rob some trains in another.So, if you want a western game on the PC, try the Gun. At least now, despite the fact it is 10 years old title. Play it now, while it is still available and working, and there are no new game from the Rockstar or Techland, or some other studio with taste in the good old days of 19th century.While many fine games took some beef from the westerns, from Fallout New Vegas and even Mass Effect to japanese Wild Guns series… If we are talking about vanilla Wild West, not some Weird West, like in the Dark Watch or Damnation, we have so few decent games, that missing the Gun is almost a crime.Mark 8.1/10			"

			Gun is underrated and forgotten game. It's worth checking out Widscreen fix: http://thirteenag.github.io/widescreen_fixes_pack#gun http://store.steampowered.com/app/2610/ Follow me on Twitter:...		

For me this is one of my favorite games of all time and the best game set in the wild west. I know there are other, like Call of Juarez, but Gun, which is older, have far more interesting characters, world, story and I can safely say it's higher quality product, as far as the first Juarez. While the consoles have Red Dead Redemption, which by the looks of it is superior, PC have Gun, which is rough around the edges. I read somewhere, before RDR, Gun was the best western game. It may be rough, but this doesn't mean it's not fun. Unfortunately, it's far from perfect. It does have some problems, that might put off some people. It all depends of your tolerance for something far from perfect. Let me continue with bad stuff, so I can end on a positive note.This is a console port and it's obvious. It's not the worst, but this could be unacceptable for some. The game runs at 30 fps, which is not such big deal, I can close my eyes, but in some situation dips below that. It's an open world game, but it feels like it's divide by sectors and when you reach the border of some sector, the game need to load the surroundings and fps drops below 30. It's for e second, but it's annoying. There are some weird bugs. Few examples: NPC is giving me task and you can see his neck,arms and legs are not attached to the torso. In one side quest you can see in the distance, the enemies are riding … the air, or the legs of a horse are not moving. These bugs are more funny, than game breaking. The graphics didn't aged very well. For the time they were decent.Maybe the biggest problem is the presence of slight auto aim. Why is this in a PC game? It would be nice if I could turn it off. The answer is simple – console port. The developer of the game is Neversoft, which were famous with the Tony Hawk franchise, but for the port is responsible Beenox (known for the Spider-man games) and they didn't do good job. Here is the contradiction. Maybe the auto aim it's not a bad thing, since aiming with the mouse is not perfect, it's not that precise. I always compare 3rd person action games with Max Payne in this regard, because the aiming there is perfect for me and Gun is almost there. There are other 2 small problems. The first is the AI – sometimes it's just stupid and second one is the enemy models. You will see the same characters over and over.After all I said, maybe you are asking yourself is there any good things in the game? Yes, there is. Absolutely love the game. Almost 10 years later, you can see the higher quality of the game, starting with the voice acting. The main characters are voiced by famous hollywood actors, like Thomas Jane, Kriss Kristoffersen, Lance Henriksen, Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman, Tom Skerritt. Even the other voice actors are doing a great job. As a hole the sound design is great. The weapons sound like they came out from old western movie, which contribute to the atmosphere of the game. The music is phenomenal. When a track hits, you feel like you are in great adventure. And it is great.The studio hire hollywood screen writer and the outcome is pretty good story. You take the role of Colton White, who with his father, makes a living with hunting and selling the meat to a steamboat. The steamboat is attacked, because the bad guys are looking for something, that your father is hiding even from you. He dies, the boat is destroyed and from here starts your adventure. The story is great, but short, so don't rush with her. So is there anything else to do? You have a lot of side quests, most of them consists of killing everything that moves. But there are others, like get a cattle back to the their pens, making deliveries, protect people from wolves. And of course there are wanted posters. With them you often have a choice between dead or alive, which respectively brings you less or more money. When you are given a choice to get someone alive, the thing you have to do is to shoot the horse, cut him once or twice with the knife and apprehend him. You don't need to kill his buddies. And what is the wild west without a game of poker. In the two towns there are tables to play. The AI is not that good, but here is not that important.While walking around you can find gold, which you can dig. So the first thing you have to do when you see shopkeeper is to buy pickaxe. Other things you can buy from him are standard upgrades for your weapons, horse, but not for the bow. For him you have to visit an indian outside the towns. There are two shopkeepers in the game and they sell different upgrades.From everything I said until now, I almost didn't touch the gameplay. It's good. If you put aside the auto aim, everything else is great. You have pretty standard arsenal of weapons – pistols, rifles, shotguns, sharpshooter, whiskey bomb, dynamite and bow. My favorite is the shotgun. At close range is irreplaceable. After almost each story mission you will be given new weapon, each with different stats. In saddlebag you can choose which one to equip. The ammo for everything is not endless and you can't buy it. You have to find boxes with them in specific places spread around the world. Only for the pistols are endless and for the rifle are most easy to find.There is one more thing and it is Quickdraw. This is basically bullet time. With a press of a button, you slow down time and arrows appear to show you where the bad guys are. Then you pres left or right and start shooting without reloading. The feeling of killing 6-7 guys this way is awesome. When you slow down time, you can shoot arrows and dynamite, while there are in the air. Of course, you can move the crosshair with the mouse. In some cases it's very useful for more accurate shots. You can also go in first person view, for better shots with the rifle and bow. As far as the bosses, all I can say they are a lot of fun, especially the final one.Here is one interesting fact. Activision merged Neversoft with developer Infinity Ward in May 2014. In August 2014 it was discovered that inside the latest DLC for Infinity Ward's game Call of Duty: Ghost there was an easter egg of a fake poster advertising Gun 2.The game run absolutely fine on Windows 7, 64 bit. There is widescreen fix, but it stretching the HUD. When you type in 1 in HUD_PATCH inside gun_res.ini, it will fix the stretching, but the mini map will be almost in the middle of the screen.Gun is forgotten and underrated game. It's worth buying right now, if you don't mind the port. But it's definitely have to be played by everyone, who loves open world games and western movies. Gun is like human – it has some shortcomings, but if you look close enough, you will see beautiful soul underneath. From here you have to decide if you want to overlook the flaws, for everything else or not.			"

												The highlight of this game is the story. The graphics are dated but not unplayable. Combat is fun. There are a good variety of weapons. Short story but this game is open world and has side missions. There are alot of glitches but from what i've seen none of them are gamebreaking. This game has that slow mo shooting special ability that alot of games have now. If you plan on getting this game I would wait for when it goes on sale for at least 25% off. Overall I give this game a 8.6/10.			"

 Disclaimer - I do not own GUN, I have played the game via Steam family share and the hours recorded on Steam are not accurate either due to playing offline. GUN is an action adventure western themed game which was released ten years ago in 2005. This was my first experience with the game too, I had never played it on release. This is probably one of the first open world games to come out. The world consists of the story missions, side missions, gambling side activities and bounties to take care of.  As you travel on horse back from town to town, you encounter bandit attacks and ambushes which you can choose to either fight in, or escape with your tail between your legs. You play in a third person view of your character, Colton White. The game also has an auto-aim feature which I suppose was needed for the consoles back in the day, but on the PC it just felt clunky when aiming with a mouse. While you aren't out in the desert on story missions, another activity you can take part in is the hunting; you can hunt wild animals and then sell the fur and meat to be able to upgrade your equipment. There are plenty of classic western style weapons to be used in GUN too, from the revolver, to explosives and bow'n arrows.  This is also another game with a bullet-time feature in which can be activated once you fill up your Quickdraw meter and then switches into a first-person view. GUN also encourages melee action as well; with another wide range of different weapons to use here.The graphics do look dated; but for its time, this would of been top of the range. So if you are the sort that is discouraged by older looking games; GUN is certainly going to put you off in the graphics category. There are a couple of options which you can change to increase the graphical fidelity, but really any machine now days will be able to run this on max settings. GUN does have an element of difficulty to as well; I had to reply a number of missions from dying and messing up the objective. A full playthrough took me about eighteen hours to finish; this was with doing all of the side missions and activities as well. You are getting a really fleshed out game here. Since the game is old, I did have a couple of technical issues. The main one being the game will not support higher resolutions and will sometimes cause a black screen upon launching - I just had to minimize and reopen for it to sort out though. I did also have a few random crashes while playing too; so in order to minimize the risk of this, save often so you don't end up having to re-do levels you just completed and you'll be fine. I can recommend GUN; but only if you are playing it purely for the gameplay and story elements. Most will be put off by the aging looking graphics. however if you play it for what it is, a really well put together Western open world game. You will surely have a good time. 1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												This is one of those undiscovered gems of games. one of the first games i've ever played as a matter of fact. yes, for PC the control's are a bit odd, the graphics aren't the best, the frame rate at med range is bad and the hitbox's are weird but what can you expect of an old game for the PS2 and Game Cube? It has a great story line, an fun type of gameplay and a nice and original concept. and a pretty good open world. I can tell you right now that if you look for top ten best western games, this will be on every single one of those list's. If only more people played this game then maybe just maybe there would of been a sequel which i would've loved to see. I wish there was another game like this placed in the old west that made you truely feel like you were in the old western times with the natives, the cowboy's and just how life was back then. if anything the only problems that i found with this game is that after you compleat the whole story line and finish all the mission's, there is nothing more you can do. if anything the only thing that you can do is go fight the one or two bandits that cross your path witch will die within two seconds or go find the rest of the gold that you no longer need because after you buy everything at the shop your just watching your gold counter go up with nothing to spend it on. I wish that maybe one day, just one day there is a re-make of this game. though its a about as likely as seeing half life 3 come out maybe even less so, I still wish to one day see this game with fresh new graphics, a new system with more things to collect, a spot to change how you look because you get diffrent looks as you go on the story, better control's, and finally extra added content to keep me playing. but that is just a dream. 10/10 would buy this game again just to tell you how good it is... again...7.8 - IGN			"

												This game is a fantastic open world third person shooter set in western times. There's the main story you can do, but the game also has plenty of sidequests.

The port for PC is good with no problems whatsoever, not even a single crash even when Alt Tabbing. Great buy if your looking for a Wild west story or even a open world game. The only downside of this game is its quite short although there are a few side quests and minigames it took me about 3.5 hrs to finish. But for the detail and story that was orginally made in 2005 the game is great.			"

 GUN™  One of the best westerns we can get on a PC. The main character is Colton White who seeks revenge for the death of his father. The story typical for such games but still very cool. This production has many years on the neck and it is no longer a playable title as it was. The game has problems with the rendering environment. It can also crash a game and delete the game progress and it have a problems with low resolution but i heard there is a mod that will repair this. The area that we visit is not the biggest but although it is, and we will get around by horses. The game of my childhood and the first one I finished on 100%. Production has his age and I can not recommend it to everyone, but if you are looking for an interesting western with a cool storyline, open world, a great soundtrack and side quests like a poker, message delivery, wanted posters, herding cattle, hunting, helping the Marshals or collecting gold and you are able to forgive poor graphics and technical failures you should definietly try it.

												I thoroughly enjoyed GUN when it was released and I replayed it endlessly; it was so successful where Red Dead Revolver fell short - playing both of them back-to-back was very fulfilling.Despite this, for the so-so quality of the port (which I'm beginning to think is inevitable when porting old games,  Shame), $20 is STILL too high. If I was given the opportunity to buy a console version for $20, that would be a steal! Seeing as how, on PC, if you ride too fast through the relatively small world all hints of scenery, except for static objects, are prone to disappear, leaving you riding in the sky (but not for too long) – $10 would be more than fair, if you had an inkling of replaying this game. The more I've played it, though, the less often I've found such glitches.Remember, circa 2005, much less was expected from games. There is a respectable amount of diversions; I'm 6 hours deep and about 60% through - just sayin', don't expect an older ReDead Redemption. This is not that. If anything, it's ReDead Revolver with PERHAPS less refined combat but much more freedom and Native Americans instead of Mexicans, Animals instead of Carnies.Aye, when I recently replayed both Red Dead's, I kept finding myself thinking ""When is [major incident from the story] going to happen?!"" Every time I was anticipating such an event, it was always one that took place in GUN. So it seems, at least to me, GUN beat out ReDead in being epic... indeed, sometimes, while riding aimlessly around, the music can become TOO epic. As evident from the publishers, I really do stand by my saying that GUN is Tony Hawk with guns, regarding the sense of the controls/feel of it. Mind, I am playing with a controller - IT DOES HAVE CONTROLLER SUPPORT, YOU JUST HAVE TO MAP THE BUTTONS YOURSELF - when I first started the game, if you take a few steps and then stop abruptly, Cole continues sliding ever so slightly. LOL it's as if a remnant of the engine that defined the skateboarding. The longer you play, the less you'll notice it. Also: Never ride your horse with gun drawn unless you are in combat; having your weapon holstered, your horse can maneuver just as well as anything with wheels. I exaggerate only slightly when I say you can drift around corners on horseback.The gunplay is acceptable but nothing fantastic and you can't take too many bullets, even on Normal. For every few bullets, you'll have to take a shot - of Whiskey, oh yeah. Often, especially when horses are involved, it can be aggravating to try and line up your shots. Sometimes, it comes down to: drive your horse in circles, drive your horse in parallel lines, get off your horse. There is hardly ever that appropriate speed at which horse-to-horse combat can be fluidly achieved. The speed of things was something to be reckoned with in all games back then; remember how ANY time you had an escort mission or had to follow a story-dictating character while they walked and talked – if you moved at full speed, you’d leave them behind; if you walked, they’d leave you behind. So it comes down to Start.Stop.Start.Stop.Arggggh. …anyway, I don't know if I'm just lucky in doing this/lacking in skill for having to do this, but a tried and true method for me, that I've employed in several games when I can’t figure with the camera(/)speed: swing the camera haphazardly to aim, shoot, pray... watch it be a headshot... er, watch your enemy's head explode. Yes, there's chunky gore to be seen in GUN. Pistols, Shotguns, Rifles, Bows, Dynamite, Whiskey Bombs, Knives, Hatchets... 30(?) weapons in all. There are Stats that get upgraded when you complete missions, to help you in the progression of the story; it's a tale of revenge steeped in a revolutionary atmosphere - your actions throughout the Story make you more and more enemies, you'll be ambushed constantly by parties of 2 or 3 Bandits; sometimes the towns will be ("")off-limits("") as the residents will seek your life. A typical half hour in-game could be something like:Shoot bandits off their horses (again, because of the iffy/sluggish camera controls (ON CONTROLLER), I usually will get off my horse and run around whenever enemies ride in on the beasts, it's much easier – just don’t get trampled) and then scope the scene for gold veins to mine, go back to your incapacitated enemies and scalp them, go to town and play Texas Hold 'Em, pick up a Pony Express mission that takes you to the Ranch in-between the two towns (Empire, New Mexico and Dodge City, Kansas), go check the store in the other town (while avoiding/destroying the Bandits/Indians/Haters-in-general), pick up a Deputy mission, dispatch with criminals, then go to the wilderness and find the Native American shopkeep and Hunter, all the while using your Quickdraw (GUN's Dead Eye) to kill birds and other wildlife. You cannot aim down sights with your pistols; not really sure why but that’s that. You can aim in the first-person with two-handed weapons, poppin’ dudes with your rifle, rippin’ ‘em in half with your shotty, or huntin’ the murderous Great Animals with your bow (really cool, really annoying). It has been stated elsewhere that, at least for controller, ADS is a toggle – if you continue holding the aim button and try to shoot, it’s a no-go. The Cast Includes:Whistler from Blade as your father, Ned. Hellboy as the criminal Mayor Brown.The Punisher as Cole, the hero. Keeping in mind that this is an old game, ergo perhaps lacking in content by today’s expectations: $5 = WIN. $10 = DEAL. $20 = LOL. Addendum: Playing on Normal, I've quickly found any sort of challenge to be nonexistent. I still stand by my recommendation, seeing as how, no doubt, only fans of Western Shooters or those of the game when it was originally released would seek this game out. For those who have not played it, it's (EITHER ""is"" or ""was,"" sorry I can't commit to one or the other) a good game. I just have to stress once again that, despite being a technically open world, there's nothing but hand-holding; there's little in the way of difficulty; there's fun to be found, should you acquiesce to its age.

												I just beat the game a minute ago, and I'll base this reccomendation on the time i spent on it.First off, I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys western films. You're a cowboy seeking revenge on whoever killed your father, who was involved with a madman looking for a fabled city of gold. I'll rate the game on a few criteria.Story/immersion: 9/10-The story  is great. Each character brings something new to the table. Each of them have their own unique personalities and are important to the plot in one way or another. The voice acting is also pretty good. Sure, it may be out of sync at times, but that never got in the way of me enjoying it. Also, it feels like I'm playing in a westerner, and although some of the scenes portray a few negative Native American stereotypes that seem to be a bit outdated, it feels genuine. I loved it, but honestly, the story should've been a bit longer. I beat it in 6 hours which, although average for the time, seems short for the kind of game it is. Controls: 6/10-This is one of the few places in which the game suffers. Moving is standard, as well as aiming, jumping, and crouching. What really could've had some work was the weapon system. You have plenty of weapons, don't get me wrong, but it's such a hassle to switch between them that I wound up using the rifle for most of the game. This could've easily been fixed if you could just cycle through with the mouse button. Instead, you have to use either the numbers or hold alt+the corresponding weapon key. Really bad in the heat of battle.Graphics: 8/10-By today's standards, an 8 seems a bit generous, but considering the fact that this game is from 2005, they really stand out. Even today, they don't look horendous. One thing I must say is that character models, such as NPCs and enemys don't render at full motion unless you are closer to them. If they are further away, they look like something out of Doom 3D. Anyway, the camera controls nicely, which is great considering the time this game came out. Extra: 7/10-Throughout the game, there are plenty of side missions you can do to improve stats, gain money, and take a break from the main story. They're fun, and adds to the feel of the wild west. My only complaint is that it feels like grinding. If you don't do side missions, then the main story gets very difficult towards the end. This makes it not feel like something extra, but rather, something you have to do and part of the main game. Overall: 8/10-Highly reccomend. Don't buy it at full price. It's a short game worth a smaller price.			"

												This is a pretty nice 3rd person shooter. It has some similarities with Max Payne as it not only has a bullet time mechanic, but also has a somewhat grimdark story. Main characters that you think will live, get killed, etc. The Good:-Wall to wall action. Not a moment is wasted on unnecessary tasks-Good atmosphere with a fleshed out world due to quests and characters-Fun and varied missions overall-Interesting story, if not a bit predictable-Good length of content for the type of game it isThe not so good:-3rd person is a bit hard to manage, even with a Mouse + KB setup-Audio lags a bit in the steam version-Difficulty spike on the final boss. Had to google how to kill him. Ofc it was some stupid trick-Some side missions were hard to understand (hunting ones) and I never finished themAgain, overall a really nice game with some cool side missions and atmosphere.			"

												Nothing beats a classic western cowboy & indian shooter, you literally play as a tough hombre who dukes it out through vast wastelands and towns to find the reason who he is and why the one who protected him died from an evil preacher. It innovates itself to be a bloody, action packed of an explosive thrill ride of a story. You get to ride horses, hunt animals, fight indians, play many gambling card games and the last touch of it is hunting down wanted men for cash and hookers. Love the game but its  only real downfall is that the story ends rather quickly. 3/5 Rating			"

												It's basically the cliche's of the wild wild west rolled up into a game. The action in this game is fantastic and there is a fairly large but empty feeling open world to accompany it. The side missions of course don't do anything to the story itself but are there for added fun and to lengthen the game itself, I didn't find myself actually doing them til the game was over but it shouldn't stop you from completing some of them because the game does get relatively harder as you progress and you need dem upgrades. All in all whenever I played this it was for nostalgic reasons because I did play this back on the gamecube when I was a kid but if you have never played this game before then go grab it, it's a hell of a game!Clay: ""How did you know what that apache indian was saying?""

												There isn't really anything I can say that hasn't been already said in other reviews.  The main campaign is disappointingly short; as in short enough that I'm glad I bought the game during the summer sale rather than paying the full $20.  The storyline line is cliche and lacks the intrigue necessary to keep anyone interested, but the voice acting is pretty good.  The gameplay is fun and makes you feel like an old West gunslinger, but whoever made this game has probably never even seen a real levergun, as the reloads are initially tiresome and slow.  One good selling point is that the game ran flawlessly on Windows 8.1 right after download; I didn't have to get any patches or mods or run it in compatability mode, which was a nice surprise.  If you find this game for $10 or less, I would recommend buying it, but anything more I would consider a rip off.			"

												A relatively fun semi-open world western shooter. Gameplay/StoryStory is pretty average and generic at times, and the gunplay is quite fun with a variety of guns. The only real downside is how hard to come by ammunition is at times, as you have to memorise where and in which towns the infinitely replenishing boxes of ammo are. You can make money to buy upgrades from a shop, which are almost mandatory to properly complete the game. Overall pretty fun.Technicalities (Graphics, framerate, port quality)The port is atrocious. Maximum resolution is 720p, runs at a locked 30 fps. Forced mouse acceleration and irremovable autoaim. The graphics and sound have aged very badly. But if you can get over this, you will probably enjoy the game.Overall a fun experience, though don't expect too much out of it as its rather short. Additional - I experienced a CTD halfway through the final mission and the game does not have autosave (had not saved in a long time either...) so try to remember to save often.			"

												First had this game back in 2005 on my ps2 but decided on a whim to re-buy it for my pc after seeing it on sale. The game itself is one of the best for the limited choice of cowboy games on PC and in my opinon across all platforms. Although some of the negative reviews have said that the game hasn't aged well i'd have to say that i do agree with some points but as a whole disagree. I've finished the campaign in just over 5 hours but in all honesty the map size for what we would call open world in comparison to a game like Red Dead Redemption is of its time and frankly that is understandable when trying to create a campaign that wasn't overly boring within a relatively small open world. The one bad thing i would say about the short length of the campaign is that you can feel like the story lacks depth in some senses but i feel that as a whole it stands strong as it tries to not make boring repetitive core missions in a limited space.As far as side missions there are plenty and of a wide variety be it your classic bounty hunter posters (which in mission do include an option to subdue your bounty which i found surprising for a game in 2005 for which i expected to be find bad guy shoot bad guy policy upon first playing it so long ago) you have the option to help out on a ranch herding cattle, delivering mail or even hunting wild animals (the hunting missions dont include way points on your map which really ups the open world exploration of the game). You can even just go out and hunt buffalo if you feel like it a true variety on display throughout.The game has a basic weapons collection system which allows for a bit of variety when it comes to combat both in ranged and melee. Although you can't go to the store to buy your weapons as they can only be unlocked through campaign progress, their is a general store which sells upgrades for those weapons to improve things like damage and accuracy as well as other miscellaneous items including the nice little feature of a pick axe to go and mine gold allowing you to become the true claim jumping 49'er you've always wanted to be.The graphics are again understandably low quality and are of course of their time. Cut scenes can be a good laugh watching the characters mouth move in random contortions which apparently are producing words as their gun jaggedly no-clips through a horses head. I feel that it gives the game a bit of atmosphere i mean it wouldn't be expected now, but hey as i keep saying its a classic from 2005 and the game holds up so much more than just graphical quality.The game does have both mouse+keyboard and controller support though the controller will have to be manually mapped out for those who wish to truly experience the old-old-gen console experience. But hey real nostalgic trip a true classic and a worthy title to a returning fan or a new one. i'd have to give it a solid 9.5/10			"

												GUN™ is a great Western open world third person shooter in which you are playing as Colton White, and tracking down you're enemies after you're father is killed by a monstrous preacher and a group of savage Indians. Great mechanics and an awesome story allow for alot of great gameplay, because GUN™ doesn't take itself too seriously and yet has so much atmosphere and depth it is a great experience, just do whatever you want whenever you want and have a goodtime. Also side note if you think this is just a knockoff of read dead then you really have to play GUN™ because it's not just different, it's better.			"

												GUN is a very interesting game back from the old days. Well, to be honest, it's not that old of a game, but if you compare games made in this day and age to the tech of the old days, I'd say it's safe to call it old, but not ancient. If you've played Red Dead Redemption before, you'll see quite a few striking similarities between GUN and this game. I wouldn't be suprised if Rockstar got many of their ideas for Red Dead from this game, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, since inspiration is part of art anyway.I personally enjoyed the game and appreciated the open world it had to offer, although I did not enjoy the story. There are quite a few fans of the game that argue GUN is a much better game than Red Dead, but if you ask me, none of that is true in the slightest. Lemme elaborate my thoughts on this. You'll be able to understand this review a bit more if you've played Red Dead Redemption before, but if you're new to this genre, there's still a lot of information for you that's worth knowing.The Gameplay:Considering that the tech they had in 2005 was nowhere near as good as it was in 2010 when RDR was released, you can safely say that the open world in GUN is smaller and there is much less content. That doesn't mean the game is bad, and if you ask me, this game was pretty damn good for its time. As far as gameplay is concerned, you can ride a horse, explore the world, take part in side missions, or break the law, just like RDR. Also, remember the Dead Eye mechanic from Red Dead? You know, the one that allows you to slow down time and shoot enemies in slow motion? GUN had this very same mechanic five years before RDR took off where the game left and added improvements for it. As far as combat is concerned, you'll be put up against hordes of enemies attacking buildings and settlements, and you will take part in battles against your foes with allies. Shooting doesn't work nearly as well as it does in RDR, since aiming is dumbed down. Basically on GUN, if your crosshair turns red on an enemey, even if the crosshair's center isn't even on the target, you still still manage to shoot them regardless. With all that being said, the combat is repetitive but fun, filled with senseless violence and shooting you would expect from a game set in the Wild West. You can throw molotovs and dynamite, use pistols, use rifles, shotguns, you name it. A game like this was undoubtedly awesome for its time, but arguing that this game is better than RDR is completely laughable. The Story (don't worry, I won't reveal any major spoilers for GUN except the main character's name and personality, but there are major spoilers for Red Dead. I believe it's important to compare these two stories to get an idea of what GUN is all about):I remember hearing from somebody that GUN's story is better than Red Dead's. Before I played the game, I kept an open mind, and when I finally decided to buy it, I can definitely tell you that the story isn't executed well, even if you don't compare it to RDR. Am I saying the story is bad? First of all, the story's concept isn't bad, but the way it was executed was terrible later on in the game. Basically, the plot starts out this way: Something terrible happens to the main character. The main character sets of on a quest after a dramatic event, looking for answers about himself, and also trying to discover the sinister plans of his enemies. Is it different from RDR? Yes. For one thing, RDR's plot was rather simple, but there are complex meanings behind it. John Marstin (if that's how you spell the full name) was a criminal trying to fix his ways when the law holds his family hostage. He is essentially trying to pay the debt. Later on, John pays his debt to the law, which in turn stabs him in the back and kills him. His son grows up seeking personal revenge, and he finds the man who ordered his father to be killed, and kills him in return. What was Red Dead's story about? It was about the struggles of keeping morals when you live in a world where people only care for themselves. It was about dealing with the consequences of your actions, and how the desire to seek revenge for wrongdoings done unto you can turn you into the very people you despise. So yeah, RDR did have an amazing plot for sure, and the characters? Very well thought out. They fit the atmosphere of the game very well, which I will tell you more about after I talk about GUN's main character.So what makes Colton, the main character, different from John and his son? Well for one thing, even though this story is set in the Wild West, which means Colton is a gritty, tough hero like all heroes in a Western, one who is also motivated by personal revenge, you can easily argue that he still somehow manages to stick to the more noble path far better than John Marstin and his son.While many of GUN's characters, including Colt's allies, are believable, there is one villain I highly dislike. This one is a corrupt religious zealot working for the main villain. While I understand that he was a clergyman, the character design is awful. He looks more like somebody from the Middle Ages, and his personality doesn't fit well either. Other characters in the game, including the minions you shoot at, look more like a bunch of giants on steroids rather than humans. Now, for those of you wondering why I felt GUN's plot was poorly executed later on in the game, let me tell you why. It's rushed way too fast. On some missions, you will find yourself attacking an enemy base, and once you're done, you might expect a cutscene that will further explain the story and elaborate exactly what happened, but instead, you are immediately progress to the next stage. Is there anything wrong with more focus on gameplay? No. But there is something wrong with failing to elaborate on what you have done, and what awaits next BEFORE you progress. Conclusion:Yes, GUN is a good game, but considering that its open world has far less to offer, its gameplay has less features, and its story just feels rushed way too fast at the middle and the end, can you really safely argue that this game is better than RDR? There's no way you can. The point is that it is a gem worth playing, and it was definitely an amazing game for its time.			"

												Very good game, but very short. This game seems to focus on the side missions more than the story. There are several side missions, maybe even in the hundreds, while there are only around 8 story missions. There are epic boss fights and cut scenes.You're a native american cowboy on a quest to avenge the death of your father and ultimately save the wild west from a greedy man named Thomas Magruder and his gang of conspirators. He seeks a golden cross that leads to more gold, and ultimately giving him more power if attained. He leaves a lot of death on his pursuit, dating all the way back to him being a Confederate officer who used his division of the confed army to massacre people believed to have pieces of the cross. Eventually, he messes with the wrong man and leads to a Clint Eastwood-like showdown after you shoot his minions and their minions up.

												Gun is really good western game but really too short. I enjoyed playing it but after the story ended and the sidequests are done, there's nothing to do left.The story is pretty nice, the graphism are outdated and the gameplay is a bit rigid. Some battles can be hard but overall, the game was pretty simple for me. I had a few crash but not enough to make me angry and leave the game (warning : there is no auto-save for your progression).

												Unlike alot of people, who picked this game up out of nostalgia, I picked it up for the first time on PC. And I don't regret my decision, this is one of my favorite games of all time. The cast of characters is interesting, and the dialogue and voice acting are pretty great too. Besides Rockstar's take on an open-world western game (Which interestingly enough, seems to have a ton of things that seem based off this game), this is the only other one I know, and it's my favorite of the two. The further you get in the game, the more awesome your character becomes, earning new weapons, getting new skills, and having more options on what you can do. On hard mode (The difficulty I played through), the missions are challenging, and there were only 2 missions that I felt were unreasonably difficult (but I somehow managed to push through anyway). Another thing interesting is that on hard mode, especially when your not on horseback and are earlier in the game, you have to have a quick finger on the left mouse button so you don't get shot first. Some other interesting things to note about the game is that the leaning system is realistic in the way that it doesn't stop enemies from firing back, and that there is a variety of western side-missions to complete for cash and increasing skills. Overall, if you are looking for an excelllent open-world western game, than this is the game for you. It gave me 18.5 hrs of playtime untill I beat it (Doing all sidequests up to the end as well) and I noticed new missions pop up after the game was beaten .			"

												I wasn't sure what to expect from this game. I vaguely remember hearing good things about it when it came out ten years ago. It definitely looks like an earlyish GameCube era game, and has a few awkward hiccups here and there, but overall it runs well, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. My complaints so far are...-Key bindings could be more customizable. It won't recognize any buttons other than the L/R click on my mouse. I've accidentally button mashed myself to death on a few missions. The key to throw barrels of TNT is the same as the button to throw your selected grenade/explosive type weapon. One minute you're setting up an ambush in the intersection, the next thing you know, you took yourself out, and failed the mission for the tenth time. -Does occasionally crash. It's a well done port, but it's still a port, and isn't quite as stable as it could be. -THERE IS NO AUTOSAVE. If you fail a mission, it'll restart you where you picked it up, but if you quit the game, or it crashes on you, you'll pick back up exactly where you last manually saved. You have been warned.-Missions can be a little clunky. You have to blow up a boulder, but your tnt was dropped a few pixels too far away, and despawned, so you fail, and have to restart. You have to chase down a bandit that changes sprites in the gang every time you play it, and you'll fail even if you still have a direct visual on them, but they've moved just a few steps too far. You'll fail if you're doing an escort/follow mission, and stray too far ahead. -Crosshairs are more just boxes, and precision shots are tricky until you have a few hours in, and get a feel for how the hitboxes work. The Sharpshooter rifles are precise though, and since unlocking them, headshots are a breeze, even from horseback.Otherwise, it's a great game. The gameplay's enjoyable, the story's good, the map design is great, especially for as old as it is. I've lived in Colorado since '97, and the scenery really does capture some of the nostalgia I've gotten from travelling across the plains, and visiting old ghost towns and stuff.			"

												An Indiana Jones story. This is not so much of an FPS but an Action Adventure. The Animations are awful, even by 2005 standards,  butthe the voice acting and music are pretty good. 1080p is not natively supported and the FPS is capped at 30. This is a game that was obviously a console port, so put that AA to the max. But if you can put your master race elistism aside, you will enjoy this game.

												I first played GUN when one of my friends in middle school let me borrow some his PS2 games. I remember almost playing through GUN in one sitting. The gunplay is responsive and punchy, Tom Jane is Tom Jane, scalping dudes is pretty satisfying. The game is short as all hell and the missions can be kind of loosy goosy and repetitive. But in a world where games have to be hyper realistic/4k masterpieces, it is so refreshing to jam out a slightly ""old school"" gem.			"

												The only really strange thing in this game is that only the horses regenerate life automatically, hehe. Besides that, it is a great game that was (for me) a hit when released. I think I have finished it 3 or 4 times already (only the last time on steam).Having an open-world style and a little map, the game still manages to have a cool environment, bringing the confusion to you all the time. But have no fear, bow and rifle will keep you safe. The combat system is something normal, nothing beyond expected.There are ways to upgrade your character (side missions and shopkeepers) and mastering the game is not hard. Choosing the hardest difficult doesn't change the game besides making enemies only stronger (not even smarter. The kind of difficult leveling that I hate).The history line is simple and cliché, but do its part. The sound and artwork are good.In short, a game with no many inovations, but that in being short, probably will be worth playing. Discharging your barrel and taking scalps have its value.7/10			"

												GUN can be basically thought of as Call of Juarez, albeit more shooting and less running around dodging stuff. As Colton, you grew up under a harsh father learning to hunt and live off the land and horses and the rest. Until one day, your father told you he's not your real father, then to save you he threw you off the boat you've been defending as the boiler exploded. Your only clue is a token to the Alhambra Hotel, and Jenny, and a preacher Josiah Reed, who is working for someone... And it may involve Indian gold gathered up by Spaniards... The game involves shooting... LOTS of shooting. Pistol, rifle, shotgun, even a few whiskey bombs (i.e. molotov cocktails before Comrade Molotov changed it to gasoline) and later, precision rifle plus a bow. As you go through the plot missions, you'll unlock new weapons. And as you go through the game world, you can travel anywhere (between towns if you like) and indeed, some of the ""gold deposits"" you can mine requires buying a pick in town. A story mission would be escort the wagon through Apache territory (resulting in a couple checkpoints, including on horseback, static defense, go forward to find dynamite to clear a passage, then railshooter.  Another mission would be clearing the bridge of Apache presence, as they rush the bridge, check for explosives (you have to grab them and chuck them into the river) then escort the Chinese coolies to finish the job as Apaches attack, then finally defeat the Apache warrior leader with quickdraw and shoot fire arrows out of the air then kill the minions and finally leader himself. Betweens story missions you are encouraged to do the ""side missions"", which would give you bonus in various areas, such as pistol, rifle, shotgun, horse (speed), quickdraw, and so on if you complete them. The side missions are quite varied, including wanted posters (best if you wound the perp, then grab and knock out), but usually it's dead or alive (alive worth slightly more). Each town has a sheriff who will ask you to do things, basically run around town dealing with various troubles, usually involving shooting, but sometimes melee. There's also pony express where you need to make deliveries on a timer. There may be additional missions in town. Finally, there's usually a shopkeep where you can buy various upgrades, from fastloader for pistols to better knife to pistol upgrade (bore enlargement kit). There is a lot of terrain between towns, and lot of places to explore, and as mentioned before, there are gold in those hills (and you'll need a pickaxe from a shopkeep to get them). Finding them is part of the fun. As this game did come out more than 10 years ago, graphics are low-fi but good enough. Music is quite good, very orchetrally western. Voice acting is above average, though somewhat cliched. Gun sounds are adequate. The main problem is you basically spend your entire game depopulating the West, of one unsavory character after another. The game doesn't reallly have you do anything else (other then grabbing TNT barrels and chucking them, either into the river or put them at places where you do need to blow them up). The only time you really need to think was the wanted, where you TRY to sneak up on the guy but it probably doesn't work. While the controls can be mapped to gamepad, the game is best play with mouse and keyboard, where the added precision makes gun fights easier for you to pull off headshots or weapon shots (i.e. shoot weapon out of enemy hands). And in this game, you CAN blow enemy's head off. Rare, but it does happen, esp. with shotgun. Still, the game holds up even after 10 years, and IMHO, at some places, better than even Call of Juarez (the original) which has a very similar premise of sorts (in CoJ, people are also after the gold hidden and the protagonist is chased after by a nasty preacher with gun). If you can get it at bargain bin prices, it's worth a couple hours for sure. Just beware of certain nasty segments, like the quickdraw segments that require a lot of retries. And remember to save. A LOT.  "

												I remember the first time I played this game 9 years ago, the game still never fails to entertain me with all these western actions it offered. Shoot! Hunt! Scalp the head of your enemies! Play as Colton White on a trail of vengeance for his ‘father’ and discover his true past. Bandits, indians, and renegades stand in your way and the big irons on your hip are ready to do the talking. If you’re not in the mood for completing the main quest, there’s plenty of side quest for you to do in order to improve your stats or get cash for upgrading your arsenal of weaponry, ranging from cattle-herding, delivering goods, to bounty hunting.Good things from this game:+ Good music that really fits with the overall theme & atmosphere+ Interesting environment encourage players to explore+ Wide variety of weapons+ Solid gameplay+ Exceptional characters & dialoguesBad things from this game:- Short story mode- Once you're finished with the story mode and side quests, there's nothing left to do- Lack of replayability on the PC version- Small world			"

												For the time being, consider this the closest thing you can get to RDR on PC. It's a fun game, but unlike Redemption I feel like a lot is missing. The map is small and the campaign seems kinda short. The world doesn't feel as alive and vibrant as it could be, and graphical bugs seem frequent (Weird walk cycles, people moving without a walking animation from a distance, etc.).But my complaints of GUN end there because the game is an excellent western title. You play as Colton White, a young man who has to carry out missions to find a crook reverend named Reed after he ambushes a steamboat you were on, taking your father and a ♥♥♥♥♥ he knew to the river deep. You play between Dodge City and Empire City in Kansas (Both well known as the pinnacle western cities in popular culture, along with Wichita and other towns) fighting off gang members, raiders, Apache Indians and so on.If you've played Red Dead Redemption before this game then you should feel right at home. It has a pretty straightforward third-person mechanic where you can get weapons like a Schofield revolver, a lever-action rifle, Winchester Shotgun, tomahawk, whiskey bombs (Essentially a Molotov cocktail) and much more. Gunplay is very simple and intuitive, normal for a TPS, and you can use your revolver to slow down time with a Dead Eye-esque mode called Quickdraw. Plus, you can ride a horse. Why would you pass that up?While not as developed and gritty as RDR's excellent western epic of a story, the story is still well-thought-out, although from what I've heard it's relatively short. You can also do side missions such as being a ranch hand, helping the local sheriff or marshals, and, a wild west staple, hunt bounties, among other things. The score fits so well with the game and story, that I could see it very well in a spaghetti western if the graphics weren't so...you know...2005.Overall, it's a great game and I'd recommend it if you're a fan of the wild west, Red Dead Redemption (Much like myself), or just games like these in general. It's a smaller-scale RDR and despite its dated and sometimes buggy graphics and small map, I suggest you give it a look.			"

												Still a pretty good game considering when it was released, has a great storyline, yes, the graphics are old but still decent. I would definitely recommend this game to any western game fans out there, it goes on sale now and then too with the steam sales so give it a try, you'll be glad you did. Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is probably my favorite western game so far, since RDR still isnt out for pc , still hoping that they will make a port for it since i do not like playing on consoles, especially shooting type games. I'm hoping some company will come out with an epic game for pc set in the late 1800s with western type scenery, a massive open world like Just Cause, and an awesome quest style storyline with tons of side missions and stuff to see and do. That. would. be. awesome.  :)			"

												I have played this game extensively on Gamecube and Xbox 360. While the visuals may put you off at first, it will soon grasp you on the amazing story and stellar voice acting. The characters are very memorable, especially the  protagonist, Colton White, and his father, Ned, who he helps hunt fresh game in Montana for steamboats travelling the Missouri River. When travelling on the water after a successful hunt, the steamboat is ambushed, and Ned reveals to Colton with his dying moments that he is not his real father. Colton's journey across the West in the late 19th century is a tale of greed, brutality, and lust. It has one of the most gripping stories of any western game I have ever played. Sadly, as with being a western game, it is cursed to not sell very well. With the only exception to this rule beng Red Dead Redemption, not as many people have picked up this gem from 2005 - back when Activision was a semi-respectable publisher. It hasnt aged well, but the combat is still very fluent, if not a little repetitive. There are quite a few authentic sounding weapons from the time period, and you have an array of 6-shooters, hunting rifles, sniper rifles and shotguns to choose from, as well as melee weapons such as the bowie knife, cavalry sword, and tomahawk. Thrown weapons are added as well, including a whiskey fire bomb and dynamite sticks.The most unique mechanic this game has to offer is it's Quickdraw system. Yes,, it has been done in westerns before - time slows down, and you sling your pistol out and blast away at any man looking in your direction at the card table.Speaking of card tables, there a re quite a few mini games to be played here - poker tournaments, horse races, bandit raids, bounty hunting - you know, cowboy stuff. Overall, the game has a good story and atmosphere. You actually feel like you are Colton White, a man on a mission of vengeance and heroics - at the same time. Find Quivara, the City of Gold, and kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s behind the steamboat massacre all the while protecting the people from the dastardly Magruder, a failed politician and the trecherous murderer of Colton's true parents, which is an interesting character development as it is a complete surprise who his parents really were.  Tallied up, this game scores a 7/10, as long as you do not mind outdated textures and a rather small overworld map.			"

												Gun is the underrated masterpiece that too few had heard of. Gun is the game that Neversoft quietly made while most people were eagerly awaiting their next Tony Hawk game. Gun is the open world western of 2005, 5 years before Red Dead Redemption would hit stores as a critically and commercially successful western. People praised Rockstar for doing an open world western, but forgot about Gun.Gun is a gem, and everyone should play it. The story is strong. The voice acting from the leads, Thomas Jane, Ron Perlman, Kris Kristofferson, Dave Wittenberg, Lance Henriksen and Brad Dourif, nuanced and unequivocal. The soundtrack is perfect. The animation is outstanding. The gameplay is pretty good, but not perfect. There are so many reasons for owning this game and literally just one fallacy; the graphics.The only issue in Gun is the poor time release; late 2005, before the first next gen console would roll into stores, therefore, only taking advantage of what power the PS2 had left in it; and that's what PC gamers are getting, the PS2 port. It's not bad, hell, you can use a controller and configure it to your liking, all buttons mappable in the menu.Concering the plot, you are Colton White, voiced brilliantly by Thomas Jane. You start the game with your father, Ned White, hunting along the Missouri River. You fight some bears and this acts as the tutorial, learning how to shoot and whatnot. I REALLY don't wanna spoil anything, because the plot is so damn good. But from there, you end up on a steamboat to sell the meat with your father and a whole heap of ♥♥♥♥♥ happens. You meet one of the games antagonists and end up travelling to Dodge City. From there, you uncover mysteries of your father and your own personal past. The overall plot can be done in maybe 7 hours, but if you ♥♥♥♥ around doing side missions, bounty hunting, ranching, parcel delivery, being a marshal and deputy, you can squeeze in 12 hours or so.You meet these brilliant characters that come to life with, for 2005, really damn good animation; although the character's mesh will collide, the body motion is amazing and not robotic, like how some games are from over a decade ago. Whoever directed the cutscenes did their homework in film school, as the camera work is fantastic, tracking shots, over the shoulder dialog, full body view, some dutch angles. It's all intricate and brilliantly directed, I just can't believe this game was made by Neversoft, holy ♥♥♥♥.9.7/10P.S. If you're not already using ureschanger2 for older games that don't support widescreen, get ureschanger2 and follow the readme. It's very easy to use, just copy/paste the d3d9.dll and resolution.ini, changing the resolution to your liking. Once you get this bad boy in widescreen, the game looks a bit more glorious.			"

After a massecre on a ferry ship his father told him he is not his real father but to go see someone from Dodge, which contains many more problems of dealing with greedy people for a huge hidden cave full of gold of which none gets at the end of the main story. Game is quick should be done between 10-15 hours of playing for new players but for experienced ones I would say about 7-12 hours as i had beaten the main missions in 7.8 hours			"

												A fun game that really looks and feels like a classic western as a young man is on the hunt for justice to avenge his father in the harsh conditions of the Wild West. Along the way he comes into conflict with gangs, Indians and corrupt lawmen in a land where you must always be ready to skin your smokewagon (that's not a euphamism). If you're a fan of Red Dead Redemption, there is no doubt in my mind you'll love this one. Fluent control, exciting challenge and a magnificent love letter to western revenge movies.  Don't believe what the other hack reviewers are saying on steam. It might be old, but it certainly has charm and has aged relatively well. I guarantee you will like it.There is no emoticon for what I'm feeling.			"

												I bought this game many years ago for PS2 and sunk hundreds of hours into and 100% completed it more than once. After what seems to be close to 7 years since i last played it i decided to buy it on steam today and relive it. I have a few grips about this PC port so far. Nothing terribly condemning but it is a significant annoyance. First off i want to say that its annoying this game dosent at the very least support 1920 x 1080p resolution. It max resolution supported is 1280 x 1024. Most games of this time made by big companies usually had native 1080p support on the PC. Why this game dosent i am not sure. Its not a big deal because 1280 x 1024 dosent look horrible. This PC port is graphically superior by a large margin compared to the PS2 version. The bigger issues i have noticed in this port is that it has a plethora of audio bugs. So far since i started playing it on PC 3 hours ago i have encountered 3 different audio issues. The first time was right near the begginning after the steam boat sequence loads. The winchester rifle was bugged with the same firing sound as Ned's single shot rifle. The issue went away after i died a couple times but it is still something to note. The second issue i experienced with the audio was a synchronization issue with one of the cut scenes. The Audio was about 3/4 to 1 second delayed with what was going on in the cut scene. The third issue was after the stage coach mission from Dodge to empire. Well near the river bank on the route that you take on this mission after you leave the canyon there appeared to be one of the ambient sounds from the mission still playing when you got within a certain vicinity of the area. That was the only bugs i have noticed so far. Gameplay wise i havent noticed anything yet. Still feels like the same good old game i played back on the PS2. Overall this game isent bad but it isent the greatest. The graphics where pretty shoddy even back in 2006 so it hasent aged well like games such as GTA 3. Regardless if its your first time playing it ever the gameplay may seem dull, and the world unintresting which for the most part it is. The world dosent have much in the way of detail and things to do but i wont hold it against it to much. The shining part of this game is its short but compelling storyline, playing through it is loads of fun and the gun play is quite entertaining. People that have played this before years ago the hit of Nostalgia is great but Nostolgic or not dont buy this game unless it goes on sale. It was on sale today for 50% at $9.99 and i bought it but i would still call that pretty steep. Ideally if it goes on sale for $5 then i say its a good buy. Its steam MSRP is $19.99 and it is by no means worth that much so if its priced at $20 dont buy it. That money could be spent on a better game.			"

												Yeah, Where should I begin?I don`t know what to say, this game is really,really awsome!!I did not have so many hopes about this game at first, but I love wild western games so I bought It.If you love The wild west and games like that, then this game is a must! The story is soo great that I would like to replay it sometime.I would describe this like a babygame to ""Red dead Redemption"" because these two games are very similar. Gun 2 should have come out, but sadly they cancelled it.This is a great example that you should love a game for the gameplay and not for the graphics! :`)10/10			"

												This game holds a place in my heart, for it was the only game as a kid I'd play for hours on end during my childhood.Having never played RDR, I can't say what I don't know. For me this game's short, but action filled storyline makes you want more. It's like a true wild west movie, but with tons of plot-twists all over (I won't spoil that : ] ). I was never one for graphics, but I would say it would annoy you if you are considering this port was eh, but admirable non the less. The music is nice, however free roaming it has an idea to play when it wants too so you'll mostly stay hearing the footsteps of your horse. I'm going to be honest with you all, I'm doing this for the achievment...			"

												I played this game a long time ago on my xbox 360, like when it first came out. And this was evidentally a port of the PS2 game ""GUN"". Or maybe I am wrong but backstory aside. I consider this a gem of the early Xbox360 days and possibly the PS2 era. I was having fun but right now I am stuck on the last boss and I just got bored with this game. I recommend for those who want a nostalgic game or a replacement for Read Dead Redemption. It's linear and fun for a bit but after a while you figure out that there isn't that much to do. I HIGHLY recommend only get this on a 10$ or less sale. Not worth more than 10$ at best.			"

												Gun is an excellent open world western.  Follow the guides in the community hub to enable widescreen resolutions and GUN actually looks pretty sweet for such an old game. The gameplay, shooting and controls are very tight and before you know it, you will be drinking in the atmosphere.Consider GUN as a very worthy preamble to Red Dead Redemption.

												This is a very good game, at least for the first couple of hours, sadly the good impression is later on somewhat ruined by typical activision call of duty crap. Still, if you can buy it on a sale it's worth playing through to see some truly amazing elements.The good:+ nice menu (grand tale vibe)+ good story telling+ gun play+ music+ voice overs+ action style+ story+ horse gun fights+ amazing animations, movie like, cinematic+ shooting heads off+ gun stopping power+ upgrades+ some unique side missions like herding cows (works great)+ nicely fleshed out characters+ sharp turns with a horse+ one of the best horse animations I have ever seen+ diverse side missions that improve your stats+ bullet trail+ sounds+ hidden secrets+ weapon variety+ nice towns+ calf herding system!+ dust+ gun stopping powerThe bad:- camera work- mouse controls- some repetitive side missions- you are forced to do side missions or otherwise your stats will be painfully low- floaty barrels- at later states its hard to say where the bullets are coming from- aim assist (is riddiculous how it gets in the way)TL:DR: there was a potential for a nice gem, sadly ruined by activision's philosophy: more enemies = more fun, which is wrong...anyways still enough fun in here to make it worth your while, has some unique gameplay elements, beautiful animations and clever mechanics.

												A broken mess of a port kept me from even attempting to finish this game.I was only able to manage 2 and a half hours before I was sick of the issues with this one.First things first. The game, locked to 30 frames per second. Off to a great start.The texture work and character models are some of the worst I've ever seen.In first person the field of view is absolutely nausea inducing. It's so zoomed in the guns were clipping with things that were 3 feet in front of me. Doesn't help that the gun is so massive in this view it takes up a ton of the screen.And some of the all time worst mouse acceleration I've ever seen. The difference is moving your mouse the same distance slow and fast, one time turning 90 degrees and the second time spinning around 3 times.The port quality here is unnacepptable, don't pick this one up. At least not on PC. It's not worth the trouble.Footage/Video Rant :

												I can almost always handle replaying some games from years back, but this one surprisingly did not age well for me. I played it for a little bit and could not force myself to play anymore.Really, it is sad, however, because I played it when it first came out and unless my memory is out of wack, I enjoyed it a lot more than I am enjoying just now. It seems like everything has fallen apart - and maybe some of my tastes have shifted over the years; I mean, it has been over a decade.Now people bring this up a lot in relation to Western games - but Red Dead Redemption really is a greater one. The only reason I even bring this up is because I actually replayed it within the past year as well, and it aged much better than this game (but it certainly isn't perfect). However, that only had to uphold 5+ years whereas this one is 10+.The looks of this game are really bad, even for when it was released, and the characters are pretty bad from the get-go. The controls were just all over the place - everything was really jittery, and all of the characters and objects were really jittery, moving in sloppy robotic ways.It just made my memories of it fall apart.

												This game is fun but I don't think that most people would like this game if they are looking for a good story. The story is really short and cheesy at times and it made me feel like I was playing a game made by an amature company. The combat is fun, good selection of guns, and fun side missions. You can play poker but it's kinda pointless since there isn't much stuff in shops. After you finish all the side missions the game is pretty much pointless unless you want to play poker and look around the open world. (Which is very small so once you've finished the game you've seen it all.) Plus you can buy this game for playstation 2, xbox, and gamecube for around 5 dollars instead. I give it a 6.8/10			"

												It was fun 10 years ago, but this hasn't aged well at all.It doesn't natively support widescreen resolutions so you need to get third party fixes for that and then on top of that it plays like crap cause of the always-on-autoaim and the gameplay is just archaic and dull with no real tactics or nuances to it.Graphically it's pretty awful too, coming out at a time where excessive bloom was all the rage.Storywise it was never that great to begin with and I recall it being really short too, something like a 10 hour long campaign.I'd advise to steer clear no matter what, if you never played then you're not missing much and if you're looking to get it for nostalgic reasons I'd leave those memories alone.

												I'd like to recommend this game but I can't. For one thing, good luck making it work on dual or triple monitor setups. It just black screens. And then when you disable your other monitors, it has a tendancy of crashing making it impossible for me to get past the prologue. That and the game doesn't run in widescreen and is capped at 30fps. You're better off buying a 360 and getting Red Dead instead unless you happen to be lucky enough to get past the problems here.EDIT: For total bellends who can't read: Buy it on the ♥♥♥♥ing PS2 for ♥♥♥♥s sake.

												A friend of mine gave me a physical copy of GUN because he wasn't a PC gamer probably five years ago, and I remember slogging through what's probably one of the most generic,cliche-riddled action games I've ever encountered. I eventually sold the game (back before Steam when selling used games was still a thing; thanks Valve for taking away that revenue stream) but had an attack of nostalgia a few weeks ago and finally decided to pick it up on a Humble Sale for about $5.I never beat my physical copy of the game, though I was able to slog through to the end and its absurdly difficult boss fight. I never made it that far this time around, mainly because I decided my life was just worth more to me than playing through this truly awful game.Now, I'll get this out of the way first: certain parts of GUN are really good. For a game with such awful visuals the voice acting itself is actually quite good, with special mention going to Ron Perlman and Kris Kristofferson, and the soundtrack is also quite nice. That's really the most I can say about the game, though, as the rest is quite garbage.The story itself is just...I really don't know what to say about it, other than it feels like an absurd, over-the-top genre parody of actual Westerns rather than a serious attempt at making a good Western itself. Keep in mind, this was originally a Gamecube game so it's not really fair to compare it to later titles (most notably Red Dead Redemption) but the fact remains Westers as a genre had been around for a lot longer than video games, and there was so much other material the developers could've drawn in. Instead, we get a very strange arcade-shooter/RPG hybrid that never actually manages to make use of its own logical core mechanics. For example:There's an arbitrary stat buff given at the end of ever sidequest. There is not, however, an actual leveling system, so it's hard to really keep track of what these values actually represent.There are kill chain mechanics for killing large groups of enemies in a row with a specific combat style (i.e., chaining several kills with melee weapons), as well as for getting headshots or shooting weapons out of their owners' hands. Since there's no score or level up system, this mechanic feels completely pointless.There are several instances where the player is given a mounted weapon with infinite ammo and wave after wave of Valve-level stupid AI to slaughter. While this sort of works when that weapon is a Gatling Gun, it becomes ridiculous when it's a canon (and it's a canon most times).This, of course, isn't helped by the fact which the game is named after (the guns) are themselves pretty bland. Most of the weapons depicted are lever action, except none of them fire this way: the rifles fire on semi-auto, and the 1887 (the most iconic leveraction weapon in history) is a single shot shotgun. While it's nice to see a wide range of authentic Western shooting irons in the game, the fact the developers went to exactly no effort to make sure they were depicted realistically is disappointing.There are other mechanics which are handled much the same. Your character, Colton, and most of the people you run into are never especially interesting and it's difficult to take any of them seriously. This is compounded by some of the absurd things you and NPCs will both yell in combat (Colt, for instance, seems to think he's in Vietnam and will shout ""Get some!"" quite often for no real reason). The models themselves aren't animated well, and there's one constantly reused conversation animation that looks like it'd be right at home in the original Resident Evil. There are a lot of people who have lots of nostalgia regarding this game. I'm personally not one of them since I didn't enjoy the game when I first played it and I'm really not sure why I bothered buying it a second time. If you're someone who played the game back in 2005, you'll probably be content with the Steam version now. If you're not, however; if you're someone who's not ever touched it before, I highly recommend trying other more recent shooters instead (such as Call of Juarez or even Fallout: New Vegas) as both are much more rewarding. GUN had a lot of potential, but it never really goes anywhere and that's all there is to it.			"

												A classic game that is more enjoyable years after the first time you play it.  Used to play on Playstation so having better graphics on PC is a plus.  And story is well played out with good cutscenes and gameplay for its time.  I highly recommend buying this is you:A. Have played before and are looking for a great nostalgia filled experience.B. Are a wild west cowboy gun slinger who is home sick.C. An interested buyer whos never played before and are second guessing whether to buy it.  (Just Do It)D. ALL OF THE ABOVE			"

												This game takes about 8 hours to 100%. It's old and graphics are nothing to write home about. But the gameplay itself is pretty good, good weapons selection, interesting main missions (with a predictable story), the combat actually feels rather smooth (shooting arrows and dynamite out of the air feels very nice). It's a game for a weekend, buy it at a discount, enjoy it for a day, and forget about it.			"

												There are parts of this game that are really fun then there are times where this game can be dull... It is an old game though so I can't complain a whole lot. Could of used a more indepth story though. Something to drag you in... Heck in the first town I can't tell you how many empty buildings there where or the fact you could see the end of the world. They could have taken a little more time using some creativity but as I said it is an old game. As I also said there are the good parts there too... So don't let the game pass you by. It is something to add to your western collection. However the one wesetern game on here I can't get enough of is the Call of Jaurez. That is the only western on pc worth the time. However if Rockstar ever came out with Red Dead on PC hands down that is the best western game alive. Just wish Rockstar would do it.... Doubtful though... Anyways the game gets a thumbs up but in truth it is a so so kinda game. Buy at your leisure. Course I haven't had the chance to get any further so it might draw me in by the end but for now just know ""Buy at your Liesure""!!!!			"

												The Good: The game has a decent plot--although there are some pretty major holes. Cole is a likeable protagonist, bordering on an anti-hero. The game also allows you to continue playing after you beat the main questline, in case there were any side missions that you missed before taking down Magruder. While I wouldn't play this game again right away after beating it, it does have some replay value, and the soundtrack is reminiscent of both Firefly and Tombstone.The Bad: The side missions can get repetitive after a while, and the A.I. isn't great on your allies. They're more likely to walk into a bullet than avoid it, and there are plenty of missions that you'll fail if they die. The game also has an odd habit (particularly during the Magruder fight) of not giving you instructions on a mission until your health is nearly depleted and you can't do much other than die and start over. The Pony Express missions are also kind of pointless--at most, your horse gets more health and you get $5 for essentially running a horse race back and forth across the map. Pretty dumb.The Ugly: Some of the writing in this game is downright laughable, and most of the side characters are cardboard cutouts. Apart from Cole, there really is no character development. Magruder and his posse are evil because the game needed antagonists--no other reason. Likewise, you as Cole don't particularly gain anything by completing the main quest apart from having the satisfaction of killing all of the bad guys and feeling like the Man With No Name out of an Eastwood western. All in all, the game is pretty good and definitely worth playing at least once, but the creators could have done a lot more with this to make it even better than it is.			"

												Brilliant game. Classic western with an excellent storyline. The ONLY thing that stumps me is: Why did Magruder leave the cross at the house where Colton and Many Wounds were in the prologue? Magruder picks up the cross, then gets shot at by  Colton's mother, then drops the cross, kills everyone and rides off, leaving the cross behind where it is picked up by Many Wounds. I only just noticed this recently, because of the game being so good. 9.5/10.			"

												It's pretty decent, but it's showing its age a lot. It's really silly and excruciatingly stupid, but it's really fun partly because of it. The gunplay is fairly watered down compared to similar titles, though, with excessive aim assist and a reticle that rather than hinting at a specific point of aim is in fact a full circle defining where a pistol WILL hit rather than where it may hit. So shooting is very, very easy.I like how a lot of the areas seem laid out similar to an old west style shooting gallery. Pretty fun.6/10. It's alright.			"

												I spent so many hours on the PS2 playing this simple, wonderful, yet fulfilling game. It is a great game for memories, but compared to modern free roam games it doesn't hold a candle. If you didn't buy this game in the past and experience it then then I don't know if you would be interested, but if you are interested I can say that there is fun to be had here.

												The ending of the game is way harder than the rest of it, on the brink of disappointment. I spent like four hours just for that one level (the last one). That is too much.Having said that, if you like western mood, and don´t mind having to watch people and animals move without leg movement (as sometimes happens), this is a cool game.Here you have shooting, a reason to relate to the main character, and the western mood.

												I'm surprised I never picked this up back in the PS2 era--it's a pretty decent shooter. And that--the shooting--is the meat and best part of GUN. It is a little flawed; for example, the game world itself feels underdeveloped, perhaps limited by the power of the PS2, offering little to no incentive to explore the map. But if you're up for six hours of largely mindless shooting with fun mechanics, the game is worth playing provided it's on sale for no more than about 4.99.			"

Now a couple hrs in and I am very much enjoying this game. Makes me feel like John Wayne, playing through one of those old spaghetti western films. The graphics are old school, from the early 2000's, but it still manages to look good. The controls are solid and easy to use; I thought this might be an issue as I use mouse & Keyboard, but no the key bindings actually work quite well. Definitely recommend!			"

												Ahh... sweet sweet nostalgic memories. This is a game me and my father would play when I was just a child. It's an open world western game with a great story, great gameplay, great gunplay, and great immersion. It has character progression; every time you do a side mission or hunt a bounty, or choose to kill or subdue a wanted criminal, etc. you get money (which goes towards buying upgrades from shopkeeps like increased ammo, more horse stamina, or more damage.) and increased stats. Certain types of side missions increase certain stats. Story missions don't progress your character any, but that's what makes the game fun. If you cannot beat a certain part, you can do side missions to increase your stats so you can do so. You get more guns throughout the campaign, meaning the combat doesn't get stale because you always have new ""tools"" to try out. I recommend playing this game on the hardest difficulty, or second to hardest, because only then do you really get the full experience of needing to increase your stats to progress. If you play it on the lowest difficulty you can breeze through the whole game with eaze. The immersion is so good and so thick (if you can get past the graphics, which to me, weren't a bad thing, especially for the Playstation 2 era.) and they really go above and beyond to make you feel like you are in the wild west. It's brutal, realistic, your character changes clothes over time, and you can play poker. (!!!) This game is a win-win and honestly worth every penny. Also, something to note: headshots are HEAVEN in this game, when you shoot someone in the head  with a sniper rifle, their head just pops. (and at one point, you man a cannon and you can headshot people with that as well, which is pure joy.) I cannot recommend this game more. I constantly had a blast. -EDIT: The story mode on normal difficulty took me 8 hours to complete. I didn't rush through it or try to 100% or anything. A casual playthrough on normal took me 8 hours.			"

												Besides Red Dead Revolver, this and Red Dead Redemption are the only worthwhile third-person Western era games. The stock controls are a little wonky (but I'm sure there is ways around it to use a controller instead or even change the keyboard controls to better suit your needs.) Also, the campaign itself is only about six hours long (maybe even less) in it's entirety. But to make up for it, upon finishing the campaign my save file says the game is only 55% completed, so the side missions must be more plentiful than I thought. (However, the side-missions do not supply to the story and do not upgrade your character enough to make them worth your time.) There is no auto-save, which I learned the hard way. The graphics are not to today's standards (which is to be expected of course) and yet still, the game has times when the frame rate drops dramatically for a second or two. However, that does not take away from the overall expierence of a Western game worth your time, especially at the price of $4.99, which is what I paid. Buy it if you like Western era games at all, especially at the low price that is stated above. It's a classic!			"

												Story TimeMany years ago when I first encountered the PS2 classic Red Dead Revolver I knew I was in love when I first played the game thanks to the western motive and styling as well as the enjoyable gameplay it brought as well. Now when was 4-5 years old I remember seeing commercials for Gun and always begged my dad to get it for me. Of course he never let and always gave me the speel of ""Oh its violent"" like any other kid my age at the time. Now 11 years later I now own the game and let me tell ya after those long awaited years my expectations have been none the more met.The Positives:For an old game running on a modern opperating system Gun runs flawlessly and despite how dated the game may appear it does pay a lot of attention to detail mainly in character models and atmoshpere. The controls are a little weird at first in my opinion and they could have been better but again this game is 11 years old so I will cut it some slack in that regard. You are also given plenty of variety in side activities that reward you with cash and stat points which give the game some light RPG elements and its almost recommended to do these side jobs when you can in order to progress at a smoother pace with enemies that pose a real threat. The Neutral:Despite the given variety in missions is does get a little repetative but not to much to where it will jade any sort of enjoyment for the player. The Negatives:Now if your all into graphics this game will dissapoint you since it is dated and it dosent support modern resolutions like 1920 by 1080 and the graphic options are also quite bleek with detail.Overall its a fun game with some smart writing and characters but overall just being enjoyable			"

												I have not played it much on steam BUT this is one of the greatest games ever made.This game made me good at games where you have to focus like on CS:GO wich im plying alot today and before i played CS:GO i played Call of Duty wich you also had to focus on,I finished this game 10 times before i even tried ANY other game then my disk broke and my Playstation 2 wich i played it on.One question for you all did you play a game called Timesplitters to?

												As one of my favorite games, I can say that as of December 2016, this is by far, the best open world western game you can hope to play on PC.Also, as a personal opinion, this is the greatest western game you can ever hope to play on any platform. I would seriously drop a boulder on a one-eyed Lance Henriksen for a sequel.			"
