												Ok i bought this game during the summer sale and so far I like it!The Good!Open world.. You can do what you want to do if you have some imagination!A large mapped out universe with safe systems.. Not so safe systems.. And just down right Angry systems!Even more systems that arn't mapped out... Not sure how many so far, I have only found a few of them and their hard to find which is a good thing! Remember Space is a big place so it shouldn't be to easy to find everything! You can Generate space stations in locations you chose that arn't to close to other stations.. Gives you a tactical advantige or a trading benifit, howerver you wish to use it! Thats kinda up to you to figure out!You can Mine, Trade, Do Missions from a mission board, or just Pirate cargo from NPC ships to make credit'sGuessing 30 plus spacecraft frames to chose from..Or upgrade to with in game credits if you can find a station that has them!Upgradeable engins, cargo bays, wings, fuel tanks and Sheilds if you can afford them!A really Neat wepons lab where you can craft your own version of the perfect Beam or Partical wepons!A hanger in most stations where you can store a frame for later use..... For a price of course!Good flight model with inerta or thrust driven modes and even an in atmosphere mode.Custimazable enough controlls without being just way to much and confusing!Can land on planets and planet base Locations.Can fly inside some very large astroids and find some lootable stuff!Can get a Mech Walker and walk planetside or even fight planetside if you can find something to fight!Good bit of tech to buy in the stations and with limited space it make's you think and make desisions on how you want your ship to performe, Not enough room for everything so you have to decide whats important for the way you want to play.. The largest ships in the game cant carry everything even!  and thats a good thing, makes you think!I have read some reviews about a hard learning curve.... This is my first space sim since Tie Fighter and it took a while to learn but it wasn't bad and that was part of the fun in my opinion!Theirs more good stuff but just cant remember it all!The Bad!Making credits is to easy once you figure out where to buy low and sell high... Some players think you have to find the lost city but you can make credits really easy just paying attition to prices... On my second Pilot I made 50 Million in just a few hours of game play because I had figured it out on my first pilot.. Needs to be a bit harder to make credits so you can't just get the best gear so quick!TO HARD TO FIND OTHER REAL PLAYERS TO PLAY WITH.... I have managed to log onto a multiplayer server but I was the only player on it  :(  Would be nice if you could find others to play with! Seems like not to many people play multiplayer sadly..It might be fun!Not enough Places to store loot in the hangers...Yes you can use multiable hangers in multible Space Ports but Dang their expensive and a pain being so spread out... Would like to see them let you chose a hanger locaion or build a Space Port to use as your home base and let you store multable ships and alot of looted and Pillaged goodies!   Can't figure out how to create my own Guild?  Would be neat if you could start your own guild then search out an uncharted galaxy... then build it up with Ports and stuff and have your own guild Galaxy, If you could name it that would be even cooler but some peeps would do some real silly names I relize sadly!If you lack Imagination... You will probably get bored after a while... Persionally I keep trying to find new stuff and tinkering around to see what i can do.... I'm still learning the deepth of the game!Anyway all in all it has been fun even if I havent got to play multiplayer yet!  But maybe someone will see this review and we can find a server and start building a universe!Sleepy			"

												I would have preferred a better reviewing system that would allow me to moderate my point, but this will have to do. If I had to give an honest opinion of whether or not you should get the game, I would say that it depends of what you're looking for, as well as how patient you are. This game actually came pretty close to a good recommendation for me : you're relatively free to do what you want, you can customize your ship on several aspects, you have multiplayer, if you're into that stuff... It doesn't look half bad either, the menus are clear and precise, the gameplay is pretty good, and the combat in particular is quite involving.The game does suffer from a few flaws, though, one of them being fatal in my eyes. The first one is that even though you can customize you ship, the different modules you get are nothing more than upgraded versions of what you already have. What I mean is that you don't have the choice between a shield that's very strong and one that's less strong, but recharges quickly, that sort of thing. You just have ""small shield that's not great but will fit on small frames"", and it gets bigger from that.Another flaw, this one more important : ennemies aren't all that smart, and seem to have access to an unlimited supply of missiles, or at least that's the impression I get. Combat isn't bad in itself, but make one mistake and you're likely to get blown up, so it encourages a sort of ""jousting"" pattern that can get repetitive. Your fights will be pretty much the same every time.Last problem I have with this game, and this one is what made me give it a negative recommendation : the reputation system is absolute garbage. So, you have several factions in this game, and doing contracts for them or destroying their ships will impact it. Okay. But your reputation in a sector won't carry over to another, it's just for THAT sector. That means that you can (WILL, if you're following the plot) stumble on sectors where the Navy don't like you. At all. They don't know you, they don't know where you're from, or what you want, but boy do they know they want you dead. And we're not talking about pirates, we're talking about the NAVY. So pretty much every ship you'll come across here are hostiles. You'll want to bribe them, but they won't answer your trade requests. And here comes the REALLY dumb part : you'll want to do a few contracts for them, but for that, you'll have to dock in the station while everyone is trying to kill you, then pay a fee to even be able to bring up the contracts menu, then leave the station without getting shot down on the way out, then reach the mission waypoint. And do you think they'll stop shooting you just because you accepted to do their work ? ♥♥♥♥ no, don't be insane. Good luck trying to do your mission while having to fend off unlimited waves of hostiles and their flood of missiles. And good luck trying to get a good rep with those guys if you have to blow their ships up while doing THEIR job that THEY gave you. Not that you really CAN, since you won't last long against 15 bad guys and their unlimited reinforcements... I really wanted to like that game, it had so much potential... But as you can see, despite the apparent choice you have to decide what you'll want to be, you'll get shoehorned into investing in weapons and strong shields to even have a chance. That, or ignore the sectors where everyone and their mother will try to kill you for no reason, but that's just really, really dumb...			"

												""I saw a distant planet with rings like saturn, as i flew closer i could see the rings were made of tiny particles of water as i drifted through them in my starship"" - 8.5/10EM is a sandbox space pilot simulator. It provides you with all the tools you need to live the life of an intrepid space explorer as you blast around an (almost) infinite galaxy filled with collossal space stations, glittering nebula, astroid belts, and planets.How you choose to use this sandbox is very much up to you. Want to be a fighter pilot? No problem. Want to mine and trade precious minerals? You got it. Feel the need to build a fleet and have your own armada? Ok. Wanna explore the farthest reaches of the universe either by jumpgate or just pointing your ships nose at a distant star and pushing on the throttle? Oh yes! Fancy visiting the surface of that giant blue planet over there? Yep. Maybe cruise across mountains and dock at the local trade city for repairs and fuel? Sure.Whatever you want to do EM has you covered.However, despite the fact that it is probably obvious by now that I am impressed with this game it is only fair that I point out a few low points and niggles.Firstly, the graphics. They are pretty dated. Still, what is here is all done pretty well. Distant stars flare light across your cockpit, nebula and gas clouds sparkle and shimmer as electrical storms rage, and giant space transporters lumber across the sky. On the downside the textures are all pretty bland up close. This is not so bad in space but it is on the planet surfaces that this really lowers the immersion. The actual concept of being able to fly from outer space, into the planet's atmosphere, and right down to the tree line is brilliant and the mechanics of it work really well. Unfortunately when you get there you see that the surface is just barren and featureless. A few sparodic trees and one or two cities is not enough to save this part of the game. A real shame as the actual descending to, and launching back up from, the planets is a lovely experience. Its just annoying that there is nothing to do when you get there.Secondly, this is no hand holder. You will need to use the forums and wiki's to get to grips with this game. My six and a half hours playtime probably equates to about half of that as actual 'game' time. Still, nothing worth having is easy and  i found the learning quite fun.Lastly, the quests are pretty generic. You will make more money in ten mins of mining than by doing a dozen starter quests. Also there is a very limited amount of detail at times as so far as the living, breathing galaxy goes. There are lots of other ships, constant radio chatter, and dozens of busy space ports, but i'm yet to see anything along the lines of real faction interactions. Still, not been playing long so we'll seeDon't let these points put you off, there are a few mods available for graphical tweaks and the community is still pretty active and helpful for the learning side of things.EM is a wonderful opportunity to just grab a spaceship and jet off to the stars. You'll be glad that you did.			"

												Really fun.  Great graphics (especially with the mods, which are worth looking into) and sound. Singleplayer and Multiplayer (basically the Singleplayer world but with other players on servers). No real loading screens except for like, 20 seconds when you first start playing.  The game install itself is less than 200 MBs or so but if you don't like even the starting loading screen, setting the 'Procedural' generation to 'Pre-Generated' adds 2+ GBs and makes it so it doesn't have to reload everything every time.  Very useful.You can go from space right into planets and land on a major trade city or maybe walk around the surface in a terrain walker mech (but don't go too fast in atmo unless you want to burn up), manage your fuel levels, take some contracts or follow the storyline (not necessary unless you want to follow it) or be even more enterprising and find a way to maximize profit by buying low, selling high, mining hydrogen or water or metals and turning that into something which you might turn into a warp drive that you can sell for much more.  Hire crewmembers to make your ship perform better (but keep paying so that they don't jump ship next time you dock).  The combat has a learning curve (the game has proper Newtonian physics but also a setting that uses your engines to try to keep your ship still for the most part when you throttle down) but once you get into it, it's very exciting and strategic. The universe is massive and you can pretty much fly in any direction and you'll find unmapped sectors with planets.  Or you might have a run-in with pirates or the mysterious Vonari alien race.  The playerbase is still finding new things in the universe regularly.  The game really understands space travel.  Not everything is on the same x-axis or y-axis and you might warp somewhere to find out that the station is actually above you a ways.  Little touches like that add to the whole feel of actually being in space.You wanna build a station for repairing your ship or constructing things and hide it out in the unmapped sectors of space?  Go do that. I'd suggest the game to people that enjoy open sandbox games, space as a setting, sci-fi, and games like Elite.  The game doesn't care if you're a miner, a racer (yeah, there are space races, which are very interesting with the newtonian physics), a fighter pilot, a bandit that uses a cargo scanner to pick targets and blast 'em, a trader that's playing the markets, or maybe you just want to shuttle people from one station to another.  It's all up to you and this game really excels at that.			"

												If you're a fan of space-flight sims, this one is pretty interesting. It's mostly a sandbox that gives you an option to follow a storyline of missions that will lead you in the general direction of a reward. The learning curve isn't too steep and you'll likely learn something new about the game throughout the time you play it.The closest to a ""ground game"" you can get is to buy a terrestrial walker so you can walk around on the surface of planets after seamlessly entering the atmosphere from space and descending down to the surface, of course. Aside from that, you can't actually leave your ship. Better hope your cockpit doubles as a restroom!			"

												I've played now during a while (+500h) and i'm still not bored and apparently it's not going to finish :)Well I won't repeat what you can do in this game because all is pretty much describe in the page ahah.I will just say the game is still living with a nice communauty who like help new people.The game is still uptaded regulary and improved. I need say it was created and still updated by only one man..... When you see the result final this man is close to be a genius! Many mod was created by players so you could customize a lot of things into the game as you wish.Event are regulary organise to creat activity into the game.Various clan into the mp are still available. PVP are respectfull. Players ask 98% of the time to another player if they want have a fight. Exeption of course clan against clan wich is logic. So it's pretty safe.A couple of team speak 3 are proposed by players for talk easier.Exept the trade station you build, Sp and mp are link. Everything you do in one are do in the otherone. So if nice to see some player online. It's not only fight.I will just say it's the best game I ever played of my life. (add me on steam for more information or question I will be happy answer your question or help new players)I can speak english or french as you prefer.			"

												This is the first time I've ever bothered to write a review on Steam.  Long story short - EM has really struck a chord with me and I'd happily reccommend to others hungry for some immersive, expansive, open-universe space fun. I'm only just getting started into this game; only 50-odd hours so far - but already I am REALLY liking the experience, and can envision this consuming MANY hours in the future.  This game seems to give me what I've been looking for in a space sim game for a long time.  The atmosphere, the feel, the freedom and sense of scale - really succeeds in giving the feel of a lone wolf mercenary with the vastness of space just outside his cockpit.I started slow; some mining, some trading, some exploring, some simple contracts - and have only in the last session or two had a taste of combat.  That's part of what's great about this game: you do what you want to do.  And even after just scratching the surface I can see there is a LOT to do in this big chunk of space.  Love the mood (or moods) of the game; relaxing one moment frantic the next depending on what you want; where you go, what you do.I'll admit to being personally shallow enough that I needed to get a cockpit and UI mod before really being able to get immersed - made a huge difference and there's tons to choose from.  Don't let the first few seconds of the game throw you.  There is a LOT of beauty in this game (I've taken a ton of screenshots already), and the feel is top notch.I've only played singleplayer so far, but the multiplayer sounds great - enough to convince a die-hard singleplayer to be very tempted to dip in.. soon.  The community seems active and friendly, and the dev (yes, a single individual is behind this!) deeply involved and interested and responsive.  And it would seem he is currently working hard on the next iteration - which seems like it will only make this very good thing even better, much better.  Can't wait.. but in the meantime I've a huge chunk of space to explore, so back to it..!** EDIT: Surprise! Evochron Legacy has now been released on Steam!  Saw it - bought it - downloaded it - now it's play time!  **			"

												An excellent space combat simulator that has all the bells and whistles of most AAA titles; except it's made by one person.  Don't blow this off as some clone or half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt; this will give everyone who enjoys space combat sims plenty of entertainment. It may not be as polished or in-depth as games like Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen; but it is complete, and works 100%.The star system is vast, mostly contained within our own Milkyway galaxy. I don't think any person has enough time to completely explore the whole area; as it would take thousands and thousands of hours to do so. There are many unexplored areas that are left for the player to find on their own; but there are plenty of ""inhabited"" planets and sectors in between to keep you busy. There are planets with terrain, atmosphere, bases, vegetation, and resources that you will also need to explore, either by ship or on foot. You can customize your vessel almost however you want; from re-arranging the chassis and different sections, to customizing weapon platforms and even your character/crew.The only ""cons"" that I have is the small (but active) community, and slow (but consistant) progress to perfection. However, these are easily forgivable since they are mostly my opinion, and theres still 1000x more to this game than just multiplayer and eye-candy.There's really too much to write about, and I have barely scratched the surface. It's best to support a great and dedicated developer and see for yourself! It's cheap, and even goes on sale from time to time.  Check out the official forums and SeeJay's www site for starcharts, information, and mods.			"

												This game is worth getting for the incredible space-flight simulation.  But like the ground-breaking ""flight sims"" of the 1990's anything past that in this game earns a resounding ""eh"".Cleaning solar pannels is a pain as you have to get 100% instead of 90%, so you end up re-cleaning cells you could have sworn you cleaned previously.  Harvesting asteroids is such a snore I played another game on my cell WHILE playing this one and harvesting.  But the combat is indeed enjoyable and the truly zero-gravity flight is well worth the experience.			"

												While this game is quite fun, and you literally can do almost anything you want to, it has it's shortcomings. The biggest being the limitations of upgrades. There are only a few ships you can possibly obtain, and they are not very upgradable. You are unable to have a cargo hauler with a gigantic cargo bay. All ships of all models are limited to 5 slots. Sure, you can end up making lots of credits but what the heck are you gonna do with it? options are really limited.			"

												Amazing, the only thing more amazing is the optimization and performance.   Runs great on my old XP machine, and doesn't need a ton of Ram or Hard Drive space.It is also supremely cool to be able to go from space to planet surfaces seamlessly.  Even planetary rings become space dust when you fly into them.There IS a learning curve with the complex controls, (most of the keyboard is bound to something lol) but eventually you learn which controls are important and which are just there for extra fine control.  I found transposing the arrow key binds with the WASD ones really helped, and there is a training mode to help you get accustomed to the controls and general gameplay.  You can map most of the important controls onto a standard USB PS1 controller.I'll also mention that space station contracts are where the meat of single player objectives are, and space gates allows travel to different galaxies.Combat feels like a refined version of Wing Commander, and there are times I feel like I'm playing a sandboxed version of that, which is a good thing IMO.  Get this game if you like space.  It has definitely earned it's Very Positive rating.  I'm thoroughly impressed. "

												Amazing game.  Sorta ilke EVE online but a lot more focus on flying than economy.  Economy is still a big part of the game and finding trade routes and exploring new planets for profit is a ton of fun.  Exploring is INSANELY difficult and requires use of many tools to find the untold number of secrets in this game.  You can even travel to our solar system, Sol, and visit all the planets around us (if you can figure out how to actually get there!).  Switching between multiplayer and single player is seamless in that it allows you to use the same pilot if you want, progressing in one will progress your character in both.Graphics are beautiful, controls are tricky at first but very intuitive once you get the hang of it, and pvp/pve is a lot of fun.  The physics aren't exactly realistic, but they do interia well and gravity is a factor when close to a celestial body.  You can do whatever you want, but for a little guidance there's a story mission line that will take you through most of the universe and into some expensive secrets!			"

												This is an often overlooked gem of a space sim. Known for a very steep learning curve, especially with the flight model within a newtonian physics engine. Amazing but challenging.Works well with mouse + keyboard, gamepad (360 USB) and Joysticks (Logitech Extreme 3D Pro and CH Fighterstick). Doesn't need the newest system to run maxed and looks pretty damn amazing in most situations.Vice (the creator) is an amazing individual. I've purchased the last two titles as well, playing the hell out of them learning as I go. The Evochron series has been a solid space sim series for those that want the pilot experience. So much has been accomplished with Mercenary, just been amazing to be a part of.I play this and Elite Dangerous (currently Gamma 1.05) a lot, and if you're good in one, you'll do well in the other. Evochron has a lot to offer the person that doesn't need led by a carrot on a stick, especially if you go online (seamless online/offline experience btw, along with seamless world and seamless planetary landings) as there is plenty of fellow pilots looking to help you become a skilled ace.Once you spend enough time to become a decent pilot in EvoMerc, and things start to click, trades become a fast income, combat stays intense but is amazing when you can beat several foes and have a couple of hired wingmen to back you up. Upgrading and designing your ship is awesome, the community is among the best without an elitist attitude towards newcomers, very welcoming.If you want an amazing space sim that doesn't break the bank or your PC, but offers one of the best piloting experiences period, you cannot look past Evochron Mercenary. As I said before often overlooked, but appreciated by most that give it a chance. Anyone that has enjoyed space sims in the past, arcade or realistic, easy or challenging, will find something to like here.Buy it! Support Vice and future Evochron upgrades/patches (he does this frequently and for years with each release) and future titles.			"

												One of the best space fighter simulations out there, Evochron Mercenary gives you the freedom you should expect from space.Even though it's not perfect feature-wise, those who loved Elite, Wing Commander or Freelancer must try Evochron for sure.There's a good number of missions to do and places to go, and the seamless universe is a very change of pace considering all other space sims available. Differently from almost all other space sims, you can fly to (or jump to) anywhere, without loading screens. You can also fly to planets, land on their cities or land anywhere and hop into a mech-explorer, then back to space seamslessly.There's an economy going on and lot's of combat to get into.You can also modify your ship to make it most efficient for the role you want (Trader, Miner, Multi-Purpose, etc) or even get a Military Ship that's best fitted for combat.The flaw of this game is exactly on its strongest point: there's a lot of random things to do, but nothing is really persistent or makes sense in the long run. All existing ships are random, the stations you build are not yours (you own a license that gives you discounts, among other things), you cannot command ships bigger than a fighter and you can't (properly) own and command a fleet. The universe is big and has no boundaries, but the game's scope is actually very limited.If you ever played the X series (X: Beyond the Frontier, X2: The Threat, X3 Reunion etc), the lack of decent combat, freedom, proper flying model and seamless universe that X has, is fulfilled by Evochron Mercenary.However, the lack of persistence, fleet control and ownership, consistent and non-random economy and capital ship control is found on X.Therefore, Evochron Mercenary satisfies those who want a good space fighter simulator with a basic sandbox thrown in, but for large scale economy and anything more persistent, consistent and less random, you should look somewhere else.Still, as said before, if you're into space games, you MUST try Evochron!It's a must-have for those who want proper space-flight experience.

												A fairly good game with some nice ideas. It's a bit like Freelancer, but a little more ""real"" and more involved. The multiplayer is where the majority of the fun is at, but you will find it lacks depth. Once you have enough money to buy the best ship in the game (which does not take long at all), you will struggle to find anything to do except explore.The control of your ship never seems quite right, and you find yourself constantly ""sliding"" everywhere. I have no problem playing space games with inertial dampeners off, but something about this just feels wrong - it takes forever to make course changes if you have any kind of speed.The developer is absolutely brilliant though. I visited their forums to ask some questions and instantly got a reply from the developer, who implemented a new mechanic to the game based on my questions and feedback. I was stunned at how welcoming and kind the community is for this game. That alone is worth its weight in gold.A good game, that could be a great game.Jimbo Rating: 6/10			"

												First, this is not a casual game by any means so if can't handle much beyond point and shoot then leave now or you'll be sent home crying over you're twenty bucks (just read the negative reviews). This game is something I've been looking for ever since I played a little indy flash game somewhere on the internet when I was 14. It had interesting lore, trading and combat in unique space mercenary environment made by someone who had a great idea and new how to code. This game is like the grown up, college educated, athletic, beautiful version of that game. It is so complex you WILL need to get a key binding sheet but everything you can do actually has a purpose. It feels like you are in Star Trek at times when you have to boost forward shields, deactivate the inertial dampening system, all power to canons  and deploy counter measures! (I've done this, it's the coolest feeling when you pull it off in combat). The map is massive but divided into indivdual systems to make it easier to handle, each system tracks your reputation and has every odd job to military contract you could want. You can customize your ship and change out and upgrade equipment to tailor your ship to the jobs you want to have. The game is meduim paced from starting out, I upgraded my ship's size about 5 hours in for the first time. I've barely scratched the surface of this game but I have played plenty to give it a good recomendation. It is a game that makes you think and feel like you are immersed in this world, added with a backdrop of stunning nebulae and planets with a swelling orchestral sci-fi soundtrack.			"

												First that comes to mind is Holy Sh*t...(been playing this for about 5 hours) , I am a seasoned veteran of these type of games since first Elite on Commodore 64 back in the 80:s and this is the only one compared to that i can say that captures the same atmosphere and immersion..I have Played  Wing Commander series (Including privateer obviously), Federation of Free Traders, First Encounters,New Frontier,X-series and been in EVE-Online since 2008 ... But now that i have found this gem... Goodbye social life :)  Good bye EVE ..See ya later wife... Im off to Olympus Prime with my Pulsar class ship...I dont want to upgrade my pc for Elite dangerous or Star Citizen ... this is both of them for me and for a good price...If this truly is a work of a one man  ..then 07 For you!!!

												How is it possible I didn't saw this game be released back in 2012 ? This gem....Forget about empty premium AAA over-priced hype ELITE:DANGEROUS.EVOCHRON MERCENARY is a game made by one man, alone, and he puts so much love into it, you feel it when you play !There are a tons of things to do in this game ! You won't be bored anytime soon. Cargo, mining, spying, killing, exploring, trading, ....Multiplayer is fun also (and single player and multi player progression is syncced too).You can even test the game before you buy, there is a demo ! Yeah !Try it, if spaces sims is your thing, you won't regret it !			"

												This game gets a ""must buy"" rating from me for anyone who is interested in this genre of spaceflight simulation/comba/trading game. The realistic newtonian physics model and controls are so much better than the status quo ""airplane physics in space"" in practically every other similar game, and you really can seamlessly fly down onto a planet's surface! And you really can fly anywhere between solar systems without jump gates, though it would take 100s of jumps without a ""special"" hard to find type of jump drive. All of this is done very well.The main drawback of the game is that lots of areas feel kind of lacking in depth. For example, you can craft things and customize your ship but there isn't that much variety. You can land on planets and stations looking for missions or things to buy, but there are no characters with scripted conversations to talk to. Capital ships aren't very detailed or specialized, and are more like scaled-up very slow versions of fighters with lots of hit points. Basically there are lots of things you can do that you can't do in other games, but not that much intracacy in any particular part of the game.Stll, I think most people who are interested in this sort of game will want to spend at least 10s if not 100s of hours playing it. So it's worth buying at full price, especially with multiplayer support (which honestly I haven't tried yet.)			"

												This game is visually amazing and will have you spend hours exploring the universe and landing on planets. BE AWARE THIS GAME REQUIRES TONS OF STUDYING TUTORIALS. This game took me 2 weeks to a month to learn how to play and I'm still learning. However visually stunning! I'm blown away the enitre game was created by one person. Amazing game! Also I had to do some customization to the controls to work right. Even though you have to invest learning time in this game...it's so worth it!!!			"

												I was happy to buy the game when it was out, however there are several things which I didn't like.. read on...Why I do not like it:I've been playing it recently and I must say it is really limited in a number of options. I think it is fun however the limited choice of ships to buy is a real killer for me. As I pursued a career of a miner/trader, I only could install a limited number of cargobays which is no fun a all. I wanted to buy a bigger ship, like a big trade vessel, but there are none.. no big ships to command.What's really nice:I have played around 10 hours now and I do like the scenery and the graphics are pleasing to me, the game is well constructed as in the graphics as well landing on planets is nice. Any bugs?I haven't encountered any bugs.To recommend or not?Sadly I can not make this a positive review as it´s not for me, can't recommend this game.			"

												2/22/2015If you like the concept of Elite: Dangerous but at 1/3 the cost, this is your game. Alternatively, if you've never played a space sim before, this is a good jumping off point. Pros: Works well with or without a joystickHours of gameplay; whether you're into blowing stuff up or mining, there's something to do. Light Crafting ElementsMix and match parts to create a ship you want, not a cookie cutter ship. Large Universe to experience and lots going onCons:Not as polished as E:DMedium Learning Curve - It takes a bit to get used to the controls / config hotkeys for your tastesCombat and other duties can get repetative if you have gamer A.D.D. (which I do)Could use more varied types of quests and Steam Workshop assetsOverall this game is well worth the money and is pretty enjoyable. Early upgrades don't take forever to buy and the game doesn't waste your time with silly docking procedures like E:D does. As I said before, it's not as polished as other games in the genre, though it isn't lacking for visuals. I feel bad that I have to compare it to Elite: Dangerous so much, but that is sort of the stardard right now even if this came out 2 years before it.   "

												This game took me a while to get comfortable with but after getting there I can confidently say there is no other space combat game out there that has been as exciting and realistic for me to play. Once you get the systems down and learn navigation (There are a multitude of youtube instructional video's I highly recommend you watch as you begin playing) you are given free range of a vast universe with a multitude of locations and enemies. One of the most interesting concepts for me initially was being able to fly down to the surface of planets from space. The planets vary in type and in atmosphere some even have hostile weather systems or visibility conditions that make atmospheric flight very difficult which I found really cool. The main draw for me also being the realistic physics involved in flight. You cannot just drop through an atmosphere without burning up so you have to approach at the correct speeds and angles and flight controls shift from atmospheric to space seamlessly. Also in space you can fly using true newtonian flight or switch on the fly to an adaptive system that mimics atmospheric flight by compensating for the intended forward direction. Being able to continue on a trajectory at enormous speeds and rotate on any axis without impacting your trajectory has always been the draw of space combat for me but is rarely implemented in space games. Flipping over at speed and accelerating in the opposite direction or setting a trajectory and flipping on your side to strafe a capital ship at incredible speeds is amazing and it's made manageable by being able to switch back to a directional flight mode when you just want to point and fly. The gauges need to be researched a little bit (also on the video's) if you are unfamiliar but provide spectacular feedback that not only brings realism but adds depth and enables more control with a clear idea of the forces at work from and on your ship. I play a ton of games but there is something special about this one that keeps me coming back. There is a great community of people willing to help out and some incredible mods available. I have some for my HUD that uses the HUD from the ship on the movie Oblivion that's really well done and mods that make the nebulae and space in general look absolutely phenomenal. There isn't a ton of story or progression, there are a lot of different ships, weapons, components, etc. and you are given the ability to edit your own ship designs by choosing components and altering their size and placement on your ship allowing every ship to be completely different even if using identical components. I have spent hours creating and saving ship designs alone with the different components and different levels of components. There are also ship mods made by the community that use models from popular franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek. You can trade although trading is limited since cargo is extremely limited even at the highest levels but quantity is not what I assume was the goal. There are many alert style missions where a commodity is needed at a particular station or planet that appears with a timer and you need to acquire and deliver it to get the reward which is usually substantial. There are many different levels of missions with varying goals of taking out single ships to entire fleets or mining asteroids for particular minerals and even cleaning giant solar arrays with tractor beams where you remove the dirt from the panels with your ship. The solar systems are VAST and can contain many planets and stations that require jump drives to navigate and gates connect the systems although the gates are placed in different areas in each system but do not act as doors at the barriers between rooms, you can fly past the gates and on into space if you so choose.  Many gates are actually located in the center of the systems so it's not a N,S,E,W square setup. It's vary natural and organic. The stations offer vendors, supplies, components, fuel, commodities, repairs, missions and a few other things. You fly in to the stations and dock with them to interact and you are protected within until you undock and exit the force field. There are also varying levels of difficulty in the different systems with some containing very few hostile ships, some with many and although I haven't made it out there yet some are active war zones and incredibly hostile. There are also different factions that inhabit the systems with who you can build up your standings by running missions for or against their enemies. The faction standings are system specific and do not carry over throughout the universe which i found adds a lot more gameplay in that your standings affect your ability to use different stations and the prices of things like fuel and other commodities. You may also purchase licences that allow you to hunt the enemies of that faction for rewards. This game is the closest I have ever felt to actually having a ship in space with the freedom to fly anywhere and do anything. The realism is incredible and comes through in scope of environment, optional objectives and the feel of opening up a universe for you to inhabit as you so choose. I've actually just flown around as I imagine I would to relax and enjoy the majesty and solitude of space and no other game has inspired that kind of feeling for me. That says a lot. Disclaimer: I live in and run a home for homeless and disabled Veterans where we have multiple computers and Steam accounts so hours played does not always reflect my actual experience with the game being reviewed other than showing the minimum amount of time I have personally played as this is my personal account.

												Fighter, merchant, and gathering cargo , ship options are all player choicing. Travel around as a mercenary fighter to a variety of factions with different characteristic to each. For one looking for a more peaceful style, the merchant ship role is best suited. Going around from star to star, buying and trading goods, for each journey comes with beautiful galactic view. Lastly the gathering cargo ship plays hand-in-hand with both fighter and merchant, for materials can be gathered to be sold or build grand improved ships. Enjoy the view of a space simulation shipping game.			"

Space combat is very dynamic, sometimes not so easy, trade is simple, but may be dangerous, mining, crafting and stations building are fine, missions as well, You can do whatever You like, even spending hours only exploring uncharted systems and trying to raise reputation among the forgotten and hostile colonists, if You find them.

												Extremely fun space simulator that is absolutely worth the price of admission.This is a rare title in which gameplay makes up for dull and recycled in-game missions. Having access to both an inertial dampening flight system and pure newtonian physics mode adds an entirely new dimension to space travel and combat. Dogfighting becomes more like a well calculated jousting match and mastering your sliding techniques allows you to overcome enemies with much larger firepower. This is a game that rewards patience and experience.While some of the art looks fantastic (planets from a distance), low resolution textures on space stations, backgrounds and ships hinders the experience slightly. Mods are available to help slightly rectify this problem.Great news is this games support for Surround/Eyefinity AND gamepad/joystick setups is phenomenal. Most other titles require the use of a third party application/driver that merges multiple joysticks together, however Evochron allows you to map each separately. This is fantastic for people with separated HOTAS systems (ie T.16000M Joystick + Saitek Throttle)Warning to New Pilots: When the game begins it will seem very daunting. After the tutorial section, play with the various tools at your disposal and you will catch on very quickly. Reach out to the amazing community if you are in need of help, or tune into a Let's Play series that can help jumpstart you into the universe. "

												I bought this game years ago and was overwhelmed by its depth. So it sat in my library until I forgot about it. Recently I got Elite Dangerous and had alot of fun for aobut a day, then started to feel like every planet, mission and contract was the same. Elite is basically 4 stations with a handful of lame ships, and some generic random objectives inside a smaller version of space simulator. Now it had its fun moments and looks great. That said it gets old quick. Then the devs at elite decided to make a feature that was promised before the game came out, into dlc. Not just dc but a ""season"" of dlc, which is a practice I find despicable. To make things worse, that season costs more than the original game, and if youre a newcomer you can buy that and get base elite dangerous for free. Outrages, I uninstalled the game. Then I started playing this, and within 6 hours got 100x more quality experience from this game. I built a ship with total freedom, meaning I was able to decide what parts went where, how big they were and the style of my ship, so the starter ship in the game could look millions of ways, depending on how you configure it. Theres a main story, an economy, Factions fighting for control of sectors. Its got everything Elite claims to have, and more. Theres crafting, base building, i can even land on any planet, something the devs at Elite feel is worth $60.  The only thing elite does better than this game is graphics, which odsent matter a whole lot when you're in space. Doesnt require a great engine to show black with white dots.  And to top it off this game still gets updates, and I bought it over 4 years ago. Made by one guy....So DO NOT BUY ELITE DO NOT BUY ELITE, save your money and buy this game, or play eve online if you want to constantly spend money on your game.			"

												Nothing like turning the lights off on a quiet evening and loading up Evochron Mercenary. Drifting, exploring, trading, and fighting through a MASSIVE galaxy. It's impossible to fly from one end to the next - but there's warp gates to get anywhere in a pinch. The combat is simply thrilling. A lot of fun if you're looking for an immersive space-flight experience; it's for patient people with an active imaginiation. Although it's not as crammed with stuff as the X series, I find I prefer the minimalist experience. I get that oceanic feeling playing this game.			"

												I will buy anything made this Developer. I was introduced to PC when I was working for an injured vet in the PH. I was a console player my whole life and this game and Freelancer where my first, tentative, steps into PC. I had a pirated version for about five months in the PH and it was missing a lot of the gameplay. When I got back stateside I bought it and haven't looked back. It is a wonderful game. Worth the dollars spent. The forums are active. The Developer is active and the modding is good too. Nothing can be more fun, in short bursts, than flying around with nuetonian physics killing Cylons. (Mod by CaptCaveman)			"

												What I did in this game so far:1) Chose to be a combat pilot.2) Chose a mission to escort a ship, enemy ships keep coming in dozens and kills me in minutes.3) Decides to wander a little, follows a big bright light, reaches near it. Oh, its a star, I should try to land on it. Burns to death.4) Starts again, this time choses a simple mission, mission done.5) Buys mining beam, does the same type of mission thrice, earns enough to upgrade ship's hyper drive.6) Jumps a gate to next quadrant, sees a planet, tries to land on it with Afterburner on, doesn't even reach near the atmosphere, burns to death due to high heat because of high speed.7) Combat ship doesn't support more hangars, disappointed as couldn't mine more than one type of material. Jumps another gate to reach a quadrant which has better economy for trading.8) Quadrant is hostile, everyone is chasing me like I have killed a Chicken of their quadrant, dies.Until now, I haven't done anything much apart from dying or loading from my last saves several times to try something new, and dying again, but I am still doing it. As it is fun to explore and realistic as well. So, anyone who loves exploring the space would love this game. You can do many things on this game and I haven't even tried the fraction of it. So, do I recommend this game? Of course.10/10 Would try to land on a star again.			"

												This game is a Sim in the full context of the word.  The learning curb is a bi steep, but well worth it. This game features tones of things that I think should be essential to all space sims: an open sandbox world, multiplayer, planetary reentry, and customizable ships to name a few.  Not only can you toggle in and out of Newtonian physics, but doing so is an essential element of combat in this game.Also, the game is constantly expanding.  A while back, they added terrestrial mechs that you can pilot, once you land on a planet.  Space stations also got a nice functional and cosmetic update.  I look forward to what new features may be released int the future.			"

												Probably the best space sim I will ever play.  Evochron Mercenary is an amazing achievement because it excels at its primary purpose: putting you in the cockpit of a wide-open universe.  And I do mean wide open.  While there are a jump-gates, jump-drives and other, more-exotic means of travel, the universe is a continuous whole.  You could drift from one side to the other given enough time. . . though I am not sure if there are sides or just an infinite extension of the void.  There are also hundreds of systems -- yes, HUNDREDS -- in the game many of which have yet to be discovered.  Also you can land on planets (or burn up in their atmospheres).In addition to providing such a vast expanse to explore, Evochron's other principle virtue is its flight system: the game operates on Newtonian mechanics.  This is more than a clever gimmick because it radically changes the nature of combat: weapons systems can be rotated to face any direction regardless of the ship's vector; without drag and friction, momentum also cannot be carried into another vector.  As a result, the game demands a unique brand of piloting, and your first encounters with racing and combat will see you spinning out of control.  This necessarily adds to the joy when you get it right.  The game does ease the burden through the well-implemented use of assisted flight mode (IDS), which the player can toggle on and off.  When on, the computer automatically fires thrusters to orient the ship onto its current heading.  The Newtonian physics nonetheless remain in this mode and (especially at high speeds) your ship will continue moving under its own momentum until your thrusters are capable of compensating. For example, if you were to spin your ship around 180 degrees you would nonetheless fly ""backwards"" until your engines were capable of canceling out that momentum (if the IDS were off, you would just keep traveling on that heading regardless of orientation).  Incidentally, if you were just thinking of Babylon 5, you might as well stop reading and add this to your cart.While I stand by that glowing endorsement, Evochron is not for everyone.  Those who are looking for the massive empire building found in something like X may very well find this game underwhelming (I personally despise X for its unforgivably bad AI, obtuse interface, and ho-hum combat).  Trading and building elements are in Evochron but not to anything approaching the degree that they are in X.  The game was also made by one man -- which is mind-bendingly awesome -- and this does show in some of the production values.  Simply put, you won't find as much variety in textures and geometric detail in ship design as you will in most games.  Having said that, the game oozes atmosphere; it just nails the big picture thing.  In this respect, I think it is comparable to Skyrim: up close not terribly spectacular, but the vistas are breathtaking.  As a sandbox game, you must also find your own motivation.  That the game was built by one man also reflects that it is largely a labor of love; complementing its roughness and quirks are design choices that would never survive a profit-motivated studio, e.g. Newtonian physics that scare off casual gamers and a hands-on navigation system that has more in common with a sextant or Ti86 than with gMaps.  Evochron also has a pretty steep learning curve, though my experience is that this curve mostly reflects actual complexity in piloting the ship and learning where to buy/sell in order to make money rather than a stupidly convoluted interface (Yes, that was a cheap shot.  And no, I will not apologize to X3 nor to Windows 8).  Nonetheless, there are some aspects of the game -- especially when starting out -- that will have you bringing up the steam overlay to google: ""How do I _____ in Evochron.""  With the exception of the navigation system, the interface is however pretty smooth and intuitive.In sum, this is the game for you if you want to get in touch with your inner Malcolm Reynolds or Han Solo.  For that matter, it is also the game to for you if you want to get in touch with your inner Starbuck or Freddie Prince Jr. from that really bad 90s movie.  And you need not take my word for it: the developer provides a free demo on his official website.			"

												( 11 Pm) 1 hour into the game = This game looks amazing!(12 Pm) another one hour later = So that is how you mine asteroids.....(7 Am) 7 hours later = What the ♥♥♥♥ it's seven am alreadySInce this review got a bit popular, i'm doing a full review.  Tl:dr: at the end of the review.So, to start with, i have only played 16 hours in the game, and yet i have done so much, there's still so much more to do. If you're not a shooter♥♥♥♥♥ this game has great potential, so much to do! The game is a space exploration, trading, combat and mining game. Sadly you can't leave your spaceship, yet you can still go the the planet's surface, but you must remain at a distance, else the planet will eat you. The game is like no man's sky, with more physics elements, re entry feels like re entry on a real ship. Many people play legacy, but meh, legacy has better graphics and stuff. This game has a lot of potential, yet the people at starwraith have done a great job executing it.At the start of the game, you are greeted by a screen that asks you your class. The game has four classes, mercenary, combat pilot, miner and the last one which i don't seem to remember for some reason. All classes are different, mercenary is the best though, but if you want to be a mercenary, you won't get military type hull classes. so, when you chose your class, you have to choose your callsign. After that, you are greeted by the beautiful main menu. You can either 'launch' or do the 'training'. I started by launching, and oh, the game was so beautiful, so much to do. So many nebulae, so my ship was drifting towards the space station called evochron, referring to the name of the game of course. There i took my first mission to descend on the planet in the sapphire solar system. 11 hours later, i ha 26 million credits, the fastest ship in the galaxy, the best hyperdrive and an entire solar empire. I don't have words to describe this beautiful game, just get it.Tl;dr: Please do me a favour and buy this game.			"

												A good starter game for Space SIms. I use the word SIM lightly. The mechanics of the game are realistic. if you use your boosters in space you will fly in that direction. If you turn off your boosters, you will still fly in that direction. Dogfights are a little dull, and it can often feel like a basic fps in space. But, the sense of freedom is astounding. Atmospheric, beautiful. i recommend a few mods to tweak to your liking. Imagination can be a factor, use it or be bored. I spent a lot of time in the shipyard making custom ships of all sizes in an oddly different but versatile creation kit. However, in the end every ship felt very much the same. Same cockpit, almost same handling, no real difference in flying a freighter or a fighter. Can be a great casual game for exploring.			"

												To SOME people I would recommend it. It's not an ""arcade"" space game. Distances are great and controls are detailed ... also very little storyline. I'm not sure if I'm the guy to ask about this game, but I can tell you what I know/ how aI play. I find this game is very relaxing. Poor myself a glass of whisky, get some snacks and put on my own music. A new player will have to take a crash course in controls and such, so be in the mood for some learning the first time.Once you know the buttons, it's time to head out into space and get a job. Because if you want to travel faster and further you need better parts for your ship.At first, the jobs are cleaning and pick-up/delivery. Once you think you're good enough you can race and fight other AI ships. I never got good enough to stand a chance, though.So, I just fly around in space, check out planets, pick up some things here and there to sell and chill. It's like Train Simulator in space.Landing on/ taking off from planets and docking (>ᴗ< Pfft) at space stations is really cool as you can be all finicky about maneuvering and speed.Word of advice: don't run out of gas...! Though it was excellent when I went Online, sent out a S.O.S. and a friendly stranger came to my coordinates to lend me some. The few that still play, are very friendly.			"

												I bought this game, because I wanted to customize my ship and then have a ""sandbox"" environment to kick around in. After half an hour of playing, I realized I'd bitten off way more than I'd ever wanted to chew, so I put the game away for months. I came back at it with the intent of finally mastering the thing. After spending an hour and a half beating my head against the control options, I finally learned how to toggle inertial flying and began to work my way through the first few frankly boring missions and got to the race against the AI ship. After half a dozen frustrating goes of bouncing helplessly around and then out of the course ""rings"", I had my fill of the Evo after 4 hours of playing.I really wanted to give this game a positive recommendation, I really did, but it all comes down to the game trying too hard to be too much. Yes, the hardcore space simulator enthusiast looking for perfect immersion will LOVINGLY CARESS this game all night long (so if that's you, I TOTALLY recommend this game), but if you are a more casual gamer looking for a fun sandbox space combat game you can jump into and start kicking around in immediately? This is the exact opposite of that.The controls are designed for a high level of investment in both time and energy in learning how to play. Ultimately, to get the best experience, a full function joystick and throttle are NOT OPTIONAL. Don't even buy the game unless you have a very robust controller. You'll have to devote yourself to memorizing dozens of key commands and unfortunately the opposite of intuitive control options, which is the only serious knock I have against the game from a critical standpoint. The control options desperately need better laying out (IE: movement controls need to be separate from head swivel controls need to be separate from combat controls, etc.)Compared to other space themed games (ie: Wing Commander, X-Wing, Freelancer, Colony Wars, etc.), Evo is orders of magnitude more difficult to play, being marketted as a ""game"" (which it is technically), but it's more accurate to call it a space simulator with game elements bootstrapped on. So I simply can't recommend this game to anyone that isn't a hardcore space simulator enthusiast.Unfortunately, my search for a nice middle ground space combat sim continues.			"

												This game lets you seamlessly undock from a space station, throttle up to high speed, turn off flight control and ""slide"" through an asteroid field (don't crash!), fly down and skim through the rings around the planet, mining water to sell later .... Then turn your ship towards the planet's surface, and shoot down through the atmosphere, through the cloud layer, and now you're skimming over the surface like an airplane. You can mine resources while you're at it, because all of this is burning up expensive fuel that has to be replaced (mine oxygen from the atmosphere, and then resources if you can skim low enough over the surface). Then land at the city and trade!Here are the things I haven't done yet in this game: found a gas giant and skimmed over it, mining gas; seen a sunset or sunrise from a planet's surface; messed around in black holes; searched for lost ship wrecks/cargo/whatever; seen ANY combat (I'm still in the first/safe area); bought a Terrain Walker and walked over the surface of an alien world; been through a wormhole; messed about inside a nebula; designed/bought a new ship ...No stupid ""gates"" like in the X series - in this game, you can fly anywhere, anytime. The graphics are actually pretty good (obviously not AAA-quality) and the sound/music is great.Only 1 thing if you buy this game -- find a ""cockpit replacer"" (""perch"") and install it, so that your view isn't cut off by the ship's cockpit.Great game, highly recommend for space sim fans!

Nothing has matched the sheer size of the game, as well as still include such great detail. the game itself is an interesting beast for sure, there is lots to learn and LOTS to discover, not including actually exploring the vast systems.  The space/newtonian physics are incredible, and this game truly makes you feel as though you are in space. Grab a buddy to play this with, as playing alone makes you feel truly alone, as there are millions of kilometers between you and the other players.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't. For an open-world game set in space, there is surprisingly very little to do, and the learning curve is so steep that it isn't really a curve at all. And unlike other games with harsh barriers to entry, there isn't enough of a userbase for new players to be able to rely on generous veterans showing them the ropes.In all honesty, I might even be able to deal with all that if it weren't for the in-game economy being completely broken. That is by far my biggest complaint: that the player is forced to spend 90% of their time worrying about making enough money for fuel, and because of that, barely gets to experience any of the actually entertaining and worthwhile aspects of the game. The jobs available to pilots simply don't pay nearly well enough to sustain fuel usage and other mundane expenses, all too often leaving players stranded in the void of outer space. And no, there's no space tow truck; if you get stuck, you can only pray that some nearby player is compassionate enough to risk their own ship to save you (which, while realistic, is pretty unlikely to happen considering how expensive it would be for them to do this, and how few players there are to begin with).Additionally, apart from avoiding becoming stranded and possibly losing their character, there really isn't much positive incentive for players to make money at all. In stark contrast to comparable space-simulator-MMOs such as Eve, there is an incredibly small selection of upgrades, most of which aren't even much better than the starting equipment when you think about how much work it is to acquire them.Sure, it's probably one of the most depressingly realistic space simulators out there, and captures wonderfully the all-too-real feelings of futility one might conceivably experience as an actual space pilot attempting to tackle the cosmic abyss all by himself. But there's a point where realism just isn't fun, and this game has clearly passed it. All things considered, while it is a beautiful game and would've been excellent if it were released about 10 years ago, it's just not exciting enough to warrant its pricetag.Money aside, I really wouldn't have half as much to complain about if it weren't for the fact that it was advertised as more of an MMORPG than it actually is. Evochron Mercenary is basically 100% simulator, so whether it was intentional or not, the way it was presented was misleading for many buyers, including myself.tl;dr: If you're absolutely in love with retro space sims and are ready to tackle one of the most grisly learning curves you've ever experienced in your days as a gamer, then by all means, get this game; you'll love it. But if you're anyone else, give it a miss--or at least do a little research into the gameplay before deciding to buy it.			"

												I wish I could find more games like this, it is a fun game once you get the hang of it. It has a large learning curve, I would sugest completing the tutorial levels first before hitting the launch button. Graphics arent super spectacular but I do enjoy the atmospher that the game creates. unlike most space sims you can land on a planet and go to the main trade city on that planet. It is a bit slower paced game that requires some sense of patience. I tried speeding up the landing sequence on a planet because I was too impatient and indeed up overheating and exploding. So my advice was learned the hard way XDp.s. dont use the jump drive while in atmosphere.. ""boom""PROS: -good atmospher (can hear radio chatter, lots of spaceships everywhere creating a breathing real world)-I havent come across a copy and paste city yet, each one seems a bit different-good gameplay, once mastered you have 100% controllCONS:-hard to get the hang of at first (dont let that make you rage quit though! it just takes some time)-interface is a little odd. took me FOREVER to figure out how to use the map but that might just be me.I give this a great 8/10 if you like space sims with firstperson option and fairly decent graphics then this is for you!

												WOW!!! I can't believe there are so few reviews for this game. For me, this game is a gem! A diamond in the rough! Being a huge fan of space combat/sim games I have been patiently waiting for the genre to rebirth itself. I knew that with all of the new technology that is available that the space combat/sim genre would come back after a huge drop off that occured as soon as the FPS genre took off in the early 2000's. It was only a matter of time that all of the Wing Commander fans (and there are a lot of us) would beg for a new space sim. The time has finally come. Elite Dangerous and the long awaited Star Citizen are probably the two biggest space sims out there right now. Personally I am anticipating the full release of Star Citizen. I have already purchased the Star Citizen basic package and am calmly waiting for the full release. The only thing daunting about Star Citizen is that it is a ""rich mans"" game as you can purchase (for a hefty price) all different kinds of off the charts upgrades and package deals from the get go so you may have a huge advantage over the poor old fella like me. It seems that I am gonna have to grind it out like I have never ginded before to be a decent contender in Star Citizen... Which I will ho-heartedly and willingly do. Although Star Citizen seems to be a looong way from being completed... I have Evochron Mercenary to fufill my space sim appetite!From the very beginning since I came across this ""diamond in the rough"", I was extremely excited to find that a game as in-debth as this for only $25! As I read all of the reviews I began to salivate as this game was exactly what I was looking for! Flying through space, doing what I want when I want! Hey look... There is a nice looking planet! I think I will go explore it and see what I can find. Simply point your ship at the planet, forward thrust and whoosh... you are entering the atmosphere... SEEMLESSLY! No docking a mother ship, no load times... You just fly on in, land, explore, trade, rest and then you leave just as easy as you landed. If mining is your thing... Just pull up to an asteroid and mine it! It is that easy! I have only just finished the training module and I know that this game is a for sure gig. The graphics my be a little dated. But if you gotta a decent rig all yoa gotta do is bump everything up to ultra and your set. The game is so rewarding that the graphics do not really matter. For what the game is and what it costs I thing that the graphics are quite pleasing. Where was I the last year or so and how come I have never heard of this game? Oh... I know. I was to busy reading about Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous to even think that there was another space sim out there. Thank God for Steam in pointing me in the right direction. Sometimes Steams suggestions are all wrong, but they got this one right on the button! Because of Evochron, I now have an awesome space sim to play while I am waiting for Star Citizen (and saving up some cash... Star Citizen is gonna be expensive as I think the FPS dlc is gonna run me a pretty penny). Seriously... If you are a space sim genre fan and are waiting for Star Citizen like I am and need something to hold you over... GET THIS GAME! Well honestly... If you are a space sim fan, you prabobly already own this game. Unfortunately I have been in the dark as this game has been around for awhile. I wish I would have known about this game sooner. Enough of the chit-chat. I am through with training and I want to go mine a couple of asteroids, and skim a few planets! Good luck and enjoy!			"

												This game is really cool! Unfortunately, it's nigh unplayable. After poking around for a bit, doing some mining and contracts, I've realized that I really don't want to play, any more. Flying around an open world universe in your own pile of space scrap is a good feeling, one that deserves an interface worthy of its task. Unfortunately, it's just abysmal. Your starting ship starts out with one cargo hold. Sounds ok, right? You can only put one type of item in each hold, even though it'll hold 25 of that item. When mining, each asteroid gives three ore, which means you're missing out on two-thirds of the ore, since they're not compatible with each other.Ok, you can upgrade your ship to five cargo holds. Fine, but the miner stacks to the lowest cargo hold that isn't full, so if you have 1 platinum ore each in holds 2 through 5, it'll still put any new platinum in hold 1, meaning that if you actually wanted to get some diamond ore from the same asteroid, you'll have to trash one of the platinums to make room for it, instead of (logically) moving it to one of the holds that already has that same item in it.One time, I got a contract to mine 25 platinum. As it works out, I ended up with about 32. Unfortunately, about half was in hold 2, and the other half was in hold 3. When I got back to the station, it said ""contract failed"". O.o My best guess is that the game is too dumb to figure out that 16 + 16 = 32, which is more than enough for the contract. Another mining contract flew me right into a planet as soon as I jumped to the waypoint it gave me. Yet another didn't give me a waypoint at all, so I flew to an asteroid field and saw, yet again, ""contract failed"". I failed a mining contract by flying to an asteroid field?!?Ok, that's most of my experience. I also happened to run into a hostile ship. He decided to engage me, and I gladly took the challenge. Unfortunately, the starter ship couldn't even dent his shields... Guess I won't be roaming around, looking for fights to get into. There are a lot of other problems, mostly with the interface. Variety is also sorely lacking. Sure, there's a few ships you can buy, but no one ship or weapon is particularly different from any other. Their stats aren't all that different, either.Meh, 4/10. A great idea, implemented very badly.			"

												This game is impressive if the rumors about one person programming it are true. However, there are many, many problems that make this game completely unplayable for anyone except the most die-hard, pig-headed, obsessive types. The interface is poorly constructed and counter intuitive. The trade system is unbalanced and easily manipulated. (I had 250 million credits in 5 hours of play) This takes all the excitement out of playing. With 250 million credits, I could afford everything in the game. The combat controls are terrible. I'm a person who favors game mechanics and story content over beautiful graphics so I would not, normally, mention the graphics quality. Unfortunately, this game excel in none of these areas and the graphics would have been aweful in 2001. The potential of this game is there. With a team of programmers and six months of overhual, it could really be something. At this time I have to advice people not to waste their money. I know the space flight sim field has been barren, but there is hope on the horizon. Wait for Star Citizen.			"

												What little I can play in this game without forgetting to quicksave and then blowing up, I can honestly say it's been fun.However, there's been that issue of blowing up. A lot. Near planets, on planets, into asteroids...there's a lot of blowing up in this game if you're not careful about your actions.I can understand that these are somewhat expected of games like this, but at the same time, they're somewhat off-putting. And I say this having owned Evochron Mercenary before Elite: Dangerous was a thing. This game is insanely strict about certain things and you will blow up with the slightest provocation when starting out. And you will lose progress many times if you're used to games made in the last decade and a half using autosaves.That said, it's probably one of the biggest spaceflight sims I've played, with the widest range of options in terms of gameplay. It doesn't ever really shift out of space, either, into transitions or loading screens or anything. It's just space, end of story. And that's nice, because it's rare that you can literally fly, freestyle, between sectors. I don't know why you would, because they're huge, but this is one of the rare places where this is actually possible, and I feel like that's worth merit in itself. The world never limits your ability to travel within it, and you can seamlessly exit a station, pop over to a planet, fly around in the atmosphere, and then be back out in space and out to an asteroid belt without a single moment of pause.So while the game is hilariously heavy-handed with its smackdown if you make even a small mistake, it makes up for it by having a huge world that seems to go on forever, and without a single loading screen or transition...except for the one between the game and the menu. That one, however, we can ignore. I'll take one loading screen to a series of ""jump gates"" any day.			"

												Is what is says on the tin....and it says allot. You have the freedom to decide how you make your fortune, wich solar system you want to do it in depending on the market wich is constantly changing. The game helps you open your mind to how you could do things and while it does that...you get to fly in space...win win and more win.The game engine is clever with the way it follows newtonian law and it's very smooth too. There's no loading screens....you go into a station, you go out of a station. You fly into the planet's atmosphere, go and mine the sea, the soil, go to a station on the ground and trade and get contracts...then fly by out....again, no loading screen.To top it off, the game is beautiful, some of the veiws your eyes will be widening at are truly spectacular. you'll find yourself flying around and enjoying the scenery...yup, the scenery of space...you'll see when you get to it. Not all of it is wonderful, some systems feel ran down, a red dwarf making the system look drab, evil, dirty. In other places, you might just want to stay there and make a few thousand credits, just to take in more of the scenery...aaahhh.All in all, it's a good sandbox game that gives you the full dish of freedom. The game can either be relaxed and casual as you mine and trade as a merchant, or it can be chaotic, living life on the edge, destructive and dangerous as you fight in war zones and even just fly into systems where law means little to nothing. How you play, is entirely your choice.			"

												This game is tremendously executed! For one developer, he's done an excellent job making this game. You can do anything you want, explore any planet, and customize your ship to your liking. Another aspect of this game I particularly enjoy is velocity flight. It's one of the best ways to conserve your fuel as you go out exploring. The learning curve is fairly steep, but once you figure out it (which, honestly, doesn't take much time), you'll certainly enjoy it.The graphics are a bit dated, but the gameplay makes up for it incredibly.

												Do you like space sims? If not, just go somewhere else, why are you even reading this... If you're on the fence, it's probably still not for you, it's not an easy game to like. If you love em, go ahead and give this a try. When it's on sale.There's a fair bit to the game - some nice looking worlds, a fair number of ships and some parts to strap to them. Some missions to do. For the most part it's all there, just not enough of 'it' for my tastes. Lets take ships for a start:There's a couple of dozen hulls, but the hull you pick just gives you more (or less) ability to strap a better engine to it, or better shields. There's not much in the way of trade-off, one engine isn't super fast and another super agile. Some shields aren't better at one sort of weapon or worse at another, it's all just a ladder to climb.That means money. Missions are fine but you wont see much profit out of them: fuel is pricy, repairs can be too, and new missles aren't found in the bargin bin. That means you'll probably go mining a lot. It's good money but it's a massive time-sink - no danger involved, just... time. You're going to get sick of the music pretty fast when you're listening to it this much. The fastest way to make money is trading goods between system, but it's still no more exciting.Reputation is another thing you'll be spending a lot of time working on and it's no different than a grind in any other game, it gets old a little too fast. Missions become overly repetitive under the strain of getting someone to like you and the fun evaporates.None of what it has is bad, but the sandbox world leaves you soon feeling too directionless and the available content isn't enough to really populate the void of space. While it's fun to start, I think the majority of people would tire of it quickly - not that it should scare anyone off giving it a try, just wait for a sale to pick it up.			"

												I can still remember my first impression, and it was... disappointing. ""Man, that's not what I expected, what did I pay for?"" - something like that. Then, I got into it, and things turned to the better.That is hard to deny that the game has drawbacks. There's an uber great idea behind it, but it was not absolutely properly realized. On the other hand, revealing its full potential would have required years of development and dozens of developers. I don't really like its graphics, for instance. It looks outdated, and the game is unable to switch between screen resolutions - so, I have to change it manually before running the app. After starting a new game, you feel a bit lost - not knowing what exactly to do, how to travel to long distances, why is the map so small, why are contracts the same again and again... Earning money becomes too easy when you find out that a bunch of cheap metal alloys can easily be turned into some expensive spacecraft equipment... The list can be continued.Still, the game has its appeal. After some exploration you will find out how to make fun of it. Its combat system is rather fine, for example; developers also paid a lot of attention to controlling options, making it possible to control every small aspect of managing and dispatching your ship - like manual tuning of energy balance between shields and weapons to boost either of them. (I remember one reviewer saying that it's one of the few games where you can actually feel like being inside of a real spacecraft; that's quite true.) There's some endless space you can wander, and some beautiful planets that make you want to save a screenshot. If you want to, you can land on literally any spot on any planet (except gas giants, of course), and as soon as you've earned some million dollars to buy a terrain walker, you can even leave your ship and take a walk on the surface. It may be calm and relaxing as well as swift and exciting. And, it is generally good, though it could be even better.			"

I know there are tons of planets/distress calls/etc. to explore, but I've never been able to reach many.

												I have had this game well before it was available on steam.  I wrote this on Feb 16, 2012.""I spent many many hours of game play time on X3 before things started moving along.It took lots of reading and learning and many slow hours of going from gate to gates just to get a map of the place. Mercenary is a lot faster to get things moving. Mercenary might seem like the same slow start at first but it is only the beginning few hours that are hard.The learning curve may seem a little steep at first but when you start to get the hang of things the fun just keeps on building. This game doesn't have the same level of depth as the likes of X3 but it has the fun that I never found in any other space game since Elite back on the Amiga.Yes the amount of different missions can seem small and they can get repetitive but there a many different ways or techniques to complete missions so even the same missions over again can be very entertaining.Mercenary has a lot to offer but a lot of the really nice things don't always become apparent until after a good few hours of play.Combat that seems impossible at first becomes gradually easier as you learn different ways to fight and fly.There is so much to find, so much to explore, even after weeks I am still learning new things. Having a good multi player universe gives this game a lot of extra life. Player dogfights and battles can be amazingly good fun and the community online is one of the friendliest I have ever seen.The graphics are not the best by today's standards but they have nice artistic feel to them and frame rates are smooth even on my low/mid spec system.There are lots of user mods available to improve the look and being easy to mod it has even inspired me to make my own  Cockpit/HUD and sound mods.Basically, to me it is an old school type space game sim with newer-ish graphics and a decent multi-play component.It all adds up to loads of fun and many hours of play time that make the price worth ever cent.""

												Open ended and complex! Fans of the X series will feel right at home here, and appreciate some of the new and innovative twists this title offers with it's flight and combat aspects. The persistant universe multiplayer aspect is pretty rad too. While the mechanics themselves are easy to master, the game itself offers endless depth with precious little direction. No rails here.

												You know, it took me quite a while to figure it all out; the learning curve actually curves back upon itself and forms a cliff dusted with all of your shattered hopes and dreams, and burning chunks of starships. But after a few hours of puttering around the universe, a universe which feels vast enough to become truly lost in, shearing minerals from asteroids, cleaning solar arrays, dashing through holographic rings for chump-change, and laser-jousting at eyeball-blistering speeds with sweet lady inertia as my copilot...I think I like it. There's a lot to see, ridiculous amounts of things to do, and you'll spend enough time tweaking your ship design, or creating the perfect kinetic particle weapon from the ground up, that if you're anything like me, you'll wonder just where the hell the day went. It's got an unforgiving interface, more controls than you'll remember after taking a break, and you might even get the feeling that it's laughing at you when you accidentally come out of warp inside a planet's atmosphere and shear your wings off...but for all that, the gently swelling, epic score punctuated by radio static and laser blasts against that gaseous nebula, backlit by the bright white glare of a dwarf star, will lead you back in. Head first. Into an asteroid.			"

												I want to like this game I really do. i wanted something open that would allow me to explore and mine and this seems to provide that........I think. The tutorial in this game is TERRIBLE and as a result the learning curve seems a bit insurmountable. The tutorial is 10 minutes of rapid fire hotkeys, and then your unleashed into the universe with almost no understanding of the game mechanics. I've read a few forums in an effort to be able to use the Nav Map as I couldn't get where I wanted with it only to discover that it's three dimensional so just clicking where you want to go could result (and does) in you ending up in the sector behind it, It seems like the tutorial should cover this, I mean you use the nav map constanly.Overall it feels a lot like I just paid for an unfinished game.

If, on the other hand, you're looking for a space sim that offers more than simple combat, here we go. This is the game I wanted when I bought X3, which was so damn complicated it would probably be easier to fly a real spaceship. This is possibly the best space sim available on Steam.			"

												This game is great. Once you get used to the way combat works it's pretty easy to start racking up kills. The way station building works is a bit weird but has a decent effect on economies. All the work of one guy who is very open to feedback, for instance recently he patched in full 3D Vision support, and one of the coolest things I've ever seen with it is combat taking place at a planetary ring and having the dust cloud give a *real* feeling of oh god I hope I don't hit anything, and as the cloud melts away on the other side and seeing you have a clear shot at your opponent. Or you can just mine the cloud for trade goods.			"

												302 reviews. Clearly the game doesn't sell a lot.It ""is"" complicated and there's a very steep learning curve. I'm guessing about a month before you figure most of it out.Complicating this is that there isn't much information if you Google for it because there weren't enough players for it. There ""is"" some useful info, there are some good Youtube vids, but not enough for you to learn what many other things do.Very poor ship customization. Cargo bays are limited to 5, although with the Oasis to Pearl run (semi-cheat) that's really all you need to make all the money you need. And then what?I still have a long way to go so I gave the game a thumbs up but I don't know what else I'll find. I've easily spent 10x the amount of time I've played watching vids and searching Google for info. I have about 100,000,000 credits from that trade run between Oasis station in Pearl and Pearl's hidden planet (location easily Googled).The Nav map is so hard to read with all the letters cluttered. Surely this can be fixed.Game is about 4 years old and no signs of fixing/adding small conveniences.Way too expensive for a game no one plays anymore.Auto docking would make this game much more tolerable, and a lower price (say $7 to attract more players).The game ""is"" fun, but you really have to work for that fun. Again, still too early for me to tell how tolerable the game really is.			"

Have to watch fuels levels and such.Can explore the planets and the universe is so large you won't feel limited in any way.Has mining and crafting. Can build your own space stations and gain reputation with factions in different sectors.Graphics-wise it looks really good if not a bit dated though. Can't really expect too much from a space sim that was basically made for its online mode.It's a game you can play in depth or just casually. Quite fun online and the community is quite pleasant.

												Would I recommend it to a niche market? Yes. Otherwise, it needs some polishing and more content to be considered a 100% finished product, even if close to that finish line. At the moment, it lacks in ship choices, planetary content (they are rather barren) and some aspects of the navigation interface graphics are a bit crude. That said, there is a lot of space for game modifications and further improvements. The game, as it stands, is immersive and uses correct vector and inertial physics, which is refreshing. It does allow for a lot of freedom, play-style choices, exploration, and you can land on planets! I have started playing the game and find myself constantly coming back to my ship to see what else is ""out there""! As I explore this vast space, I am hoping for even further development from StarWraith and the modding community.  7/10			"

												Evochron Mercenary is a space simulation game that will allow you to explore the universe with an endless amounts of fun. The game will offer you a series of starting roles that will give you a ship that you can use to explore. The options of starting roles include anything from a miner to a combat pilot. I chose the miner because of the tools and reputation you get with the ship you pilot. The game will also give you a chance to customise your ship to what you want it to look like from a selected range of wings, engines, shields, fule tank and the body frame. The game map is pre-made and you will get the same map as everone else has, but it will throw a lot of diffrent things in our path from a black hole in one sector, to a planet made of water with an atmosphere made of diamond in the next sector. The game also has a reputation system that will chance on what contracts you take in the diffrent quadrents. If you complete  enough contracts for a cetain group, you reputation will increase with them and down with another. Overall the games elements of exploration, freedom and customisation makes you in control of the game with no rules to follow. I really recommend this game to anyone who would like to have a good time exporing the universe!   "

												This game takes a much higher focus to the immersion factor than the actual ""game"" factor. What I mean by this is simply that it does a lot more with looks than mechanics. Evochron Mercenary is a great game for any player that does not mind some shortcommings in upgrade systems and etc, but would instead love to get the feel of flying a real spaceship. Despite the few upgrades and medium sized selection of weapons, the combat is intense. Piloting a ship and making manovers, cutting your engines to make missiles lose track of you, and even more tactical moves are implimented in this space simulators battle category. In terms of a game, this is about a 6/10, in terms of an experience, it's a 10/10.			"

It's about dropping stealth fields and hanging out in them with a station detonator when you figure out which clan came to seek retribution. It's also about performing ten jumps in random directions into empty space and deciding to build your secret lair there, then forgetting where you actually built it and performing about 30 more jumps trying to find it before you just build a new one that you'll probably also never come back to. But mostly, it's about grifing people and then running the ♥♥♥♥ away. Like I said earlier. Space. Combat.			"

												(NOTE: Rewritten to be less short 'n' dull.) Easily the most difficult-to-play space game I've ever played or even SEEN, Evochron Mercenary is going to challenge you in every damn way a space game can. It's almost as advanced as a simulator, but WAY more hectic (yeah, I'd like to see you sim-twits fight off a Harrier while flying your Boeing civ-jet) than ANY simulator out there. Honest to god, Allah, Vishnu and all them other dudes up (or down) there in the divine realm, I couldn't learn even HALF of the stuff in the game that's needed to play it. But still, even so, I have GOT to give my respects to a game that doesn't just demand an above-average intellect to crack open and enjoy, but a game that even cracks your head open and enjoys snacking on your less-than-Benjamin-Franklin-brilliant brain if you mess up! 8.7/10			"

It's a bit better, but still feels a bit slow, the quests and storyline don't feel very compelling to me, and although there is a dynamic ability to create your own space station and other facilties, it still feels bland and lackluster. It's combat is better then eve, i'll give it that much, not that i played a ton of eve, but eve has always been more of a text based game with some visual laser shows for big fights. I guess it does what it's suppose to do: well, and it tries to make the world more emmersive by having voices when you dock at a station adding a good effect. An effect that i wish there was more of. I never felt attached to anything, faction or cause. Just me floating in space fighting enertia, my only true enemy. The ""main story"" i guess you could say, just walks you through each type of quest they have avilable to you, not giving anything new or interactive besides revealing random♥♥♥♥♥cache's for ""mercenaries only"".This is more of a simulator, as such it takes a very long time to do anything. Maybe multiplayer is more fun, but i did not bother with it.Maybe build a giant Space station network or something. There's apperently npc ships you can command later on but i did not get there due to me having to battle it out solo with a capital ship.being sent to fight fighters i can understand, but fighting a capital ship solo? are they nuts? it can be done of course, but i feel like it's something a group of fighters would do, maybe with support, rather then a single lone mercenary, trying to soak up the endless missles it launches while 4 fighters attack you. Also, missles are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and you seem to run out of countermeasures very quickly due to the shere amount of them fired at you. Also station items seem to be really buggy when you reload after dying, they don't replinish and it's like you just bought them out, you can also save and reload or exit the quadrent and return to it to get a new set of items. This does not feel right to me for a ""simulator"".""Contracts"" or quests as i like to call them, get very stale very fast. Kill 4 fighters, then kill 4 more, after that you can kill 4 fighters again, all of them randomly scattered about in some random portion of space for no conceivable reason. This is one of the better quests you'll find, as most of it's fetch quests, mining, cleaning a solor array, ""racing"": which is more like ""Battle your greatest foe! ENERTIA!""Jumpdrive is still bugged however, causing you to run into stuff or randomly explode upon exiting a jump. They fixed it with stations at least, I remember hammering into the side of stations uncontrollably, now you just seem to bump off them harmlessly instead of smashing into them, they also have better guiding for your ship when entering a station, minimizing further ship crashing.Overall, this is not what i'm personally looking for. There is potential, but i don't think it can be reached with how things are set up.			"

												The central mechanics of this game are good enough that I was willing to stay with it for over 15 hours. At the same time, the overall experience seemed to be a bit obtuse, with navigation especially feeling a bit uncertain (as I remember). Also, the lack of a memorable and central narrative eventually had me shrugging my shoulders and moving on to other things. ""Free form"" play is a neat idea, but if you have to imagine the entirety of your own story - without real external cues - it can all end up being too emotionally ""flat."" (If there's nothing to care about beyond the next ship upgrade or profit-making venture, what's the point of being a swashbuckling star pilot? I ask you.)			"

												I want to like this game.  I'm TRYING HARD to like this game.  I love the idea of it, but I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do:1) The second quest mission out of the gate is a race that I simply can't do.  I've shredded millions of credits on different ship ideas and the like, but occasionally no matter what I do, inertia pulls me out of the rings and I lose the race.  Period.  Big ships, small ships, wings, engines - doesn't matter.  I can't win that race.  Maybe there's a way to cheat it or something I can find on the forums, but this is FRUSTRATING.2) Mining is mining, and it's fine, but there's not much to it.  There's an outpost with an asteroid about 700 out from gate 4.  Pretty sweet spot to pile up credits.  On a lark, I tried warping over to the hostile space next door.  Got killed a lot, but eventually jumped away to a much riskier asteroid field.  What did I find, mining in this new hotbed?  Same stuff as the asteroid right outside the gate.Maybe I just need to start a new pilot and try a different career, but at this point I'm worried I'll hit the same sort of dead end.			"

												Evochron is an interesting beast.Its a one man project that uses some free, stock assets. But its made by one guy, so that's forgivable.But its kind of ugly, it has quite a learning curve and does a poor job of explaining things. The UI is AWFUL, and doesn't do all that great a job of letting you know what's going on. BUT with persistence, you can get a good grip on it.There really isn't much to do once you get in there. Sure you can trade, but there isn't enough interesting things to do once you have a boatload of cash. You can build stations and other items, that give you discounts on items, but building them is a pain. Once you have them, though, there isn't really a point as you already have what you need.The atmospheric flight is neat, its handled in a interesting way. You can't just slam down into the atmosphere and survive. You have to take a long, shallow entry or you'll explode. But once you get down to surface level, there really isn't much to do, that you can't already do in space. So it eventually becomes pointless.The ship building/upgrading is interesting, but not nearly fleshed out enough. It feels like the developer tried to do LOTS of things just well enough for them to work, but non of them are all that good or worth doing unless its your first time, or absolutely necessary, like ship upgrading.In saying all that. If you stick with it, you make the control layout work for you, rather then fight you all the time. You find a nice, active MP server and play. It becomes more interesting. But on a whole, I could only get a few days in before I lost interest.But for one guys work, its impressive.I wish the developer would hire a few more people. It has some really cool stuff, that could be made into something REALLY cool.			"

												this is a standout game in the space flight sim genre and the exploration here is second to none.  it could be argued theat elite dangerous has better combat and is bigger, but this game is soooooo massive you would be hard pressed to actually be able to tell that it is smaller and the combat is still top notch.  in my opinion the only way elite dangerous tops this game is that docking is not so simple and the graphics are better.  but in evochron there are more hidden systems, wormholes, jumpgates, secret technologies, and even wormholes hidden at the core of black holes (good luck getting to those intrepid explorers!).  the game has a vibrant online community and is definitley worth checking out.  I reccomend buying this game EVEN if you already have elite dangerous.			"

												Learning curve looks more like a straight line from my viewpoint.  If you like space exploration and no hand holding (and lots and lots and lots of research in the forums or wherever) then you might like this.  There seems like a lot of potential here but this game requires so much external refrence required to even play this game I have to give it a thumbs down.  I long for the feeling of a game like this that allowes us to explore, gather resources, trade routes, etc, but with a reasonable learning curve for those of us who cannot spend all day reading forums.  I like the idea that this game gives us so many options for modifying our ship, but we have so little info at the start of the game I don't know if I should upgrade and if I do upgrade what do I upgrade to?There are so many options and commands in this game it is utterly confusing.  I have forced my self to play this game because it is so much work.  I'm sure it is great once somebody knows what they are doing.  I do like complexity, but after two weeks reading the forums and playing, I still don't know what the hell this game is about.  I just don't have the time to spend. Although if you have time and you like games like this, there appears to be plenty of people who like the game.  I bought it because I saw potential.  Although if you just want to buy a space game that you can jump into and just play casually I say this may not be the game for you.			"

												Not much to do in this game. Mine, fight, race, or do missions. Missions are always the same, clean, race, mine, pick up, drop off.You mine a lot. I tend to put something heavy on the b key (mining laser) and go do something else. And the best place to mine is in the starter areain the asteroids. So why go anywhere else?Fight when you get bored of mining. Then it comes down to the unlimited ai missles vs your 4. You can't even tell if your counter measures are working or not. You might actualy stand a chance should you live to get close enough with your main weapons and stay behind them. Cargo bay maxes out at 5 cargo bays, and you can get that at the beginning of the game. So any ship you upgrade to can only have 5 cargo bays period, which to me is stupid. You finally got that large ship, only to find out it's limited to what your small ship could carry. WTF!You can customize you ship, but I really didn't see much difference in it. And any equipment you buy is just an upgrade of what you start out with. Class 2 shields, class 3 shields, blah blah blah.System travel is painfully slow, so you're constantly jumping everywhere and saving the game all the time (no auto-save). Although I don't see the point in visiting other systems or planets. There's nothing new or to do but the same old thing.Game does have multiplayer, though the only difference I see is that to do the main story missions, except for the first mission, you have to do them in single player mode. I've never gotten past the 2nd one, just can't win that race no matter what. And supposedly the ship you're racing is a clone of yours.After you get over the newness of the game, you'll come to find out it's just very repetative.			"

Sadly, that is the theme for this game, great scope all around but the execution leaves the game a bare bones space simulator.Great flight controls but overly complicated HUD.

												This games fuel and money demands leaves me confined to routine.Unless you like the routine of going to a hostile area,running your♥♥♥♥♥in and out quickly before dying,landing on a planet 3-5 mins later and selling.Rinse and repeat.The other tactics to make money is trivial.So once you look up the ""Best Way"" to make money you are force to that routine.Even though that tactic makes alot of money I still get a paranoid feeling of running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere becoming perma-stuck.This game makes you think you can freely explore,but I have never felt so confined.If fuel wasn't a factor this could be enjoyable to play.I tried going multiplayer a couple of times but the servers are down or something.The whole game experience has been utter crap boring to me.Which is why I wouldn't recommend.Update:Trying to give it more of a chance.After making over half a billion credits I've experienced more of this game.This game seems to really depend on how you are.If you're patient you will get some rewards.Making money is the big secret first,then customizing your ship to your needs.The physics in this is Newtonian,so combat can become a drift in and out of range firing.Combat is really tough to get used to if you never played space-sim with newtonian physics.Final word is this game takes doing some homework or alot of trial and error.If you are looking for a game to mess with like X3 look somewhere else this isn't it.If you are looking for a challenging game that takes knowledge and skill this is for you.I still won't stamp this on recommended because my stance is neutral since this game isn't for a majority of people.There are pros and cons,and I want to make sure people are aware of the cons before purchasing this strange,innovative,yet well built game.

												I just don't get this game, I went through the entire set of IMG missions to see if anything would happen, but all I can say is that this game lacks everything a game of this type needs to make it interesting.   The economy is static.  There is no flavor between any of the factions, heck other than a different label, theres no difference between the factions.   There's not much of a difference between your starting ship and the best ship you can buy.  And because of the way energy works in this game, the starting weapon is one of the best.   When you put everything together, this universe is simply... dead.   Sure, you can build a station to buy stuff you don't need, or build a construction yard to turn space junk you don't need into spaceship components you don't need, or you can mine an asteroid for money you don't need (see static economy) - but it all amounts to nothing.This game is one of the few that I whole-heartedly give 2 thumbs down.

Run, run, run, shoot, shoot, shoot... everybody has to much shield (including you) and it became very tedious... wish the guns are more lethal, so the combats end more quick or, at least, require more tactics and skills than bloodly shield and weapons management... this could be fun in a capital ship simulation, but not in a fighter.My recomendation: Instal Freelancer and its best open space mods.

												Remember that time when Notch was making a scifi game? And how he was like ""it's all gonna be hard scifi""? This game is what the result would have been: clunky controls, too many buttons needed to be pressed just to get your ship moving without exploding, empty space, complicated combat, immense learning curve, no backstory to what you're actually doing, and an unrealistic price for how old this game actually is. If you want a space adventure without getting lost in details, don't buy this. Save your money and get Elite: Dangerous or something similar.			"

												This sounds like a brilliant game. On paper.However, the controls are extremely difficult to handle, and you will die. Alot. Over and over again. I have yet to manage 10 minutes without exploding. Sometimes I don't even know why. I want to love this game, but I really can't get anywhere with it. Sorry, can't recomend it.			"

												How can I sum this game up?This is regurgitated garbage, that has been thrown away, taken back out, repackaged under a new name, thrown away, taken out, repackaged as the same original garbage it was from the start.  And let me tel lyou the long history this game has had so you can discover for yourselves where this game originated from...I bought a game by the company 3000ad, which is now a dirty word in my language, never to be trusted again, who released a game called Battlecruiser ???? (some number), the game, while it may have had good intentions, was utterly flawed, and buggy, and options had to be selected with particular care, when setting up at the start of a game, if you inadvertently, selected the incompatible options, it would crash to desktop, but there was no error checking routines in place to say if you chose this option and have that option selected, will cause problems, instead, it gave you the freedom to choose whatever options you want regardless of outcome.The documentation included an instruction manual for the game that would put our Defense Department's aircraft manual's to shame.  After installing the game, nearly 70 additional ""how to"" files will be spammed into your start menu, and if not handled properly during installation may even spam your entire desktop.I don't care about the cheesy graphic's as I'd rather have a low end game that works, than a high end game full of bugs, but even so, despite the cartoony graphic's, was full of bugs and crash to desktops, with an eternity worth of documentation you'll never keep in your head, let alone remember when it comes time to actually play the game.Later on, they released a sequel called Battlecruiser Millenium, which was the same game, same bugs, no noticable difference, other than the fact that they got another paycheck at our expense, for a flashier intro screen.Following their failure with that sequel, was about the same time Microsoft released their best functional game called Microsoft Freelancer, which was an incredible game that I adored, and wish they would have made a sequel to, but never did.  3000ad felt they had to collect on some of that fan base $$$, so they repackaged their garbage to compete with Freelancer, and they called that same garbage Universal Combat...   Same game as Battlecruiser, different title, different box, same garbage game, full of bugs and crash to desktops.Now they've repackaged the game AGAIN, under a new name called Evochron Mercenary, same game as their original garbage Battlecruiser, with same crash to desktops... The only reason I bought the game was because the box reminded me of Freelancer, and I didn't notice in very small print 3000ad, had I seen their company's logo, I would have not wasted my money on it.  So I got ripped off 4 times by that company, like buying the same game 4 times, only thing different was the names.This game doesn't even have a rating, its THAT low! "

												Whilst desperately searching for something similiar to No Mans Sky I came across this game and figured I'd give it a shot. I really wish I hadn't bothered. From the moment the game loaded the dev graphic I could already tell that this wasn't the crisp looking game it appears to be in the screenshots. The somewhat pixellated graphic being reminiscent of something I'd expect to see on a Megadrive era game. I figured I'd let it slide, maybe it was meant to look like for some sort of retro feel or maybe th graphics options needed setting up properly? Then the UI loaded and boy was I instantly disappointed. I was confronted with an almost unreadable message in a blocky squished font, which would be bad enough if it weren't for the fact that some genius decided to go with a light blue text on a dark blue background. Still not deterred I figured I'd try to fix this issue searching through the graphics options, I checked the resolution was OK but it made no difference. Eventually I managed to decipher an option that might help, it was to do with text at least. I selected it and ... it made it worse! The text was less blocky but was instead smaller and more squashed in? So I went back to the default bad option and decided to just try and get into the game. I loaded the tutorial and tried to get started. After 10 minutes of tedious instruction I'd managed to move pretty much nowhere and if I had there was no way of being sure. Despite the tutorial narrators constant droning on in the background I was non the wiser as to how to do the very basic thing of actually moving. Now I could of stepped away for a moment, spent the next couple of hours hunting down and reading through guides and explanations but quite frankly I wanted to play a game now. I don't feel like I should be expected to research the basics just to get started. Some people may be able to find something here, it certainly seems to have plenty of positive responses from others but for me there was too much wrong in too short a period of time and for that reason I decided to get my money back and leave it.

The enemies are quite sharp, and dangerous so if you dont know the controls, combat missions are brutal, and not advisable to undertake. However there are other missions like cleaning solar pannels and taking part in races, but the after doing these for a while, I lost interest. Its ok for passing the time if you have nothing else to play. On the plus the Graphics are ok, and the customization of the ship is quite interesting and unique.			"

												If you like free-form spaceflight games, in the vein of Privateer or Freelancer, this is THE game to play! Warning: Steep learning curve, and addictive game play ahead! Best of all? You can play with your friends online! Newtonian spaceflight done right!Addendum: This game REALLY shines when you use a decent HOTAS or 6DOF flight stick! While everyone these days is talking about Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen, this game feels like it still has a lot of features those games just aren't yet delivering, like seemless planetary landings from space and the ability to walk around and fight on the surface in a ""Terrain Walker"". Essentially, this game is a combination of the likes of Privateer and Elite with a dash of MechWarrior-lite. If you own a decent stick, and you're considering (or already play) Elite or Star Citizen, you need to play this. Online play is an interesting mix of freeform adventure and clan engagements, with the ability to build Trade Stations for either yourself or your clan. These stations will actually affect the local economy, and are part of a larger strategy for asserting financial dominance in an area. Come play with us!			"

												This game has its share of challenges thats without a doubt but I can honestly say once you figure out the controls and how to play the game you can really get into this game and spend a good amount of time on it. The game has so much content that I never did get a chance to totally finish everything but I spent all of my time playing coop with someone and I couldnt have had more fun if I tried so even though this game has a solo player mode I would recommend the coop mode without a doubt just because after trying both it didnt change anything and was just more enjoyable with a friend.Would recommend this game if you enjoy games like EVE online but dont want the drama with a bunch of people on a server trying to kill you. Not to mention you only buy this game once and you are good which is a huge plus over EVE. The missions at times were a challenge so it never left you feeling like the game was too easy.			"

												Immense, detailed and challenging space trading/combat simulation. If you like the genre you've got no excuse not to buy this. If you want to try the game out without paying, you can always download the demo from the dev's website - It offers about 90h of unrestricted gameplay.			"

												The best game to hit the genre since Frontier....the new graphics update is amazing, along with the new scale of the in game models.  The planets, space stations and capital ships are now huge, dwarfing your little ship.  Complete freedom, coop multiplayer and lasers....what more could you want!			"

												This is an indy game like no other. The price is absolutely outrageous, and only an idiot wouldn't get it on sale, but it is still an amazing game. It's like combining Star Wars: Rebel Strike with EVE Online. The multiplayer is lobby and server-based, but the experience is wholefully open, coving a vast galaxy. The Singleplayer and Multiplayer experiences are very similar, meaning you can go anywhere and do anything in either. I strongly recommend it if you're looking for something very fun to play with friends.			"

												A very open no boundaries space simulation. See a planet? Go down into the atmosphere and land at a city or outpost. Dock with a space station and trade commodities, mine asterioids and make a profit. There are many countless ways to do just about whatever you want in this game. To sum it all up, I read on a website that review said ""This is the kind of game for gamers that played mario and tried to jump off the edge of the screen to find a hidden warp tube"". You have no limitations in this simulation. It is well worth it.			"

												Probably the single-most kickass space sim I have ever played. Plus it has online co-op! You literally don't see loading screens, even while entering a planets atmosphere. Sad how much this game is overlooked. I bought this game and it stayed in my 'unplayed bin' for almost a year because I was intimidated by how much you have to learn, and all I was doing was a great disservice to myself and this game. Truly fun.			"

												I think the best fact that describes this game is that I almost ran out of fuel on my first mission. This is not your typical space arcade game where you just go about blasting stuff. My game controller didn't have enough axis for the game and the inertia system requires some learning as well. So this is way closer to realism, than any other game I've seen.			"

												I have taken down my good reccomendation for this game until they can fix the Alt+Tab crashing, it makes the game practically unplayable. To get around the Alt+Tab crashing you need to change the game to a setting that doesnt allow antialiasing, which is unacceptable. Recently released patches also seem to overlook this issue.			"

												Awesome freedom, just drops you into a huge seemless universe with nothing but a ship and a quest to get your bearings. Fly down onto worlds seemlessly, no loading, and explore the planets. Trade between space stations, ships, planets, fight as a mercenary, race, and eventually build your own space station/colony/fleet.			"

												Its ok, but thats it... quite realistic in terms of physics and fuel useage, but I quickly got bored of the gameplay as it gets a little repetitive. The enemies are quite sharp, and dangerous so if you dont know the controls, combat missions are brutal, and not advisable to undertake. However there are other missions like cleaning solar pannels and taking part in races, but the after doing these for a while, I lost interest. Its ok for passing the time if you have nothing else to play. On the plus the Graphics are ok, and the customization of the ship is quite interesting and unique.			"

												This is the best space simulator I've EVER tried. It even breaks X-Wing Alliance off. It's flying in space with the same kind of physical realism you know from sims like MS Flight Sim and other heavily realism-oriented games.You can do whatever you want. Start a war with a entire system. Make yourself rích by mining. Find luxurious trade-routes. Live by your guns - yes, you name it.You can soar over the surface of any planet you encounter, and even land in cities on them. You have an entire quadrant of space ahead of you, some systems are hostile, some aren't. Some have riches, others have rebels hiding behind every asteroid you try to mine. Your options are what you make them to be in this game.It's a truely amazing space sim.Just remember to make your graphics card apply anti aliasing and ansitropic filtering to the game's .exe file - or it looks like som kind of 90's game. But it IS quite beautiful if these measures are met. And a good solid joystick wouldn't hurt either...			"

												When this game says 'True Freeform Gameplay without plot constriction, conditions or limitations' it means it. Right from the get go, you are given a ship, a class and a small quest to start with and then the galaxy is yours to explore. Be a Merchent and mine materials from clusters of asteroids or gather materials from different worlds to sell in the local markets. Be a Merc and work for any faction. Be a Racer and compeate against other racers  across the galaxy, or be a Fighter Pilot and make a name for yourself or whatever you want. Make allies and enemy with different faction from different sectors. Engage in real time, authentic space combat with other mercs, military and even other players.Controls are abit confusing at first, but the tutorial is very in depth and will give you an idea of how it works. Combine that with friendly players and practice and you'll be an Ace in no time.If your interested in space FPS sims, or just love exploring galaxys. This is for you.			"

												This game has its share of challenges thats without a doubt but I can honestly say once you figure out the controls and how to play the game you can really get into this game and spend a good amount of time on it. The game has so much content that I never did get a chance to totally finish everything but I spent all of my time playing coop with someone and I couldnt have had more fun if I tried so even though this game has a solo player mode I would recommend the coop mode without a doubt just because after trying both it didnt change anything and was just more enjoyable with a friend.Would recommend this game if you enjoy games like EVE online but dont want the drama with a bunch of people on a server trying to kill you. Not to mention you only buy this game once and you are good which is a huge plus over EVE. The missions at times were a challenge so it never left you feeling like the game was too easy.			"

												If you like free-form spaceflight games, in the vein of Privateer or Freelancer, this is THE game to play! Warning: Steep learning curve, and addictive game play ahead! Best of all? You can play with your friends online! Newtonian spaceflight done right!Addendum: This game REALLY shines when you use a decent HOTAS or 6DOF flight stick! While everyone these days is talking about Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen, this game feels like it still has a lot of features those games just aren't yet delivering, like seemless planetary landings from space and the ability to walk around and fight on the surface in a ""Terrain Walker"". Essentially, this game is a combination of the likes of Privateer and Elite with a dash of MechWarrior-lite. If you own a decent stick, and you're considering (or already play) Elite or Star Citizen, you need to play this. Online play is an interesting mix of freeform adventure and clan engagements, with the ability to build Trade Stations for either yourself or your clan. These stations will actually affect the local economy, and are part of a larger strategy for asserting financial dominance in an area. Come play with us!			"
