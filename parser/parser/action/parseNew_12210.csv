												HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE CALM DOWN!!!!!A bunch of people are complete idiots and are giving this game bad reviews, because they can't start the game (Because they have windows 10).

												This game gets a thumbs down because it doesn't work without doing extra work. And Rockstar is aware of these issues but won't produce a patch. Otherwise GTA IV is awesome.To get the game to run if you are on Windows 8.1 (and maybe lower) you need to download and install the latest Games For Windows Live.  Yes GFWL is cancer but it is required. Just Google it and hope the download link is still up. (It is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need this considering GFWL is DEAD and no longer supported.)Then if you have a video card above 2 gigs you need to do two things to ensure it runs properly. GTA IV assumes you do not meet the requirements and limits your graphics settings. To get around this make a file in the GTA IV install folder called ""commandline.txt"" without the qoutes. Then put ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" without the qoutes inside of the file and save. Then goto your Steam launch settings for the game and put those two settngs in there like the you did the file.You are welcome. Where are my support royalties Rockstar?			"

												Apart from several technical issues, this is an amazing game. Personally, I think, it's even better than GTA V. The story is deep and the characters are very well written.---NOTE: The following guide may be outdated because the game has received an unexpected update today.The guide how to play:1)Install X Live Less,2)Install NTA's budget fix,3)Remove paul.dll file from the game folder,4)Create file named ""commandline.txt"" in the game folder with following content:"" -nomemrestrict -norestrictions""5)Install some mods for your taste (I recommend VisualIV and Killatomate's Realistic Driving),6)Experience the masterpiece.

												This is the successor of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and the sixth installment in the series (not counting the portable and mobile releases). GTA is one of the most successful western video game franchises and it is most known for it's intense violence, drugs and nudity. Not to an extreme level though, as the series objective is to stay relatively realistic and to depict true criminal situations. e.g. gangs, mobs, drug dealing etc.All Grand Theft Auto games are set in fictional cities that try to replicate real American ones. They are also set in different time periods and do not bind together story-wise, but some characters and/or events are being referenced from time to time. Unlike Vice City and San Andreas, GTAIV is set in modern times in Liberty City. Which is the same setting as the older title GTA3 is set in, which might explain the choice of GTAIV's name.Liberty City is a replica / parody of New York, with famous land marks such as The Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building. As well as very well replicated areas of Brooklyn, Manhattan and New Jersey. You play as the illegal (?) immigrant Niko Bellic, which has recently arrived from ""the old country"" (Eastern Europe) via boat. You therefore are immediately orchestrated to break the law, it is expected of you. Probably because you play a GTA game... I mean, of course you are going to break the law!To be expected, this game has very much improved graphics, physics and story compared to San Andreas (which was a kick♥♥♥♥♥GTA, I might add), and the game was very much ahead of it's time when it came out. It quickly became very successful on both Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. When it ended up on PC, 9 months down the line, the port itself was rather hideous. This game could completely tank a high-end PC on medium settings, making it unavailable for the majority of the player-base. Even today, this game is very demanding, but nothing a modern computer can't handle. What is it about? As if you didn't know already.... Steal a car, drive over a couple of pedestrians, pull out your SMG and mow down a few cops to get some heat, race on the highway while causing havok all over the place, see the cars crumble when you (or the cops) smash into them, end it all with an insane stunt, setting fire to everything and everyone and make a big BOOM. Probably dragging you down in the process, die and respawn in the hospital where you can just repeat everything all over.There's this satisfaction about just being a complete outlaw in a peaceful city, that no other game can really deliver. GTAIV is no different, although the lack of airplanes is a minus and should not have been left out. 9/11 be damned, I want to fly a ♥♥♥♥ing jet. Other than that, this game is phenomenal - it's not just the gameplay, but the story, the humor and the amount of details put into the game. This game will make your hours disappear, and your violence-o-meter to rise sky high.Pick this game up if you want free roaming, open-world, non-stop action, car crashing extravaganza set in a realistic world and with a good story.Note: This game currently requires SecuROM, Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Games Social Club. So 3 extrenal DRM's in addition to Steam. "

""WHEN THE WAR CAME, I DID BAD THINGS, BUT AFTER THE WAR I THOUGHT NOTHING OF DOING BAD THINGS. I KILLED PEOPLE, SMUGGLED PEOPLE, SOLD PEOPLE.""Everybody was looking forward to 3rd December 2008. The release day of PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV. 2 years later, I found out that some GTA IV exists, when I saw ""Move Up Ladies"" trailer. Back in 2010 I used to run on Windows XP Service Pack 1. I had to upgrade. SP3 was needed. I never upgraded, and when I did month before to W7 I ruined that. I can't exactly remember how it all went down, but all I remember is, that mother cooked me soup, and while the computer was installing Service Pack 3, I was inpatiently waiting in the kitchen eating that bomb soup. Full of excitement I came to my room and that glorious legendary Windows XP background was shining at me and I immidiately started screaming ""OH YES OH YES OH YEEEEEEES"". After that, there was absolute silence in my room for a week. Why? Because I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV.Now, we all know that it's legendary and before GTA V it was totem to most of the gamers who managed to run it. That optimalization was and is problem to lot of gamers, but it all was a price of the revolution. Maybe, I didn't say it correctly, because revolution is change of something and after that it follows. But no game was able to follow GTA IV. Physics was totally heaven. It was like from another planet. Just imagine, 9 freaking years ago, game like GTA IV was out. That game didn't even had competition. Still I'm not sure if there's game close to that physics that we were introduced to back in 2008. Yeah I know GTA V bla bla bla bla. Sound, graphics, story, visuals, city, just every everything was new level. Storytelling and dialogues are gripping as hell. It's really deep and intense, with absolute dedication to detail. Liberty City is dark and so is story. Liberty City is beautiful, sad, sombrely. New York in your hands. Everybody has to play it at least once, so I believe there's no need of going into the story, and if so, I'll just tell you to play it because you won't regret it.Recent update helped a game a bit, but modders used to downgrade. Mods extend the gaming experience. Game will last you easily around 30 hours. It's highly replayable. I can't even count how many times I've finished that. Easily over 10 times. Multiplayer was and is just a bonus addition. Nothing big, nothing real. GFWL sucks, everybody agrees with that. Game expansions have been already reviewed so you can check it in my profile. If I forget about anything, let me know please. To sum it up - legendary game that everybody must finish with amazing story and storytelling, awesome visual and physics and great overal gaming experience. Bonus Point: Soup from my motherRating: 9.5/10 "

												Please note: The game does not work out of the box but the fix is simple. I have written a detailed guide on how to make the game work here: 


First Time Setup Guide: Making the Game Run on Modern PCs (2016) 
A Guide for Grand Theft Auto IV
By: Reverend Jesse V92

			How to make the game startup in 2016 now that Games for Windows is deprecated and Social Club doesn't work		


Review:The game isn't as pretty as a game like GTA V, but remember this game came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. For the age, the graphics work well. If the graphics bother you, there are a plethora of mods available to up the graphics on various sites.As with every GTA game, there is a lot of things to do in GTA IV. If you count for 100% completion, here's the breakdown:60%: the 90 story missions2%: assassinations2%: street races2%: Chop shop collections2%: Car thefts2%: Drug deliveries2.5%: Vigilante missions2.5%: Police Most Wanted hitman missions5%: Random Encounters5%: Activities5%: Special Activities5%: Competitions2.5%: Pigeon Hunter2.5%: Stunt Jumps(Source: GameFaqs[www.gamefaqs.com])I played this on 360 when it came out and I averaged about 90 hours by taking my time with the main story. I'd estimate 20-40 hours of additional content remains not counting story missions depending on your skill and time invested.Overall, the game can be fun. The initial setup issues are what cause 99% of the negative reviews on Steam. Social Club also does not work as of September 2016 when I write this post, so just ignore the login prompt for it on launch. However this also means that the multiplayer aspect is sadly inaccessible. Rockstar made a post on their support forums saying they were looking into it on 6 Oct. 2015 (Source: Rockstar Support[support.rockstargames.com]) so it's likely that it will never be fixed as it currently looks.Still, if you never played the single-player, that's completely working. Several of the characters from GTAV are in GTAIV and further expands on their original context in the series here.If you have any additional questions or concerns before buying the game that I have not answered here in my review, please leave a comment and I will append my review with the answer to your question.

												In order to use any online features (which is the only part of the game I am interested in) you must also login to Games for Windows Live (which you need to install yourself), and Rockstar's Social Club service. This wouldn't be a problem... except for the fact that the social club has not been working in this game for well over a month now. The game has several layers of DRM that simply do not work.			"

Unfortunately the game cannot be launched through steam anymore. (This was later fixed in the 1.0.8.0 Patch by rockstar)The game: Pros- good graphics ( everything on max of course)- magnificent story - brings back the nostalgia from playing it on the ps3 - get the dlc Cons - noneThis review was written while I was taking a dump.

												Great story, good characters, superb graphs, simply a top game but....just like GTAIII, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas, there is some work to do to get this game running on PC. Time is not standing still, you know and Rockstar and Steam are not helping a lot. This is how i got the game running on windows 10 based on forum readings and own experiments.First of all thanks to anyone for posts and helping each other out on this one.1. Download software2. Start the game, click on desktop icon3. Steam will install necessary files like Direct X - Windows LIVE - Securom protection4. You will be asked to login to Rockstars Social Club, ignore this and exit / return to desktop5. Go to your steam game folder and rename the file paul.dll to paul.old, this way you willbe never prompted again to login to Rockstars Social Club. You also can delete this paul.dll filebut one never knows if a decent update appears and paul.dll is necessary again.6. As told in point 3, steam installed Windows LIVE but this is not supported anymore by Microsoftand you will need to have it installed to start the game. Install Games for windows Marketplace, see link    http://www.xbox.com/en-us/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient7. Start the GTAIV again by clicking on the desktop icon.8. You will be asked to make an account on Windows Marketplace (mail and password required), do so as it is needed to save the game and store achievements. 9. You are also asked to submit the serial key number which is provided by steam.10. And to have a gamertag on Xbox live. If not create one (mail and password required) via starting the app Xbox in windows 10 after exiting the game. (i guess this app is also available in win 7 / 8). If not, here to find     http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-app11. And there you go with the game.....for the lucky ones.12. If you have a graphic card with more then 2GB memory, as I do, you're ingame graphic options are all set to minimum and can not be changed.13. Right-click on GTA 4 under the Steam Library and select properties.14. Under the general tab, click the set launch options button.15. Enter the launch options you wish to apply (be sure to separate each code with a space) and click OK. For GTA 4 it is:       -nomemrestrict -norestrictions16. Close the game's Properties window and launch the game.17. Now, you can set your graphic options to it's max.Auch, it start's with a SM scene, anyway, less painfull then getting the game installed.The last mission (helicopter) is painfull as well, it has a glitch.There is a workaround on the internet (use FRAPS & record settubg @ 30 fps) but hell, Rockstar where are you ??

GTA IV The Game			* 8/10GTA IV Release On Steam		* 0/10Let's stay ojective on this one, I downvoted this title not because I didn't enjoy the game but because I really cannot stand how developers and publishers handled this product, so I've split this review in 2 parts: one for GTA IV As a Steam Product, and the other one as a game itself. GTA IV (as Steam Product)BUY this game AT YOUR OWN RISK. Why?The procedure is the usual, we download and we get a serial key. Fine. Start the game and first thing we have to do is login with a Rockstar Social Club. Which I still believe has no reason to exist, but since this is their game I can live with it... Until their own launcher doesn't let me log in many random times for unknown reasons. Luckily it's necessary for online games only so I skip that passage as I'm not interested. Fine let's play! NO. Now you have to face Games for Windows Live, a dead platform badly working which You need TO MANUALLY UPDATE FIRST, because NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF DOING IT WHEN THE PLATFORM DIED, then it pretends your login and your serial code. OK, I'm almost running out of patience here but many games on steam require further registration with another platform (uPlay, Origin...), so ok. Then it's mayhem. I've read about A WHOLE LOT of people with this same issue: I've bought a 4-pack so I've registered all my serials on my account and all my friends' except for one which isn't recognized. There's NO WAY to get a solution for this (and I'm NOT even considering the trick where you're supposed to buy Episodes from liberty city to use its serial as GTA IV serial because I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BUY MORE TO USE WHAT I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR). Steam isn't responsible and claims it's rockstar or microsoft issue, Microsoft doesn't even have a number to call as GFWL is dead, Rockstar doesn't care and I've only read of just one user that came out of this by threatening Rockstar of SUING THEM and after a VEEERY long time he got a new serial.After all these troubles IF we're lucky we can get to the game... Or maybe not. Obviously On modern systems there HAS to be issues as The game allows to change your graphic Details ONLY IF it detects enough VRAM.Too bad that it doesn't recognize anything at all. Luckily A couple of command strings SHOULD be enough to bypass that problem. Let's press the ""Play"" button... Loading...Loading...Loading... REALLY?!?!? Luckily seems like another command strings solve that problem as well, but it's really ridiculous considering all the money they got they didn't support nor fixed any of these problems.GTA IV (as a Game)Anyways, after a good dose of patience and luck, once inside the game it gives some satisfaction. I've played the whole franchise since the first GTA (except for london) so I've seen the evolution of the games and I have to say this chapter is a huge leap forward.The gameplay is basically the same, third person action, you can do almost anything you want but if you want to follow the story and the missions it can be summarized as Running, shooting, stealing cars and drive away. In this chapter the gameplay introduces the cover systems which kind of helps in difficult situations and shootings. What makes the game particular is the really big map, a lively city with so many things to do, which means huge replayability. Liberty City is split in various ""islands"" connected with bridges... Closed at the beginning, as usual and there are the usual stores, spray'n'go, weapons and so on. Besides that there are also reastaurants, fast food, clothes shops and similar, among with the new leisure activities, such as bowling, strip clubs, cabaret and whatever, used mainly to maintain your reputation with friends and girlfriends. Yes, you can choose to date girls, and go out with friends which will call you anytime on your ingame mobile to invite you somewhere, and wether you accept or not it will influence the ""level of friendship"", which is kind of important as once you reach the top level they can help you out with their own abilities (call a cab, car bombs, weapons and more). Important or not it can be kind of annoying as girlfriends will always look at your clothes which you must change often and choose carefully according to their taste, and friends will often call to invite you... quite often... At any time... even while you're on mission or already out with someone else...Anyways, Looks like Rockstar did a really good job with the story as well, which was to be expected, but now they've taken everything to the next level with their new graphic engine with good direction skills and by taking good shots. You also have to make a choice towards the end and this will lead to two very different endings. And they're both quite bitter if I may say but I really liked the story anyways.The new engine does its job and shows the beauties of liberty city. Of course sometimes there are the usual glitches where some map elements are loaded later, or maybe sometimes the game will show on the road only massive copies of your own car but besides that everything is ok.There are few new things I really liked, such as buildings in the city... Meaning you can get inside various buildings, so this time you don't have a city made of impenetrable cubes. Of course most of them are accessible during missions but it gave a nice variation to the gameplay and locations. There's a TON of radio stations, and I love all of them, just like in the previous games, of course. And last thing is something I kind of liked and hated at the same time: the ""police wanted system"". Once you get the police attention you have to get out of an area of interest whose limits are determined by nearby units that have you onsight. Which is good... And hard to do at the same time as it's quite hard to shake off the units behind AND avoid the large quantity of units incoming ahead of you, which means they will keep you busy with long pursuit sessions before you can shake them off... Especially if you get the attention of choppers.One last thing that really took me some time to get used to is car physics... I mean, it's kind of hard and odd to drive them. Honestly, I don't care too much if it's more realistic than the older games or GTA V, but I can say all the cars are hard to handle, they don't steer enough, Handbrake makes you totally lose control, but after some hours of game I kind of got used to it... Not without some difficulty anyways. ---PROs--- GAMEPLAY. It's GTA, one generation ahead of the trilogy. Many additions and improvements to the game giving you lots of activities to do besides the main campaign. LIBERTY CITY. A very big city with lots of places, activities, people around, doing things, everything is really lively in that place. And everythin is built with lot of dedication and care for details. Even rides in Trains have a panoramic cinematic, or rides in taxis with lots of dialogues with the driver. STORY. Story is never to be underestimated in any GTA chapter and this here makes no exception.---CONs--- SERIAL ACTIVATION. The biggest flaw with this game is the high chance to fail registering your own Legit Serial Key AND the total lack of assistence. Not to mention the fact that you need to update your Games For Windows Live manually and the Rockstar Social Club randomly doesn't let you log in. THIS is the reason I downvoted this product. COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. It has some issues with modern hardware and modern OS and there's no official patch for this. Luckily there's always the steam community that helped me run GTA IV on my Laptop with Win 10 x64 and a Integrated nVidia GPU. CARS. Maybe it's me but I never got used to the car physics, they're quite hard to handle as they never steer enough and you can lose control too easily with handbrake. "

												This game in its current state of dependancy on both GFWL and Rockstar social club, is UNPLAYABLE. Do not spend your money on this wreck until it has been fixed.Edit:SpellingMy original review was posted in a state of extreme frustration, This is an excellent game, issues with DRM aside. However I still cannot recommend a a game that is this broken out of the box. With mods such as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game becomes playable, but the EULA for the game prohibits these modifications, and making them disables the multiplayer component.I think it's irresponsible and disrespectful to release a game in this state, and to ignore the issues once it's out.

												Broken Games for Windows Live, broken graphics options (won't let me use more than 250 mb of my 3 gb of VRam on an R9 280x) make this game completely unplayable. Not in that It's hard to play or I refuse to play it, but that the title screen is the farthest I've ever gotten.Edit:I was able to use startup commands to force the game into letting me play it (something I really shouldn't have to do in the first place), but then of course, the game is dreadfully optimized and runs at around 45 FPS on medium settings, with things like character models and buildings just kinda missing. Just get GTA V, it's the more optimized game, and the more well-written game.			"

												(It's been maybe over a year since I posted this review, so let's give it a different touch shall we?)   Grand Theft Auto IV is a good game, while being able to tell a story well and also delivering it in a special way. Gameplay and driving is not exactly the best, but this game is very good for it's time.The story is rich, very well written and greatly delivered to the player. Gun-play is decent, it's not bad nor is it great. Driving is also the same, however after the release of Grand Theft Auto V, I would prefer GTA V over IV for more control over the vehicle. Overall, the game is great for story, while mechanics are a bit stale for this new gen. Get the game, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!			"

 I remember that time, when i was 14 and always wanted a XBOX 360 just to play the newest GTA Game. This is without a doubt one of the best single player games of all time, and it is even more of a certainty that it features one of the ultimate video game story-lines, i mean... its GTA... The plot is so engaging, the characters instantly likeable, and the cutscenes are anything but boring.Some have mourned the loss of the arcade feel of previous games in the series, but this is stupid; yes, it is a sensationally fun game. You can't have honestly played this game and not have marvelled and spent hours pushing the limits of the ridiculous physics of the game world. It runs on Ultra graphical settings with no lag or other problems. If you don't have a powerful enough P.C, as I did for a long time, don't be quick to down this game. Seriously, save for an upgrade as this game is worth it. Rockstar admittedly however made a terrible decision to integrate with Windows Live, and the unavoidable Social Club. Hopefully in time these services will improve or be phased out because at the moment they are a pointless obstacle, detracting from what is otherwise a masterpiece. I dunno what all the problems were that people were having with Games for Windows Live or Rockstar Social Club, but I didn't hit any major hurdles getting this game up and running.			"

												Grand Theft Auto is great. No doubt. But the port they made of this game to PC was nothing to be proud of. They require you to log into some sort of windows live account to play online, and the modding community had to make a fix just so players could boot up the game. I would link people to youtube video I found for the startup crashing fix... but the link is in my other computers internet history. I do recommend visiting gta4-mods.com if you intend on playing this after completing the main story line as modding this game gives it soo much more replay value.Rockstar you make good games but for godsake... a billion dollar company... And you can't fix your game making indenpendant users do it for you. And then you wonder why you get complaints by those who don't know how to use google to find the fixes...			"

EDIT (11/30/16)Rockstar released an update for this game on 11/29/16. That's actually surprising. Although it didn't do the well-needed removal of GFWL, it still fixed a lot of problems.- Compatibility with modern hardware and Windows 8, 8.1, and 10. No more -nomemrestrict and -norestrictions !- Social Club works now. It's doesn't require you to login on bootup anymore, and instead gives you a text box about Social Club and a play button.- Multiplayer now works on Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.- Slight optimizations. The game runs a bit better now.- For me, Vsync now locks to 60 FPS instead of 52 FPS.But there's still problems with the game.- GFWL is still in the game. Why? It's old and outdated DRM that Microsoft doesn't support anymore. It just causes problems.- Game can still have frame dips here and there.- Antialiasing is nonexistant. It would be nice to have an antialiasing option added to the video options.Although the game still have GFWL, I feel like the update did A LOT to fix this horrendous PC port. But the review will still stand negative because GFWL is still baked into the game. I'm not sure why they didn't remove it. I figured they would know that no one likes GFWL. I'm assuming it's either impossible or it depends on what Microsoft says. Either way, it's awful DRM, and needs to be removed. Now don't let that turn you away from the game completely. It's not impossible to get around it. It's just annoying. You can easily get past GFWL in a few minutes and never have to worry about it.With that said, you can read my original review below. I decided to strikethrough all the fixed problems in the review.Original ReviewNow let's start off with the positives of this game to start this off with a positive note (the red thumbs down isn't helping that but it's whatever.PositivesThe game itself is great. I would know because I played it and beat it on 360 before joining the PCMR. Great story, sounds, graphics, and dialogue. Voice acting is a bit above average. There's a good amount of content as well, from the long story to the side activities like bowling and getting a drink with the various friends you can make. It's 2016 so you should know how this game plays out, but in case you haven't, there's a crash course of it.NegativesThis is a bad PC port. Like, really bad. The GTA V is leaps and bounds better than this disaster. Granted that the game is old, but they should've added future compatibility. I can open Half Life 2 and Counter Strike 1.6 on my PC with no problems. The graphics options are pretty good, to R*'s credit, but there's missing options. Where's antialiasing? And even maxed out, my 960 4GB doesn't even get 60 FPS, as this port has horrible optimization. It hovers around 52 FPS with the Shadows on High and all sliders at 70 and everything else maxed out, which is definitely playable if you aren't a PC elitist that thinks 52 is choppy, but for a game that only requires a 256MB GPU, I should be getting 60 locked with no problems. That's ridiculous. At least it runs better than 360 and that's what I'm happy about. And why is EFLC released as a seperate game itself? Couldn't you just add it as DLC under GTA IV? What is that all about? And I always got Social Club failed to login. Over and over and over and over. Luckily, you don't need to sign in to Social Club to play the game.And the preparation was unneeded and tedious. I had to install GFWL (which is a negative in itself as I don't need two DRMs to play my game) and set compatibility options on the three .exes in the GTA IV data folder to Vista SP2, THEN set the launch options to "" -nomemrestrict -norestrictions ""SummaryIt's definitely playable with the prep and the right settings, but it's just not needed. This is a bad port, and that's enough to justify a negative review. This is about the only time Rockstar ever effed up, aside from the terrible GTA online launch from server overload.Should you buy?  If you want to spend 30 minutes to an hour just to get the game to work, YES. If not, don't bother. "

												This game is wonderful, but don't buy it on the PC (EDIT: Do not buy if you have Windows 8). You have to manually configure the game to make it compatible with Windows 8 (if you have it). For some reason, to save your progress you must create a Games for Windows Live account. Which barely matters, seeing you can't start the game without GFWL if you have Windows 8. The only reason I have about 25 hours on this game is me trying to fix it/having it on an old Win 7 PC. I lost a good $20 on this game, don't waste your money.EDIT: Got a PC with Windows 7. Great game if you have Win7/XP, if not, don't bother buying.			"

												I have not played GTA:IV on PC before, because back when it was initially released it was so horrendously unoptimized you couldn't even joke about it.Nothing has changed.This is a shameful mess of a game, so 'extremely' badly ported it makes me want to cry.-You can't log in to Social most of the time-Rockstar Social uses a heavily outdated version, for whatever reason-It uses the unholy GFWL, still-Crashes and freezes galore-Locks your graphical settings to lowest possible if your GPU is too strong (not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you, there is a community fix tho)-No AA, at all-Runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ even on my 970 FTW edition-The mouse is choppy and awkward all the time-Using steam overlay is prone to cause the game to lock up, or simply not let you exit the overlay-May lock up your entire computer randomly upon booting, forcing you to restart (you can't even kill the process manually)This is from just, like, an hour of 'playing' the game, too.It's still fun to play a game I spent countless hours on many years ago at launch with the 360, but god damn it Rockstar, how can you mess up a port this badly?If you plan to buy this game on PC, prepare to jump through some hoops and facepalm at GFWL, among other things, a lot.

												{{Short version: There are hoops to jump through at first, but GTA IV is worth the money and the 10-15 minutes it takes to set the game up to play.}}I write this review understanding that this isn't a brand new game, and as such, this review is for people who, like me, are buying this game waaaay after it's prime. Why am I writing this review? Because I nearly found myself dissuaded out of a perfectly good game by reviews that targeted easily bypassed issues.Now, I'd like to begin this by saying that no matter what platform you play it on, GTA IV is still a good game, and a fun entry to the GTA series. A lot of the other reviews for this game note that there's difficulty getting this game to work on PC, and, I won't lie, it's true; there are some hoops to jump through to get this game working. These reviews, however, vastly overstate the difficulty of playing this game, and as such, advise against it's purchase, but don't heed these reviews, the process of getting this game to work takes 10 minutes, 15 tops. Combined with the time it takes to download in the first place, this is totally negligible. Down to it: There are two main barriers to pass before enjoying going bowling with your virtual cousin, Games for WIndows Live, and Social Club, both of which can be gotten around very easily. In the effort to not make this review a tutorial, I will simply say that there exist plenty of dedicated tutorials on the web, especially on support forums and the like.At the end of the day, what you get is a great GTA game, with all of GTA's signature crazy storytelling. I've heard tell that there's a way to still access multiplayer too, and there are plenty of people who have done this. It's the same story here, you have to put a little work in, but then you have a perfectly good game.			"

												For everyone who wishes to play this game:This is a unacceptable game, for the PC. Making a windows live account, logging in, making a rockstar account, logging in, install GFWL will break the game. All the patches and fixes I have tried have not worked. This game is an absolute piece of trash. Hoping to play multiplayer with friends, I come across launcher errors. I cant even get to the game. Launcher. Keeps. Freaking. Breaking. I dont know how people play it, and I wasted 20$ on this piece of trash. Save your 20$ for the xbox or ps3, not PC.			"

												This game is unplayable. There are 6 reasons why I don't like it.1. The amount of accounts that I have to sign into(Steam, Social Club, GFWL)2. The CD key doesn't work. The in game GFWL client says its invalid, Xbox.com recognizes it, but gives me an error. 3. The standalone GFWL client won't let me log in.4. DRM. We have Steam, which is alright, I'm fine with that, and then we have Social Club, then Games for Windows Live, and then freaking SecuROM. I mean, why on earth is it neccessary to have FOUR freaking layers of DRM!? What were they thinking!?!?!?!?5. GFWL, and even more GFWL.6. Because GFWL doesn't work, you can't save the game making it useless.I will be refunding this game as it is a waste of my money, and I'm considering it a lost cause. "

Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Praising● Independent FM. As with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you have your very own customizable radio station to play your own music while exploring Liberty City.● The Video Editor. Unfortunately not many developers provide their players with a tool such as the Video Editor, this tool allows you have seemingly endless opportunities for creating videos and screenshots.● No Weapon Use Restrictions. Unlike its successor Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't restrict the use of your weapons while inside your safehouses or whether you're in a store. Hence, allowing you to shoot anything and everything inside your home as you desire or use it as refuge from the police.●  Forward Thinking Online Modification Ideology. Regardless of your view on Games for Windows Live, the online aspect of Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't ban users for using modifications but instead segregates those who have modified game files unlike its successor, Grand Theft Auto V. Whenever you would like to rejoin regular sessions, simply remove the modified files, replace the original ones or reinstall the game.Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Criticizing● Optimization. Regardless of your hardware specifications or how much you've spent on it, you're going to experience 30 frames per second frame drops while driving at high speeds.Deplorable Digital Rights Management Restrictions● Rockstar Social Club. Without signing into the Rockstar Social Club you can't play online or track your statistics on the Social Club. If you want to remove it, simply remove the paul.dll.● Games for Windows Live. Without a Live account or offline local account you can't save your single player progress. You can easily get around this disgrace by installing a modified version of the xlive.dll. I've linked it below if you would like a purely offline uninterrupted experience.● SecuROM. This revolting abomination limits your installations of Grand Theft Auto IV to 15. If you frequently change your PC or replace most of your PCs parts, your access to Grand Theft Auto IV will be terminated. Those who pirate this product don't have to worry about limited installations.Some consumers don't care about their rights for the products they purchase but most of these services treat consumers worse than pirates. Dispite of the stomach-churning digital rights managment restrictions, I recommend Grand Theft Auto IV if the price is right.| Grand Theft Auto IV Liveless[gtaforums.com] |			"

												Apparently in order to use my save files I have to be signed into GFWL.In order to sign into my GFWL account I have to have internet because there's NO OFFLINE MODE.That means whenever I have no internet, I can't use my save files.This was not a problem with the 360 and PS3 versions of the game.I can go play on my 100% save file on my 360 regardless of whether I have it plugged into the internet or not.This is all because Rockstar, with their infinite wisdom, decided to use GFWL with this game.GFWL causes all kinds of other issues as well, with every single game that uses it. It's pretty much cancer in digital form and nobody should ever use it.Basically, you had ONE ♥♥♥♥ING JOB ROCKSTAR! YA DUN ♥♥♥♥ED IT ALL UP! GOOD JOB!			"

												Before trying the game myself I was optimistic and though that perhaps people just complain a bit too easily about drm's and stuff. But when I installed and tried to play the game the ugly truth revealed to me: The progress you have to go through to be able to play GTA IV was the worst drm bloatware online registeration bug-filled s**t that I can remember. To play the game you have to first notice you can't play without logging in but loggin with your valid user name and password fails. After a hour of googling and s**t you can start the game but notice that the game resolution is set to 800x600 and all other graphics settings are at the minimun. So you go to options to change that. Unforunately the game refuses to change any settings. So you end up googling again how to solve this problem. You find out that the game does not recognize more than 2gb ram so you have to use command line parameters to launch the game - something that Rockstar could have easily updated along the years.Edit: I also want to give honorable mention to long unskippable parts like new game intro, which also cause your computer to go in sort of freeze state if try to close the game manually after accidentally pressing new game.Also, I want to give honorable mention to one of the worst menu navigation I have seen.Excluding above the game is great. Now I just have to keep my fingers crossed and hope the game starts again next time I decide to play it...Edit 12/2016: Apparently there's is new patch that is said to fix many issues mentioned above! Well I guess Steam didn't download it for me since options were still same c**p they were before. I wen't to options to see what happens when I change resolution to something a bit lower and the screen mode changed to windowed and moved partly off screen. I didn't see all buttons so I accidentally started new game. Of couse you can't skip the into so I ended up alt+tabbing and tried to close the game manually. But hey, you don't mess with GTA, it messes your computer so that you can't close the game that just froze and you can't get back to Windows either.Oh, One more thing. When I launched to game today, GFWL installation screen popped up and the only option to choose was to uninstall it. I didn't uninstall it since I though it was still need to play the game. I don't know what that was about.Now should I change my review .. Huumm...Nope			"

												Don't buy in SteamThere's a conflict in the DRM between games for windows live, steam and Rockstar. The CD Key is incorrect in the steam version so you need to go to games for windows and trade the cd key for a valid one. In my case the games for windows live doesn't give a correct CD key so i cannot start the game.the PC version is terribly non optimized, random slowdowns, physics glitches. Geforce Experience suggests low textures even in a i7 and a GTX 660 Ti; while Sleeping Dogs run beautifully with everything in maximum and HD texture pack, Saints Row 3 runs with eveything in maximum and both games looks better and runs smoother than GTA.Rockstar could solve the CD Key problems (look at the Steam forum and in the Rockstar knowledge base, they know there is a problem) and remove the Games for Windows Live DRM.The game itself is a great sandbox game. Play it in the PS3 or in the Xbox 360 cause it's broken in PCUPDATE: After Steam changed my serial number and the proper version of GFWL I managed to get the game running. Still not recommending due the bugs and the effort needed to put it running.now i can go bowling with my cousin			"

												GTA IV is a very sad example of a PC game.Since building myself a new computer, I decided to download it again to see how well it runs.Here's my specs:Intel i5-4690k @ 3.5ghz, OC'd to 3.9ghz, quad core. 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAMNvidia GTX 960 (2GB)Now, you'd expect a seven year old game like GTAIV, even a pretty intense one, to run flawlessly at 60FPS?No such business. While at times I had no issue reaching ~55fps, generally in less intense areas like cutscenes or near trh beach, the game stuttered all over the place in more detailed areas like Roman's house at the very start. This is pretty terrible.Now, I hear tell that GTA IV is probably a prime example of the worst PC port from a console game in existence, maybe besides Saints Row 2. I'm inclined to believe that. Even after tweaking settings and telling the program that yes, I did have a lot of memory and a good graphics card, and feel free to use it all instead of constraining yourself, the stuttering did not go away.Now, all this would be irritating, but playable. The game's certainly still playable, though the stuttering affects enjoyment. The storyline is pretty good, albeit darker and grittier than previous and future GTA installments.The best thing ever:With the demise of Games for Windows Live, it is now nearly impossible to save your game. You must jump through hoops in order to get it to save offline, which means the online community is totally dead. Coupled with the fact that it uses FOUR methods of DRM:- Steam (on its own, not an issue)- Social Club (notoriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥)- Games for Windows Live (♥♥♥♥♥♥ on release, dead now and unusable)- the much maligned SecuROM, well known and unstable.You're gonna have a bad time. Four DRM systems all running at once, coupled with poor optimisation and a shoddy PC port, as well as serious issues with saving the game (it asks you to sign into GFWL, which doesn't exist anymore - you have to use third party tools to even get the game able to save progress) means that I would absolutely not recommend this once great game. It's too far gone to be worth buying anymore. "

												So, I've played this game for only 30 hours, in that time I've finished the whole story, and I gotta say, it's an amazing game, and I really liked the story. It looks very good for the time it got released, I couldn't stop playing. I've finished it within a week. This is definitely worth the buy. I had some problems with the last mission, I recommend you to google it up as I don't really wanna spoil something but that and the Windows Live thing you were forced to use were the only things that were disappointing, so if you like the GTA series and you somehow haven't played this yet, do it now! Now it's time for me to go play bowling with Roman. (oh and play GTA V) Seems like the game doesn't work on Windows 10 anymore, such a shame Windows...			"

												Criminals are an ugly, cowardly lot more worthy of pity and disdain than admiration. This is what you'll learn playing through the single-player campaign in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV. The series cheered (and criticized) for glorifying violence has taken an unexpected turn: it's gone legit. Oh sure, you'll still blow up cop cars, run down innocent civilians, bang hookers, assist drug dealers and lowlifes and do many, many other bad deeds, but at a cost to main character Niko Bellic's very soul. GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama. Every facet of Rockstar's new masterpiece is worthy of applause. 


Can't a guy just eat a hotdog in peace? Not in Gta obviously.

By: Naught




You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern European attempting to escape his past and the horrors of the Bosnian war. He arrives in Liberty City to experience the American dream, only to discover his cousin, Roman, may have fibbed a bit in his tales of success. Starting from nothing, Niko makes a living as a killer and enforcer, a bad♥♥♥♥♥foreigner who appears to have no morals. The longer we stay with Niko, the more we see that there is a broken human being inside, one who would give anything to escape the person he once was.Don't worry, GTA's famed over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humor are intact, but there is a new level of sophistication in the characters and the game world that raises the story above the norm. As Niko becomes mired in the death throes of American organized crime, he begins to become more self-aware. Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic.Watch the people and you'll witness some amazing things. At one point, I saw a woman stopped at a light, looking in the rearview mirror right before she was rear-ended by a man ogling a girl on the street. The man got out of his car and went to the woman, checking to see if she was okay. This had nothing to do with Niko or a single action I took. These were the citizens of Liberty City going about their day. And it was just one moment in a day full of incidents.For the first time in a GTA game, the story is actually a greater draw than city exploration. That's not to say driving around the city hunting for Easter Eggs isn't enjoyable, but the story is so compelling, you may find yourself singularly focused till its conclusion. The wild cast of characters is part of the reason things are so entertaining. The voice acting is top notch and the characters are each immediately identifiable and unique.Past GTA titles have had mild-to-serious framerate issues and technical glitches, because the games were trying to do far more than the PlayStation 2 could handle. While GTA IV is pushing the PS3 and 360 to the limit, it also runs amazingly well. Sure, there are framerate hitches here and there and (particularly on 360) there is some texture pop-in, but it actually runs better than I expected. That a game with great AI, an awesome physics engine and a detailed open world runs so well and with such short load times is a technical marvel. For that, I can forgive framerate issues and some noticeable aliasing.There are more than a dozen multiplayer modes if you count team and free-for-all variations. The bread-and-butter of multiplayer is Free Mode. This is a no-rules game that drops you into Liberty City with up to 15 other people to do as you please. You can invent your own custom games, waste time shooting one another or explore the city. As with almost all of the multiplayer modes, there are loads of options for the match. Turn on cops and each player will get their own individual wanted level. Set the time of day, weather, flow of traffic, weapons available -- there's very little you can't customize. Free Mode taps into the very core of GTA gameplay, which is to run around the city causing mayhem. Only now you can do it with 15 other like-minded individuals.			"

 My solution for getting around the issues:  - Download Games for Windows Marketplace (Type gfwl into Google or go to http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient) - Sign in with your Windows LIVE/Xbox LIVE details. - Once signed in,  leave this application open.  - Launch GTA IV (I've only tried it with the desktop shortcut so far) and select 'Play Offline'. - It should prompt you to sign in to Games for Windows LIVE, sign in (again) in order to save/load. - An update for Games for Windows LIVE may be required. Let it update and lauch GTA IV again.Ensure that GTA IV and Games for Windows LIVE are allowed through Windows Firewall.I didn't do anything to my compatibility settings. I changed paul.dll to paul.dll.disabledNo, nothing is impossible.Yes, this is a dumb issue.			"

												8 years since Rockstar released a patch for this damned game.Before Windows 10 released, this game worked like a charm for Windows 7 and 8, it was rough around 8, but it worked.Then Windows 10 released, the game would not boot. Yesterday night, Rockstar released a patch for GTA IV that would fix the issue on Windows 10, the game no longer requires a login at startup, just click play and go.Games For Windows Live, it still exists, and surprisingly, it still works on Windows 10, Games For Windows Live is completely optional, you're not forced to use Games For Windows Live for single player use, but if you wish to play online, or get achievements, you need to create a microsoft account, and login with that.The game will still try to install Social Club stuff, which is normal, that's just to activate your game and connect to their servers, which is completely normal and understandable. You're not forced to create 2 accounts to play multiplayer or to even boot up the game, which is a huuuuuuuge plus.To summarize this, Rockstar finally did something good after some years, releasing a patch for a better game, with a better multiplayer experience. Props to you, Rockstar, props to you.Side note: Those having issues with trying to play the game (Press play, steam status changes to ""Playing Grand Theft Auto IV"", then it goes back to ""Online""), try uninstalling any mods or mod menus you might have installed... Currently that seems to be a huge issue with everyone trying to play this game, I haven't tested the game with mods, but I might test in the near future.			"

												Probably give a final judgment about the work of Rockstar Games would require pages and pages of in-depth analysis; the variety and the peculiar characterization of every aspect of the game that goes from the manufacturing care of vehicles up outstanding photorealism in the reproduction of social life in this fascinating city leaves us stunned by the size and overall structure surprisingly detailed. And I am happy to reassure by saying that some flaw graphics seen in the surrounding environment will not undermine the fun that Grand Theft Auto 4 will offer.The single player campaign and a mammoth MP to represent in itself a stand-alone game will fall into a world of absolute fun and durable, which will please not only the fans of the historical series. GTA IV is a title that will be surely appreciated by all players Ps3 simply for the fact that whatever you are looking at a video game in ""Liberty City"" will find it.			"

												It blows my mind that I can't find one coherent patch to make GTA 4 (steam version) run on Windows 8.1 (Have an Asus ROG laptop with Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M, Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU @2.5Ghz). I have about 40+/- browser tabs open with different/conflicting advice how to troubleshoot this game, and keep on making minute progress until reaching another error that either forbids play, crashes the game, or freezes my whole system. Rockstar makes so much money, it's absolutely inexcusable that they sell such junk. I have already spent 5 hours trying to make their game playable and have decided I'd have an easier time picking up a new programming language by tomorrow or hand solving a couple differential equation problems in complete darkness, than play this game tonight (without handicapping the online component of the game with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mod). Based on this experience I will not buy GTA 5, unless GTA 4 is refunded  or patched, and the future PC title is discounted at least 20% for those who couldn't get GTA 4 to work.			"

												This game hits home for me. It's almost like I am Niko Bellic. You know those Top Gear shirts that say, ""I AM THE STIG"" on it? I need one that says, ""I AM NIKO BELLIC."" Niko and I share some common traits. We're both Slavic. We both have a good taste in automobiles. We both have cousins. We both have bad taste clothing. And anytime we find a girl, they usually end up being spies for the authorites. I will admit that I didn't immigrate from Albania or wherever he's from. But still, you can see the resemblance. The story was very immersive. That's about it. You play as a Slavic dude and shoot people. That's it. SPOILER ALERT: People die, and especially the ones that are on the sidewalk because you're too drunk to realize that you can't drive after taking an absurd amount of gummy bear vodka shots. I will also say, that the multiplayer for GTA IV is way better than GTA V. I don't want insurance, or the ability to have my own house. I can get that in real life. I just don't have the money. Overall, I give this game 8 half-finished bottles of vodka out of 9 hammer and sickels.			"

												Before I start this review I just want to say I highly recommend this game if you buy it for the console, but for the pc/ desktop it is one of the worse games I have ever had. With the pc version there are just way too many bugs and issues with the game that make it unplayable. Here are just a few that I can name off the top of my head.1) When I started playing I could not access the phone Roman gives you on the second mission, which resulted in me having to restart the game and try the mission several times just to get the phone to pop up.2) Also on the second mission the car that has the loan sharks that is supposed to pull up after Roman calls you doesnt show up half the time, which again resulted in me restarting the game/ mission.3) The map itself would just randomly dissapear and Niko would be walking/ driving on air. I figured out this was because of the game not being able to keep up and load everything. This was partly due to my computer, which should not be a problem at all considering I have an Asus Republic of gamers laptop with a intel core i7 and NVIDIA Geforce GTX 765. I have been able to play every other game I have without map rendering issues at all. 4) Missions wouldn't activate when I walked into the marker. 5) Crashes. The game would crash on me randomly without any warning or anything and I could never figure out what it was that caused it to crash.Again if you really want to play this game I recommend getting it for a console because this really is a good game, it just sucks for the pc. You can try it if you have one bad♥♥♥♥♥pc or desktop, but I wouldn't. Hopefully this helped you make your decision. "

												EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ON SALE - DO NOT BUYGTA IV is the worst PC port I have ever played in my life. Confusing, as GTA V is the best PC port I have ever played. Long story short, this game is broken. It seems they're trying to milk every last penny out of this game. Upon launching the game, I couldn't play online and my resolution was locked to 800x600. Pretty crappy as I know my R9 280 is capable of running this game (Which launched in 2008) at 1080p, max textures. Even though it seems like a steal, the game is horribly optimized and you'd be better of spending your money elsewhere. PROS- It's GTACONS- You can't play it, unless you want to sign into 5 different accounts and spend the best part of 10 hours trying to fix it and then have it crash on you. "

												All in all, this game isn't too bad. I've put quite some hours in it and it probably still was worth its money - especially because I bought it during a sale - but I still felt really disappointed by it, having played SA a LOT when I was younger, and it was so good and omg iv is here let's play that and relive the good old SA days! Nope.What IV did wrong was going too realistic, especially on the graphics, they are really grayed out and boring, the sunny days feel more like a cloudy day, a lot of fun aspect was taken out, such as taxi, firefighter and ambulance missions, and one thing more:The performance. It's hard to talk about because PCs vary wildly, but all in all, I have a decent enough pc - can't run everything on high but switching to low makes every game playable. Except this. Everything as low as can be, but still about 10 fps.To conclude this review, it's a decent enough game if you want to have SOME fun, and don't care too much about raging at the lag, the realism, and... the GFWL. I could have recommended instead of not-recommended, but I feel like I said more negative than positive things about the game so I decided to go for not-recommending instead.			"

												I have never had this many problems with any game.Steam says I spent 1 hour for this game but it was all spent on trying to fix things.Problems I have encountered so far:1) I couldn't count the number of accounts I had to login. 2) This game says my VRAM is not enough and doesn't let me change resolution (I have gtx980ti). (I know there is a solution, setting launch options but is it that hard for Rockstar to fix this?)3) I downloaded GFWL from Microsoft website. I thought it would be the latest one. I was wrong...  An in-game update is required and at the end you need to quit game to continue updating. 4) YOU CANNOT QUIT. I had to restart my computer 4 times just to quit. I could never quit in a normal way. When you try to quit, a black screen appears. Guess what, you also can't close the game using task manager.  This screen prevents you to see other windows, the only way to quit is restart.5) GFWL, GFWL, GFWL6) GFWLSo I couldn't even play a minute. I have no idea about in-game things. I have never thought I would see something worse than UPLAY. After having trouble with this game I think UPLAY is good enough.			"

												after several sessions of installing and uninstalling the game, of hours spent trying to get it to work, i had finally found a workaround allowing me to play EFLC and GTA IV - games i bought twice, once in retail and once on steam.then rockstar patched it, removing the ""play offline"" button of the social club launcher in the process and it won't launch anymore.instead of removing those ridiculous anti-piracy measures they made it even more impossible to play the game, paradoxically making pirating it the more convenient option.can't say anything bad about either the main game or any of the two episodes. the whole biker setting of ""the lost and damned"" wasn't my cup of tea, but it was still a decent game. ""the ballad of gay tony"" was amazing (and in my opinion with a little more content it could have been a full-blown entry to the main series instead of an afterthought to IV).still: i can't recommend it in its current condition as it won't launch anymore.

 The Game It's arguably the best GTA game ever.It's got a huge modding scene, which adds tons of replayability and customization and you're way less likely to be banned for enjoying singleplayer mods than you would be if you were playing GTA V. There is a whole bunch of ludonarrative dissonance throughout the singleplayer but if you can get over it the story can still prove to be enjoyable, though to be fair there are a handful of filler missions, nevertheless if you've enjoyed any of the other GTA singleplayer experiences I can't see why this would be the one you wouldn't like as much.When it comes to the actual gameplay itself, everything is pretty much par for the course. The graphics have aged fairly well, the colour pallet consists of mostly de-saturated colours used to portray Liberty City's griminess and from time to time you may notice that some textures aren't as high-res as would be ideal, but thanfully there are mods to fix all of that if that turns you off. The soundtrack is what has come to be expected of any game from the franchise, and as such consists mostly of licensed songs which you can listen to on the radio while you drive around Liberty City. Here is a list of them [www.gta4.net]. Driving around is fun, though vehicles have less traction than they did in other GTA games and the game's physics are comically exaggerated, so if you are driving around on a sedan at 31 miles per hour and you happen to hit a tree get ready to see Niko Bellic's best impression of a slab of beef getting thrown across a football stadium. The combat is tight, the weapons are diversified. and you can go on random killing sprees whenever it tickles your fancy. What's not to like? The Price TagOn average, people take about 28hours to finish the singleplayer story mode (according to 400 players polled by howlongtobeat[howlongtobeat.com]), and in my opinion that alone is enough to justify the 20$ price tag on GTA IV, though perhaps you'd like to know that when on sale this game can be bought for as little as 6$ which incidentally was what I paid for it. The PortSadly this game uses 3rd Party DRM and as such cannot be family-shared on Steam, on the other hand, the software it uses was, in my experience, mostly non-intrusive and the Games for Windows Live bullcrap can be removed by installing this nifty patch[gtaforums.com]. If you notice any performance issues I urge you not to dismiss them, most can be fixed and the patches are usually really easy to find via a simple google search. I know that it should be up to the developers to make sure that their games run smootly but sadly thats not always the case, thankfully the game has been polished to a mirror like shine by modders, you might have to get your hands dirty to get it running properly, but it shouldnt be too hard. In my case I just had to remove Windows Live.To Conclude  this is not a TL;DRGet it, try it, patch it as much as necessary, enjoy it. Or you can get it, write it off as a ﻿ｓｈｉｔ game because of how poorly optimized it is without the patches that you were too lazy to look for, and never experience GTA IV because you're too stubborn.

Yeah, sure, there's other games that contend for the title of worst of all time on here, but at least you can play them. This game...this game is a joke.

I recommend it for mature gamers that prioritize story over gameplay and not ridiculous things such as an empty map, three empty caricatures for protagonists, or a story trying too hard to entertain like a certain overrated sandbox game I know. Then again, that's just my own silly personal opinion.			"

												At first I was hesitant to buy this on PC due to all the reviews of poor optimization but now that I have it I don't see what the big issue is, I'm able to play this fine on Windows 10. All I had to do was download GFWL and sign in. FPS is normal as well, some drops in high density areas but I also have on MSAA x16 and traffic density at %75(no mods).Best campaign storyline out of any games from the GTA series and Niko Bellic is one of the best protagonists in any video game.Compared to GTA V, certain aspects of gameplay are a lot more grittier and realistic. Driving is a lot less arcade-y, if you're driving a big 4-door car or SUV, it drives like a boat because that's how it would be in real life. Unless you're driving a sports car you won't be travelling the corners as fast. Car crashes, vehicle damage and vehicle ejections are all more realistic than GTA V. Cop chases are more difficult to get away from. There is even squeaking from the suspension as you bottom out a vehicle when you get air, something GTA V decided to leave out.Fist-fighting is a lot more realistic, instead of being able to drop an enemy in 3 normal punches, it takes 5 or so unless you do a powerful combo.Graphic wise, it's not that far off of GTA V. You can easily tell GTA V is the more beautiful game graphically but GTA IV definitely holds it's own for a game from 2008.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV greatly blends a real-life criminal simulator with satire of the American culture and view of life, however, as you advance deeper and deeper in the game's realistic part you begin to wonder: was all of this necessary?Let me begin by furtherly analyzing the above: the game starts and you are Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant who, after repeatedly hearing from his cousin Roman about how great life in America is, decides to go live in Liberty City (a fictional New York) to find a better life, while also having his own secret motives, that reveal themselves later in the game.""It's the land of opportunity!"", as Roman points out many times in the game, but is it really? Is everything so perfect as Roman describes it? As the story progresses on we find out that this utopia does not exist and only the few get to really realize the dreams of their lives, pretty much like in the rest of the world.This motive is played really well in the game, pretty much like in all the previous games of the series, but even more so, thanks to its added realism.Speaking of the latter, GTA IV manages to improve in mainly two fields, compared to its predecessors: Graphics and Realism.The graphics are great, after all it's the game that began the transition of the series in its HD universe, from the ""cartoony"" 3D universe of the previous games. The city feels very nice, with the weather occasionally changing and a miniature world unfolding every day, with very realistic behaviors from the people inhabiting it.The car models however are the true beauty of the game: the shininess they emanate, especially the racing ones, makes you really feel like you are watching an HD movie, instead of a video game.The added realism, on the other hand, at first really catches your attention as it pushes the limits far more than any other of the series' games attempted: you can now watch the TV, with so many fictional programs that it would take you many hours to see them all, while all the same you can browse the internet in the game's fictional web, but with so many real-like sites (from daily news and food ads to... pοrnο websites!) that it makes you realize that Rockstar did a lot of effort to make the game feel more real than ever.Among other things, you also get a mobile phone this time, with which you can contact people you meet in the game (either friends or girlfriends) and engage in all kinds of activities: bowling, darts, pool, eating, drinking to the point of getting drunk (and getting chased by the police, should you decide to drive personally, while feeling nauseated by the hangover induced shaky-cam), go to stand up comedy shows, cabarets and, last but not least, strip clubs!The famous heart shaped health which you found in the previous games in random spots in the city is now gone and instead you have to find hot dog stands or restaurants to replenish your health (or, of course, get a good nap in your designated houses) and the badge icon that lowered your wanted level is also absent, since this time you have to actually evade the police and hide from their radar range for some seconds, to get rid of them.Even stealing the cars feels more realistic, as the main character now smashes the windows of parked cars to enter them, or points a gun to the drivers of moving ones.To conclude, you can also dress your character, like in some of its predecessors, to make the game feel even more realistic, but thank god they removed the ""going to the gym to get fit"" part of the game, present in GTA: San Andreas.With all that in mind (and many other real-life simulations the game has, but I feel don't need to be described, but played instead) you initially feel in awe with what GTA IV offers and how closer are games getting to our lives, but as the story progresses you begin to wonder: is all of this necessary? Do I really have to socialize with the ingame friends and engage in various activities (even if there are rewards from said socializing), wasting my time instead of getting ahead with the missions and story?At a certain point I realized that Rockstar went too far this time: I play games to escape reality, not to find myself in a second one. As such, the more time I spent in the game, the less of these ""social"" activities I took part on.In fact, graphics and realism were the only parts the game improved compared to the rest, since the combat mechanics and car models were mostly the same, or even less... I'm looking at you, Rhino Tank, which was scrapped in the name of realism (truly a pity, driving it was one of the most fun parts in the other games)!The game even has the now famous ""moral dilemmas"" with which you have to choose whether to kill a character or let him live (to kill another instead!) and subsequently set in motion a different turn of events each time, which I found to be OK, not bad, but probably unecessary for the likes of a GTA game, where most of its characters are far from saints (heck, even normal people with flaws, far from it!). The revenge motive plays a lot in the game too (again, not so successfully as in other games in my opinion, like Bioshock), while the game's protagonist gets to work with or against many types of mafias and mob bosses: Russian, Albanian, Irish, Chinese Triads, Gangstas and, of course, Italian (only the Japanese Yakuza was absent).The ending too, feels a bit sad and doesn't deliver the same closure the previous games had, that's realism for you.The radio stations are, of course, present here as well, though I did not find most of the songs as catchy as in GTA: Vice City (with few exceptions: Ruslana's eurovision winner song, Wild Dances was great to hear), so I got to prefer the custom station instead, Indipendent FM.Some easter eggs are there too (check inside the Statue of Liberty look-alike, if you don't believe me!).I truly enjoyed the foreign accents of the various characters by the way, especially the angry taxi driver that Roman sent you again and again, realy funny guy.There is also an online multiplayer component, but I didn't get even close to trying it, I'm not quite sure it's still active anyway, especially now with GTA V's appearance.To sum it all, GTA IV is a great game, with beautiful graphics, many jokes and references to the American way of life, loads of awesome action (as per tradition) and a nice story, however the continuous need to improve the way the game simulates real life went too far this time and ruined part of it.Hopefully GTA V corrected this part, all I hear is praise after all... with that said, we've reached the end of this review (quick, wasn't it?). If you managed to read up till now I hope we'll catch up again in the next one, when I complete GTA V!Until then... game on!			"

												Let me just start by saying that I replayed GTA4 using the ICE 3.0 graphics enhancement mod, and ohmigod, does it make the game look gorgeous. It's not quite up to the standard set by the sequel, but it comes pretty damn close (well, most of the time; some of the textures and the shorter draw distance knock things down a notch). In some areas - particularly the AI animations - the game is noticeably superior. Not bad for a nine year old game.The gameplay is pure GTA, with all its strength and weaknesses. The huge open world is wonderfully detailed; more so, in my opinion, than that of GTA5. The vehicles control as terribly as ever, and the combat is middling. But it's the scale and variety of the world far more than the gameplay that was always the draw of the franchise.The satire and humor, on the other hand, are decidedly sub-par; too biting and nasty to be enjoyable even for a Rockstar production (even for the guys who made literal murder-simulators with the Manhunt games). I did quite enjoy the early parts of the game which focused more on Nico, the protagonist, and his relationship with needy cousin Roman. Nico is a truly broken person and the developers managed some surprisingly deep and satisfying characterization, making him equally loathsome and pitiable at the same time. Unfortunately, the latter half of the game degenerates into broad stereotypes with increasingly fantastic adventures, and this early magic is sacrificed for cheap jokes and over-the-top action cliches. I struggled to play the game to the end.Still, revisiting Liberty City in all its newly-found high-res glory and following Nico's wounded journey through the city's dirty underside - at least in the beginning - was a welcome return to one of gaming's classic titles.

The game booted up into an 800x600 window. I went into the settings to fiddle with the graphics, but it wouldn't let me. Turns out my computer ""didn't have enough VRAM"". Well that's what it said, turns out Rockstar had failed to realise that computers with more than 2GB of VRAM exist. So I had to edit a configure file restricting the game to 2GB of VRAM, annoying because my R9 280X has 3GB.			"

												I loved this game since the very day it came out in 2008. Got it on console before I owned a PC. once I built my first PC my life was instantly filled with joy by all the mods that were available for this game. ENB mods that made it instantly look like a 2016 title and made it look even better than GTA 5. So many options with the trainer, great mod community, just overall made it a lot of fun. But this was all ruined this last year when GFW decided they were going to release a new patch. now my game won't even start up. I've tried unistalling it completely and deleting all of the files, but it didn't do any good. Seriously so upset by this. How can you ruin one of the best games to ever be released? GFW seems to always feel the need to stick their nose in places it doesn't belong. It almost seems as though everytime a great game is released; they need to go and mess it up beyond repair. Would absolutely LOVE to give this game a good review, but I just can't. Not until these issues have been resolved.			"

												Worse than GTA 5 in every way but until that's released on the PC, this will have to do.There's something magical about the GTA series that transforms peaceful adults / children / pensioners into murderous psychopaths. There are hundreds of well thought-out and diverse missions to complete, though let's be honest- nobody really cares about them that much. The real magic with GTA happens when you explore the city and get side-tracked by something small that quickly escalates into a 4-star police chase with dozens of casualties. I can't help myself, and I don't know anybody who can!The gameplay is clunky and the graphics are blocky, though the sheer scale and ambition of this game more than compensates. The PC version is a fairly lousy port. You have some additional graphics options but it isn't well optimised and you have to log in to 3 THINGS before you can play the game! (Steam, Rockstar Social and Windows Live). At its launch it was also horribly buggy and I lost many a save from stupid game crashes and corruptions. Most of that is now sorted out, so there's probably not been a better time to play this game whilst waiting for the far-superior 5th instalment to be released.No other series can come close to matching what the GTA series pulls off. Although controversial, the game has a sense of humour and is surprisingly likeable for a game that wants you to kill lots of innocent people. Perhaps it's because the game can be played so peacefully. You can slowly drive about while listening to the hundreds of music tracks on offer, playing occasional games of pool or bowling. You can go get drunk in a bar and stumble about (probably the best use of the free-form animation system, EVER) or you can go and watch a comedy act. It's a living, breathing city where death and destruction are only ever seconds away.			"

												I have played over 1000 hours in non-steam versionEpic crime drama set in fictional version of New York (Liberty City), tells a story about Niko Bellic who just came in from Serbia seeking for the american dream that his cousin Roman told him about, apparently it's all lies crime depicted in this game is dark and gritty forget hollywood-action movie styled gangster personalities. The game itself also filled with present day pop-culture, political satires and parodies you could laugh to yourself while listening to the radio or watching the TV show and the ingame internet.     The story line itself is comparable to 5 stars quality movie, as the player gets involved with the story of modern day balkan immigrant Niko Bellic as he travels to Liberty City seeking refuge from Serbia and his past. Throughout the way, the player feels sympathy and passion for Niko as he goes through love, hate, revenge, and all the modern emotions in real life with GTA IV. Liberty City of course based on New York, there are some familiar landmarks where epic shootouts take place in the game. The game is worthwhile just for the storyline and all the interesting characters alone that are involved with Niko's criminal activities in Liberty City.GTA IV has great story, and one becomes rather fascinated with all the characters towards the middle part of this experience. So before playing the newly released GTA V, take a step in a few years and play a game that truly revolutionized the GTA franchise, IV.Pros:+Great story+One of the best voice acting in video game+Good Soundtrack +Great ""dark"" vibe+Realistic physics engine (Euphoria Technology), still better than Watch Dogs+Video editor, great for movie making+Modding of courseCons:-Games For Windows Live (no explanation needed its pure sh*t)-Console port, need a good pc to run in good settings-(For some audience)Slow paced gameplay, dont expect Michael Bay-esque gameplay-Clumsy controls great animation thoughScore: 92/100			"

												Before I begin I want to clarify for the ""Not recommended"" vote.The GTA series were always about having fun, reliving film/tv tropes and poking fun at everything, even the game itself.GTA IV was like a bucket of cold water after experiencing the GTA 3 series/arch.A grittier and realistic approach coupled with unrelatable characters/plot, three different sign-in services, a lockdown on easily modifiable content and technology-over-substance mentality made this game become vaguely entertaining rather the hits it's predecessors were. Not to mention that parachutes, airplanes, customization garages, tanks, tattoos, haircuts were removed, all for the sake of realism.I could have overlooked all the previously mentioned issues if it wasn't for the most infuriating feature in this game, the driving.You had a better chance at surviving an attack from a grizzly bear while tied in a burlap sack than you had of not sliding into a wall during a high speed chase, cars wobbled more than the double-chins of a portly patron at the all-you-can-eat buffet, road friction would convince you the pavement was made of teflon. Supporters will fanatically defend the new driving mechanics, but I saw it as taking the Auto out of Grand Theft Auto, whenever I needed to get anywhere I'd call a cab.Seems Rockstar realized their mistakes and reverted these issues on GTA V.I played this game a lot, and will probably continue to do so thus this may make me a hypocrite, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a GTA fan who loved the GTA 3 series.P.S. Keep in mind GFWL is kicking the bucket in 2014, and Rockstar hasn't issued any statements regarding updates (which many other developers in the same situation have addressed and resolved), GFWL is latched like a parasite to this game, especially the multiplayer.

It's also very unstable and will often crash (especially when changing graphical settings). I have reinstalled it three times, and it has given me different problems on each install. On the most recent one, it crashed 2 times, and then hard crashed on it's third time, doing possible damage to my machine. I have since uninstalled it and will not go back.			"

												I originally bought this game for the 360 prior to purchasing it months later for the PC. When it first came out, I was sorely disappointed. The amount of ""realism"" in the game is a stark contrast to the more zany antics of the GTAIII series. GTA to me,  was always in a gray line between wacky environments and clever humor intergrated with a serious story. It worked perfectly. While the humor and memorable characters are there, the gameplay itself comes off dull, sluggish, and boring. Many of the features, while interesting at first, eventually start to feel like chores.When the PC port eventually did see a release months later in 2008, it was a complete mess. It was the prime example of a rushed non-optimized console game ported over to the PC. While many of the optimization problems have been fixed, there are still many others that do exist to this day.Modding is another issue. It's severely limited compared to the GTAIII series. Most of this has to do with GFWL (see below), as Microsoft has complete control over almost everything because of the GFWL system.Another issue, and rather the biggest problem, is the DRM love triangle that's been plaguing this game since day one. If you buy it, you have to install GFWL and Rockstar Backstage pass. GFWL was the nail in the coffin for many potential games that came out in the past 7 years  Compared to Steam (even during its hectic years of 2003-06), GFWL service was probably one of the worse and buggiest software clients i have ever installed forcibly on my computer. Thankfully, GFWL is rumored to being shutdown by July 2014, so the possibility of Rockstar bringing the full experience over to Steam is there, be it in a dim light. However the death of GWFL is like the birth of Chinese democracy, or the release of Half Life 2: Episode 3. where the reaction isn't one of cheer and hype, but rather a jester of ""about god damn time"".  The bad news however is that the multiplayer or any online required feature is apparently skewed until further notice as GFWL is cutting down the various services.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008 and is a departure from the gameplay and style of it's predescessor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Grand Theft Auto IV is actually the Eleventh title in the GTA series, and features Nico Bellic, a Serbian military veteran who travels to Liberty City to start a new life with his cousin Roman. As Nico begins to settle in he finds himself working for a loan shark, Roman is indebted to and eventually kills him. Nico is then recruited by other powerful figures in the Liberty City underworld and quickly begins accumulating power.Grand Theft Auto IV is a fun game to play, but differs from San Andreas in the way it looks and feels, making it a little weird to get used to if you have played the previous games in the series. The voice acting is pretty good, the story is interesting, especially with the Downloadable Content such as; The Ballad of Gay Tony. Though showing it's age, Grand Theft Auto IV is still fun and worth playing if you are a fan of the series.			"

												DO NOT GET THIS!  This game is horrible for PC!  It requires you to log in with your Rockstar Social Club account, Windows Live account AND your xbox account!  I had none of those.  It says you don't need to sign up for single player?  Cool!  Except it's a flat out lie!  So I signed up for Rockstars Social Club since that seemed to be needed.I start playing, the camera does not follow the car, so every turn you make, you have to move your mouse to adjust the view.  Worst possible camera I've ever seen in a game... sigh ok, lets keep going.  Do the intro mission and cutscenes.  Ok the game is asking me to save... 'You must be logged in to save, log in now?'  What?  I already signed up... Ok login again I guess.  NOPE, WINDOWS F-IN LIVE pops up!  Log into that to save?!  WTF!  Okay... raging now, lets do it.  I go to sign up, not only do I need to have a windows live account, I HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR AN XBOX ACCOUNT!  I'VE NEVER OWNED AN XBOX! WTF!  So fine, I create my THIRD ACCOUNT to be able to play.  Finally, go back into the game, enter the log in for the last account.  WINDOWS LIVE NEEDS AN UPDATE!  SAVE YOUR GAME AND RESTART!.... uhhh, go into the game.  MUST LOG IN BEFORE YOU CAN SAVE!

During installation I had almost every bug and error this game has to offer.First problem: it doesn't use your dedicated video card memory if you have a good video card.Second problem: you have to make an account with rockstar if you want to safe your game.third problem: you have to manually install the latest xbox life market.and last problem: after 3 minutes in game, it asks for your CD key for windows LIVE, I use the CD-key steam gave me and it doesn't accept it.Rockstar knows all this problems but doesn't want to fix this in a patch. Also you need 3 acounts to play this game, thats not very user friendly.After 4 hours trying to repair the bugs I just asked my money back (played it for 20 minutes, 3 minutes in game)Is this a good game? No idea, never had the chance to play it.If you want to fix all these problems, good luck. I just take my money and buy a different game. "

												This game, despite it being over 5 years old, is still one of the best games that Rockstar has ever made. It has endless replayability thanks to the modding community. The graphics can be made to look at least 10x better than some AAA titles that have come out in 2013. You are able to change the game in such as a way that you can more or less design something that is unique every time you play. Although the game is not without its flaws, game saves are link to one machine and can't be synced thanks to Games for Windows Live, extremely difficult to join a friends game and not end up disconnected and the worst one by far is the ridiculous amount of DRM protection on this game. Although if you remove GFWL you can at least launch the game quicker and save to a much easier to find location, this is also useful if you to play on another computer as you do not have to start the game from scratch. Aside for those, it is still one of my all time favourite games.			"

												This is a nostalgic game for me and I used to enjoy it very much. However, this game falls massively on functionality and performance. It was very badly ported to PC to start off, and since Rockstar never repaired the game after Games for Windows Live shut down, the game is rendered unsavable and Multiplayer cannot be accessed even after the fix (this is not an issue as Rockstar shut down Multiplayer regardless). Also, if you are a fan of dull, flickering textures then this game is for you. Don't forget the unforgivable lag on high-end PC systems.Looking past the appauling amount of technical faults that this game has, I still enjoyed the plot of the game very much, and I think that the variety of things you can do and access is creditable. Just don't expect much content in terms of weapon types, and unlike GTA 5 there are no weapon or car modifications available.To conclude, I think that you're infinitely better off getting this game on console, as you will be able to void the bad performance, glitchy textures and the inability to save without a fix (which you can find on the Steam forums thankfully). I was one of the unfortunate that bought this game only months before the GFWL termination.			"

												Before I give my summary, let me go over a few things.YES:  This game has compatibility issues in windows 8 and 10 due to Games for Windows LIVE.YES:  This game requires the command prompt in order to use all that your graphics card has to offer.YES:  You need a number of accounts to run the game online (not a problem for me).NO:  This does not mean that this game sucks.  These faults should not degrade a game completely, especially when there are workarounds to these faults.--GTA IV tells the story of Niko:  a serbian/russian immigrant who meets up with his cousin Roman in the big apple, only to discover that all the glamour his cousin told him:  the women with big ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, the fancy sports cars, the luxury penthouse, turned out to be a lie.  Niko inevitably ends up having to help his cousin through difficult times, discovering that his cousin has issues, as well as ties with known criminals.  As he continues to help his cousin, he delves deeper into the crime life, all while trying to make life work for him and his cousin.Overall, this game has quite a lot to offer even in its somewhat aging state.  You have various story missions.  And you also have hangouts that you can do with Roman and friends (obvious bowling joke here).   You're also faced with choices throughout the game, which may or may not affect how the story goes long-term.If I'm honest, though, there are faults with this game.  I feel that the devs tried too hard to make the driving physics in this game ""real"".  In Liberty City, life is a journy of 3 and 5 point turns.  Braking is squeaky & clunky, made even worse when it rains, but I guess that was expected with driving pieces of utter trash throughout Liberty City.  In fact, the only time you feel like you're actually moving with speed is when you get ahold of a sports car.  As for biking...  well, that's a totally different story that's just as bad.Another fault with the game is that it isn't graphically impressive anymore.  Stacked up against GTA V, this game seems to have followed a trend in 2008 where almost every game was 50 shades of brown, occasionally broken with a blue filter.  Overall, its just not gonna woo people over anymore..--My verdict:  This game has its problems, and it's gonna take some getting used to, but in the end, its worth getting the game up and running for the story it tells.  Its Rockstar doing what it does best.			"

												A fantastic game... the only catch is that it doesn't feel as fun as Vice City and San Andreas. The fun, humor and charm have been yanked out for the most part. Realism > Fun. Everything looks fantastic, but its a lot of shadows in Liberty City, making it tough to see at times of day. There are a ton of keys to use on your keyboard and again it just doesn't feel as fun or easy as previous games. It is still a desirable game, just buy it when it goes even cheaper.			"

												Pros: Good game, played a lot on the Xbox.Cons: On Windows 8 its junk! It is the most annoying thing ever to set up! With the windows Live crap and the game not allowing me to use my graphics settings! Wait for GTA V then buying this.			"

Note: I got the physical copy for this game in winter 2008 for the PC, and have been playing since then.GTA IV, the follow-up to GTA San Andreas. As a kid, I was very excited for this game. It looked amazing, I watched the Trailers over and over again. I was hyped. Was the hype worth it? Hell. Yes. After I got the PC to play it, that is.Gameplay, World and Story:Good:» Shooting feels very impactful and fluid.» Amazing gun choice: Melee, Pistols, SMGs, Shotguns, Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles, Throwables and a Rocket Launcher.» Good AI. Enemies take advantage of cover and pedestrians react realistically to the player's actions.» Exciting police. Shootouts with the police are very fun, they even pathfind into interiors.» Cover system. Cover behind walls, benches, trashcans, cars, etc. just by pressing one button.» Amazing physics engine. Pedestrians and player fall over realistically, it feels impactful.» Good driving physics. Now this point might be a bit controversial, but I personally like how floaty the cars are.» Three different islands to unlock and explore.» Several Story-Choices with varying impact.» Loads of activities you can do with Niko's friends: Bowling, pool, darts, drinking, etc.» You can call your friends for a favor. Want a car bomb? Want to lose your wanted-level? Sure.» Multiplayer is still functional and is very fun.Bad:» Your friends call you up every 5 minutes to ask to do an activity. Not accepting can make your friend deny any services.» No option to do activities (like bowling) with other players in freeroam Multiplayer. Would've been a nice touch.» Open world not as varied and large as San Andreas' world.» There are no planes like in many other GTA-Titles.» Story sets off very slowly.Misc:Settings:There are lots of settings to tweak. Resolution, shadow quality, view-distance, etc. No anti-aliasing option unfortunately, but it can be enabled via driver; Make sure you use something else than MSAA (as it's not supported), like FXAA.Performance:This game does not perform that well. Even on modern PCs it likes to dip into the 30s. Tweaking the settings correctly is important (I recommend turning on Vsync on fast systems, it fixes a lot of stuttering issues).Modding:While not having official mod-support, the game has a HUGE modding-community. There are mods out there that allow you to play as super-heroes or as a police officer. There even is a first person mod (I'd like to think that this mod actually inspired GTA V's official first person).Unfortunately the newest patch broke all script mods. You will have to downpatch your game, or wait for an updated ScriptHook.Summary:Despite the game's flaws and it missing many features compared to it's predecessors, the game improves so much on what the previous titles tried, that it has earned it's place as one of the best GTAs in my opinion. I even think that it feels more fun to play than GTA V. I can only recommend you try it.			"

RATING7/10GOODGrand Theft Auto IV is a game that revolutionized Grand Theft Auto series in terms of graphics and gameplay features. This is one of my favorite games in series, just because it made a huge difference from the previous games in series, it has great story, excellent characters, Niko is simply amazing, and fits perfectly in everything, cousin Roman and his bowling calls - AMAZING! If you're looking for game and want to spend money but want it to last at least 50-60 hours this one is for you, I didn't finish it on steam just because I finished it before, so that's the reason I got only under 20 hours in-game. So to conclude it's not a perfect classic like GTA San Andreas, nor GTA III but it's really worth playing. Do I recommend this game? Yes, it's worth the money, but I'd really like to recommend you waiting for the sale and get it then, since steam charges a lot for such an old game, yes it's still great to this day but it's little bit too much, so wait for sale.BADNow to the bad side, this game really suffers from opimization issues, you'll get frame drops every once in a while, even the most powerful PC's are struggling from these issues, because it simply won't utilize grahics card power at all, once it does your game is over 100FPS if you have a decent graphics card, but most of the time you'll be stuck around 40-60 FPS which isn't as great as constant 60 or 60-80 FPS, it's not due to PC specs, it's simply due to optimization issues, before it got udpated to 1,0,4,0 back in the day it was even worse, frame drops on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems were pain in the a$$. So, this is a great game in general, but it lacks from optimization and technical issues.			"

												Well, what can I say? I can't even play the game because of Social Club. Selecting the option to play offline does nothing either. Once you click it, nothing happens. I'm not sure why this is happening. Even launching the game from its local files doesn't work. Apparently, this is a known issue that's existed for a few years now. I wonder why its never been fixed though? I highly recommend against buying GTA IV over Steam. Trust me, it isn't worth losing your money over. Now I know how that feels...*UPDATE 6/1/15*  In order to get the game to work, you need to download the X Liveless mod, which disables the need and use of online functions (Social Club, Windows Live).  However, because Rockstar shut down their servers for GTA IV 2 years ago, that shouldn't be a problem.  My stance on buying the game is unchanged, however.  Players shouldn't have to download third-party content just to get the game to work properly.  If you're looking for a clean, working install of GTA IV, I suggest buying this game separately (from Amazon, etc.).			"

												First of all, you may not agree with me or with everyone else who doesn't recommend this game. but not recommended review always try to be honest with everything in the game, not just ""Cousin! let's go bowling"" upvote.let's get started.my laptop spec is 8gigs ram, 2.4GHz i5, NVidia GT520M OC. I can play CS:GO & Dota 2 for 50-70 fps, Tomb Raider for 30-40 fps, and many other at decent graphic and fps. It's old computer, I bought it in 2011.And if you think (and I think too) that ""maybe i can run this game for sure, my sysreq is good for GTA IV"", you're totally wrong. this game is not optimized for PC, and you will have so many issues with this GTA IV PC version.the first of all is graphic issue, if you don't have a powerful machine, my suggestion is to skip this game. you'll have a serious time about setting up graphic, tweaking your pc, defragment, playing with registry and many other files, just for to make this game playable. again, playable, not enjoyable.and like everyone else whining about the 3rd party drm, GFWL, i should too. GFWL will make you even have a hard time just to play this game. - GFWL is not compatible with windows 8.1- and yes, CD KEY Invalid still here, steam isn't behind this, if you have problem with CDKEY you must contact GFWL just to activate it, kinda manually.- I don't know why, but maybe just me. I install my GTA IV at my desktop PC via steam, just like many other games i have. and i can't login to my GFWL account, just for this game. I'm searching this problem on google, said SecureROM is behind this. so apparently, steam will allow you to install game to any computer you have as long as you login with your account. but not with this GFWL, GFWL restrict me to have many ""copies"" of GTA IV at my own computers.- don't make me mention that GFWL is ruining the online gameplay, yes, for now, you can't play online. if you just want to play singleplayer, well its not issues for you.I'm not going to say that it's not worth your money, $29.99 is worthed much for a good game like this. but what i want to say is, it's not worth of your time, to think that i spend money for this game and what i want is just.. simplicity. click install, and play. but not with this game..

Games for Windows live, constant framerate issues with a large variety of different computer setups and crashes make this game a large pain in the rear for many people.

												Let me just say, I have played a lot of bad games; I have played a lot of good games. I have never felt compelled to write a review for anything. This game -- I have played it on the ol' Xbox. It was fun. I am a PC gamer though, so I dl'ed this on steam. I have never spent so much time trying to get something to even run in my life. Between the integration with Microsoft's Games for Windows Live and the♥♥♥♥♥♥box of a port -- this game is totally unrunnable. I have a monster machine (16 gigs of RAM, a nice dual video card setup from NVidia, 6 core i7) and I cannot get past the first few minutes of the game. It freezes and crashes whenever I take any action in game and will work for just long enough to infuriate me into believing I have finally fixed it. Honestly, Rockstar should have payed me to do this because every hour I have logged in this game is just me trying to get it to run. Total crap. Don't buy it.			"

												One of my favorite game right now, i really enjoyed playing this.Even it was soooo long, it wasnt boring, so story was great (only at the end i gets same mission, find someone, kill someone and etc.)Unfortunately, i completed gta4 after gta5 (because my pc was so bad for gta4 and i played gta5 on my old xbox 360).Car physics even better then in gta5 xD.There's one big problem, its GFWL(But i disabled it with patch, and its works fine). Also optimisation is not good, I have 35-60 fps on my gtx 1060, but i think its because my old amd athlon II X4 635 :\(but ofc its was playble). And its in 2017, i can't even imagine what it was in 2008.So my score is 9.5\10.I had glitch, when after i completed this game, one of my dead character called me and we played bowling XD.

												Grand Theft Auto IV was released April 29th, 2008.The PC was later released December 2nd that same year.In this game, you play as Niko Bellic.  An eastern European who just recently came to America to stay with his cousin, Roman.  Roman told Niko, via emails, that he is doing very well in America.  Owning mansions, luxury sports cars, and so on.  Shortly after arriving in Liberty City, Niko finds out that most of the things his cousin said about his life in America to be false.You find out Roman actually lives in a small crappy apartment in Hove Beach, which is a small eastern European community in Liberty City.  His cab business also resides there.  Since you (Niko) already went through the effort of coming to America, you decided to help your cousin with his cab business, and help achieve the American dream.This game takes place in Liberty City, a fictional post 9/11 New York City.  Rockstar's take on this is very well done, with iconic buildings able to be seen from the very beginning of the game.  Of course, you can't quite visit those landmarks yet, since the bridges are closed due to a terrorist threat.The city is brought to life with the citizens that reside in it.  With the interactions the player will experience, both in story and in just normal free roaming gameplay, you get that feeling that the city is still in fear of an attack.  With the police blocking off the bridges, to pedestrians overreacting to things and claiming them to be acts of terror.  As well as this games take on Homeland Security, the National Office of Security Enforcement (NOoSE).I recommend this game for its immersive city, story, and lore.  Pick it up, if you haven't already, and enjoy the experience.If you’re a cheapskate and don't want to spend the twenty dollar asking price, wait for a sale.  It usually drops down to about five dollars.			"

												Oh the joys of being a criminal in an open world environment. Grand Theft Auto IV is a game that brings you the engrossing story of Niko Bellic, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars. He moved to Liberty City to live with his cousin, Roman, with two goals: revenge and money. This is a game that beat my expectations, as an old GTA fan, in almost every single way. It has a vast amount of things to do compared to its predecessors (i.e. hang out with friends, do many side missions, customize your phone, watch shows/TV, get in-game achievements, etc) contains top notch writing and gameplay mechanics, and an incredibly thrilling multiplayer. Get this game and live the American dream, it's that simple. 9.8/10.0 "

												As of 25DEC2014, this game no longer works.  For anybody.  It requires Games for Windows Live, and that has been shut down.  Normally we would file a class-action lawsuit against Steam for still selling things like this-- which can't possibly work, and they know it-- but Steam updated the EULA a while back, and you have theoretically signed away your rights to file a class action lawsuit.Unless, of course, you happen to live in the European Union...

It's best Grand Theft Auto but sadly, it's the only one with ♥♥♥♥♥iest port on PC.Another game, same story. One game -sorry- one masterpiece game, it's glorious on consoles -and even PC gamers jeaolus because console have them- and when the time comes, that game released on PC but it have a lot of problems.Oh, also updates are not helping. Lots of players disscuss the ""1.0.4.0"" update gives a better performance and quality. You can downgrade the game and play, i've done it on Windows 7 with no problem but Windows 10 won't allow it somehow.And Good'ol Windows game thingy. No one loves you m8. I can't register game on GFWL because it not allows my key, keep saying same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hey Bill Gates, Games For Windows Live is a mistake. Just like Windows Vista pal.Some mods can improve performance and quality, it's confirmed by me. I have stable framerates with iCenchanter. Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can help me more, it gets rid of GFWL. But the RGSC still stay. It's not too bad, but it's Outdated af.Even after all, i'm still playing after beating game twice. If you can't handle these, you should grab it on a console. It's worth it. It's better then Grand Downgrade Auto V. Really, you can just compare what they have, and GTA IV should win. Even it's has a ♥♥♥♥♥iest port ever.So, last words. If Rockstar gave this game a shot again and make it remastered -it's so popular these days- please remove that GFWL, RGSC Launcher (Not RGSC, the launcher is the one with brain problems) and make a better optimization i can give a full game price again.It's your cousin, lets go bowling.

In my opinion it's worth the effort you have to put into this to make it going. There are many good guides in the game's threads so you can easily solve the problems around the game.I don't really would like to get into details about the game itself, because i think most of you know this masterpiece.So don't get scared by the lots of negative reviews.

												Worst port I've seen in a game. Seriously. Windows 7 Ultimate, Can run BF4 on 120 FPS smoothly and I cant run this with no mods. 8 Times I have Bluescreened, 3 of them. Not GTA's fault. I had to Defrag my hard drive. I bluescreened. I've spent 3 hours on trying to get the game to work. What happened? I had to run it on windowed mode. Yet it still happened. Instead of that, My taskbar would dissapear and my computer would automatically restart. No, I dont have any viruses on my computer.   After a while I finally got the game to work. Full of pop-ins, more than enough. Constant freezes. So, I thought I would install the reason I wanted to get GTA 4, LCPDFR. Guess what? BLUESCREEN.Wait for GTA 5.			"

Well, as long as you can deal with these problems.PS: I know some players have not experienced such bugs. I don't care: if I did, someone else may experience them as well. So I'm giving Rockstar a thumbs down until them address these problems.			"

												Most of the reviews I've seen here are possibly coming from idiots who doesn't know how to fix their game.Notably the problems that most people are having right now is about the dreaded Games for Windows Live that Microsoft doesn't really care anymore.You have to put a code in GFWL otherwise not only you can't play Multiplayer but it won't let your save files and whoever came up with that idea is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. What's worse is that many users complained that the code that comes with IV doesn't even work.But that can be easily fixed with the use of a tool called ""Xliveless""; for some reason, Steam censors that word but it's perfectly safe and it allows you to bypass the annoying GFWL Code Authentication/Login.I used a magic trick to make Steam Filters unable to censor that word in case you wondering why it's not replaced with hearts.You can download Xliveless here: Download Link[gtaforums.com]However, if you really want to play GTA IV's official multiplayer mode then I heard that using GTA: Episodes from Liberty City's activation code instead would actually work.Aside from that - GTA IV has been poorly optimised, giving users with low FPS even if you are using an high-end PC.But once you're able to get the game playable then I'm sure you will enjoy this game a lot better than playing on a console since you get to play with mods such as LCPDFR, Simple Native Trainer, Tsunami, ENB/Graphical Enhancements and many more.I recommend this game because it doesn't feel right that this game's User's Reviews score is ""Mixed"" just because so many dumbasses doesn't know how to fix the game.You should buy this game if you have a brain that has a good mindset of fixing things while having a PC that could run this game with more 20-30FPSOtherwise, purchase this game on a console instead.And last thing - here's something that could help you get better performances in this game:I heard that downgrading the game from 1.0.7.0 (the current patch that Steam is using) to 1.0.4.0 would give you more FPS as well as able to get the game compatible with certain mods that are only playable on 1.0.4.0.Just read the instructions here: http://www.gtagaming.com/forums/showthread.php?t=128300Now unfortunately, you can no longer buy this game on Steam currently since it ""ran out of keys for the game"".Could this be our chance? That Rockstar Games/TakeTwo Interactive would fix the issues for the game while stocking more ""keys""?Or will they just let the game ""unbuyable"" since they no longer support it.			"

												Avoid this game at all cost.Dont buy this even on sale. This game does not work on Windows 10 despite all the efforts.And you know what? Downloading this crap and fixing it is a waste of time. I can see now why the rating of this game on Steam is very low.Social club is broken. Multiplayer is dead. Also, getting this game to work is not worth it.EDIT: If you managed to get it working, well, play it! I heard that the storyline is pretty good.If you're using windows other than Windows 10, then you can try your luck by buying this game and trying it out			"

												What a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥this pc port is. Dealing with games for windows live, finding a solution for being unable to change the video settings because your gpu is above 2gb vram, and the game itself running awful on modern gpu's. I was never able to hit 60fps on max settings while playing because the game didn't use over 50% of my gpu and cpu.However i was able to put up with all of those issues because the game itself is great. A great world with a great story. The cover based shooting feels a bit stiff and dated now but its still fun and the driving is still good. I will still always prefer the gta 3 trilogy though, they are just more fun to play but there is no denying that this is still a great gta game.8/10 (Great)			"

												It's crazy to think that Grand Theft Auto IV is now a staggering nine years old but don't let that deter you from trying or revisiting one of the finest open-world games in Rockstar's phenomenal library. It is the first entry into the now present HD GTA universe (moving on from the classic trilogy before it of GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas) and you return to Liberty City in all it's beautiful glory. You play as a Serbian named Niko Bellic who journeys to America in hope of making a better life for himself and meeting up with his cousin Roman who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Without giving too much away for first time players, the storyline is captivating and there are tons of missions and memorable characters along the way. You will join Niko on a road to personal redemption and for the first time you can decide what choices to make (there are even two different endings) The main theme is also so epic and one of the best in GTA history IMO and it really draws you in at the beginning.The combat feels very satisfying and fluid with a range of different weapons at your disposal: melee, rifles, pistols, SMG's, shotguns, throwables, (such as grenades and moltovs) machine guns and a rocket launcher. There is also a new cover system which you will come in handy during intense firefights and is very easy to use at the tap of one button. The A.I. is very realistic, escaping from the police is more of a challenge than in previous titles and the physics engine is a welcomed change (although some players might prefer the feel of the vehicles in the previous GTA titles) Pedestrians and the player will fall over much more realistically in comparison to older titles with the ragdoll like physic system. In terms of size, GTA IV is quite big with three islands for you to unlock and explore. You have numerous activities you can start with your friends by bringing up your phone (bowling, *enter Roman meme here* darts, pool, visiting the strip club, getting something to eat, drinking, etc) Some of these even come with unique favours once they like you enough such as car bombs, weapons, removing your wanted level for you, etc. The multiplayer also still works very well which is a blast.There aren't too many negatives but I guess if I had to pick one, it would be that your friends won't stop calling you at times to hang out and that can get annoying although you can switch your phone to silent but it needs to be enabled to progress the main story missions. There are sadly no planes but you can get helicopters. The map of San Andreas may have been a bit bigger and more varied but you'll find the HD version of Liberty City to be a living, breathing and wondrous place. It's certainly came a long way since the gritty, gloomy feel of Grand Theft Auto III's Liberty City.In conclusion, this is another *must play* Rockstar game. In my opinion, it is my second favourite GTA (narrowly being beaten by Vice City) and Niko Bellic is one of the standout protagonist's in the series history right up there with Tommy Vercetti. I want to add that this game can struggle to run well but if you stick to your recommended settings under the graphics menu you should be fine. If you find your FPS is low, tweak/decrease some of the options there to help out. Mine dipped here and there but for the most part it runs quite smooth and my PC is a pretty good but by no means an amazing gaming rig. You might need a Games for Windows account to play this. I see some are giving negative reviews for that but for me it was no hassle whatsoever. I just linked my XBL and Rockstar Club account and I was away.Just as a heads up, there is a well known bug on the final mission without spoiling anything. I fixed it by going into the graphics menu and making everything the highest it could possibly go and this fixed the problem. I then switched it all back when I got pass that segment of the mission. Hope this helps anyone out there!			"

If you have 30 dollars USD, then buy Grand Theft Auto V. It's a better game in more ways than one.			"

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  Decent game but easily the worst one in the saga (Niko, my cousin!), it’s also a terrible console port. Remember games for windows live? It’s here and it will annoy you to hell. Want more? It's your lucky day because there are other issues with GPUs, OS, etc.  If you are patient enough you'll probably get it running but only after trouble shooting for a couple hours and even after that there is a high possibility it won't run as well as you might like. My game never went past 45fps no matter what graphical settings I played on (mind you, my current rig is more than enough to run GTAV at 60fps with everything on max)I frankly cannot recommend this game unless you want to take your chance as it could run fine or not run at all. Español:  No es mal juego pero es el peor de todos los GTA. La versión de PC se encuentra además muy mal optimizada pues tendrás que lidiar con games for windows live, problemas con sistemas operativos recientes, problemas con la gráfica y un largo etcétera. El rendimiento es muy variable, en mi GTX980 no logre que me diera más de 45-50fps sin importar settings gráficos. Sólo recomendaría comprarlo si por algún motivo no has jugado GTAIV y te pica la curiosidad.			"

												Hey Niko! Let's go bowling! - RomanIs a phrase you will be hearing alot as you play as Niko Bellic, his cousin. Fresh off the boat and wishing to start a new life in America, you will kill, steal and intimidate your way to the top of Liberty City, leaving nothing in your way.Story: The story in Grand Theft Auto IV is very intricate. You start off with basically nothing but the clothes on your back and your cousin Roman, who is a struggling car dealer with lofty ambitions of fast cars, women and lots of money. As you complete each mission, you are greeted with a range of very interesting characters from the weed smoking Little Jacob to the balls to the wall crazy bald-headed Brucie. These characters have great chemistry with Niko and I found myself really wanting to play more to delve into this dark and twisted world. As you play through the game, the missions become more creative, intense and harder culminating in an epic finale. (The main campaign took me around 25 hours to beat).Graphics: For a game released in 2008, the graphics still hold up today if not looking abit murky. The textures are high definition but I often found myself wanting the game to use a brighter colour palette rather the the dark colours Rockstar have used. I guess the game's look is reflective of the dark nature of the story. Sound: All the characters have defining personalities and this is attributed to the superb voice acting. In particular, Niko and Roman's voice actors really sell their characters and give them much needed charisma and presence. The radio stations are great too, with a wide range of music playing and funny radio personalities often talking. The sounds of cars are good though I would have to criticize the fact that most of them sound like vacuums.Gameplay: I haven't played GTA V so I will base the gameplay of GTA IV based on its predecessor San Andreas. The controls are much improved this time round, with a newly implemented cover system that makes gunfights alot easier, accessible and less frustrating this time round. However, I believe that controlling cars and Niko himself have gotten worse this time round, often feeling floaty and imprecise to move about.All in all, Grand Theft Auto IV is a solid game with an enticing story and memorable characters that will not let you put your controller (or keyboard and mouse) down.8/10.

												I always liked GTA series. But this game pretty much ruined it.First you have to fight with Rockstar Social Club, everytime you launch the game. Then there's Games for Windows Live, that was also obviously put in there only to make life of paying customer miserable. After you get through all this, you'll only discover, that controls react weird, melee combat is absolutely horrible and the way police works sucks too. NPCs are annoying and needy, and obviously have nothing to do, except for annoying you to go play darts with them. The only thing I like about the game so far is story, let's see how long that lasts. But in overall, this game is great example proving that piracy should be legal, because asking 20 bucks for it is almost like stealing.			"

												(All of this can be fixed so don't worry, iam just pointing out how ridiculous this thing really is. So you can still go and buy the game just read this, and if you don't want to go through these problems then consider if you want to really buy the game, or not. Also keep in mind that you will need to create 2 accounts, and i know that it's not that big of a problem, i just wanted to point it out,because i didn't in the review and iam too lazy of fixing it.)This game is not the worst GTA ever created, but the networks arround it are. And i have few things to say about them:No.1: SocialClubWhen i launch the game it opens a social club window where it says that i don't need an account to play singleplayer but when i click play offline nothing happens. So i try to sing up but it says that the email is invalid even tho it's obviusly not (just to clear things up i can sign up to the rockstar page). Eventualy i figured out that you have to click the play button 3 times to proceed (it might be just me, idk).No.2: More bullsh*tSo iam past the bullsh*t that they call the SocialClub and i finnaly get to play. Just that i actualy don't, iam waiting for it to launch and it takes almost forever. So then i decide to open my steam, and what do i see ? that iam not playing it anymore. So i launch it again i click the play button 3 times but still nothing. So finnaly i decide to restart my PC. I start the game up, click 3 times on the play button (yes... again) and this time the game actualy launches. So i'm like ""yay i finnaly get to play the game.""No.3: Settings (not realy)After the game finnaly decided to launch the setting were set to the lowest so i decided to change them to the highest (obviusly), but the problem is: it didn't let me. I was trying to change them but every time i cliked it just changed back immediately. So then i tryed to restart the game... again. clicked the button 3 times (you know how it is by now) and the game launches. And guess what, still can't change the settings.No.4: The wrap upDun't buy this game. Unless you want to spend a lot of time getting it to work (it's pain in the a*s, but it is possible to fix. Which doesn't change my thoughts about it. You shouldn't need to find tutorials on how to install a game is what i mean to say.) And if you want to play older gta (not GTA V) then buy San Andreas, it's right here on steam so i guess that makes it easy.And if you want to buy this game or already bought it here is a guide on how to fix all of the stuff:

A Guide for Grand Theft Auto IV
By: CaptainTenneal

			 How to get your game started quickly.  Collection of fixes for problems with:    SecuROM  Windows Compatibility  Social Club  Games for Windows Live/ Game not saving  Graphics Settings/ Out of...		


Don't worry i know it's for windows 10 but it will work just as good for any windows, you will just have a different layout.I would just like to say that even tho there is a fully working guide that helps you fix all the stuff. There is still the thing that it should not be a problem in the first place and the guide is not even from rockstar it's from a very kind guy which only proves the amount of f*ck rockstar gives. So that is why i don't recomend this game.			"

YOU DON'T HAVE TO, YOU CAN MAKE A GUEST TO SAVE YOUR GAME. This game is my all time favorite GTA and it is worth the money. I have felt so much nostalgia playing this.			"

												8/10Of course, it's a waystone you cannot miss. The most of Rockstars GTA games feels like beginning and the end of all parodies and wannabe sandboxes at one's time. Gameplots, mechanics, subsequential and miscellanious stuff - all sandbox developers imbibes and adopts every sip of that astonishing game series.But, hereafter, with GTA4 you have one-time-through game. Storyline so dense, so alive... and weird for the most of us, that you need only one look at it. Vice City or San Andreas was very different, there was much more fun for returning in game in three-four years after the first time. Even knowing it's teens-oriented, even with all that PS2-level graphics I'm still adore San Andreas most of all Rockstar series...Okay, back to GTA$! Oh, sorry, GTA4, I mean. It's cool. And ""Episodes from LibertyCity"" are cool as well. But... They all are grim. Even horrid sometimes. And the worst part is that you (most of you) don't really like your protagonist. He's proficient, even wised up guy, okay. He had a hard start, that's okay. He's a psycho killer, fine, every main GTA-guy goes like that. But besides all of that... there are big hole with vacuum. It drains emotions out of Nico Bellic, out of any of his companions, activities. It drains YOUR emotions, so you don't know how to get excitement out of this game. One-time goer, for every opportunity in game. No more!Until mods came by, of course. But not for long again. GTA 4 is not a hit, not a brilliant of any kind. And those damned DRM protection you need to work out... Very soon this game will become completely obsolete, comparing to new games. All hails to GTA5, that is!			"

												This is the best GTA game I have ever played after GTA SA. The story is so immersive that I stopped playing other games. The characters had so much emotions that you would care about every character in the game. Graphics are still good and were the best in 2009 but Rockstar really messed up with the PC port. Game was badly optimized, aiming is difficult because it was made for controllers, glitches, bugs, running poorly on good PCs and the worst thing is Windows Live. I couldn't log in and had to look on the internet to remove in completely because it was so annoying and couldn't let me play the game, also had to install patches to optimize the game and started to get 90fps on high settings. Without Windows Live and bad optimization, this game would be better and most people review this game negatively just because of it. In my opinion, GTA IV has a better story than GTA V... probably the last best story in GTA games, looks like Rockstar stopped caring about singleplayer when GTA V came out.  I don't know if multiplayer is still alive. And people should stop reviewing the game negatively just because of Windows Live... you can remove it and play the game without any problems, well... you will need to install a patch from Rockstar to fix the fps issues but that's not a problem. Worth to buy this game even when it's 20euro on steam.			"

												After playing this game on my xnox 360 it was fun and I had one of the best experiences with a game. Now when I first opened it up I had to download games for windows live and so I did. After opening it and angry with windows live I just skipped those steps. When the game finally loaded I was in a new game. Normal driving Roman to the apartment. So I pressed on the gas on my controller (I was playing with an xbox one controller) and WOW THE LAG. Now I thought this was due to my computer so I kept lowering settings till I got to the minimal. Now my computer can run Skyrim on Medium settings with no lag at all. So I went and read all the reviews for this game and its a normal thing to have a poor frame rate. Also considering buying San Andreas but that game has problems.			"

												COMPLETED DATE22-Dec-2016 SETUPWindows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadRATING (rated as if released in 2016, some aspects may suffer from outdated technology)Optimization : CStorytelling : AGraphics : CSound : AControl : C Fun Factor : BBang For The Buck : Wait for saleI always get mixed feeling after completing GTA games. GTA-series always have great story and comedy, memorable characters, great voice acting, memorable action scenes, and great open world with details here and there. But I never like the combat and driving mechanic. Not to mention if you fail a mission, you have to restart from the beginning, driving the same road, listening the same talk, etc. Rockstar never bothered to change these since the games sold billions anyway and so here we are with GTA4 that have the same awful combat and driving mechanic as the previous games. Overall, this is still a fun game to play. I (Nico) was dating one of the GF, took her to a club, got drunk, driving her home in my yellow Lambo, and instead of getting a ""hot coffee"" from her, I got arrested for DUI instead. Seriously, have you ever been arrested for DUI in a game before? If you haven't, then in this game you can.PS : If you have modern PC with multi-cores CPU, the final story mission are buggy. You have to set the app to run only on 2 cores (resulting in lower FPS) to avoid the bug and able to complete the mission.			"

Posted: February 7, 2015
												Most of the reviews for this game seem to have been written shortly after the game came out, or after only playing the first portion of the game. Having finished it, here's my impressions (TLDR: This is about 10% of the game content as you'll find in the two previous GTA games, and most of what is here is tedious and annoying).In the beginning, the game is fun. You drive around a little, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old cars you mostly find are hard to drive but that's normal for a GTA game. You unlock some new clothing options early on, and while they seem limited, it feels like the normal tutorial-style starter shop that only has mostly undesirable stuff in it. After a while, your original people stop giving you missions and basically dissapear from the game unless you go do mini games with them.And that's when the game starts to fall apart.Basically, the game seems to want you to do minigame ""dates"" with the women and ""friend hang outs"" with the dudes. You can befriend several characters and do lots of boring, repetitive mini game♥♥♥♥♥♥with them. Sadly, this is mostly tedious, in large part because the above mentioned part where the cars handle like♥♥♥♥♥♥never gets fixed. The entire game you'll be fishtailing and losing control of every car you drive, never being able to turn when you need to and overturning when you least want to. You'll fight lots of mobsters, criminals, and cops in this game but the real enemy is the controls. This is compounded by the fact that the controls for moving NIco around often leave him unresponsive at the worst time, like when you are trying to escape a burning car. He will take his sweet ♥♥♥♥ing time. He also likes to lie around on his face and get shot in the back by cops. Eastern Europe has some weird hobbies I guess.This might be forgivable if the main story didn't go off the rails about halfway through, where you spend a while getting to know a pretty interesting clan of criminal Irish (including the sister, Kate, who I'll get to in a second). Things seem to be developing nicely with them, until suddenly you find yourself working for a long string of about 8 Italian randos who blur together to the point that I could not tell you which one was which, or why I was ever working for any of them. Nico constantly talks about needing money, but the best payouts are from the missions you do with the Irish. The italians mostly drag you through a series of increasingly stupid plans, most of which involve walking face first into obvious traps.Added on this, the dialog has no branching or control. You control executions only, and that only infrequently, and the only consequence of your choices (except the last one) is that you can get a generic side mission from people if you spare them.Like the game, this review is costing too much effort, so I'm going to cut the budget and let it devolve into a series of bullet points, instead of putting careful thought into each one and fully developing them.- Kate, the Irish sister, is a ♥♥♥♥ing horrible ""girlfriend."" She puts Nico firmly in the friend box and he refuses to accept this fact, always insisting she's going to turn around. There is one way to turn her around to actually getting serious, but if you go down that road she dies almost instantly in a random attack that you can never get payback for. Oh, and if you don't make the choice where she dies, then you get to watch Roman die. Frankly, she was stringing Nico along the whole time so he'd sooth her lonliness, knowing the whole time that she was playing with his emotions, so I was happy to see her go. Nico is better off with hookers because,♥♥♥♥♥♥ at least they're honest.- Every interesting character from the first part of the game is sidelined in the second part in favor of the blandest bunch of Italian shitbags you'll ever meet. The voice acting for these guys is terrible, they obviously blew the budget on the dudes in the first half of the game.- Unforgivable that the driving is so bad that you'll end up taking taxis to almost every mission just to avoid it.- The developers put a toll booth in the middle of some of the bridges in order to make you stop, pay the toll, then continue on. If you don't do that, you have to shake a 1 star wanted level. Either way, you have annoyance and inconvenience. Also, often missions force you to drive across the bridge over and over again. This isn't challenge, this is padding the game out with pointless and tedious obstacles. It is very much like the endless same road encounter from Far Cry 3.- Nico is basically the errand ♥♥♥♥♥ for every gangster in the city, but never ever rises to any power of his own. At no point is Nico giving orders outside of immediate life or death situations, at which point he's mostly shouting ineffectually for flavor. Sure, you don't take♥♥♥♥♥♥from people, unless they pay you, in which case you'll suck anything they put in your path.- At one point, Nico is double crossed. The guy who double crosses him then spends the rest of the game cropping up to ♥♥♥♥ with him. At no point do you have the option to track this ♥♥♥♥er down and execute him until the plot finally allows it, WAY later than Nico would have done considering how his character is portrayed. - TLDR: The first two hours of gameplay are worth about $5. Don't pay more than that for this game. Don't bother beating it, read the wikipedia page to get the details on what happens.			"

												Do NOT get this game for PC. It's a fun game, sure, but only when it works. When I first launched the game I was getting massive frame drops. Now that may seem like my problem but I have double maybe triple the system requirements needed to run this game on a decently new computer. So I looked up the issue and found many MANY reports of the same issue. As well as an options menu that didn't help my cause in any way. After hours of testing and removing mods to help fix these issues I have come to the conclusion that this game is almost completely broken on my end and if you got it to work I envy you. This is one of the worst PC ports I have ever come across and by a major developer working on a major title. I don't usually recommend this but if you want this game buy it on console. Otherwise, I advise against buying this game on PC unless you think your computer won't have an issue or that you can fix the issue. I have given up on it but maybe you can do it. Waste of my money.			"

												The game itself is really good. Had quite a bit of fun. HOWEVER...IT'S AN UNOPTIMIZED PIECE OF CRAP! And it has lots of bugs. It runs at 28 (or less!) FPS at medium settings on my GTX 750 Ti. AT 1360X768! It feels like my old ATI HD 4350 ran this game better than my 750 Ti.Don't get me started on the bugs. My game wouldn't start, it literally closed after the Social Club part. Eventually I had to install a mod that removed GFWL to actually START the game! Also, I got the dual cursor glitch. Seems that this is caused by Steam Overlay.. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, don't buy this game. I literally had a better experience on my PS3 (Only PC game I can say that about..) and on my pirated version of the game on my old PC. The optimization is horrendous and it has a lot of bugs. The game itself is great, but that's not enough to justify buying this game.			"

Fascinating experience.Played for another 5 times. All wonderful game, nice plot, nice graphics.GFWL would not let me log in anymore. Cannot save my game.End up downloading a pirated version.

												Ok. This is going to be a totally honest review of this game. I am going to give my opinions after finishing the single player campaign so be weary for spoilers if you haven't got round to playing this game yet. I have alot of history with GTA IV, Firstly it was probably my favourite game of the last generation (Yes I enjoyed it more than 5) and I spent so many hours just messing around in free roam. When I played it on 360 I never really got into the campaign, Basically all I did was mess around so playing the game all the way through on pc was a new experience for me. Lets begin to recall the start of my time playing GTA IV...With this being the PC version of the game, their was obviously some problems to get the game running. Everyone knows at this point that Games for Windows LIVE is a dead service so if you came here for some insane GTA IV multiplayer then sadly this won't be your game (anymore atleast) But I wasnt here for the online feature, I was here to complete the story and enjoy some big american boobs xD. Little did i know the act of starting the game would take a little effort. When you click play it will open a small window advising you to log into the rockstar social club to access some online features, Knowing that GFWS was dead and the fact that I couldn't be bothered to find my social club login, I ignored this and clicked Play (Offline) The window then closed and...Nothing happened. I waited amd waited but GTA IV wouldn't open. I then went on youtube for 5 minutes downloaded a file from a video description, put it in the GTA IV directory and tried again. IT WORKED. Seriously EVERY review you see says something like: ""Don't play cus it don't work."" but I sorted it out in ten seconds on youtube. PLEASE PEOPLE ATLEAST TRY SOMETHING BEFORE REFUNDING! Anyway GFWL stuff aside. Lets get into the game. Niko Bellic (an immigrant from Serbia) is just getting off a boat to meet his cousin Roman who has been living is Liberty city for some time. His cousins drunk so Niko has to drive. STOP! This is the moment when millions of people round the world said: ""What's with the car controls?, Are they sliding on ice?"" DONT WORRY! The driving takes some getting used too but over time you will enjoy it as it really gives a satisfying sense of momentum. So yeah that explains stuff a little. Lets skip foreward so you dont have to hear the games whole story. Blah blah blah Niko wants revenge for someone who betrayed him in the serbian war blah blah blah. When Niko finds the guy to get revenge on you can choose to kill him or spare him. Your choice but I chose spare as roman said it was the right thing to do. Anyway i enjoyed the story. It didn't have the widest variety of missions but it was fun. Some highlights were: Three Leaf Clover and A Dish Served Cold. I chose the revenge ending. (Not spoling too much here) On the revenge ending you get a mission called: ""Out Of Commission"" MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS BEFORE YOU PLAY THIS MISSION!!! This is the final mission and it involves you chasing Pegorino through a ware house killing everyone. Eventually Pegorino makes it to a boat. Niko takes a bike and follows him across the shore. Soon, Roman and Little Jacob turn up in a helicopter to help. Niko then has to hit a ramp on his bike and grab onto the backup helicopter. THIS IS WHERE SOMETHING WENT WRONG. On screen is an instruction to tap SPACE repeatedly to climb onto the helicopter. Tapping space will change the camera angle and won't pull you up. Eventually you fall into the water and fail the mission. You then have to swin to land and replay the mission only to have the same thing happen. The fix is quite complicated and I'm not gonna go into it. All you need to do is search up a tutorial on Youtube. You should eventually find a good one. Because of this problem I had to replay this mission (Quite a long one BTW) about 6 times with no refilling ammo. I was prepared to call my time with GTA IV enjoyable but this bug turned it into a moderate experience. Besides all the bugs and glitches, The game is still very fun and enjoyable to play. I recommend playing the console version for the main story and the PC version for dicking around and mods. Final Verdict 8/10. For crying out loud people do your research to fix common issues, don't just refund the game. Oh sorry I'm getting a call from Roman, I think he wants to go bowling. Gotta go. Thanks for reading.

												GTA IV is a classic game and certainly a fun story. Niko Bellic has the heart of a G and is a likeable character. One of my favourites next to Lara Croft or Agent Blaskowitz. The game works fine on Windows 10 (2016). I am currently logged into both Rockstar and Games For Windows Live. MANY people are having difficulties with this so here is how to do it properly in simple steps:1-	Install GTA IV via steam.2-	Uninstall Games For Windows Live that came with Steam.3-	Download and install Games for Windows Marketplace Client:  http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Live/PC/DownloadClient4-	Sign in to GFWMP.5-	Create an account and sign in to Rockstar Social Club:  https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/6-	If you are having problems Logging into Social Club make sure you have VERIFIED YOUR EMAIL and also LINKED your Games For Windows Live Account via Rockstar.I repeat: make sure you have VERIFIED YOUR EMAIL and also LINKED your Games For Windows Live Account via Rockstar.

												Do not buy this game. However good you expect it to be, there's a tremendous chance it simply won't work. The forums are full of people who've paid money, can't play the game, and get no support from Rockstar. This is bordering on a scam at this point. The DRM is more extreme than any game I've every played. It requires games for windows live, which was a bad idea even before it started to get shut down. It uses securom which is famous as one of the worst bits of DRM anywhere. And on top of that it's not maintaned or supported to even the most basic level. This was the laziest of ports to start with, and it treates its audience, ironically, as potential criminals. Only buy this if you want to give your money away with little to no chance of getting to play the game itself, especially on windows 8.As to the gameplay, compared to the previous game this is a tedious slog. The best cars handle as well or worse than the worst cars in vice city or san andreas. The story itself is grey, depressing, and lackluster. The missions are so poorly done comedian Dara o Brien even does a bit in his stand up show mocking it. The ending, not to spoil it, is miserable. Just give the entire game a miss and pretend it never happened.			"

												Let's jump right on it! Is the game good? Yes, absolutely. Rich story, great voice acting, good graphics and gameplay.Should I recommend it?: No.Why?: Games for Window Live.I saw the negative reviews all pointing that they couldn't play online, frequent crashes, black screens and all thanks to the multiple DRM that this games has. I though, well it probably isn't ""that"" bad. Wrong. It's was worse than that.There are some guides in the steam forums that try to fix this issues but they are all a gamble, maybe it works for a little bit or not at all. What I really hate about this that there is no official support and they keep pushing the sales like it's nothing happening in the back. Bad move RockStar. BAD.Long story short, after massive reading and trying all I could it wasn't enough to run the game properly. And OMG you even need GFWL to save your game locally. Wow!Anyway, stay away or be ready to crack your head in the forums worldwide to be able to run the game properly.			"

												The PC port isn't that great, but the mods make up for it. If you have it on consoles, i'd advise you stick with it unless you're into mods. It's also under about 3 layers of DRM and runs on 'Games for Windows Live' which isn't great by any stretch of the imagination. With the game itself, it provides hours of gameplay with a pretty good storyline, messing about in Liberty City, and of course the mods. If you can get past all the stupid nonsense that the PC port has, you'll have a blast of a time.			"

However, once you complete the game it does get boring, but the PC version has opened up to a wide range of mods.. including switching to the good side and playing as a cop in LCPD:FR (Liberty City Police Department: First Response) modification. The wide range of mods is what makes the PC version extremely better than the console releases			"

												Quick Review:Technologically Impressive and thematically impressive, but missing the creamy game center.Long Review:    I'll start this review off by saying that I enjoy the GTA series but I am not a super fan. I have beaten GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas at different periods in my life all had a profound effect on me. GTA3 absolutely sucked me in, I had not felt so engulfed in a game until I put GTA3 in my PS2 at the tale end of 2001. Vice City introduced me to the 80's, a decade that I was alive during but have few memories of. San Andreas topped them both by introducing a gangland so cal landscape that was the epitome of free roaming gaming .They were all ground breaking ,fun, and even comedic the but sadly , GTA 4 is alot of hype and thats about it.    If you've read any of my reviews you know I'm a stickler for story and I have to say that GTA 4 is pretty weak in this department. While there are some very interesting missions, the over all plot is so loose and bordering on incoherent that it really hurts the game, especially since the same company was telling better stories on older tech.     The story itself is fairly original, for a game anyway ,in that you are an immigrant fresh off the boat looking for the american dream. Initally I thought that the plot was going to be dramatic and a deep look at the United States from the outside. Sadly this concept is tossed aside for a story that relies on over the top neurotic characters that rely on flat comedy and stereotypical archetypes to carve out a thin plot than a deep narrative that makes you question american values. While there are bits of the latter lightly tossed in, its too bad the game didn't do more in this area.     Another area in which the story was under developed, is the number of characters. While main character Niko is very well done, the other characters are too under developed. Roman, your in game cousin is somewhat developed but is annoying and a moron too. Too many characters are introduced , all of whom we know next to nothing about. Little Jacob, a character I enjoyed in the game was vastly under developed. For all the nay sayers out there, taking a person to play a game of billiards IS NOT character development. Technologically the game is outstanding and I think for this reason alone is where a lot of the reviews gave it such high marks. The impression of the real world being translated into video game form is at its apogee here. The best example of this is the feel of the weapons. Blind firing a shot gun into a person has never felt so good, especially seeing them realistically collapse.     While the story is serviceable but lacking and the technology is spot on , the game aspect is where GTA4 hits its largest hurdle. Everyone knows the GTA formula; Steal car, drive to mission giver, complete mission, repeat. GTA 4 is no different but why fix something that isnt broken? The catch here is that you now have a cell phone that also functions as a quest giver, a quick restart button, as well as a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ While I enjoyed the concept of the phone, the date aspect falters because it is not rewarding, its repetitive, and in the end it just didn't do anything for me other than hang up on the person and not care about the thumbs down they gave me. When it comes to The missions themselves, they are usually ruined by the TERRIBLE characters that give them to you. While most people enjoyed the Brucie character I couldn't stand him. He wasn't funny, his missions were boring, and he was a moron.    About half way through the story you realize that most of the missions are the same as the old games. The combat, like Gears of War, is essentially Wack a Mole. The tech is impressive, but why spend so much money on mediocrity? At the end of the day GTA4 will go down as being a technical marvel that lacked a cohesive story and fun,enjoyably game play.			"

												TL;DR: Bad when relased, updated to even worse. Don't buy.I have had a copy of this game from the time it was made. And it didn't run well the with that old computer. I thought that I will give the full version a try with my now much more powerfull computer. Guess what? It still doesn't work, even with all these patches. I actaully remember it running and working better with that old computer!!!First of all, the game doesn't even let me change settings from low, since it is thinking that I don't have enought vram on my 4gt R9 290. So to even make the game work I need to google and use launch settings ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" to be able to make it 1080p. After that I got to the game only to notice that it has huge lag spikes and very noticeable inputlag (even with vsync off). Just that the game is almost unplayable with hardware that is many times more powerfull than anything when it was relased. Tuning down the settings only makes things worse, with even more lagging and handbrake button magically starting to spin the camera. And then we will get to the business with ""Windows Live"". So you new can't even make safes without Live-account? WTF is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I could make safe on the orginal version without any live crap, so why cannot I now? Just that this game always horribly broken on PC, but the updates have made it even worse. Just don't buy. "

												Nicely done but becomes a little repetitive after a while. There should be more around the story, or more interesting missions than just go and shoot a bunch of people to steal something. Yet, it's addictive and characters are quite developed with clear cut personalities (Little Jacob is AWESOME!).However, after playing for 60 hours, I'm struggling real bad with some missions, after retrying them for like 20 times. No way to skip them, no help, it SUCKS! I'm so fed up to redo the same things again and again and have Nicko not respond to what I ask him to do, ending up dying in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ways ever. I give up. It ruined my game experience so bad that I now hate the game. Well done Rockstar for not putting any save-points for the long missions and force the player to do the same things during 30 minutes every time, again and again, for nothing.			"

So I will just say, I have never gotten so much of a thrill from murdering prostiez in dark alleys, then repeatedly stabbing their lifeless cadavers, over and over and over and over and over again, while watching the corpse twitch and flip upon itself, in ways I never thought possible within a video game.Grand Theft Auto IV turned me into a sociopathic, homicidal serial killer.I'm okay with this, as long as it remains a fantasy within a video game, and not become reality.

(""Hours on record"" grossly misrepresented by Steam. We all await the day some decade-old bugs might be fixed on Steam. I'm sure it will happen as soon as a Valve employee is in just the right mood to fix them, sometime after the release of Half Life 3)~Past all the Rocktard, Games For Windows Dead, Steamin' Pile of Turd, and other delightful quirks and wonderful customer support (""What support?! We dun need no stinkin' support!"")...(A while later, after some cups smashed in anger.)~As I said, past all that (""You done yet? Can I play?"" -- 'NO! STOP NAGGING ME! Sorry, you're not helping. I'm doing the best I can, I just need to trick the game into thinking Games for Windows Dead is Games for Windows Live and Rocktards have a Social Life -- I mean Club.')...(A while later still, after some more smashed dishes, this time over my head.)~As I was saying. Once you get past all that, the game can be quite fun...(A while later, after grabbing a couple of mods and fine-tuning them, making sure the frame rate is as it should be --might need an initial dry run, exit, quit, some forced graphics setting in case GTA IV goes full Rocktard and doesn't recognise your card's full potential, relaunch, reload and a quick test-- then making sure the game doesn't crash and the mods work as intended, the new speedometer is not too big, not too small, and in the right spot, the camera isn't looking left or continues on straight into the Hudson when you turn right, etc. My-my, time sure does fly when you're playing GTA IV. Or trying to play GTA IV, initially. By which I mean doing some of the dev's or the devil's work, since Rocktards can't be arsed to do it. Persevere. Don't let the Rocktards grind you down. There. Done. Hopefully.)~So. After you gently mod the living daylights out of the driving physics ('Let's make these cars handle like cars, not beached whales plopped into the middle of a busy intersection') and the POV / FOV, the 'revolutionary' camera angle invented by Rocktard's Most Wasted Employee of the Month ('Bloody hell, what were these muppets inhaling?!')~Where was I... These interruptions trying to make to game run and behave in a civilised manner, as a game released on Steam supposedly should, are becoming annoying.Right. If you sort out this bloody mess successfully -- congratulations, you are now overqualified for any job at Rockstar North, Rockstar Toronto.(NVM though, you can get a job at Overkill. Nope, even more overqualified. UbiSoft Montreal. Nooo, way too overqualified. Well, crap. NVM, you need to work on your ineptitude. 'Must. Screw. Up. More. Often. And. In. Bigger. Ways!'  First, make a novelty 'demotivational poster' using that motto: ""Must screw up more often and in bigger ways!"" Now you're ready to play. 'What? Used up my free time set aside for playing? Bloooody hell! NVM, we'll pick this up tomorrow.')(The following day.)ReviewGame can be fun.End of reviewWHAT!? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?! The set-up wore me out like a four-hour foreplay, give me a break. I need some of those mythical electrolytes.~""But but but! What makes the game fun, senpai NVM?"" asks little Jenny and Johnny. (What is this, an effing FAQ?)~All right, settle down, 'chirren,' I will give you one simple example. Completely child- and family-friendly.(Maybe not, don't quote me on that, I've never been a model senpai under any name. Tend to chew my charges when I get peckish, then regurgitate fur balls and stuff. Not always as patient as I could be.)~The game teaches wholesome social interaction, the fostering of friendship and intimate relationships with mature pixels, and in general instils a healthy respect for others, along with good family values. (Why are you gasping and spluttering? Jack Thompson's got it wrong.)I'll explain. Using an example. This example grew, like a festering tumour, out of a comment I left on a friend's review. Namely:~""I love how my friends will call me go bowling.""Well, play it some more and it will be the thing you hate most. Needy buggers. And resentful if you say no, say later, or get into trouble and arrive too late.True, you don't need to play the game for that, but so what. Maybe GTA IV was intended to work as a sim in this instance -- The Sims 4: GTA add-on pack. (Called it, you've seen it here first. And that is the true story of why I must hide my true name and identity. Otherwise people would beat my doors down asking for predictions. And for a share of my royalty cheques, 'because we're friends,' supposedly. But I digress).Back to the subject: the cab's not the issue, nor the drive. The frequent calls themselves, which the game can unleash on you, might become an annoyance. The endless stream of nagging, one call after the other sometimes: cousin, friends, girlfriends.Can make you want to stop the car, get out, and just start spraying bullets. Instead, since I'm not a sociopath, I sometimes do go, pick up Roman, take him bowling, let him have his jokes from the Motherland, then once outside, I shove a shotgun in his face and blow his head off...""Your friend has been injured."" I guess so! Next time, think twice, call once, cousin.But that's what keeps the game fun I suppose. You can play it as nest suits your mood, and do the 'no-no,' the unexpected, the socially unacceptable, the irresponsible thing at any time. Things that go against what the game tells you to do, and continue without an ""Oh noes, you injured your cousin! Reload a saved game?""~I left out the best part -- the next part, the follow-up, the 'check-up.' The aggravated assault after the grievous bodily harm inflicted upon your pixellated companion, the aggravated punchline following the punchline.Instead of having to reload the game because you've done something naughty, you can go wreak some havoc, wait for your dear cousin to be patched up after you shot him in the face, and call asking you to pick him up at the hospital when he's discharged.At which point you can decide to be a dutiful cousin, drive to the hospital, stop, get out -- and blow his head off again right in front of the hospital. It's very practical and considerate, what with medical help at hand. Rinse and repeat till he hates you.~Don't worry, he'll still call, he's as slow as he sounds:""Hello cousin! Could you pick me up from the hospital?""'Of course, Roman. I'll be right there, cousin.'*reloads shotgun nonchalantly*This then is the story of Roman as Johnny in 'Johnny Got His Gun.' Always make sure to leave his medulla oblongata intact.~PS.So you don't like this review, and wish to lodge a complaint, do you? Ah well, that hurts my feelings and annoys me. Now you've made me sad. Happy?No worries, I'll find a way to get over it. Tell you what...How about I pick you up and we go out bowling, dear reader?*casually reloads shotgun*			"

Начинается всё с того, что главный герой иргы – то ли русский, то ли себирский парень Нико Беллик. Приплывает нелегалом не куда-нибудь, а в саму Америку в город Либерти Сити. Корабль уже  подходит к порту.В это время Нико, наслаждаясь живописными панорамными видами пресловутой Америки ведет разговор с одним из пассажиров танкера.В своем разговоре Нико рассказывает про своего преуспевающего кузена, который в свое время тоже иммигрировал в Америку и в настоящий момент смог не плохо раскрутиться: дорогие машины, пентхаус, девочки и все дела.Сойдя на землю Нико встречает его кузен Роман на какой то невзрачной машине среднего класса, что уже наводит на Нико тень сомнений о том, на самом ли деле его брат на столько преуспевающий бизнесмен, каким он себя описывал в письмах для Нико. Попав в квартиру своего кузена у Нико не остается ни капли сомнений и занавес спадает. Как оказалось ни пентхаусов, ни дорогих машин, ни девочек у Романа не было. Жил он в обычной захудалой квартирке в далеко не самом богатом районе Либерти Сити. На почве этого Нико ругается с Романом и высказывает всё, что он о нём думает. Ведь Нико приехал в чужую страну только потому, что рассчитывал на деньги своего кузена. А здесь оказывается, что всего придется добиваться самому..Совсем недавно Нико принимал участия в боевых действиях на какой-то войне. В ходе одного сражения весь его взвод кто то подставил, в результате чего в живых осталось только три человека, один из которых – Нико.Цель приезда Нико в Либерти Сити – найти тех двух оставшихся в живых, которые по слухам могут находиться в Либерти Сити.На счет девочек Роман все же не совсем соврал Нико.Роман хоть и не оказался миллионером, но кузена своего не бросил и по началу подкинул ему не пыльную работенку в своей фирме. Отвези туда, забери того и все в таком роде. Благодаря этой работе Нико постепенно знакомиться с криминальными авторитетами Либерти Сити, один из которых положил глаз на девушку Романа.Нико, в отличие от Романа, человек действия. Поэтому увидев тот беспредел, который чинил тот авторитет с девушкой его родственника, Нико не задумываясь хладнокровно его убивает. Как в дальнейшем оказывается, этот авторитет был лишь пешкой, работающей на куда более серьезных и уважаемых людей, на беседу с которыми в добровольно принудительном порядке в вырубленном состоянии и попал Нико.С этого и закручивается весь сюжет игры.Периодически сюжет игры вас будет ставить перед выбором, кого убивать.Будет у вас в игре и ваша девушка, с которой вы так же сможете посещать все эти увеселительные заведения.Причем от того, как вы себя поведете в игре будет зависеть и концовка ваших отношений с этой девушкой, с которой кстати по мере прохождения игры обязательно получиться пару тройку раз переспать.От того, на сколько опрятно вы одеты во многом зависит как быстро вам даст ваша девушка, обычно это происходит максимум после третьего свидания.Правда секса вам не покажут.Покажут лишь вид квартирки с улицы и дадут послушать соответствующие стоны.Даже есть общественный транспорт, в виде метро, на котором так же можно ездить, правда не за рулем.Случайные прохожие могут затеять друг с другом драку или перестрелку.Предлагается шмалять все с тех же пистолетов, УЗИ, дробовиков, автоматов, в числе которых старый добрый АК-47, снайперских винтовой, гранат, коктейлей молотова и гранатометов.Появилась возможность подбирать с пола камни или кирпичи и швырять их например в витрину магазина, или случайного прохожего.Система боя приобрела приятные новшества.Можно прятаться за углами зданий в процессе стрельбы, перекатываться, кувыркаться и прочее. Все эти действие неминуемо сопровождаются соответствующими поворотами угла обзора камеры, что выглядит весьма впечатляюще.Как и в предыдущих версиях, в GTA4 вы сможете владеть собственными квартирами.Гаражей в квартирах не предусмотрено, зато предусмотрена ваша личная стоятнка у подъезда квартиры, где можно сохранять честно украденные из автосалонов крутейшие иномарки. В квартире имеется телевизор, который можно смотреть.Графика, как и музыка в игре просто отменная.Машины бьются со всех сторон, быстрее всего бьются фары и перестают светить, разбитые капоты открываются и отлетают от сопротивления ветра на скорости.При ДТП вы легко можете вылететь из салона. Моя оценка 9.3/10 Нико Белликов			"

It's almost a parallel world.The PC version brings enough additions and improvements to the fundamental GTA IV experience to make it an essential purchase for anyone who hasn't played it yet.			"

												Edited: Updated June 22, 2016If your like me and my friend who came from the PS3 version of GTAIV and wanted an ""upgraded"" version of GTAIV than this is definitely it! Yes, this game is old but its still one of those games we will never stop playing and still have fun with. Being able to play this game in full 1080p 60fps is amazing, (again... coming from the PS3 version) to me and my friend, it felt like a remastered GTAIV experience.Here are some things you should know about this game in order to get it working properly:1. Make sure you do not have Windows Firewall or any Xbox related services disabled (it will prevent you from updating Xbox LIVE)2. If you have trouble logging into Social Club such as the dreaded ""failed log-in"" problem (the prompt of Social Club log-in before the game starts), close the game application and go to:Your drive letter may be different if your downloading games on a seperate HDD, be sure to change the letter to the correct drive letter of your steam games. ---> C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto IV\GTAIVThis is the main directory of the game. locate the Pual.dll file and delete it.Next, follow these steps: (this is a sure way to get the game working, me and my friend has tried this and has worked for the both of us. Credit goes to Codeine_Inferno for coming up with this fix)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Post by Codeine_InfernoFound a fix for Windows 10, not sure if some of you are still trying to play GTA4 but I`ll leave this for anyone else who experienced the problem.!! TIP: If you're a Win 7 user: Try using the same steps while using Compatibility mode for Win XP SP3 instead of Win 7 as menioned below. 1) After installing GTAIV from Steam, download & install Games for Windows Live client from here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201134 2) Right-click on the GFLW client installer and go into Properties; make sure its set to run in Compatibility mode for Windows 7. Then proceed with the install. Open GFLW (making sure it runs in Compatibility mode for Windows 7) and check if it atleast lets you login with your LIVE credentials.3) Go in your GTAIV game folder and rename ""paul.dll"" to ""paul.old"" (this will temporarily bypass Social Club login in order to allow you to register your GTA4 on LIVE). Also make sure your ""GTAIV.exe"" is set to Windows 7 Compatibility.4) Start GTAIV the usual way (using LaunchGTAIV.exe), you should be able to get to the main menu. Once in the main menu, click on LIVe. This will hopefully bring down the LIVE dashboard, login with your LIVE account and follow the instructions & allow LIVE to apply updates.5) After LIVE updates itself, exit the game. Now, download the GTAIV game patch from here: http://updates.rockstargames.com/patches/gtaiv/title_update_7_EN.zip Once again, make sure the installer is in Compatibility mode for Windows 7, then proceed.6) The patch should update and create a new ""Paul.dll"" in the GTAIV directory. Attempt to startup GTAIV normally now. If RGSC still refuses to login, follow additional steps. If not, enjoy!7) IF YOUR RGSC STILL DOESN'T LOGIN:Backup your ""Paul.dll"" file, then delete it. Login to Steam-> Library -> right-click on GTAIV -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Cache. Steam will re-download ""paul.dll"" for you. Launch GTAIV thru ""LaunchGTAIV.exe"" and your RGSC login should now work. 8) The login may not work next time for no specific reason. I got tired at that point and renamed ""paul.dll"" to ""paul.old"". This skipped the RSGC login yet still allowed me to login to LIVE and MP still works (I can create games, yet I haven't found any or tested if my friend can join yet)Let me know if this works for you as well and maybe we can get this to other Win 10 users.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If your having isssues setting the graphics setting on GTAIV, then go on Steam and go to ""Library"" and click on ""Games"". Next, right-click on ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" and select ""Properties"" and on the ""General"" tab, select ""Set Launch Options..."" and paste this line in.-nomemrestrict -norestrictionsThen save the changes. Now launch GTAIV and you should be able to change the graphics settings. Enjoy :)			"

												This game has unfortunately one of the worst PC conversions, ever.Wherever you touch, you will face with a problem.Rockstar's Social Club is a nightmare. You will feel exhausted after multiple attempts to work things done. When you feel you handle the Social Club, then the disaster comes with your graphics. No, I mean even if you got the latest GPU, you'll be getting low frame rates, sturdy game engine etc. Please buy yourself a Playstation 3, if you really want to play this game.  "

												The few dollars I spent on this game were a complete waste.I only wish I saved the money and bought a chocolate bar instead, cause the amount and time of satisfaction I would have gotten while eating it would still be longer than my gameplay will ever be on this game.It doesn't even start.After I bought it and tried launching it, this rockstar games social club login popped up.Then I entered the correct email and pass several times and even tried offline play and still, it didn't launch.So I dug deeper into the reviews and some said it doesn't work sometimes with newer more up to date pcs and also it requires research and signing in to multiple services before even being able to launch it.That seems about right... not user friendly at all.Would update review if I ever at least get in-game.

												Не самая лучше часть Grand Theft Auto которая меня затронула.Всё как-то очень противно, не знаю даже....- Атмсоферы нет совсем как это было в той же San Andreas, даже Grand Theft Auto V имеет свою атмосферу.- Отсутствие природы ( Не понимаю, как они (R*) не могли добавить природу в игру. Ясное дело город, но должен ведь быть и пригород с природой, хотя бы лес какой-нибудь.)- Автомобили получились более чем крутые.- Про оптимизацию вообще молчу, здесь её практически нет.Что ещё сказать. На долго в этой игре вы не задержитесь, если только на момент сюжета и всё.Я лично прошел её 2 раза (2-е концовки) и после начал заходить в неё минут на 15.Оценка игре 5/10.			"

												Hmmm GTA IV. ""GTA IV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you can't help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. It's not without some flaws, but GTA IV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet"" ―Justin Calvert, Gamespot executive editor.That pretty much sums up the whole game. I had a really good experience with GTA IV, and it was very fun to play. I have invested 3-4 hours on this game now, and I do not regret buying this game. At first, Nico (main character) may be slow in movement, and it will be hard to drive cars. Once, you get used to the game, it will really fun to play. There so many missions ta you can choose from (eg. Go bowling with Roman, go on a date with Michelle, go beat up some people for Vlad and do jobs and earn money for Roman).A game that offers this much is a really good buy. I very much suggest buying this game!The only big issue with this game is the DOWNLOAD and RUNNING the game. It was very annoying that when I downloaded it, I couldn't run this game due to a bunch of errors. THIS IS HOW TO SOLVE IT: http://depositfiles.com/files/exnxnkwkj. Download those files, extract them and put ALL of those files into your GTAIV Folder.If you dont know where your GTAIV Folder is, well, its here: OS (Hard Drive) > Program Files(x86) > Steam > SteamApps > Common > Grand Theft Auto IV > GTAIV. Put all those files there and your game will workScore: 9/10 (still has some minor flaws and the download is corrupted)			"

												So i will tell you my opinion..I played all GTA, and i can say GTA 4 is one of the best of GTA serises.. Let me tell you why I have on GTA 4 on CD version about 2,247hours and its still funOne of the best positive is on GTA 4 story mod, missions are very emotional and good, i can say its better story than GTA 5.. The ending of GTA 4 was very emotional with the music..Music is second positive on this game.. Perfect Soundtrack from GTA 4 side, for me its better than GTA 5 soundtrack.. In loading menu its very good theme song and in the missions its too good songs. The MP game can be for someone boring, because you can´t do missions like in gta 5, but you can do another funny things.. Like searching secret car Sultan RS and then just ride around LC with good music on or just camp with your friend in multiplayer somewhere and just shot some helicopters from LCPD or just jump off the Empire State or go visit heart of Liberty City if you know where you can find it..Ok.. you can´t buy clothes in MP like in GTA 5.. but you can do character with your favourite clothes and just tunning it with ranking up.. But the most annoying is on GTA 4 Games for Windows Live... I have always problems with this thing. It ruined the game but you can overlook this epic fail.. Second negative is on this game optimalization.. On some places is the optimalization very awful.. but if you have good computer, you will see just a litle drop of FPS. I played this game on my old computer where i´ve played it on 800x600 all low on 20fps.. so ye.. prob you will run it without problems, but if you have same old pc like i had, you will see the horible optimalization on Liberty City bridge :D So this game maybe dont have so much option like GTA 5 but believe me, i can only recomend you this game.. Comunity is much better than in GTA 5, nobody will kill you here just for fun and nobody will put a reward on your head :D If you will find someone with Trainer, its fun, because they will build a ramp or do a airport party :D not like in gta 5 where cheaters will switch on a godmode and kill other.. no here is fun.. Sorry if you dont agree with me, its just my opinion and you can have your own and sorry for my english.			"

												Let's rewind the date back to March of this year. GTA IV was on sale for 5 bucks and I was curious, as I had only seen it when my friend showed me the game at his house. I nagged my father to allow me to use the funds, and he relented at about 10:00 that Friday night. I bought it and downloaded it overnight (I had a laptop at the time, so it took quite a while).The next morning, I loaded it up for the first time. Immediately as soon as the ship cutscene started, I got graphical glitches and lag, although I attribute that to the laptop, not the game. Besides those technicalities, the game appeared absolutely gorgeous. The graphics (despite me setting every option on low, and despite the glitches) looked stunning to me, as I had never played anything as close to graphical perfection at that point in my gaming career. The dialogue also seemed to be my type of style - clear, sarasctic, and on occasion, angry. And this is just from the opening cut scene!After the cutscene, I gazed upon Liberty City for the first time. Good Lord. For someone who's closest ""open-world"" atmosphere was frigging Delfino Plaza in Super Mario Sunshine, this was like an entirely new path suddenly appeared through the darkened forest of 3rd-party Nintendo games. No longer would basic linear gameplay amuse me as much as the expansive and neverending environment of GTA IV.After staring at what little of the City I could see (with Roman probably anxiously awaiting me to actually drive to his apartment), now I'll talk about the missions. Honestly, I haven't done many of them in my 42 hours of gameplay - only up to the drug dealer house raid (however, the missions do explain aspects of gameplay in a well-scripted manner, and are exceptionally fun). Why haven't I played more of the main story, you probably won't ask but I'll still say the answer anyways? Two words: Free Roam.The ability to do close to whatever I wanted in a gargantuan city with no setbacks (well, the cops maybe, but I just turn them off when I create a game for myself)? It was heaven for me. Most likely over two thirds of my hours in the game are from free roam alone - single player free roam nonetheless. I just found so much to do. Pretend to rob a Burger Shot armed with only grenades before blowing the place to Kingdom Come? Check. Launch off the ramps at the airport then dive out of the car and hope not to die? Check. Jump out of a helicopter and attempt to crush a pedestrian from 500 feet up? Check. The possibilites are endless, at least to me. I could go on and on about my Liberty City exploits, but I'll just leave it there.Of course I have a few minor qualms about the game. Fire kills you way too easily (Stop drop and roll, good lord Niko...), the cops can be absolutely relentless on 3 stars and above, and sometimes the physics just...go away (*coughSwingsetGlitchcoughDon'tHurtMeIEnjoyTheGlitchToocough*).However, despite these few setbacks, I absolutely love this game. Overall, 9.5 out of 10. While waiting for GTA V to come out for PC (if it ever does...), buy GTA IV. Even if it isn't on sale, it is definitely worth the price. As I sit here at 10:07 at night, finishing this review while listening to UFO's phenomenal album ""Phenomenon"" (See what I did there? Oh who am I kidding, you probably did. Ignore me...), I can safely say GTA IV is one of my Top 5 favorite games of all time, putting it amongst the other greats on my Top 5 Games list; Half-Life 2, Luigi's Mansion, Pokemon Fire Red, and Team Fortress 2.Stay frosty.-Silent Scream			"

A game that offers a mix of sometimes beautiful visuals, mediocre online play and an interesting, yet repetitive story line? look no further!On a serious note, the pc version of gta4 is possibly the most enjoyable moddablle game i've played in a very long time. The physics apparently abide by a completely different set of laws and, yes the multiplayer is plagued with obnoxious elitist who think they're somehow the gods of pc modding for installing a native trainer, but even when taking that and the horrific 'social club' into consideration... this is game is actually annoyingly addictive.

												Truth be told, GTA IV is the first GTA game I've ever played in depth. I've played other open world crime games like Saints Row and had a lot of fun.  But I found the missions in GTA IV to be repetitive and boring.  Most of the missions I played through involved having to chase somebody down and kill them.  Other missions involve having to kill people in a certain area (and then you'll probably have to chase down the main person you're trying to kill anyway).   Additionally, every enemy is a huge bullet sponge That being said, driving around Liberty City is still fairly fun.  The radio stations in the game have some truly funny commentary.  The guns handle decently well and the cover system works.  The thing that makes me dislike GTA IV is that it is an extremely poor PC port. Textures fade in and out sometimes, FPS slowdowns for no reason (this game is six years old, that shouldn't happen), and the crushing amount of DRM. I thought Ubisoft was bad for making you use UPlay on top of Steam, but GTA IV has four layers of DRM (Steam, Rockstar Social Club, SecuROM, and Games for Windows Live).  I really wanted to like GTA IV, but the bad far outweighed the good.			"

												This one was quite hard to decide on, Whilst the game is indeed gritty and marks a rather jarring change in tone for the GTA franchise that's worth noting whether you like it or not; Unfortunately didn't quite make the grade in technical terms. This definately feels like a PC Port that was pushed out on a very tight schedule, Whilst all the menus may well support mouse movement (something that's sadly lacking from many ports) and the graphics settings scale very well from top to bottom, the actual optimisation for this game is rather poor.In my eyes, a rig running an FX-4130 @ 4.3GHz backed with a GeForce GTX980 struggling to achieve over 24fps doesn't spell lacking hardware, but rather poor optimisation. It's a real shame to admit this but the console versions are a lot more consistent, my minimum frame rate in benchmarks flickered from 13fps to 19fps, no matter how far i tried to scale the settings.In terms of actual gameplay though?It's got a fantastic story of discovery, betrayal, disappointment and sheer gritty(ness) that's worth playing through to the end even with the hardware difficulties, if you're after a great story; buy this. If you're after a smooth, pretty title, avoid this.			"

												Honestly, this is a good game, but only really on console. It it terribly optimized for PC, resulting in relatively poor frames for less powerful computers. Unless you are a really big fan of the series or don't have a console, I wouldn't reccomend it for PC. One thing to consider however is the large mod community, which is really what makes is worth getting for me personally.			"

												An epic game again by Rockstar entertainment. Its like an ""extension"" and an upturn, if I may say, of the previous GTA games, meaning that the game has much better graphics than previous ones and also you can improvise - interact with almost everything on the game (you can use computers, enter various buildings, play various roles etc.) and boy you even got a cell phone!!! Both the storyline and the questline is big and amusing with many missions and many outcomes. The only thing I did not like in this game is the fact that the experience bars, which were used back in GTA: San Adreas (Driving Skill, Stamina, Muscle etc.) were removed and also the way that Police officers react and move (for example: You crush into a traffic light and no attention is paid. Yet you touch their car? They shoot you down!). I mean wtf is this logic. In conclusion it is a good and fun game to play.I give this game 8/10 "

												So I liked this game, even though there are plenty of people that were turned off by the extra realism vs. fun aspect of the game. The PC version is extremely moddable, which makes it even more fun while adding to the replay value. However, it is very poorly optimized and just simply doesn't want to run well. The story was ok, I had the most fun modding the game and going crazy.			"

												I love the freedom of roaming the large world of GTA4, driving at speed along scenic roads among skyscrapers, through parks, and along waterfronts. But the missions are just as malicious and hateful as in San Andreas, the mechanics of the game have not advanced at all, and the motion of your avatar in the third-person perspective is as clunky as it always was.I completed San Andreas despite these flaws, but I turned my back on GTA4 after a small number of hours. It just felt like the same flaws wearing a different outfit.			"

This has not yet been solved and with all the problems with Games for Windows Live around, it is looking unlikely to be solved soon.Really disappointed, as Ive wanted to play this game for ages and before starting the newer game.The game should not be for sale while it is unplayable and people who have purchased should be entitled to a refund.

												This is a normal review, I am not upvoting this game just with ""COUSIN LET'S GO BOWLING"" like everyone else does.GTA IV is one of my favourite games of all time. I played this game hundreds of hours on PS3 and completed every single mission three times (until the infamous YLOD wrecked my console).Pros:-Awesome storyline-Perfect humour and action combination, just like in the old GTA games-The best rendition of Liberty City by far-Variety of cars to ""buy""Cons:-The Steam version includes an outdated version of GFWL which will make the game unplayable. Can be fixed by uninstalling this version and installing the latest version from Microsoft-Three accounts needed to play: one on Steam, one on GFWL and one on Rockstar Games Social Club-Most vehicles handle like trucksOverall, this is a masterpiece in the whole series, even though many say it is a bad port.Untill GTA V comes out on PC, this is the must-buy in the series.Rating: 9.5/10 will play again			"

												GTA 4 pits you in Liberty City, a corrupted and beautiful city known for it's mob wars, ghetto's, subways, and top-tier pier with the one and only bowling alley. You are Niko Bellic, a Serbian Immigrant who grew up in war and violence and fought in the Bosnian War as a teenager for the Serbian Army. Thus, coming to Liberty City to start a new life with Roman, your cousin, who has an unusual fetish for going bowling with you alot, but nevermind that.Throughout the game, you'll meet a plethora of colorful characters, some who are 2-bit thugs, to mob bosses. Decisions you make through the story will impact your overrall experience with the game and especially the ending. Lot's of betrayals and backstabbings occur in the story, persuading you to be cautious through each mission on what to expect. Expect the Unexpected. Farewell and Goodluck.			"

												Do NOT buy the game.I spent about an hour just downloading useless programs and creating accounts just to play the game. What I hated even more was that you can not save the game unless you sign in with your LIVE account. And to even get the game running, you need to download the microsoft games client. Then when you're finally in the game, and past the long intro, the game asks you to update your account because, somehow the account you just made 5 min ago is outdated. When it asks to close the game, you are not given that option and the game freezes with your mouse cursor gone. Highly frustrating and will not want to waste my time on this trash.			"

I have spent close to 4 hours just trying to make it into the game and still cant. I'm running a new I7 processor with high specs and windown 10 and it can't figure it out. glad it was only 5 bucks I wasted and not the 50 they ask for the new one.

The story was what kept me invested, but there are plenty of other things to do in the city. The shootouts however were very stale and repetitive after a while, and the story starts to get a little bland about halfway through the game, but picks up near the end. The voice acting is incredible and believable and the characters are great. Easily a 10/10 for me.			"

												I don't get all this mixed review stuff. GTA IV is great once you get through the simple process of bypassing GFWL with two files you drag into GTA IV's directory. Now - the actual game. Is it good? Yes. Does it run well? Not exactly. I always get lag on my GTX970, but this does not affect the gameplay IMO. The only ""problem"" is that Multiplayer doesn't work (unless you do things to make it work). To be honest, you should play Singleplayer BEFORE Multiplayer - especially with GTA V. The game's modding community is still alive today and can change the game in many different ways.However, with all the stuff you need to do to get it running, GTA IV should have a lower price on Steam. Unless Rockstar decide to fix this, you should get it cheap during a sale, or buy a cheap CD key on the internet.			"

												I don't know what is the difference between this version of GTA IV and a cracked one from torrent.I replaced so many files and uninstalled/re-installed so many versions of Windows Live trying to get this to work,but with no luck. If you have Windows 8 or above it won't work or at least you will have alot of difficulties making it to work. For me...didn´t even launch.Don't buy this,the game is broken.I can say the same about Grand Theft Auto Episodes From Liberty City.Update: After many hours I managed to start the game only to find another 2 issues with this game.But let me tell you a funny story first, it seems my Windows Live password was too long for the in-game authenticator.I´ve changed my password to a shorter one and after that the game started freezing my pc when trying to sign in. Good Job Microsoft!The game is poorly optimized too,which means you will encounter lots of stuttering.GTA V runs much better than this.I cannot recommend this game on PC. If you want it, get it on console.Despite it's technical problems,the game has a good plot.The game is good,BUT not on PC			"

												*CONTAINS FEW SPOILERS*You maybe think why I have so few hours and I am writing review? Well, the anserw is, I had GTA IV on disc (not in steam some time ago. I got 100% without any cheats (but using guides.) I have no idea where the disc is now, and I deleted all saved games on it to start game from beginning. I want to get 100% again (but its realy hard). So, speaking about game. Most annoying part is making all the ****ing accounts, to play multiplayer and to get achievements. You need to make Xbox account, Microsoft account, Rockstar Social Games account,(not so important, but you cannt play multiplayer) and others. I have RSG account, but I forget my password :D. About CD keys.  know that many illegal gamers steal other gamers CD keys with some programms. Fortunately, my was not stolen. Yet.  Thank God it worked. So have achievements. Well, I buyed GTA complete pack (so together with Episode From Liberty City (GTA IV DLC)) and EFLC didn't even asked me CD key. Strange.So, about storyline.I'm gonna tell it in few words.After finishing the war in eastern Europe, war veteran, named Niko Bellic (I think Serb, his real nationality is unknow) arrived to Liberty City, wich is based on New York. One of the reasons was to see  his rich cousin, Roman Bellic, who wasnt so rich acctualy and lived in some small, dirty apartament (and was gambler). Well, the second reason was to find men, who betrayed 15 people group in the war. Survived only 3 men - Niko, and two of his friends - Florian and Darko. Niko heard that one of them is living in Liberty City. So it's second reason. Living in the Liberety City, Niko finds friends... and a lot, lot of enemies... Missions are very interesting and much - around 90. In some missions you can kill or spare people who you are after to kill, some of the spared people reapears as Random characters (one of the side mission) who then gives you some missions. In games end you have two diffrent endings - Revange and Deal. I both endings one of your close friends gets killed. In each ending, you kill your antagonist. I don't want to tell more about endings.This GTA game, in my opinion, have the best storyline then any other GTA games. Realy, it is.So, about gameplay.Well, I think GTA IV is the most realistic game Rockstar are created. Graphics are very cool and realictic. The map is pretty big. Not bigger then San Andreas (3D san andreas, not GTA 5), but a lot  bigger then GTA 3 Liberty City. There are 4 big islands - Broker/Dukes (the same island), Bohan (not so big) Algonquin (the biggest) and Alderny. Story starts in Broker/Dukes. Bohan is unlocked from beginning, too. You can unlock Algonquin and Alderny doing storylie missions. There are pretty much enterable houses in Libert City. There are a lot of side missions, like chasing enemies with cop car (know as Vigilant in 3D era). There are Taxi Driver, but you dont need to do it for 100% and you can do it only for Roman (because he have cab office). You can get five diffrent friends trought storyline - Roman Bellic , Bruice Kibbutz, Little Jacob, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ McReary, and Dwaine Forge (optional). You can do some acctivities with them, such as playing bowling, pool, go to strip club, go eat, get drunk etc. You can also do these acctivities alone, if you want. Its realy hard to get 100% (maybe because of collectables). Because collectables are 200 pigeons, and you need to find and shot them all.And trust me, this is not all I wanted to say. There are A LOT of things you can do. Buy this game and check by yourself.I will maybe write reviews about other GTA games too, also for GTA 5, when it will be on steam (fall 2014, check if you want), so yeah... THIS IS NOT ALL. I realy recommend this game to anyone.			"

												THE GAME CAN BE DECENTLY FIXED IF YOU DO THE FOLLOWING!!!!!!!!!1) Go to your libary and right click Grand Theft Auto IV (CAN ALSO WORK WITH EFLC) and click properties 2) Click the Local Files tab and click Browse Local Files3) THIS IS IMPORTANT DO THE SAME WITH (gta4Browser.exe , gtaEncoder.exe , GTAIV.exe) Right click one of the .exe and go to properties. Click Compatibility, check ""Run this program in compatibility mode for"" and set it to Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) And do the same steps for the rest of .exe's4) To play online (which might not work all the time) In the files of Grand Theft Auto IV there is a file called paul.dll, just rename it to paul.old. 5) *Optional* A tweak fps mod I personally use, works all the time. http://www.gta4-mods.com/misc/gta-iv---optimizer-fps-boost-2014-zupper-f276626) *Optional* While in game, go to the graphics settings and turn off shadows. This will dramatically increase framerate. Even at low, still turn it off. 7) *Optional* Copy my settings if your graphics card is above GTX 660 or HD 7870 (You can also turn it up to 1080p) I get around 50-60fps in the area. Rarely get dips to 30-40. [

												I would love to be able to say what a great game this is but I cant as it is unplayable. On purchase you recieve a game key for the game which is invalid. After contacting steam support through numerous messages, they say that they cannot help and I need to look through forums for help and contact  the publisher. This has not yet been solved and with all the problems with Games for Windows Live around, it is looking unlikely to be solved soon.Really disappointed, as Ive wanted to play this game for ages and before starting the newer game.The game should not be for sale while it is unplayable and people who have purchased should be entitled to a refund. I will update this review when (IF) the problem is resolved.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV is about a immigrant that goes to new york city to see his cousin roman and makes many new friends and meets many familar faces in the city the city its self is the best part about the game the graphics aren't very good but the gameplay is  rock solid to the shooting to the driving or killing civillans on the street GTA IV doesn't dissipoint the game is just a masterpiece in everyway its just ashame that GTA IV has many problems with the pc port such as heavy preformence issues with even a high end graphics card you may suffer while playing on higher settings but the game is great everything in the city feels alive and real also the modding comunity is just wonderful and that should keep you very busy its easily the best GTA game if not the one of the best open world games of the six generation of consoles highly recommened			"

												Yeah,I'm giving it an up.This game,man,this game...This game has got lots of issues,it's hard to even get in the game,that's why I got so many hours,but only like 80 hours were played.A second ago I finished this game,and 100% I mean.I feel so relieved,because it's so hard to do it because of the bugs in this.But I still have to recommend this game,I had fun with it,the story feels great,you even get to chose who to kill and who to let to live,and other decissions and the game even have multiple endings,2 in fact,but still,it's more than one,and believe me,it's a big difference and if you will get to this point,it will hit you emotionally.Get this game,on a sale it's only like 5 euro,and for 5 euro,believe me,you will have lots of problems,but you can get over 100 hours out of this game,and that's a lot.Even if it's got all this bugs,I enjoyed it and I'm going to do some achievements,as much of them as I can,and play some online,I'm going to get more than those 80 hours,because the game is fun,but,I'm going to do a pro/con list.PRO:-The game is gorgeous,and I'm still amazed by the fact that you can get a chopper,get to the top of the sky and see the whole game at the same time,you can even see,barelly,but still,can see the cars moving on the islands and boats and everything,and it looks so good.        -The story is well made,even if you may not feel Niko,but you will feel for the other characters and care about them and you will feel bad if you don't show on a meeting or things like that.And if some of them get killed,man,it's hard.        -Carefull on detail,I mean,when it's thunder,you can even see the people how they get scared,or when it rains,they have umbrelas,and there are lots of other little things that make it great        -It's funny,especially the shows,I found myself laughing like I haven't done in a long time,especially the comedy show.The cabaret may scare you a little        -The girls look good,I mean,you can go into a strip club and while you're going for your private dance,you can see her♥♥♥♥♥♥shaking while she is walking,man the developers had a lot of fun doing this part of the game :))        -The cars look good,almost every car looks like one you would like to drive,and that's a cool thing        -The drunk camera is great,it shakes so good that I feel drunk myself and I feel sick after,it's really well made        -And there are many other things that you will fall in love with this game if you will try it,and I recomand you to do it.CONS:-The game has lots of troubles,LOTS           -You need a social club account and a Games For Windows Live account before you get to play it           -The social club will say that it doesn't recognizes your details most of the time,or some♥♥♥♥♥♥that he can't connect,you need to wait like 5 minutes with social club on before pressing the play button,but it's playable           -You will maximum get around 40-50 fps out of this game,and you will encounter framedrops like around 10-20 fps,and it's the game,not the PC,so don't worry,but it sucks           -Your friends will want to go out a lot,they tried to make it more realistic with this,but not every player wants to go out so much with them,but a little secret,you can say you're going and ""cancel plans"" a minute later and they don't get upset anymore (You're welcome)           -The motorbikes are rare in this game,and you won't be able to get back up on the bike a lot when you fall,because,if it falls somewhere where it shakes,the game won't pick it up for you,and you will have to search again for one and you need them for the stunt jumps especially,so it's bag           -Another bad thing,the stealing,you will press the button to steal a car and Niko will start running for the car,but when he is close to it,he will slow down and wait for it to go again and then he starts running again,so the only way to steal a car is by stopping it first,and it's really annoying           -If you're doing the ""most wanted"" thing with police,if you will be too close to the guy,the game will tell you that it updates his profile and it will block there,making you to restart the whole game,waiting again for the social club and all that           -The bowling and pool are bad,I mean,it feels good,you want to play more,but it moves bad,it happened that the bowling ball will hit Niko's leg and it will go out,or the white ball in pool will fly over the table because of the framedrops that are making you to shoot a little harder           -Not many clothes to choose from and most of them are looking bad           -NO CUSTOMIZABLE CARS,this is something that I really felt disappointed about,you only have the paint spray thing,but no customizable           -And there are a lot of problems with the game,things that will stop you from reaching 100%,or not letting you play and from what I've heard,you can't play it on Windows10,and a lot,a lot of other things.Yeah,I know,lots of cons,but I guarantee that you will enjoy this game,buggy as it is,it's something funny about it,it has something good,and for 5 euro on sale,you can at least try it.

Niko Bellic is my favourite video game character ever, and I know I am not alone in this. I could play this game all day and all night and still have fun. This game is fun for casual and dedicated gamers alike. This will definitely pimp out your games library too. There is nothing negative I could say about this game!!!!!!!!			"

												Decent game, steering is done horribly in comparison of other GTA titles, many features and cars from San Andreas don't exist in this (fighter jet, parachute, etc) and the missions are uninspired and repetitive at best. Storyline is not as compelling as some wished me to think. What makes this game a crap pile is the port to PC controls are horrible. The last mission requires you to repeatedly tap 'space' - but this changes the view in the helicopter you're trying to get into, rather than pulling you into it. Changing hotkeys didn't fix this issue, and Rockstar never issued a patch for it.Won't be installing the add-ons I bought, uninstalling. Disappointed.			"

												Buyer BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU USE ANYTHING BEYOND WINDOWS 7!!!I bought this game on disc Waaaayyyy back when I was still running windows 7, around 2011 I believe. Lo and behold, I could not get the game to run on my machine, despite being above spec on recommended hardware. As I got it on clearance I just wrote it off (that and I couldn't return it since the celophane was opened, I simply say ♥♥♥♥ you Wal-Mart). Anyway, I grabbed the game on steam sale (I gave up on physical games a bit ago) one new computer and a new operating system later. It has been nothing but a headache trying to work with this. I've seen backwards♥♥♥♥♥DRM before, but THIS, this game took the top prize. Signing in to even play single-player, with a website that's never worked since it's inception, graphical tearing on a top-end machine, and a settings file that simply would not listen when they were changed and applied.To wrap up, ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR! Thank you for never removing your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t social club system and making your games impossible to play. If you ever cared about your customer base, which history has shown you don't, recompile and re-release this game as a story expansion or something to GTA V, I may actually buy that one then.Steam Admins, seriously, remove this freakin game from the marketplace. It's an eyesore and a joke. We are laughing at you for keeping this trash on here.			"

												After 5 years of waiting they finally fixed it, nice one Rockstar - better late than never!If you're still having trouble after updating, try deleting and reinstalling the game and (obviously) get rid of your mods. When I first updated the game it didn't actually work. You will know you're running the updated version if you see Niko on the start menu (instead of  the ""news"" feed).If you can't get the game to start at all, try downloading the GFWL client direct from Xbox.com: http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient Once you've downloaded it, just put in your normal Microsoft account info. and you're good to go.Also, make sure you don't launch the game through Steam. Go to your GTA IV folder and click on ""LaunchGTAIV"". GFWL doesn't play well with Steam, apparently.In any case, for me anyway, the game's pretty much fixed and I don't have to use an old patch or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so that's a bonus.(My System: i5 6600K + GTX 1070 + game installed on SSD)			"

												Absolutley and hopelessly broken for Windows 8.1 x64 users. I've tried everything to make this work, but as it always has for me, it freezes when I press escape to play offline. Dissapointing, Rockstar. Your ports are garbage in the first place, you don't patch them once they've come out, etc. You're one of the most low-down, vile, disgusting, greedy, money-♥♥♥♥♥s in the entire gaming industry, second only to EA. I'm never buying a Rockstar game again, on any system, simply because I refuse to support such rudimentary customer service and overall such disgusting disregard for the customer. Have a nice ♥♥♥♥ing day without my business.			"

												I have updated this review to include the latest patch (December 2016).The story of GTA 4 is incredible! Niko Bellic, who was living in the Yugoslavia and is unfamiliar with huge cities and the american way of life, visits his cousin Roman in the US and suddenly has to face the dirtiest, most criminal and most corrupt city to ever exist. Of course the story evolves out of this setting, driven by an experience Nico had during the Yugoslav Wars and by the decisions that are necessary to make a living. The writing, the protagonists and the art style fit perfectly and create an atmosphere, I have never experienced before. The missions aren't made artificially difficult in any way. If you have to take out a single guy, you can approach or snipe him and shoot him in the face. Done, easy to take a life, no big deal. This greatly contributes to the atmosphere. What makes it difficult are the consequences of your actions. Hell, maybe you even liked the guy.If you have finished the main game, there is the Episodes From Liberty City expansion, which is on par.On the technical side, the game is old and it shows. It was a console port and came with framedrops, no multicore support and several detection issues (1GB+ GPUs for example). To get it to work with WIN 10 and without Windows Live, you had to invest 30 mins. In December 2016 however, Rockstar surprisingly released an update, which fixes those issues.I enjoyed GTA 4 more than GTA 5, because you get to know more. You play a single character, with friends, foes and family. You play in a city that you know by heart and almost feel at home. It's a bit scaled down and I think for good...which doesn't make GTA 5 a bad game by the way.			"

												This game is finally running on steam as it should with the latest 2016 update that allows it to run on modern PCs. Windows live is still enabled to be used but this is a good thing because achievments are still able to be earned on your Xbox profile. At purchase a few years ago i was really excited to try this game out with mods but the game was really unplayable and was a pain to fix. I never even made it to the actual game because it would go crazy and wouldnt stay at one part of the menu, NOW its all fixed,fully playble and enjoyable. A must buy just like all the previous installments			"

												Though there are a few annoyances about this game (Requires crappy Games-for-Windows-Live, can be a bit ""buggy"" to get working properly, it's poorly optimized, some particular missions are incredibly / frustratingly difficult to complete, etc...), overall this game (along with the Episodes from Liberty City) has a lot of action (with a mix of shooting and driving), great story, top voice-acting, decent graphics (and the various cut-scenes are well done) a wide selection of in-game music to listen to while driving, mature themes and some bits of humor too, all taking place in a ""belivable"" setting of what feels like a living & breathing city. I've put in a lot of playing-time and gotten much enjoyment from this game.			"

												After 5 years of waiting they finally fixed it, nice one Rockstar - better late than never!If you're still having trouble after updating, try deleting and reinstalling the game and (obviously) get rid of your mods. When I first updated the game it didn't actually work. You will know you're running the updated version if you see Niko on the start menu (instead of  the ""news"" feed).If you can't get the game to start at all, try downloading the GFWL client direct from Xbox.com: http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Live/PC/DownloadClient Once you've downloaded it, just put in your normal Microsoft account info. and you're good to go.Also, make sure you don't launch the game through Steam. Go to your GTA IV folder and click on ""LaunchGTAIV"". GFWL doesn't play well with Steam, apparently.In any case, for me anyway, the game's pretty much fixed and I don't have to use an old patch or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so that's a bonus.(My System: i5 6600K + GTX 1070 + game installed on SSD)			"

												Buyer BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU USE ANYTHING BEYOND WINDOWS 7!!!I bought this game on disc Waaaayyyy back when I was still running windows 7, around 2011 I believe. Lo and behold, I could not get the game to run on my machine, despite being above spec on recommended hardware. As I got it on clearance I just wrote it off (that and I couldn't return it since the celophane was opened, I simply say ♥♥♥♥ you Wal-Mart). Anyway, I grabbed the game on steam sale (I gave up on physical games a bit ago) one new computer and a new operating system later. It has been nothing but a headache trying to work with this. I've seen backwards♥♥♥♥♥DRM before, but THIS, this game took the top prize. Signing in to even play single-player, with a website that's never worked since it's inception, graphical tearing on a top-end machine, and a settings file that simply would not listen when they were changed and applied.To wrap up, ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR! Thank you for never removing your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t social club system and making your games impossible to play. If you ever cared about your customer base, which history has shown you don't, recompile and re-release this game as a story expansion or something to GTA V, I may actually buy that one then.Steam Admins, seriously, remove this freakin game from the marketplace. It's an eyesore and a joke. We are laughing at you for keeping this trash on here.			"

												Looks like Rockstar and Microsoft have teamed up into making this game unplayable on contemporary machines (the game isn't even 10 years old yet, and it doesn't work on a 2016 system).First it wants you to create an account at Rockstar. Tried to skip it but it wouldn't launch. Registered, but it fails authorization.There's some guide somewhere that tells you to install some odd MS service called Windows Live Games Redistribute or something, and copy some xbox (yes, xbox) related files from WoW64 to System32. For some reason I went with all that, and managed to launch the game but it crashed and messed up the desktop resolution. Last time I saw a crash messing up my desktop was back in Windows 98SE.Now don't get me wrong, 98SE was a great OS - compared to 98 vanilla.After some more messing around I managed to finally launch the game properly. Got into main menu, adjusted settings, clicked Benchmark. Then it says I have to register in order to save my progress.So it's not enough that I'm registered on Steam, and not enough that I'm registered on Rockstar without being able to authorize, now I also have to register at Windows Live Game Redistribute Runtime Environment Service.So I clicked ♥♥♥♥ You instead.It froze. Tried to crash the game, but it completely locked up and I couldn't get a visual on the task manager.By the way, with all that mess Steam says I played the game for 32 minutes.  That includes only the attempts to authorize, attempts to launch, and the time the game spent frozen. Doesn't include all the rest of the time.I'll give it some more effort, and I do hope I will manage to play the game because after playing every PC GTA from 1 to San Andreas I'm sure I'll enjoy this one.Despite that, I wholeheartedly recommend to NOT PAY THEM FOR THIS GAME.Go play GTA 1 and 2 instead, which they actually bothered to rerelease for contemporary machines a few years ago and did a good job at it and even made them freeware.Wow Rockstar. Really ♥♥♥♥ed up this one. And it ain't even the game that is bad, just the wrapper.			"

												After half hour of dealing with an evil thing called Windows Live, I got a message that made my blood boil: Can't connect to LIVE. You may be using a Windows Live ID from a region that is not supported by LIVE.... So that means i cannot play online and it was the ONLY reason i bought this game.. I think it is not fair for me and also other people from unsupported countries who bought this game. Steam should AT LEAST put an warning notification for people attempting to buy it.This is the same for GTA IV: EFLC			"

												This game pretty much sucks, but it didn't stop me from buying three copies across PS3/X360/PC. With GTA V out it's obviously obsolete, it also uses GFWL and I'm not sure if they patched it to take away that stupid crap, but if it's on sale for $5 or less I'd consider getting it for the LCPDFR mod (worth Googling), which turns it into a pretty nifty open-world cop game.

												2 days ago I would have given this game a negative review because of the Games for Windows Live problem, which WAS a stupid obstacle for those who wanted to play multiplayer GTA IV. But the developers have fixed that problem (FINALLY) and it's fully playable now, so I can give this game what it deserves a big YES. Though nobody plays online anymore because of the problem that doesn't exist anymore... Hopefully some people will come and we will revive this game once again.			"

												Double thumbs down on this one. First thumb down: the game itself. There is really nothing to recommend it that was not already done, and done better, in previous GTA titles, particularly GTA: San Andreas. To top it off, as is normal with a GTA game, you are forced to play the persona provided by the story rather than getting to craft your own or develop one via in-game choices. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, except that in this case the persona for the main character is pathetic. A dim-witted tool, ready and even anxious to be used by any slightly less dim-witted jerk he meets. That is who you are in this game. Second thumb down: Rockstar. These guys are just too intrusive with their idiotic DRM scheme. In the early days of this game it was just very, very annoying. Why? Because you had to be simultaneously logged into three different authentication methods in order to play, Rockstar's own online system, Windows Live, and Steam. Steam was no issue, they have been reliable since before this game was released. But Windows Live and Rockstar themselves have NEVER been reliable, constantly disconnecting the player, which kicks the player right out of the game. Now, it is even worse. Rockstar have themselves more or less abandoned the game, and this comes after they have placed too many barriers between you and your ability to even play it,  so the fact that they no longer provide any support to help you get over any of these hurdles means they get your money and you get....nothing but a headache and perhaps an ulcer. They are issuing lots and lots of invalid keys, so SecuROM blocks you from getting on; and of course SecuROM is powerless to do anything about because of their contract with Rockstar.  Recent patches have made it difficult for some and impossible for others to even connect to Windows Live, without which, again, the game will not allow you to play. Windows Live itself is plagued with disconnect problems with this particular game, and of course since it is a fault in the game itself, Microsoft provides zero support help to affected players. There is also apparently a huge showstopper of a regression bug in the most recent patch that renders it unplayable for many if not most Windows 10 users. All of this happening right after Rockstar ended ALL support for this game, so if you get hit by any one of these problems and turn to Rockstar for help, prepare to hear lots of crickets...and nothing else. They won't even answer you. Of course neither will SecuROM or Microsoft, since the problems are not their fault and are beyond their power to fix in any case.My recommendation: forget all about this game. And if you disapprove of this business model, you might consider forgetting about any other Rockstar game....ever. I have.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV should have been named Drive and Shoot Simulator IV, because that's about all that you do. This could have been fine, if it weren't for the fact that the driving controls are maddening and the gun gameplay is dull, dull, dull. At least the later parts of the Saints Row games let you have wacky fun, GTA IV just seems obsessed with taking itself far too seriously even when trying to make a joke. Save your money, get SR, same exact type of game with more fun, dollar for dollar. Unless you're one of those bizarre German Simulator fans, in which case this is right up your alley.			"

Now for the actual reviewThis game has a wonderful story, easy to catch along to, and not confusing to me.I love the details they put in the game as well, the fight moves that Niko, Johnny and Luis does beats GTA V's fighting. There are many possibilities you can do during missions.Unfortunately you can't do much in the game and getting money in the game is practically pointless except when buying food for health, or weapons.I don't like the driving mechanics in the game, since I played GTA V first, and compare it to GTA IV, it's a lot harder to drive in GTA IV than GTA V. In short: GTA IV is game that mainly focuses on story and detail, you can't do much in the game but admire the little details hidden in the game.			"

												Grand theft Auto IV is a modern classic. It achieves so much, and it's easy to forgive where it falls short.What GTA3 achieved, with its cartoony real-world mayhem, GTA4 polishes with realism.  The world is the star. Every landmark, every alley, every street corner of Liberty City has been hand-constructed, and it shows. Everywhere you go, the city is authentic. Working taxis, working subway, realistic freeways (but lame traffic), fantastic weather. You live in this world, but it lives around you. For this alone, it's worth the price of admission.Where does it fail? The protagonist and characters do not excite me. The story is forgettable, compared to earlier GTA (esp. San Andreas). I simply felt I was working through my paces to get to the end. Several features of the previous games were changed for the worse, most noticeably the ""treasure-hunt"" game of boosting rare autos. The in-world Internet and cell phone are a nuisance.But these are small complaints. GTA4 is a must-play.			"

												GTA IV was probably one of the good/bad games of it's time, but it's more good than bad, so i'll go through pro's and con's on itPROS: CHARACTERS: Every character you meet has emotion and you make bonds with them, and if you had to make a choice with something it was hard to do.  Each character you meet has a different feel to them, and they are all loveable.GUNS: The guns were good in this game, when you shot someone it did feel like you did damage, and it showed, the guns in the beginning suck, but when you get the stronger guns you can do much more damage to someone.RELATIONSHIPS: You can have relationships with people you meet in the story, and so far every one you meet I have loved.GRAPHICS: The graphics are good, even though I seriously hate people that think ""Oh the graphics look terrible the game must suck"" That's a huge lie, look at Minecraft, Half Life 1, DOOM, those games looked like pure crap, but they are still fun, and if you do say you are a true gamer and you care for graphics then you aren't a true gamer.FIGHTING: I love this, I know i'm gonna get hate for saying this but GTA V's fighting is so boring, it's just duck, counter, hit, hit, duck, counter, dead.  Atleast in this one if you picked a fight with a old guy sometimes, he would kick the crap out of you.EXPLORATION: There are so many things in this game I haven't noticed even when I first bought it till now, you can ride the railcars going from one island to another, I NEVER knew about that, and there are so many places you can go.ITEMS LYING AROUND: Throughout the city Items are scattered everywhere, to meleeing weapons to actual guns and grenades, and medkits, but they aren't easy to find, at all, and some are in such a annoying spot, I found body armor on a high way sign with no latter up, and they expect me to get that HOW?!CONS: DRIVING: Driving in this game feels so weird, it's like you have 2 dryers on the front of your car, and if you hit something at a angle you can spin the car out pretty badly, that and when you hit something your car dead stops, seriously, and I hate the fact that if you flipped the car on it's roof you are basically screwed.RUNNING AND JUMPING: These mechanics are kind of weird...you feel so slow when you jump over something or have to climb over, it takes forever, and you don't even get that much sprint if you are trying to run away from something or someone.COPS: In almost EVERY GTA game the cops can be a pain, but in this it feels like they are more of a pain, not only if they do something to you, IE you are sitting in a car and a cop runs into your car you get a wanted level, but if you are wanted and try to run it's really annoying, the radar you have will make a blue and red flashing outline to show that you have to get out of it to get away from the cops.  Don't get me wrong, it's kind of nice, but it sucks when you are outside of the line, are waiting for a few seconds, you have 1 SECOND LEFT before it goes away, and some cop just ""Happens"" to come around the corner and see you, and you gotta start the WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN, not to mention when you get a max of 6 stars you may as well just die, no way you are getting out of that, or a Pay-N-Spray.RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS: I like the fact you can have fun with the characters you meet in the story, but jesus they pester you ALL THE TIME, and they get all upset that you don't want to go bowling AGAIN, (Seriously Roman, go away).HEALTH SYSTEM: This is another thing that aggrivated me, the health goes away SO fast, even if you have armor, you get hit by a car while running it can take away a good half of your health or more, and really, food to heal? Yes there are medkits lying around the city but it's not like they are THAT easy to find in the first place.FLYING: The PC controls for flying just suck, I suggest you change the keys around to maybe Saints Row 3 flying controls, VERY nice if you do it that way.MONEY: I know getting money in ANY game is nice, but in this it feels so heavy, if you don't buy ANYTHING and just do all the missions, you can get almost 1 million bucks, but what are you supposed to spend money on in the first place? All you really need is strong guns and some armor, as well as food for health, that's really it, the rest is just worthless.There are ALOT of bad things and good things about this game, but if you get a config tool you can ignore most of them and just focus on the fun! 8/10EDIT 1: Niko isn't russian, he's siberian, I know it's crazy.

												Grand Theft Auto IV is a very fun game. Although i have seen better graphics before in does not change the fact that it is one of my favourite games. The story is very interesting: you are a russian who comes to america on a boat because your cousin tells you that he is rich and has nice cars, a mansion and hot girls but when you finally get to his house you are not happy with what you see. that is only a very vague idea of the actual story. the gameplay is very fun and i would highly recommend it to anyone.

												This is a really damn good game. But here is why I'm making this a negative review.Games for Windows Live DRM. Yep. This broken♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is really bad, so bad in fact that Microsoft said it will be shutting it down. But this has had a big impact on all of the games using GfWL, which is a problem. Most companies removed it, which caused very stressful game save removals, some kind of solved it, but Rockstar Games apparently aren't doing anything about this. Which is sad.Not only do you need GfWL to save games, but also to play on multiplayer. Which means third party multiplayer clients will be the only way of playing the game online and with your friends. People have created dll files to bypass GfWL, but what about multiplayer? Common, Rockstar!Hopefully Rockstar Games will pull the dreadful GfWL out of GTA IV's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and everyone will move on. Again, I'm extremely sorry to make this a negative review.P.S. Rockstar Games Social Club, or RGSC for short, is actually a pretty good software/site. I like it, personally, it has its problems, but all in all it's ok.			"

												Do not buy this game if you have windows 10 (And probably 8).The game will not be playable, meaning the launcher is bugged and closes so you can't start playing.If you did buy this game, there's a way to refund it, just google steam refunds.Make sure you 'played' this game less than 2 hours, and bought this game within 2 weeks of refunding.

You are required to login into a dead Microsoft service, also I can't even change the game resolution because it keeps pushing buttons by it self, in the main menu for example it took a bunch of screenshots because for some reason it thought that my Steam screenshot button was being pressed. Simply a terrible port, I wouldn't recomend this game to a friend at least not trough Steam.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV should have been named Drive and Shoot Simulator IV, because that's about all that you do. This could have been fine, if it weren't for the fact that the driving controls are maddening and the gun gameplay is dull, dull, dull. At least the later parts of the Saints Row games let you have wacky fun, GTA IV just seems obsessed with taking itself far too seriously even when trying to make a joke. Save your money, get SR, same exact type of game with more fun, dollar for dollar. Unless you're one of those bizarre German Simulator fans, in which case this is right up your alley.			"

												Honestly, this isn't a bad game in anyway but without mods... The PC version is horrible. Lots of frame skips, glitchy textures, horrible vehicle handling and more. However if you have a group of friends to play with and you get some mods off the workshop then it becomes a pretty enjoyable game for the PC.I, along with many other gamer's wish that Rockstar would stop porting over the Xbox 360 versions of their games over to the PC, they instead need to solely develop versions for the PC. Hopefully Grand Theft Auto V will finally deliver what we've all been waiting more than a decade for.Xbox 360 Version: 8/10PS3 Version: 7/10PC Version (Non-modded): 6.5/10PC Version (Modded): 9.4/10			"

												Won't let you go online without Social Network...that's fine, lots of games have their own account system for online.  I can deal.  Or rather I could, if the thing would allow you to connect RIGHT after you make the account...then there's microsoft LIVE.  Ohh boy.  LIVE won't allow you to SAVE THE FREAKING GAME without connecting to it.  And what happens when you say ""screw it, I don't care if I can't save?""  Nope.  You have to.  You have to connect or it won't let you off the screen where it says ""autosaving failed.""  EVEN IF YOU TELL IT YOU DON'T CARE.  Save your money.  This game isn't worth a penny.  Because you CAN'T FREAKING PLAY IT.			"

												Have you ever played any Grand Theft Auto (GTA) game? If so then you probably know what it is the series has to offer. In case you were in the outer space for last decade here is a little sum up. GTA is THE sandbox. You get your character, huge map and freedom to do ""whatever"" you want. There is a storyline to follow, but at first you will probably just wander around, steal a car and run over some innocent bystranders (but who is innocent right?). After a while you will get curious about the story and might even try to follow up on it.And this is where GTA IV differs from previous GTA games, most notably San Andreas. Rockstar tried to shake off the comedy like feeling of previous games and took different approach. GTA IV is way more serious, maybe a little too serious. The story follows Nico Bellic, an immigrant from eastern Europe who tries to find his luck and also peace in Liberty City. It would not be much of a story if everything went well, so for poor Nico everything will go downhill right from the start and he will be force to take part in city's crimewars. The story is nothing new but it works well enough, although some may find it hard to sympathize with Nico at least at beginning, since he is really different type of ""hero"".Another big difference compared to the previous GTA titles are the looks. The graphics have evolved greatly during those 4 years since San Andreas and GTA IV comes with way more realistic ones. Considering the size of Liberty City and the fact that there are actually no loadings the game looks amazing even today. The driving model followed the path of realism as well. Obviously it is not comparable with driving simulators, but compared to San Andreas the car feels way more real.Overally GTA IV comes out pretty neat, although the game had serious performance problems for a long time after the release of PC version, the patches and the newly developed hardware had taken care of those and today the game runs pretty smoothly on your average computer. Second problem might be Games for Windows Live client which is necessary for playing and which is broadly hated by gamers, myself included. Because of that I never got chance to try out multiplayer which I was looking forward to, but you might be luckier.			"

												Experience the realism of paying taxes on time; going on boring bowling dates, and sending resumes to law firms online.I only made one of those up btw. You legitimately submit a resume to a law firm and then proceed to jot it down into your organizer and then have to show up on time the next day for your interview. WHY IS THIS IN A VIDEO GAME. I COULD DO THAT IN REAL LIFE. *IVE DONE THAT IN REAL LIFE ALREADY*. OH BOY DO I ALSO GET TO FILE TAXES IN THIS GAME. Seriously who the HELL thought this was a good idea?In trying to be hyper-realistic this game forgot it's a video game and instead became a REALLY awfully written movie. You can try being realistic and being a movie, but at least be a GOOD movie. The writing contradicts itself. Mainly because this is a video game, and it's part of the GTA series. So Niko can ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about going on the straight and narrow and how he wants to change, but after that cutscene the game takes over and you take on missions murdering people and working for criminals and thieves. Because this is GTA. They didn't even bother to give good reasoning as to why Niko continues to kill and murder, and they didn't bother to have some sort of strain on Niko himself as he continues to go down this path. What they DID do is make the missions ''realistic'' by making them insanely boring. Drive here, kill this one person. Amazing.Unlike other GTA games you NEVER feel like you're moving further than helping out small time drug dealers and has-beens by killing another crack dealer that owes them money. There's no ''theme'' here. GTAIII was the Mafia, VC was the 80's drug cartels of Miami, SA was the late 80's/early 90's urban gangwarfare. GTA:LC is ''Niko goes around helping people in the projects kill drug dealers''. Even the DLC's to this game have more focus and more ''character''. The Lost are a biker gang; Gay Tony is FLAMING. Niko is helping low level crooks all the while wondering why so many people want him dead.So not only did they screw the pooch on making a GOOD story, they also screwed the game by trying to be realistic but only coming off as BORING. That's right, the game that makes crime B O R I N G. Amazing.This game achieves a lot. None of which are good things. To its credit the game managed to make a realistic ''driving on ice'' simulator. Apparently Rockstar has never driven a vehicle in their lives. That or they live in Antartica where all roads are iced over. They got rid of features that were present in other games. I have no idea why. Another achievement: inexplicably removing features for no reason. Hair cuts aren't realistic, maybe?Honestly this game isn't....offensive. It's just a GIGANTIC waste of time. If anything made GTA a has-been series it was GTAIV. Saints Row, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, even watchdogs made this series irrelevant. RIP.Proceed to downvote, I know there are a lot of 13 year olds whos first GTA was IV. You guys really missed out on the golden era of GTA. Go play Saints Row or something.No jumping out of planes with a parachute after clearing them out. No jumping onto jetliners and stealing a plane. No AREA 51. Sorry no jetpack. You wanted to have fun? That's not realistic. Enjoy checking your emails and submitting resumes. That bank robbery mission everyone always talks about in IV? That is the one standout mission in this game, and what's sad is that it would be any other mid-point mission in any of the other GTA's.God this game is so dog sh*t. It's a god damn real life simulator, and even that can be fun (The Sims).			"

												I remember buying this a few years ago, at nearly full price. My computer couldn't run it at the time, unfortunately, so I shelved it, called it a day, and told myself I'd return to it when I could run it.Years later, I reinstalled it, wiser and older, and able to do all the fun stuff I should have been doing with money and a great setup.Needless to say, I found the game in a sorry state, and unable to be played, due to the abandoned DRM and the faulty Club system.If you ever need a game to point to where DRM went terribly wrong, GTAIV is the perfect example.

												If you are using windows 10 it is unusable as is. Once you sort out the game not starting, you will have to sort out the game preventing you from increasing the settings, as it sees a high end set up as insufficient. Once you finally get to play, be ready for disappointing performance. I have a GTX1080 and I suffer massive fps drops and overall poor performance - and that is 'only' at 1440p.Oh but that is really irellevant as it is pointless me trying to play the game anyway, as I cannot save games and have to start from the beginning every time! Windows Live does not respond and all I can do is escape out of it, so I cannot save my progress. It is hard to believe Rockstar could make such a bad port, when they'ver released such a phenominal game like GTA V. I realise this game is old and they probably don't want to spend much on updates now. However if they are not going to make it playable, they should remove it from sale.			"

That is the one standout mission in this game, and what's sad is that it would be any other mid-point mission in any of the other GTA's.God this game is so dog sh*t. It's a god damn real life simulator, and even that can be fun (The Sims).			"

												You would have a higher chance of getting hit by a flying pig than to make this game work. I've spent 30 minutes trying to make this game work, doing all the compatability, and downloading the stupid ""Games for windows marketplace"", but in the end it was all just useless. The farthest I've actually made it was opening the game, but soon after it just crashed. My advice to you, dont buy this game, unless you're fine with getting your money stolen.			"

												First of all, this game is amazing when it came out, I enjoy playing this game and installing mods for this game, the mod community for this game is amazing. They're two things that ruin my game experinence though, 1. I assure you that I have completed this game on PC, Don't let my hours tell you otherwise. When I've played this game, I played it through Games For Windows Live, which completely ruins the game experience, and I have no hours to show my dedication to this game. My second problem is that you need a rockstar social club account AND a Games For Windows Live account to play online. Which ruins online. I recommend that you get this game for the single-player, the story line is completely incredible. DO NOT get this game if you want to play online and have fun like you see the YouTubers do you'll be disapointed.			"

												PROS:-Better story than GTA V, which just felt like infinite heists.-Despite mediocre graphics, the game has aged really well.-As is with every GTA, you can waste hours at a time on it.CONS:-Despite aging well, it needs third party visual patches (bad bloom)-You need a DLL (XLiveIess) to save your game now-Probably the most horribly optimized game in modern PC historyI need to expand on just how terrible the optimization is. It doesn't have many glitches and the glitches that exist are your typical funny GTA glitches, but the performance of this game is dreadful. My GTX 650 is above and beyond even the top GPUs of 2009 and the game struggles with high res shadows, which still look blocky and overall like crap. Without shadows the game is almost unplayable, as if everything's made of mold.GTA 5 runs better than this, and that's really saying something.			"

												2 out of 5, would have been a 3 but Microsoft sucks.  I had a lot of fun playing this game.  My main complaints revolve around the whole Microsoft Live crap attached to this game.  There were several times I could not continue my game because I couldn't connect to the Live servers, apparently your save file is tied in with Live so if you can't log in all you can do is start a new game.  While playing Live would often log out and back in interrupting gameplay.  There were whole days of Live outages where I couldn't play.  I never figured out how to get multiplayer to work, I tried once but it was confusing and I quickly gave up.  My computer is not an X-Box, stop treating it like one Microsoft!!!  Anyways, the game was mostly fun, the story kinda falls apart in the late game, but overall I had a lot of fun.  Most of the missions were fun, a few were confusing and difficult, but I figured them out in the end.  Overall this is a good GTA game. I can't wait for 5, but they are taking wayyyyy toooooo loooooonnnnnngggg releasing it for PC, I will probably not have any interest by the time it actually comes out.			"

So for the gameplay, its amazing and funny, the multiplayer is sweet. Its kinda dead thou but some people are still on.Of course there's the games windows live and some error when starting but run as admin and its fixed.

												I'm not quite sure what the hell the people that can't launch this game are talking about; mine launches just fine (using Windows 10). I reinstalled it just last week and have had zero issues. Getting a solid 40-60 FPS with all settings maxed on a mid-range gaming laptop. In fact, I've never had issues with the old GFWL games people ♥♥♥♥♥ about. If I recall correctly, all you need to do is download the newest GFWL client and create an offline account. For the people who's game suddenly stopped working after a recent update, I'm suspecting most of them have mods installed and that's what's gumming up the works. Then there are bound to be a certain percentage of people that have technical problems running the game because that's just how PC gaming works...all games have that to a certain extent considering the vast array of hardware and OS versions in use.Regarding the game itself, IMO it's the most underrated GTA game. I remember back in 2008, when it was launched, I built a brand new rig specifically for GTA IV. If you were playing it at the time you'll remember that it's launch was HORRID, with a average Amazon rating of about 1.5 stars. People's main complaints were the SecuROM DRM, and the fact that it ran like total♥♥♥♥♥on even the best rigs. The rig I had built at the time was fairly high-end and my FPS were in the teens. I was so annoyed that I stopped playing and didn't come back to it until last year. As I said in my opening paragraph, it runs just fine now (about damn time).This is the ""transitional"" GTA game that improved the graphics dramatically and took on a darker tone. R* have since gone on to make GTA V, which improves the graphics still but brings back some of that lighter, cartoony tone from the first few Open World GTA games. The gameplay and combat it greatly improved from the older games as well. Gunplay is now cover based, and feels much more accurate and refined. The driving is improved too, although many people complain that it's too sluggish. Some cars will handle better than others, but the worst part about the driving is the camera and not the car handling itself. The camera is slow to adjust during turns, leaving you the responsibilty of doing so manually, which creates the illusion of sluggishness. I have come to love the driving in GTA IV personally.Is this better than GTA V? Not better, but just as good IMHO. The graphics and gameplay mechanics hold up to this day and it's got some attention to detail that GTA V doesn't have. The Open World GTA games are all essentials, and GTA IV is certainly no exception.			"

Ive tried several 'fixes' that usually made it worse, note all i wanted to play was single player. finally found a fix for my issue. there is a review that provided a video that fixed my issue, it was posted by another member in a review on September 30. this video fixed my issue. I'm not taking credit for the fix. I just feel that the more its posted and shared. The more likely we are to help people.

												GRAND THEFT AUTO IVStepping off a boat in the shoes of illegal immigrant Niko Bellic as he arrives in Liberty City at the start of Grand Theft Auto IV, you can tell immediately that Rockstar North's latest offering is something quite special. Yes, this is another GTA game in which you'll likely spend the bulk of your time stealing cars and gunning down cops and criminals, but it's also much more than that. GTAIV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you can't help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. It's not without some flaws, but GTAIV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet.One of the many things that set GTAIV apart from its predecessors is Liberty City, which is more convincing as a living, breathing urban environment than anything that you've seen in a game before, and bears little resemblance to its namesake in 2001's GTAIII. Liberty's diverse population believably attempts to go about its daily business, seemingly unaware that several criminal factions are at war in the city. Niko has no such luck. He's compelled to start working for one of the factions shortly after arriving, when he learns that his cousin Roman has some potentially fatal gambling debts. Niko's military experience makes him a useful freelancer for employers in the business of killing each other, and though his reluctance to carry out their orders is often apparent, he does whatever is asked of him in the hope that completing missions for other people will ultimately give him the means to complete his own.Actually, Niko doesn't have to do everything that is asked of him. On several occasions as you play through his story, you'll be presented with decisions that afford you the option of doing what you think is right rather than blindly following instructions. You don't necessarily have to kill a target if he or she promises to disappear, but you have to weigh the risk of your employer finding out against the possibility that the person whose life you spare might prove useful later in the game, or even have work for you in the form of bonus missions. To say anything more specific on this subject would be to risk spoiling one of GTAIV's most interesting new features, but suffice it to say that every decision you make has consequences, and you'll likely want to play through the game at least twice to see how the alternatives unfold.Grand Theft Auto IV's story mode can be beaten in less than 30 hours, and there are so many optional activities and side missions to take part in along the way that you can comfortably double that number if you're in no hurry. The majority of the story missions task you with making deliveries and/or killing people, and play out in much the same way as those in previous games. With that said, most of the missions are a lot easier this time around, partly because Niko is a more agile and efficient killer than any of his predecessors, and partly because the LCPD seemingly has better things to do than hunt down an illegal immigrant who's gunning down undesirables all over the city. Some of the more imaginative missions sprinkled throughout the story include a kidnapping, a bank heist, and a job interview. The cinematic cutscenes associated with story missions are superbly presented and are the sequences in which the game's characters really shine. Without exception, the characters you encounter benefit from great animation, great voice work, and superbly expressive faces. They're not always so impressive when they join you on a mission and refuse to do what they're supposed to (for example, not following you on an escort mission, or failing to negotiate a doorway). Nevertheless, these problems are few and far between, and they're made less painful by the new ""replay mission"" option that you're presented with whenever you fail.New abilities in Niko's arsenal include scaling fences and walls anywhere he can get a foothold, shimmying along ledges, and, most importantly, taking cover behind objects. The ability to stick close to walls, parked cars, and the like at the touch of a button makes GTAIV's gunplay a huge improvement over that in previous games, and, in tandem with the new targeting system, it also makes it a lot easier. Enemies are rarely smart enough to get to you while you're in cover, and given that you can lock your targeting reticle on to them even when they're hidden, all you have to do is wait for them to poke their heads out and then pick them off with a minimum of effort. Locking on to enemies targets their torso by default, but you can use the right analog stick to fine-tune your aim and kill them more quickly with a headshot or two. Playing without using the lock-on feature make things more difficult, but you’ll need to master the technique so that you can shoot blindly at enemies from positions of cover when you dare not poke your own head out to line up the shot.Given the amount of trouble that you get into as you play through the story mode, it's inevitable that the police are going to get involved from time to time, even when their presence isn't a scripted feature of your mission. Liberty City's boys in blue are quick to respond when you get flagged with a wanted level of between one and six stars, but they're not nearly as tough to deal with as their counterparts in previous GTA games. They don't drive as quickly when pursuing you, they rarely bother to set up roadblocks, and you'll need to blow up practically an entire city block before the FIB (that's not a typo) show up. Furthermore, you're given an unfair advantage in the form of your GPS system; when you're not using it to plot a valid route to any waypoint of your choosing, it doubles as a kind of police scanner. Any time you have a brush with the law, the GPS shows you the exact locations of patrol cars and cops on foot in your area, and highlights the circular area (centered on your last known whereabouts) where they're concentrating their search. To escape, all you need to do is move outside the circle and then avoid being seen for 10 seconds or so, which is often best achieved by finding a safe spot and just sitting there. It's not a bad system in theory, but in practice it makes dodging the law a little too easy, especially when your wanted level is low and the search area is small.If you're wondering about differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Grand Theft Auto IV, the truth is that there aren't many. The PS3 version can only be played after a mandatory install that takes around 10 minutes, and its load times are a little shorter and less frequent as a result. The visuals, which don't always hold up to close scrutiny but are impressive during typical gameplay, are comparable and feature the same quirks (shadows that flicker, for example) on both consoles. Likewise, the audio, which can take a lot of the credit for why Liberty City feels so alive, is exceptional regardless of which console you have and how many speakers it's hooked up to. True to form, GTAIV's soundtrack has plenty of great licensed songs and, unlike other games we could mention, it doesn't force the artist and track information down your throat with pop-up windows that detract from gameplay. However, if you want that information, you can simply dial up a song-recognition service on your cell phone and, after a few seconds, receive it in a text message. Genius.The minor flaws that you'll experience are no more difficult to overlook than those in previous GTA games, and they're greatly outnumbered by the features that will impress and surprise you anytime you think you've already seen everything that the game has to offer. There's lots to see in Liberty City, so you'd best get started.			"

												I almost gave this game a negative review.  But there was too much putinto the game itself. Too much *I* put into the game.  Took me over 100 hrs to finish it.Enough has been said abou GTA4, so all I can do is tell you how it went for me.GTA4 was my first GTA game ever.  Last year, I did Sleeping Dogs and itis a first cousin in many ways yet not a GTA in the least.  First off, ittook me roughly 10 hrs in total just to get the game to run.  Lots of FPS issues,slow downs, lags, GFWL not working well or at all, overheating 2 differentPC's and actually damaging my laptop from GPU heat.  You can tackle it inmany different ways - for me I had to disable all reflections, shadows, andeventually use a new PC with a new card. On top of that, I found the actualsteam overlay created an odd lag on all my PC's.  Fortunately, I could play without steam by launching straight to GWFL.  Problem solved. To anyone setting it up...Good luck, is all I have to say.Now GTA4 is not terribly hard in the sense that it's impossible to play.  Just that it'sbrutal in the way it does missions. You finish a mission and *oops* I ran over someone and a copsaw it.  Now I have to drive like crazy and...*sigh* ran into another cop and now I will die. Youwould think you can start over from a checkpoint.  NOPE.  You have to start from SCRATCH.  I lostcount of all the times I would get through a dragged out mission only to make a crucial mistakeat the end and screw it all up.  Often it was something as simple as I hit a bump and my truck turned over and *sigh* have to start over from the beginning.  It's not perma-death, but as closeas it gets.  Even platformers have checkpoints.  This has NONE save one that I remember, the lastmission I did ""Revengers Tragedy"" would save me the trouble of driving halfway through town.  Moreon that later.I could handle the shootouts okay.  Even the tough ones.  Just that the cover feature would sometimesglitch and I would either crouch and not be able to fire a single shot or have to move just a bitaway from it and take immediate fire before I can target someone.  Auto-target was okay most of thetime.  Every mission would have errors, though, as it never quite targeted the guy you actually wantto kill.Driving.  Better like it. It's in the title, so don't go in thinking it's just a gangster game.Learn to drive and carefully too or you will die a million deaths.  I still stink at it and I finishedthe game.  Driving and shooting, I am even worse at.  The missions that took me forever were alwaysdriving and shooting - usually with lots of turns, that just ruined it for me.  And sometimes I wouldget the guy, only to accidently destroy the car and lose the loot, meaning a restart.  Pulled out a few clumps of hair on that.There are a handful of busy time wasting missions, but not much.  I can't complain about any of thembeing annoying. Just that all the cheap shots in the gameplay are meant to screw you up and restartingeach time takes FOREVER.Story was engrossing, but I never really felt attached to Niko.  I think more could have been doneto let the player into his psyche.  When most of the actual banter happens inside a car, it can be a little hard to convey that, though.So, I got to the last mission.  Revenger's Tragedy.  After playing it for 10-12 attempts I found out itwas not my fault - there is a game ending BUG there.  No matter how many times I clicked into the helicopter I would die.  So, I had to cap it at 30 FPS, lower all settings to medium-low in case of memoryissues, and window mode the game.  I think the FPS and window mode did the trick and after that I was easily able to drive the helicopter...although I had trouble steering it and lost Dimitri several times untilI lucked out ( on my last attempt was literally down to 30 bullets ) and got to the last scene where I shot my way through and grabbed ammo as fast as possible before getting shot to death.  I will *not*go back to try the other ending.  I'm done.  Time for a platformer or something.  Will play the DLClater when I get in the mood.  I have to say, never had a game get my heart pounding like this one.I *knew* that if I messed up it meant starting from scratch.  Makes it tense.  Still have not decided ifit is a bad thing or not. I would have finished in less than half the time if there were checkpoints, but it losesa lot of adrenaline if it's taken away.  Enjoy Happiness Island, Niko. "

												I bought this game a while back, but with the recent launch of GTA V and the rumors that Games for Windows Live is shutting down, I decided to go ahead and play it.  GTA III for PC didn't connect with me.  This game is much more refined.  Better graphics of course, but also better story, better characters, and much better controls (when using XBox 360 Controller).  This game takes itself a little more seriously than GTA III, but you can still cause a lot of crazy mayhem. It goes without saying that none of this content is for the kiddies.The PC version is no doubt the best looking version of the game, but there are some graphical glitches and texture popping.  I also ran into a bug in the final mission and had to Google to find a workaround.  I prefer the progression system in games like Assassin's Creed and Infamous.  At a certain point in the game, I felt like I earned all this money and had nothing to spend it on but ammo and weapon refills.  None of this takes away enjoyment for what the game does best.The story missions alone take about 20-30 hours to complete, but there is so much to do (too many things to list), you could easily spend hundreds of hours in this game if you choose.  The city is huge and the developers did a fantastic job of making it feel alive.  This is where the game really shines and why gamers choose to keep playing long after the story is complete.  You can feel the massive amount of work that must have went into developing the simulation.  It really is an impressive feat.			"

												I totally recommend this game, however the GFWL is really irritating. It is normally easy but my live account wouldnt work so I had to make a totally new one. But once that is over and done with you need to go to the games files and make a file called ""commandline.txt"" without the quotes. Open it and type ""-nomemrestrictions -norestrictions"" also without the quotes. Then go to the launch parameters by right clicking the game in your library and selecting properties. Then type in the same thing for the command line file you made earlier. After you get everything sorted out with GFWL when the game starts, set your graphics accordingly. It may say that your computer can't handle the settings you have, but just use trial and error with the graphics. Once you've done all that, you're good to go! Play to your hearts content. Or mod to your hearts content. Whichever you like best.			"

												While it's definitely a terrible PC port, I'd still recommend this to anyone who can't afford GTA V or is still a kid (whose parents will let them play this but not V). Also, the modding community alone is ridiculously bright and expansive, and those FPS issues become a joke once you mod the game to inprove them and then install several other cool mods. I got it and EFLC before GTA V launched for just 6 dollars.			"

												Even though it needed a lot - and I mean A LOT - of optimization before the release, since the game runs smoothly only on very high-end computers, this game will always be a classic. It changes a bit the mechanics of the older Grand Theft Auto release, adding a better shooting system, better ragdoll physics, better environment and better movement, to the already existent violence and free roam that made GTA a must have. The story is quite good too, and this time it adds the possibility of having options that change the interactions between you and the characters, and how the story unfolds. If you have a computer that can run it then it's a must have.			"

												Real nice game,brings out the fun,altough i think some more elements are needed from EFLC,this game has lived up to the expectations as it was like you know first released before EFLC.Being myself from Balkan , and ""slavic"" this game is that more enjoyable because of the story and everything else.Multiplayer is also good,even better than the EFLC in my opinion (i mean The Lost and Damned,and Ballad of Gay Tony).Price range is totally atm okay considering it is on sale,but i would recommend buying the GTA:Complete Pack in which you get all GTA's (starting from GTA3 all the way up to EFLC).Conclusion:The game is excellent,graphics too considering it has been released long time ago  ,story is entertaining.The only thing i cant stand is Roman (your cousin in the game) who calls you on every feckin' mission and wants to go bowling.So i would definately give it 9 out of 10.

												I got this super cheat on a holiday sale: Well after I played it on Xbox 360 - I really enjoyed this game.  It had more freedom and things to do than all the other GTA games.  You can date via internet, rob a bank, play taxi driver, or be a stealthy hitman.  Overall though I found some of the additional things annoying... culturing friendships as they call and pester you all day was annoying.  The level of detail put into the city is amazing and the volume of models, cars, boats, ect is very high.  The voice acting and story is great.  The vehicle control feels like driving, its nice.However this game suffered from the same thing I dislike about all the other GTA's.... poorly controled 3rd person camera perspective.  The camera and difficult controls left me feeling frustrated at times.  Niko feels like controling a cyborg without enough oil in the hydrolics.Worth it if you love 3rd person perspective, in sandbox areas, and fun story/voice acting.			"

												This game has many up's and down's to be honest. Obiously compared to GTA Vice City, GTA San Andres, and GTA China Town Wars, the graphics are supremely better, again this game came out 4 years ago so now-a-days graphics are even better (can't wait for GTA 5 on PC). Now a major compliant from a lot of people, myself included; would be the driving concept. It is very realistic, from car alarms, to hot wiring, getting thrown out a windsheild, and getting thrown like a football off a motercyle, the reason why that is bad, is because during missions that can make or break you. For example on a mission were you have to ridea moter cycle, lets say you're full speed and you bump into a car, you will be ejected like a bomb away from your vehicle. By the time you walk back to the bike, get on and drive off, normally it will say, ""Such and Such got away. So that is a plus and a minus. The story is very well written, A leads to B and B to C and so on. Another bad thing (more annoying than anything) is that you have to ditch the cops after every single mission, it gets old after a while. And if you're in the mood to have some fun or just be lazy the cheats were kinda of stale, so you need to use mods, to get the full potential out of the game. Don't let my review keep you from buying the game, it's well worthit. ALSO BE MOTHER F*C*I*G WARNED, this game requires high PC specs, when I first bought this game I couldn't play it on a $700 dollar computer, I had to buy a $1000 dollar computer to be able to play it.

												GTA IV is the 4th game in the entire GTA numerical line, and is a real fun game to play. The only problem with this game I have are the controls and the graphics. Poorly exported overall, and recquires a really good machine to run. It currently recquires you to make a Windows Live Gaming account, which is a bit bad. I would give it a 7/10, just because of the storyline and general game. If you are to buy it, don't buy it here, but for the PS3 or Xbox if you have either of them.			"

												I'm shocked that it took me this long to finally play GTA4, but I'm glad that I waited until I had a PC powerful enough to make the game look good. In contrast to Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation review (look it up!), I found that the ""gritty realism"" actually added to the atmosphere - something that greatly surprised me. Likewise, Yahtzee deplores the ""realistic"" driving physics, while I found it a great change of pace. Car chases feel much more like the chase scene from Bullitt, and less like Fast and Furious - which is a GOOD thing. The only thing that I can really complain about is the lack of older minigames and incentive to play through ANY of the minigames - since money is VERY easy to come by and money is almost always the only reward (unlike the early GTA games, where completing minigames yielded great rewards, such as unlimited sprinting, fire resistance, etc). GTA4 is most definitely a console port, but it's not as agonizingly lazy of a port as some PC games. Great game, overall!			"

												GTA4 is the very definition of a sandbox adventure game. The world is enormous, highly detailed, and - if you're into that kind of setting - beautiful. The soundtrack leaves something to be desired in its' default state, if you ask me, but I'm not a huge fan of rap, butt rock, or jazz, so I suppose you can take that with a grain of salt. The story of Niko Bellic is by far the best story portrayed in a Grand Theft series game, and the way the end plays out differs based on a pivotal decision you must make near the finale. Well worth picking up if you like Rockstar's game design style, but certainly not for everyone.			"

												GTA IV, what's there to say, IT'S GTA. The new Rage/Euphoria engine brings new life to the already awesome franchise, but to me, they missed the spot by making the game just city-based. It's not a huge gamechanger, but I really liked the SA map because it had the big open map. Other than that, it's a really good game, the vehicle damage is cool, driving feels a bit wonky but it's all good when you get the hang of it. Weapons feel good to me, nice damage, more realistic than some shooters.Vehicles, brand new, old, rusty, shiny, they are all there.All in all, it's an awesome game. I suggest that you try it and for the love of the TÖTEM PÖLE, get the Episodes from LC too, because it has so much more to it!			"

												one of the best gta games ive played. however gfwl comes with it and alot of other problems. here are some ways to fix most of these problems, but the credit goes to skupples. here's a list of things I've compiled while browsing the sub-forum.""Games for Windows Live"" is the DRM service used by GTA-IV. Yes, it's bad, thus why no one uses it anymore. First off, uninstall the ancient version of "" Microsoft Games for Windows Live"" that the title installed. (you can do this by going to ""uninstall a program"" and looking for ""microsoft games or windows live"" uninstall both services.next : Go install the up 2 date games for windows live (google it) Next : go to the install directory (steamapps) left click on the GTA4.exe, then right click on it, go to properties, then set compatibility to win7second NOTE : G4WL does NOT need to be running when launching the game. save, close.launch game, win....having issues with tweaking graphics settings?Tito Christmas Moderator	Mar 19 @ 6:20pmGTA IV showing video cards with over 2GB as under spechttps://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200145206-Issues-with-GTA-IV-showing-video-cards-with-over-2GB-as-under-specYou can workaround the issue by adding the following to the game launch options(Right Click -> Properties -> Set Launch Options)-nomemrestrict -norestrictionsup 2 date G4WLhttp://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClientso, to break it all down.A.) uninstall the microsoft Games For Windows Live client that the game installsB.) download & install the newest Microsoft Games For Windows Live - Google it.C.) go into the game files, install the redist that's included. This includes DX9, and other random stuffD.) manually set compatibility mode for the GTAIV.EXE from the steam folders. E.) once in game, can't change settings? apply ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" in the launch parameters.note these are things to try one by one. uninstalling & updating GFWL should be enough to fix the game for 90% of users.

Once done with that, there's a huge chance it won't detect neither your GPU nor the integrated graphics processor - and would start running on the AMU (i.e bad, bad, bad).If you do some reasearch, you'll run into many hacks and weird methods of getting it to ""think"" there's more memory available to it, but that won't work either. You will also run into patches released by Rockstar, but guess what?

												A worthy continuation to the all favourite series from Rockstar Games.  Liberty City is back, and it's better then ever before! At night it's a gorgeous site to behold while the music variety is simply incredible. Every station has something for each musical taste and flavour. But it's not just that. The story is also a great representation of a depressive and broken American Dream, from the perspective of a Serbian immigrant who recently went through war in the Bosnian War after the downfall of Yugoslavia.His share and vision upon the city makes specifically New York or the fictional Liberty City THE central character of the entire story. It seems to become the centre of power, but at the same time of great corruption, mischief and to some extent the (miserable) end of many people. Driving became much more flexible. Cars handle realistically, and are worth of a separate racing game (races which are abundant), every one of them has an invidivdual feel to them and that is a great example of execution and dedication of the team working on this. Even though it's still heavily action oriented, the aesthetical value becomes more prominent throught the entire game. Perhaps it is the way to go for GTA after all.This game is worth the money. By some reports it's the most expensive yet, the budget of which is certainly more than 1.000.000 $. And that ought to tell the player something....			"

												Probably a great game, the one thing missing is beeing able to play it. I bought this game on a package in sale, and if it wasn't for GTA San Andreas, Vice City or III I would have considered it a complete waste of money. Installed a bunch of times on slow internet, a total of nearly a week of downloading time for all the various times I have downloaded it, another week trying to make it work and nothing. I have given up. If you want this game just create a folder named Grand Theft Auto IV in your desktop, it's the exact same game but takes less time to download and less hard drive space. I feel so robbed with this game that some day I'll probably download an illegal copy just to be able to play, as even a hacker makes the game work better than the people who created it, who are just plain money leeches and don't give a crap about probably one of their best games, so you have to buy the newer one or get stuck with a game you can't even return becouse you spent so much time trying to fix it unseccessfully that even steam won't take it back.

I have been tired of gta v and got banned for the stu[idest reasons. You'll never get banned for using mods, unlike v. This game rockstar got right and gta v is just meh it could have been better.

												One of the best games I played. It was great and fun playing it. The story was okay.Too bad I can't play it anymore. It's been years, I tried again today (because I got a new laptop with Windows 10 and better CPU and GPU). After a few fixes (couldnt change any graphic settings), I managed to launch it, even played it. A lot of stuff was invisible so after some tweaks in the graphics settings (had to put everything on high), I got it to work decently even if the frame rate wasn't the best.I dont know what happened, I changed a settings, restarted the game and I got infinite loading screens. Even changing back what I changed did nothing.It's official I give up with this game. Looks like Rockstar did the same.			"

												I really wanted to be able to play this game, but I was unable to due to something going wrong with the Games For Windows Life integration.  Not only was I unable to change any of the video settings (the game would instantaneously change back anything I wanted to modify: screen resolution, graphics detail, etc).  Then there was a screen before I could even start that had a defunct Games For Windows Live page up that I could not get passed.  For all I know it could be that this game is not compatible with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, but for whatever reason, I could not get this game to work on my current setup.			"

The video settings are locked at the lowest possible and the render distant is so close that you will hit cars that appear secounds before you crash. Also the controls for the keyboard and mouse are terrible. I recommend using a 360 controller if you have one and if you don't your pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed, as seeing how you can't make a proper turn with the mouse for♥♥♥♥♥♥when going fast. It's really disappointing because I had such high hopes for this game, but they were destroyed by a terrible port to PC.			"

												I love this game. It is fairly difficult to get the game to run on a lot of PC's, but once you get past that, it's a pretty good game. Here are a few of my tips to get the game to work:  Download X live less (it's not spelled like that, but Steam blocks it all out if I write it with no spaces) to disable Games for Windows - LIVE. This way, you don't have to bother making an Xbox account, installing Games for Windows - LIVE, and you will actually be able to save your game. If Social Club is giving you a hard time, disable it. To do this, go to your Grand Theft Auto IV directory, and find the file ""paul.dll"". Rename it to ""paul.dll.disabled"". This will disable Social Club, so once you launch the game, it will automatically open  the game, instead of bringing up the Social Club launcher.  This is important if you're running on Windows 8 or 8.1!  Run Steam as Administator. Find the Steam application on your desktop, right click, go to Properties, Advanced, and check the box that says ""Run as administrator"". If you don't do this, you will get an error, preventing you from playing the game.Now with all that out of the way, let's talk more about the game! Grand Theft Auto IV is very fun. The missions can become rather repetetive, but for this reason, you may want to do some other things around the city, like hanging out with friends or girlfriends, going to strip clubs, just driving around or taking rides in taxis, going on massive murder sprees, or just taking breaks from the game.Something great about the game is that, kind of like games from Telltale, choices you make tailors how the game will go. I won't give out any spoilers, but let's just say, you should have a backup of your save just before the end of the game, because the ending choice you make makes a huge difference.Although, there is a point in most games where it just gets boring. Say you didn't buy the DLC, and the base game doesn't have the spark anymore. To have some more fun again, you can download mods! There are many great mods from the game. Some of my favorites are the ""First Person"" mod, and the ""Traffic Load"" mod, which gives traffic more variety, and stops the annoying taxi bug, which occurs when you mod other cars in. There are also graphical mods to make the game look amazing, even almost real, if your PC can handle it. Long story short, it's a very fun game, once you get it working. I would only recommend to buy this game when it goes on sale though, considering how much of a pain it is to get the game working, and that it's not for everyone. Then, if you can't get it working, you only spend a couple bucks, rather than 20. Have a good one, everyone! If you have any questions about the game not working, feel free to message me or comment on my profile. I can't make any guarantees to help you, but I will try.			"

This uses two DRMs one for Multiplayer and Games For Windows Live which makes Uplay look like a chocolate cake. You have to log into both to play this, that is unless you pirate it which is what I should have done if I would have known this DRM was on here.

												I got this super cheat on a holiday sale: Well after I played it on Xbox 360 - I really enjoyed this game.  It had more freedom and things to do than all the other GTA games.  You can date via internet, rob a bank, play taxi driver, or be a stealthy hitman.  Overall though I found some of the additional things annoying... culturing friendships as they call and pester you all day was annoying.  The level of detail put into the city is amazing and the volume of models, cars, boats, ect is very high.  The voice acting and story is great.  The vehicle control feels like driving, its nice.However this game suffered from the same thing I dislike about all the other GTA's.... poorly controled 3rd person camera perspective.  The camera and difficult controls left me feeling frustrated at times.  Niko feels like controling a cyborg without enough oil in the hydrolics.Worth it if you love 3rd person perspective, in sandbox areas, and fun story/voice acting.			"

												DON'T BUY THIS NOW!!!Since the Gamespy servers which ran the SocialClub were shut down, GTA IV doesn't work, but instead of it being either fixed or taken off the store, it remains. And SecuROM - As you cannot connect to the socialclub, doesn't let the game start. This means that you cannot play the game. I have tryed all kinds of fixes but none work for me, it can someone else but not some, it isn't worth the risk at the price. I cannot wait for the Steam returns policy that has been rumored to be implemented because I would return the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this. Which is a crying shame because I played this game on console on release and it was perfect and I wanted a similar experience on PC but to no avail. ♥♥♥♥ you SecuROM, ♥♥♥♥ you GFWL and most of all, ♥♥♥♥ you Steam for keeping a possibly faulty product on the store!

												My cousin knowing the manager very well arranged a Friday night here with our better halves. Super clean, polite staff and bowling in a posh environment. From shoes to private table service, we were so impressed and we had the best evening ever. There were a lot of different balls to choose from to fit any hand, plenty of lanes with privacy in curtains in between and the music was definitely fun. Great light bar fare also, albeit pricey but delish. Most definitely worth the price tag, I would never bowl any other way.			"

												It is an older game, no longer supported by the developer so one has to put a tiny bit of an effort to make it run, the pinned discussion articles right here on steam are mostly enough (yes it runs on W10) - for the bowling game issues disable mouse acceleration in windows config panel. To create an offline profile in the GFWL popup, just click the create button, scroll down and there is a link in the text that lets you do that.Other than the obvious technical flaws it's still a great game that doesn't deserve the low score and well worth it on a sale. The storyline is interesting and gameplay really good - many small details are even better than in GTA V, the NPC reaction, the Police intelligence etc.			"

												This game is such an amazing game. The world is very immersive and real. If this was remade exactly the same as it is with the only changes being the graphics, performance, and a few elements from gta 5, this is would be better than gta  5. I personally prefer this over gta 5 because it's world is realistic and not total action filled. I feel like gta 5 was made to impress the younger audience that won't pay attention to its world because they're busy shooting people. Anyway, let's stop comparing this to gta 5.The story is great. It's dark and sad so you develop emotion for the characters. I've beat it 4 times on console. The world just seems more real, having economy and modern cars. This game's combat is a nice focus on both melee and shooting. Civilians will try to fight you sometimes after you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. When you're in a said fight, an amazing melee combat engine allows for a realistic and better looking fight. The guns included in the game also seem like you'd see them in real life, unlike a lot of the guns in gta 5. The game world is just overall great.The AI sometimes is not that great. Their driving is bad a lot and they try to overtake you at stoplights (this can be fixed with mods) The cops will follow you into sidewalk, plowing into civilians even. But, the AI can be super realistic sometimes too, like when you catch a cop by surprise and aim a gun at him. He'll pull his gun out but won't shoot until you shoot at him. They also try to arrest you instead of shooting you on sight. They even arrest civilians sometimes unline in gta 5 where they just gun them down and leave.The only thing wrong with the pc verison is the instability and the fact that the game uses Games For Windows Live. The problem with GFWL is that it no longer has servers so it is impossible to activate your game with it. You'll have to download and install a mod that removes GFWL. With this mod you can play singleplayer just fine, but can't play online. As I'm typing this, steam says that they're out of keys and are getting more. I assume that they are trying to fix this issue. If you can work around the GFWL thing, I definetly recommend this.			"

												3rd time i have finished this game and it never gets boring. The game does is exactly what its aimed for put you in the mind of the crinimal underworld. You play as Niko Bellic fresh of the boat from Russia visting your cousin Roman in Liberty city. The game starts out pretty slow and the first 10 or so levels will a feel like tutorial missions but once you get through them and get your first gun the game turns into a massive hollywood style crime/thriller. With hours and hours of missions and many side quests and extremley fun mini games i give this game 10/10 ""Three Leaf Clover""			"

												A worthy continuation to the all favourite series from Rockstar Games.  Liberty City is back, and it's better then ever before! At night it's a gorgeous site to behold while the music variety is simply incredible. Every station has something for each musical taste and flavour. But it's not just that. The story is also a great representation of a depressive and broken American Dream, from the perspective of a Serbian immigrant who recently went through war in the Bosnian War after the downfall of Yugoslavia.His share and vision upon the city makes specifically New York or the fictional Liberty City THE central character of the entire story. It seems to become the centre of power, but at the same time of great corruption, mischief and to some extent the (miserable) end of many people. Driving became much more flexible. Cars handle realistically, and are worth of a separate racing game (races which are abundant), every one of them has an invidivdual feel to them and that is a great example of execution and dedication of the team working on this. Even though it's still heavily action oriented, the aesthetical value becomes more prominent throught the entire game. Perhaps it is the way to go for GTA after all.This game is worth the money. By some reports it's the most expensive yet, the budget of which is certainly more than 1.000.000 $. And that ought to tell the player something....			"

												REVIEW - Grand Theft Auto IVInterestingly, even though I've had GTA IV on my PS3 since 2009 or so, I never managed to finish it, and only bought it on Steam this holiday sale, and managed to complete the main storyline in a few weeks.As a ""GTA-veteran"" (Played III, Vice City, San Andreas, Liberty City Stories, IV & V) of sorts, I will say my personal opinion of the game after completion.What I'm about to say may shock some and surprise others in a positive way.I think GTA IV is the best GTA to date right after GTA V.Why? It doesn't have the customization of San Andreas, its vast scale (or V for that matter), nor the exotic feeling Vice City gave us. It has annoying friends calling you every few minutes asking you to go bowling or play darts with them. It has nearly zero side-content (all it has really are some random stranger missions, a bit like RDR and V)But what it has is the best atmosphere of all GTA games, minus V. You really feel you are in Liberty City, the districts feel different, and the city just seems...alive.I will categorize this review into segments. Spoilers will be avoided to the best of my ability just in case someone is yet to play this game.S T O R Y---------You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern-european immigrant ""migrating"" to Liberty City (parody of Manhattan & surrounding boroughs). Your cousin, Roman, has sent you emails about how life is great and how he's living the ""American Dream"", so you head to the US of A to check things out. Needless to say, things arent' as shiny as Roman said, and Niko needs to build his way up from the bottom to achieve some...personal goals.Overall, the story is both weak and well written. Weak in that it's bloated and far too long, it has a huge cast of supporting characters and for some people it may be hard to actually keep track who's who. Also the story does grow stale towards the end and at least in my opinion some very minor characters got far too much screen time. Well written in that it's a gripping and a gritty tale of how humans can never truly escape their past, and how we're driven by revenge. The storyline takes around 25-30 hours, i'd say.G A M E P L A Y----------------The gameplay is essentially non-linear & open-world. Right from the beginning, you're thrown out into Liberty City (namely Bohan, one of its districts) and you're free to do whatever you wish, though I will reiterate there's not much side-content on display. Most of what you can do is hanging with friends, date girls, buy clothes, get drunk, and shoot cops (lol) apart from the story missions there are also the so called random stranger missions, which usually feature an errand or some other short job to do. There are also assassination missions. You can buy weapons and body armor. You can drive cars but they're not upgradeable aparts from a paint job. Also, the car handling is absolutely terrible. they slide like they're on ice constantly, even the fastest sport cars! No idea what Rockstar was smoking when they decided on the car handling.Liberty City is divided into boroughs, which are separated by bridges, at the beginning these bridges are sealed, but when you progress the story you open up more areas and are free to roam wherever you wish on the map.The game is driven by EUPHORIA, the physics engine that is absolutely fantastic. It simulates stuff like bullet impacts, crashes etc realistically so for example no 2 deaths are the same, people don't just ragdoll, they die realistically falling to the ground as you'd expect a shot/hit person to behave. It's absolutely one of the game's highlights. Cop chases get harder as the rating (the wanted system is divided into 6 stars, all representing more advanced police forces after you) rises. On lower levels escaping is pretty easy but past level 3, it gets really tricky. Expect to die a lot in cop shootouts.Also one complaint I do have is that there's no checkpoints during missions save a few exceptions, there are a few things more annoying than playing a mission for 30 minutes straight and ending up losing because you crashed and died so you have to play the whole freaking mission all over again. Though the checkpoints were added in subsequent Rockstar releases, this is really something noticeable.Overall, i'd say the gameplay is fantastic, I enjoyed greatly just having a go at the cops and escaping, watching them stumble as i fired my gun at them or just being a nuisance and crusuing away, or just eating at restaurants or enjoying the sights the game has to offer. G R A P H I C S & A U D I O---------------------------I gotta admit, I played the game with an ENB config, because I did not like how the game looks by default, so I will not comment on the graphics too much. Overall it has aged quite well, way better than say, GTA: SA (which was a last-gen game, to be fair). The textures are okay, if a bit muddy, the lighting by default mostly works, but is better with an ENB.The game is notorious for being awfully optimized for PC:s, my rig (i7-2600k, GTX 670 2 GB & 16GB RAM) runs the game at around 40-45 FPS with an ENB enabled at high-ultra settings, but i'm not so nitpicky on that, just be sure you have a good computer if you wish fluid performance.The audio is excellent minus some of the gun sounds, for example the pistol sounds like a BB gun, not an actual Glock.There's 18 radio stations ranging from talk (Integrity) to rap (Beat 102.7) to even eastern-european station (Vladivostok FM), plus you have Independence FM which you can use to scan your own mp3 files and play them in your ingame radio, handy!There's also a soundtrack, but it is mostly on the background and not noticeable during gameplay really. Overall, the audio is solid. C  O N C L U S I O N----------------------I said at the preface I think this is the best GTA after V. So do I recommend it? Yes! for 20 € (or whatever your currency is)?Well, maybe. It has a bit of a steep asking price for a game that came out in 2008, but I believe it's an experience worth getting, especially on sale. The game also has a very active modding-community, so that is one good reason as well.If you want a game about playing as a criminal who's likable even though a bit cynical and pessimistic, act a jerk in public, play through a gripping story, and experience the city that never sleeps, in an open world that's sizeable and full of life, what are you waiting for?Get this game.Enjoy Liberty City!PS: Ignore Roman most of the time, he just wants to see ""American ♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" or go bowling.

												While it's definitely a terrible PC port, I'd still recommend this to anyone who can't afford GTA V or is still a kid (whose parents will let them play this but not V). Also, the modding community alone is ridiculously bright and expansive, and those FPS issues become a joke once you mod the game to inprove them and then install several other cool mods. I got it and EFLC before GTA V launched for just 6 dollars.			"

												Just a word of warning first.  If you have a graphics card with more than 2GB of VRAM like myself, you need to do some research first in order to get the best possible graphics possible.  For some reason, the game caps at 2GB VRAM and if it detects you have more, than it actually thinks you have a incapable GPU and gives you incredibly poor settings.  A simple fix and everything was up and running!This game had a few quirks that needed to be fixed, such as having to reduce the framerate to finish the final mission, but overall, this game was worth every single penny that I paid for it!  I got this game on sale a few weeks back when the GTA Complete Pack was $10, and I can say that this game is worth more than the $10 asking price for 5 GTA games!  I played GTA V before IV, but I have to say that the experience and story with IV was just as good as V.  There are more NPCs in IV and you get to play as an Eastern immigrant.  Combat sometimes is a bit odd, such as aiming around a corner, but it wasn't completely terrible.  Getting away from the cops in this game is extremely easy compared to V.  There are also a bunch of mods you can get for this game that can really pretty it up!If you haven't played this game yet and are a fan of the GTA series, what are you waiting for!?			"

												If you want to have a game where you can just mess around and do whatever you want, then get this game! The campain is good, but I usually just play around the whole city. Its fun, but sometimes it can be annoying to allways deal with the cops and find your own money.(id recommend installing mods) Do I recommend this game? HELL YEAH!!			"

												This game is great, but it is a very bad pc port, but mods make up for that, also GFWL is horrible. I rate 8.5/10Already now it is time for the real review. This game is amazing! I have been tired of gta v and got banned for the stu[idest reasons. You'll never get banned for using mods, unlike v. This game rockstar got right and gta v is just meh it could have been better. So atleast buy this game to try it and see how good it is! YOU won't regret it!			"

												What needs to be said? It's one of the best GTAs. Even though the PC port is mediocre, the game's story, acting, unforgettable characters, awesome city environment, and RPGs in an open world make for a blast.			"

												This has been one of the best games i have ever played. For the time the game came out it was good looking, smooth and nice gameplay. I still enjoy this game to this very day and probably will for a long time. Which game can be more relistic than this game, to be able to free roam around in a huge city (Liberty City) and do anything you want. The story is great. You come over to Liberty City on a boat to meet your cousin ( Roman Belic) You start out in the city with pretty much nothing but an appartment giving to you by Roman. Just buy the game and play for yourself is great. The Grand theft auto series have been like a dream to me, I can't wait until Grand theft auto 5 comes out.			"

Secondly I created an account and it timed out even though I answered questions and moved from step to step quickly. Lastly I Cannot Log in !! I verified my email, but the password and email I put in says it is not found. I tried to create a new account again and My Nickname is unavailable ... because it was taken by me! This goes for GTA IV also which you can't play unless you sign into Social Club ! Now it seems like I wasted money on both and cannot play them !! Very frustrated.			"

As usual Steam will not provide support, and even makes you agree to a special waiver before you can download it.  Rockstar games continues to provide zero support for Steam users, and a barely veiled contempt for PC gamers.  Not to mention I had to fire up the launcher over and over again for an hour, just to get 5 minutes logged.  Enough to post you this warning.			"

												GTA 4 IS BETTER THAT GTA 5!!!!!    I'M HERE TO SPREAD THE WORD!!!!     HEAR ME OUT PLEASE!!!!I know what your all thinking about: oh this guy is crazy... believe me I have an unimaginable amount of hours on GTA 5 and GTA 4 (on my xbox 360)I pre-ordered GTA 5 and everything for xbox 360. Played it for about 5-6 months straight before i started realizing all of the various flaws GTA 5 has.  But GTA 5 is a mess of a game. IM HERE TO SHED THE LIGHT ON THE PC COMMUNITY WHO IS BEGGING TO GET GTA 5.   LETS GET ON WITH THE REVIEW FOR GTA 4 COMPARED TO......GTA 5: THE BIGGEST LET DOWN EVER!!!!!!GTA 4: * Much better storyline than GTA 5. It was filled with more interesting, and deep plots that were very engaging. You had various alliances, conflict and dealings with all kinds of organized crime groups, Mafia and gangs. In GTA 4, the storyline involved choosing sides, double-crossing, striking up partnerships and epic showdowns. A huge chunk of GTA 5's storyline just revolved around corrupt cops and federal agents that just used you to do their dirty work, got boring after a while.  * Much more main storyline missions than GTA 5. Although some of GTA 4 main missions were sometimes repetitive. the very good storyline still kept you entertained. Compared to GTA 4,GTA 5 was very short. GTA 4 missions: 104. GTA 5: 69GTA 5 is vey pathetic when it comes to story length and story in general.* GTA 5 HAS MICRO-TRANSACTIONS.....  let that sink in.....* GTA 4 actually more interiors to enter than GTA 5, which was quite shocking. In GTA 4 you could enter fast food restaurants, cafes, nightclubs, bars, hotels, office buildings, hospitals, museums, apartments - the crazy thing is that you could do none of this in GTA 5. Once again, the environment in GTA IV provided more interaction and immersion than GTA 5. GTA 5 has almost no interiors. * In GTA 4, the gang members carried a better variety of firearms. They had pistols, Uzis and shotguns, the Russian Mob guys even had AKs. In GTA 5, gang members just carry pistols only, and I really don't why that is. It's a small but important detail.  * In GTA 5 almost all guns (in there own category like different assult rifles or shotguns) feel the same with extremely minor differences. And on top of that. The player can hold different types of the same category of guns like 5 different assult rifles and 3 different shotguns. That might appear as a good thing at first but like everything in GTA 5,(starting out with good intentions but slowly becoming major problems)  this is terrible.Not only does it take away individuality of the game but it also make everything not unique about the players setup.Imagine in Call of Duty or Battlefield or any other shooter where you can just take out in a split second, (assuming you chose an assult rifle class) any type of an assult rifle or (assuming you are a sniper) take out any sniper rifle whenever you feel like it. This destroys all individuality, destroys gameplay, and destoys unique classes for stratigical gameplay. * GTA 4 had a better variety of side missions and activities. Although some of them were not infinite, they were much better than what GTA 5 offered for most part. In GTA 4 you could call up Dwayne's gang members for back up, to be your bodyguard or to follow you around and help you out in missions, you could deliver drug packages and do drug deals for Little Jacob, you could steal cars for Brucie and Steve for money and do Police Database vigilante missions. In Ballad of Gay Tony, you could do Drug Wars, Nightclub management and cage-fighting for money. * The physics engine for GTA 4 was really well done. I loved it. The physics engine in GTA 5..... Its terrible. Cars explode if landing to hard. I smashed into an SUV at full speed with my sedan. Not even a scratch. The feel of bikes are gone. They handle pretty much the same. Oh and the cars. I know quite a lot on cars. I know how different cars feel and handle. In GTA 4 all the cars handled differently and like they were supposed to. I was amazed. GTA 5 however.... I am not exaggerating right now.... but every single car feels exactly the same except for the speed. Some are faster than others. Thats it. Each handles relatively the same, brakes relatively the same, etc...*GTA 4 Multipayer was all about having fun. Either Roleplaying or Gunfights. It didn't matter how much money you had. This was a simpler time of just having fun with your friends. Sure you couldn't customize your cars or buy apartments but sommetimes less is more. You didnt need apartments or stocks. (okay except for customizing and owning cars. If GTA 4 had that it would be perfect) GTA 5 Howerver is all about making money. Maybe a little playing with your friends but only for getting money and RP. RP is experince points and boy did they mess up on this. Rank 100 to use an RPG. It took me 7 months to get me that far. oh and you have to buy weapons and ammo as well and it can be costly. oh you want a machine gun... Rank 75. oh you want to customize your car? Not only is it soo expensive but to get all the upgrades you need to be rank 100. In GTA 4 the only penalty for getting busted or killed by the cops in multiplayer.... nothing. In GTA 5 Your car that you were using (if it was yours) gets inpounded and if you don't rescue it in time, it gets destroyed. And if it was not insured..... sucks to be you. Oh and making money in GTA 5... Boring and takes a long time. Everytime something is actually profitable either a race or a job.... Rockstar nerfs it so that it get 100x harder and time consuming. First it was racing. Everyone was doing it. It was awesome. I really enjoyed myself and made money in the process. Then Rockstar comes along and nerfs it. Now barely any money is won off races. Thanks Rockstar. Then people start resorting to online missions. Everytime the community finds a decent mission to do over and over to make at least a decent amount of money. Rockstar ruins it and nerfs it. And Rockstar wonders why people resort to hacking or glitching there money. But if someone glitches or hacks there money, next update Rockstar takes it all away. Its miserable and I dont want more people to suffer. DON'T GET GTA 5!!!! STICK WITH GTA 4!!!!. BE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU GOT!!!!!! SPREAD THE WORD PEOPLE!!!!			"

Once done with that, there's a huge chance it won't detect neither your GPU nor the integrated graphics processor - and would start running on the AMU (i.e bad, bad, bad).If you do some reasearch, you'll run into many hacks and weird methods of getting it to ""think"" there's more memory available to it, but that won't work either. You will also run into patches released by Rockstar, but guess what? These fail to even install.Conclusion: don't waste your money/time/bandwidth on trying to acquire this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥- you'll regret it.Complete disappointment.It may say I have 5 hours on record, but believe me when I say that I did not spend ONE minute actually playing the damn game.

												Grand Theft Auto IV is probably one of the best games on the market today, It takes the modern day version of New York City and makes it a very fun piece of entiertainment.Now I'm not going to be like IGN and be like ""GTA IV is a piece of art, Best game ever, 12/10!!"". It is a still a piece of art but even art can have problems.The graphics look good but it is very very grey and dull which is good considering the game's moody setting but remember, this game came out in 2008, This was revolutionary for the time. The supporting cast is good, Roman is trying to make his life work, Brucie is just...well...excited, and Niko Belic himself can be an interesting main character but not my favorite. Combat is okay this time around, the new cover mechanic is good but is much better in something like GTA 5. Ordering food feels boring, In GTA: San Andreas, You could buy different salads, burgers and would all have different effects. In GTA IV, all you can buy is a burger and a hot dog. Of course the driving is Important, Let me say this, The driving in GTA: IV IS F**KING HORRIBLE!!! Your car slides around like the wheels are made of butter and you end up just ramming into cars and street signs, Rockstar was trying to make the driving more realistic but in all games theres a border between Realistic and Goofy, Being super realisitic is in something like a Simulator or Arma. Something in between is in my opinion, GTA III-San Andreas and Saints Row 1-2. Something completely wacky is Saints Row The Third.Another thing I don't like is the wanted system, First things first, Cops take waaay too many bullets. You could empty an entire machine gun clip in to the cops and they will not die, The SWAT teams (Or N.O.O.S.E in GTA: IV.) are the ones that take a while to take down. There's also no Military, Which is realistic considering that the city would never call the military to take down one guy, but it was funny to watch 6 tanks trying to kill CJ, Claude, and Tommy.Finally, the city feels very alive, Ambulances trying to rush to the scene resucing someone, Police officers chasing down other perps beside you, Plus the city looks great when you fly a helicopter over the Manhattan area seeing the Rotterdam Tower and the GetALife building. The game also parodies modern society in a lot of ways, Like Government agencies being very secretive, TV Shows like Republican Space Rangers and WEAZEL News, and how the american dream is dying off and how one person can get in a heap of trouble.Overall, This is a very good game. I could go on and on about what I like and what I think is just weird. I give it a 9/10.			"

												Just a word of warning first.  If you have a graphics card with more than 2GB of VRAM like myself, you need to do some research first in order to get the best possible graphics possible.  For some reason, the game caps at 2GB VRAM and if it detects you have more, than it actually thinks you have a incapable GPU and gives you incredibly poor settings.  A simple fix and everything was up and running!This game had a few quirks that needed to be fixed, such as having to reduce the framerate to finish the final mission, but overall, this game was worth every single penny that I paid for it!  I got this game on sale a few weeks back when the GTA Complete Pack was $10, and I can say that this game is worth more than the $10 asking price for 5 GTA games!  I played GTA V before IV, but I have to say that the experience and story with IV was just as good as V.  There are more NPCs in IV and you get to play as an Eastern immigrant.  Combat sometimes is a bit odd, such as aiming around a corner, but it wasn't completely terrible.  Getting away from the cops in this game is extremely easy compared to V.  There are also a bunch of mods you can get for this game that can really pretty it up!If you haven't played this game yet and are a fan of the GTA series, what are you waiting for!?			"

												I'm shocked that it took me this long to finally play GTA4, but I'm glad that I waited until I had a PC powerful enough to make the game look good. In contrast to Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation review (look it up!), I found that the ""gritty realism"" actually added to the atmosphere - something that greatly surprised me. Likewise, Yahtzee deplores the ""realistic"" driving physics, while I found it a great change of pace. Car chases feel much more like the chase scene from Bullitt, and less like Fast and Furious - which is a GOOD thing. The only thing that I can really complain about is the lack of older minigames and incentive to play through ANY of the minigames - since money is VERY easy to come by and money is almost always the only reward (unlike the early GTA games, where completing minigames yielded great rewards, such as unlimited sprinting, fire resistance, etc). GTA4 is most definitely a console port, but it's not as agonizingly lazy of a port as some PC games. Great game, overall!			"

I got everythying set up, but then this ""Social Club Login"" appeared, i thought nothing of it and just created an account. Now when everything is finished and i write my login it just says:""Social Club failed. Please try again""And guess what happens when you ""try it again""?The same thing happens!I literally wasted my money on this (and the other GTA games since i bought the collection) so i DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE SYSTEM.And if you want to lay Offline (option on the launcher) IT STILL DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN, BUT IF YOU TRY TO LOGIN IT WONT WORK!Don't even bother buying this trash, unless you want to get upset or waste your hard-earned money.You have to put in so much work and effort just to run this game (which i gave up on)So if any of you guys have a clue to remove this tumor, then please tell me, because it's growinhg into cancer.

												If you do manage to get this installed you'll be able to play one of the greatest games ever.+ Storyline is amazing (much better than V)+ Car physics (much better than V)+ Graphics still hold up well for an eight year old game- ""Niko, it's your cousin. Let's go bowling!""- Multiplayer is still up, but awfully quiet nowadaysSolid 9.5/10.			"

It can be more than one program butt delete everything with Games for windows.Now open google and search for Games for Windows Marketplace and it should be the link on top and download and install and login.Now GTA should work.I dont now if you have to do that part with games for windows butt i did it and it worked for me.Hope it helps Sorry for Bad english //Silverwarrior "

												I wouldn't recommend this game mostly because I have Windows 8 and I can't play, unless I reinstall Windows and get the older version of C++ so that I can play this game. I don't exactly have time for this stuff. GTA IV won't give me option to play and when I play offline it gives me it gives me ""SecuLauncher: failed to star application [2000]"" so this is proof that I must get an older version of C++.			"

												It's and amazing game, but Social Club ruins EVERYTHING I have played this game on xbox years ago, and i thought it would be nice to get it on pc too (also since there was a discount). I got everythying set up, but then this ""Social Club Login"" appeared, i thought nothing of it and just created an account. Now when everything is finished and i write my login it just says:""Social Club failed. Please try again""And guess what happens when you ""try it again""?The same thing happens!I literally wasted my money on this (and the other GTA games since i bought the collection) so i DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE SYSTEM.And if you want to lay Offline (option on the launcher) IT STILL DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN, BUT IF YOU TRY TO LOGIN IT WONT WORK!Don't even bother buying this trash, unless you want to get upset or waste your hard-earned money.You have to put in so much work and effort just to run this game (which i gave up on)So if any of you guys have a clue to remove this tumor, then please tell me, because it's growinhg into cancer.

												Ah, the beloved GTA 4. A true gem from Rockstar games. Since Grand Theft Auto V is not out yet for PC, then this game is definetely a great PC-gamer alternative. The game offers you to be able to do a lot, like buying weapons, stealing cars, lots of things you can imagine. Ever since Grand Theft Auto 3, GTA has become a great open-world game that so many people know and love. It doesn't need a very strong PC, too. I just had to tweak the settings a little bit and it worked perfectly. So if you like open-world games and want a decent GTA expierience without an XBox 360 or PS3, GTA 4 is for you.			"

And SecuROM - As you cannot connect to the socialclub, doesn't let the game start. This means that you cannot play the game. I have tryed all kinds of fixes but none work for me, it can someone else but not some, it isn't worth the risk at the price. I cannot wait for the Steam returns policy that has been rumored to be implemented because I would return the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this.

												I figured out how to play GTA IV on Windows 10! Below the review is how to do it.NO SPOILERS.Review:This game is amazing. Many people dislike it for its wonky driving, but the driving really isn't that bad. Once you get used to it, it is amazing to get into. Considering it was made in 2008, it was amazing for its time, and its still wonderful today. I beat this campaign about 3 times on PS3, but that was a while ago. I run it with everything maxed except no vsync, no night shadows, and view distance at 60, and I get ~ 60 fps. Build: http://pcpartpicker.com/b/XthqqsPros:+ Story. The story is really interesting, how you arrive in liberty city, throughout how your character (Niko Bellic) progresses through, and the very end of the main campaign.+ Combat/NPC. The combat is great, although the hand-to-hand combat is a little awkward on PC, but the gunplay is amazing. I have played enough San Andreas to know that GTA IV is a huge step up. The people you encounter, whether they are people you are shooting, people that are walking or driving, or even people you are hitting with your car have very fluid motions to them.+ Car Damage. Some people think it looks bad, but in my opinion it's great because the car deforms in many different areas. Unlike damage that's already programmed to happen, I'm pretty sure it has deformations that happen due to what you hit, sort of like Next Car Game: Wreckfest.Neutral:= Driving. It is a little like driving on ice. Also the cars have weight to them, so while it's good for plowing through a roadblock or rush hour, it's hard to stop and turn.Overall, I'd give this a 9/10 because it's amazing. I spent many a night staying up and playing this on PS3, and PC is even better.Windows 10 instructions:First off, this does require a thing called X Live Less. I'll explain once we get to it.If step 1 does not apply to you and your problem is that you click ""Play"" after entering your Social Club info, but the game doesn't launch, skip to step 4.WARNING: Updating the BIOS can be hazardous, so I recommend watching someone esle on YouTube update their BIOS so you kind of know what you are doing. 1. You need a flashdrive. A CD might work, but don't quote me on it. This first step is for anyone with a Gigabyte ga-z170x Gaming 5 motherboard. If it gets an error looking like this: http://postimg.org/image/9r1g2jrkz/ ... It's because your mobo's (motherboard) BIOS is out of date. Go here: http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5498#bios ... You can see that update F3 fixes for games getting error 8016. You can get that, or F4 which is what I got. The newer ones might work, but I don't know. 2. Download the BIOS update for your Continent, then put it on the flashdrive. Then extract the file (I recommend the program Winrar to extract things, it's free) in the flash drive. Once you do that, turn your system off and then turn it back on. Once the Gigabyte logo appears, press ""Delete"" (NOT backspace) enough times until you get into the BIOS Screen.3. Once there press F8 to get into the q-flash. This is how you update the BIOS. Click on the name of your flashdrive, then go into the BIOS folder that you extracted onto it, then click on that BIOS version. Then let it update. It will finish and might restart your computer a few times, but once you are on your desktop, you are golden!4. Now to fix GTA IV. Go here to download X Live Less: http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ ... The top download link works. Then make a folder somewhere and extract (I recommmend Winrar for extracting files, it's free) X Live Less into the folder. Go into the folder and you will find the files named ""xlive"" and ""xlive_d"". Go into your GTA IV folder (find your Steam folder and go to steamapps/common/Grand Theft Auto IV/GTAIV. Simply move both of the files ""xlive"" and ""xlive_d"" into the Grand Theft Auto IV folder and press ""Yes"" if it asks if you want to replace the current files with your new files. Then right click on the application GTAIV. Go to Compatability and check the box ""Run this program in compatability mode for:"" and then make sure it's set to Windows 7. Then click Apply.5. You probably want to do this step, but you might not need to. Sometimes the game won't let you increase graphics settings because you are 'out of memory.' Right click on the Grand Theft Auto IV game in your library on the Steam app and go to properties. Then click on Set Launch  Options and put in -norestrictions ... Then you will be able to set your graphics as much as you want!Now, unfortunately, I have not been able to play the game by pressing Play, because I am not able to see Niko or any other civilians. The only way I can play is to go the Grand Theft Auto IV folder and double click on LaunchGTAIV. The only downside to this is that it doesn't save how much time you play in the game on Steam. Just make a shortcut for LaunchGTAIV and put it on the desktop and you are good to go! Hope this helps!			"

												3rd time i have finished this game and it never gets boring. The game does is exactly what its aimed for put you in the mind of the crinimal underworld. You play as Niko Bellic fresh of the boat from Russia visting your cousin Roman in Liberty city. The game starts out pretty slow and the first 10 or so levels will a feel like tutorial missions but once you get through them and get your first gun the game turns into a massive hollywood style crime/thriller. With hours and hours of missions and many side quests and extremley fun mini games i give this game 10/10 ""Three Leaf Clover""			"

												The most disappointing PC port of all time. GTA IV remains to be one of the most demanding games I've played to date, with a quad core processor and beefy video card being necessities to get even close to the best of the experience. The problem with this is that GTA IV was never the strongest looking 360/PS3 game in the first place, being a game that flooded the screen with visual effects to look it's boldest. Although once you get past the horrible PC interface, including login screens via Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Social Club, you have one of the deepest sandbox games out there. Not many action-adventure games can claim to have anywhere close to the same scale that is found with GTA IV. Liberty City is a very vivid and lively interpretation of New York City too. I will say that the controls are a damn sight better on PC GTA IV than on consoles, otherwise this conversion is shambles. Avoid.			"

												I played this game to completion, but it was boring. B-O-R-I-N-G. I am comparing this to San Andreas. GTA4's missions are standard open-world boringness. In San Andreas, you had to steal a motorcycle while wearing a clown suit and then chase after a enemy on another motorcycle on top of a moving train. At the end of the train, you crash your motorcycle into a helicopter and killing your enemy on the way down and landing in the water.In GTA4, you drive to point A to point B. Then you steal the boss's car. Then you drive it back. Don't make a dent!GTA4 is boring. Get Saint's Row 3.			"

												The game is a 10/10 on consoles. But a 6/10 on the PC. It was a f***ing hassle trying to get this game up and running. Even though I got it working, It still stutters and crashes sometimes. Instead of reviewing the PC port, i'll review the actual game itself. If you're expecting a San Andreas type game with chainsaws, flamethrowers, and jetpacks, You're not gonna be impressed. GTA IV has a dark story and very interesting characters throughout. It pretty much plays like a movie basically. The missions do get a little repetitive but the story really makes up for it. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous for its time. GTA IV in my opinion of all the GTAs has the best physics. The game is pretty much the most realistic out of all of them. The game does get very boring after the main story and all of the side missions. So the only thing that i guess is fun doing is trying to 100%. Otherwise, install insanely cool mods. So overall if you have a console I would HIGHLY suggest getting the game for that. But if you only have a PC, I would stick with another GTA game, unless you wanna go through all the sh*t that i had to start the damn game.			"

												Really funny characters, fun gameplay, great modding scene, open world, tons of stuff to do. What's not to love? The game is often critiqued for being ""too serious"" but I have absolutely no idea why anyone would say that. I have yet to meet a serious character in the game. Even when you're beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a guy he's cracking jokes. With Icenhancer the game really becomes something special. The visuals are improved to the point where playing it is actually enjoyable. Especially when you have a vehicle handling mod installed. Liberty City's setting like in every GTA game exists solely to make a parody of the American way of life along with a satire of the average citizen's life. And it's really funny.After installing one of the many GFWL removers the game runs poorly. To note I have an i5 4590 and a GTX 970. The game's performance in vanilla without modifications never went above 54 FPS for whatever reason, possibly some in game vysnc problem because I used an external application to force Vsync and triple buffering and then I could reach 60fps sometimes. With Icenhancer performance usually hovers around 45FPS which is alright considering this is the worst port I've played since Dark Souls. With everything configured correctly assuming you have a decent setup you shouldn't have a hard time enjoying GTA IV despite the framerate issues on every system setup.All together it's one hell of game that I'm glad to finally be able to play. It takes the best elements of San Andreas and implements them in a more refined and beatiful world. If I had to compare the gameplay to another game I'd say it's a mix of Watch Dogs (GTA ripoff), Saints Row 2, and a little bit of Sleeping Dogs.Niko's a fantstic protagonist and listening to his conversations is great. Buy this game!			"

												It is an older game, no longer supported by the developer so one has to put a tiny bit of an effort to make it run, the pinned discussion articles right here on steam are mostly enough (yes it runs on W10) - for the bowling game issues disable mouse acceleration in windows config panel. To create an offline profile in the GFWL popup, just click the create button, scroll down and there is a link in the text that lets you do that.Other than the obvious technical flaws it's still a great game that doesn't deserve the low score and well worth it on a sale. The storyline is interesting and gameplay really good - many small details are even better than in GTA V, the NPC reaction, the Police intelligence etc.			"

If you have newer hardware (past 2010) you will be fine and have a great experience)This is the best GTA game ever (until GTA 5 comes to PC).The story is the usual GTA story.You have to rise up through a criminal underworld from a random guy to a mobster boss at the top.What makes GTA is the original moments.When a police car chases you and ensures and epic chase of cars,helicopters and military. The missions ge tboring after the first 20 hours or so because of tired old concepts of drive,kill/rob someone and run away.  Now this is GTA 4 on PC and as two exclusive features 1.An amazing  video editor and 2.The Mods!You can find thousands of mods online and really get much more fun and lifts the graphics from just ok to amazing!You can switch between mouse&keyboard or controller at any time and is a nice feature.Tip:Drive with a controller,On foot use keyboard&mouse9.5/10 Great especially on sale			"

												Firstly, this game has a lot of issues (cough, cough Games for Windows live). If you're okay with sifting for solutions to crashes and failures to launch the game, then get it. Don't worry about the specs the game will stutter no matter what, it's just a really crappy pc port. However if you can look past that then it's a pretty ok game. The story is terrific, and the exploration aspects are still there in all their glory.			"

												Don't buy it.Specially if you have Windows 8 or later.You will install the game and it won't work.You will Google for a solution and you will have to go thru a ton of workarounds that are not guaranteed to solve the problem.You will need to uninstall and re-install lots of apps (Microsoft Live, SecuRom, Visual C++ 2005, etc).You will need to create an account on Rockstar Games Social Club even if you want to play offline.And in the end, after you spend 3 hours trying every solution you can find, it will still not work.It's too much trouble to go through for a 2008 game.After you buy a game on Steam, you shouldn't have to search for several different ways just to make it work. No one from Steam tested this before putting it out for sale?Shame on Steam for selling this crap without a big warning for their customers.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV is such a great game, which has a great story and gameplay. You're playing as Niko Bellic, that visits his cousin Roman in Liberty City. Niko wants to start a fresh new life, but doesn't go like he expected. He starts to work for everyone that pays, and ends out in a lot of troubles.The Voice Acting and Graphics is great, there is nothing to complain about there. It's a old game from 2008, so of course the graphis might not be the best. But they're stil really great. You can also download mods to the game, to make the game look even better.Also all the missions is very fun, there is always something to do. Even when  you're not on a mission, there is so much fun to do. Besides the good things, Grand Theft Auto IV is full of issues. Video Settings that's stuck, crashes, bugs, glitches and the last mission that can't be completed. Issues like this, should really be fixed. I used atleast 45 minutes to find a fix for all these issues, but that's also why I have made a list of the issues, and how to fix them. Click here	 to see the guide.To save the game and activate the game, you'll have to install and register the game through ""Windows Live Marketplace"" which really is a mess. It takes so long time, because you'll have to register a Windows Live Account, Xbox Account and then you'll have to setup a ""Gamertag"". You should really not go through all these things, just to play the story mode. That was really frustrating. But when you finally gets it to work, it's a great experience!Of course it's recommended, but be aware of these issues!7/10 -			"

												The game is a 10/10 on consoles. But a 6/10 on the PC. It was a f***ing hassle trying to get this game up and running. Even though I got it working, It still stutters and crashes sometimes. Instead of reviewing the PC port, i'll review the actual game itself. If you're expecting a San Andreas type game with chainsaws, flamethrowers, and jetpacks, You're not gonna be impressed. GTA IV has a dark story and very interesting characters throughout. It pretty much plays like a movie basically. The missions do get a little repetitive but the story really makes up for it. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous for its time. GTA IV in my opinion of all the GTAs has the best physics. The game is pretty much the most realistic out of all of them. The game does get very boring after the main story and all of the side missions. So the only thing that i guess is fun doing is trying to 100%. Otherwise, install insanely cool mods. So overall if you have a console I would HIGHLY suggest getting the game for that. But if you only have a PC, I would stick with another GTA game, unless you wanna go through all the sh*t that i had to start the damn game.			"

												Has really bad controls and retrying a failed mission involves doing it all over again. It doesn't help either that the game is punishingly hard and not fair. Playing this feels like a chore; all the design decisions come in the way of having fun.Many of these problems were fixed in Episodes from Liberty City, so I recommend that one instead. Also the fact that this game has a higher metascore than GTA V just goes to show how broken numbered reviews are. There is nothing better in this than V.			"

												This is curently my most played game on Steam. Somehow beats Grand Theft Auto V in some cases. I really enjoyed the story of the game. Despite the fact that this console port is a mess on PC, has loads of issues and problems - it is still really fun to play.Why you should play GTA IV:+ Great story, interesting characters+ City full of activities and adventures+ Fun open-world experienceWhy you should not play GTA IV:- GFWL (Games for Windows Live) integration and no SteamWorks- Even on high-end PCs it is difficult to maintain 60FPS (QHD, UHD), game is not smoothOverall, if you did not play this game yet, I really recommend you to try it.P.S. Game got an update on 2016 November and it have passed 6 years since last update (2010). This gives a hope, that the game will have SteamWorks integration, removed GFWL and maybe even port to SteamOS/Linux. This 2016 update is a small bugfix (for some major gameplay bugs) and minor optimizations, but anyway it shows that this game should not be burried yet. Hope this update was not the last one...			"

												I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone you have I'd say hmmm. Niko Bellic, a Serbian with no sympathy for human beings. I just completed this game, after playing it for the past couple of days. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUUsDthsK1YUC1xJpWANHQ It's a good way to go to a less crowded and kinder New York state than in real life. Except of course the cab drivers, the uptight people, the jerks on the street, the high level of crime, and there's a lot of parody in both the things said and the advertisements that have a similarity to real life. Pick this game up if you have a disdain for Russians or just want to see how long you can survive an onslaught on a six star wanted level. 10/10			"

												Ignoring all the Techical Problems, Ignoring Rockstars social club and GFWL, This is the first rockstar Grand theft Auto Game that really delves deep into a character emotions and moral structure, which is something so powerfull, never have we seen such a GTA character with such detailed back story, we are seing real emotions, and fearing consiquinces, as soon as niko beli gets off the boat and first steps foot in the amazingly constructed Liberty city, the game introduces us to Character so larger the life, so unique that portray real characteristics that instantly lovable, and it is fantastic to see Niko interacts with all these Characters and with the city. The Cars, The Boats, the guns, even having the accessable phone where you could call up a character anytime and talk to them and interact with them itself felt so special. Its so easy to be sucked into this game with its city that feels alive and the characters who feel real, i found the more and more i played i entered the world the more it felt real, and the deeper you dove into the story the more is revealed about Characters Pasts and you understood them more, GTA4 is a fantastic experience long and memorible and is worth getting lost into, and deserves every single bit of prase i can not recommend it enough This is a Fantastic Heartwearing Hallarious and Emotional masterpeice brought to you from what many people see as just another GTA game, but play the game and look deeper, and you will discover a whole new word from a fantastic point of view..Baddenix - 11/10 ""lets go bowling together""			"

You took a game, which when modded was easily the best game made in this genre. Then continuously updated it to F***over the modding community and everyone that is keeping this game alive. Games for windows live.... Rockstar club....  and constant DRM updates to block modding. Completely unlaunchable now. Thank you for running what was one of my favorite games. I've lost all faith in Rockstars ability to put out anything quality on PC. So dissapoined in that R* has become. Shame on you guys for forgetting your beginings.			"

												I love this game. It is fairly difficult to get the game to run on a lot of PC's, but once you get past that, it's a pretty good game. Here are a few of my tips to get the game to work:  Download X live less (it's not spelled like that, but Steam blocks it all out if I write it with no spaces) to disable Games for Windows - LIVE. This way, you don't have to bother making an Xbox account, installing Games for Windows - LIVE, and you will actually be able to save your game. If Social Club is giving you a hard time, disable it. To do this, go to your Grand Theft Auto IV directory, and find the file ""paul.dll"". Rename it to ""paul.dll.disabled"". This will disable Social Club, so once you launch the game, it will automatically open  the game, instead of bringing up the Social Club launcher.  This is important if you're running on Windows 8 or 8.1!  Run Steam as Administator. Find the Steam application on your desktop, right click, go to Properties, Advanced, and check the box that says ""Run as administrator"". If you don't do this, you will get an error, preventing you from playing the game.Now with all that out of the way, let's talk more about the game! Grand Theft Auto IV is very fun. The missions can become rather repetetive, but for this reason, you may want to do some other things around the city, like hanging out with friends or girlfriends, going to strip clubs, just driving around or taking rides in taxis, going on massive murder sprees, or just taking breaks from the game.Something great about the game is that, kind of like games from Telltale, choices you make tailors how the game will go. I won't give out any spoilers, but let's just say, you should have a backup of your save just before the end of the game, because the ending choice you make makes a huge difference.Although, there is a point in most games where it just gets boring. Say you didn't buy the DLC, and the base game doesn't have the spark anymore. To have some more fun again, you can download mods! There are many great mods from the game. Some of my favorites are the ""First Person"" mod, and the ""Traffic Load"" mod, which gives traffic more variety, and stops the annoying taxi bug, which occurs when you mod other cars in. There are also graphical mods to make the game look amazing, even almost real, if your PC can handle it. Long story short, it's a very fun game, once you get it working. I would only recommend to buy this game when it goes on sale though, considering how much of a pain it is to get the game working, and that it's not for everyone. Then, if you can't get it working, you only spend a couple bucks, rather than 20. Have a good one, everyone! If you have any questions about the game not working, feel free to message me or comment on my profile. I can't make any guarantees to help you, but I will try.			"

												I figured out how to play GTA IV on Windows 10! Below the review is how to do it.NO SPOILERS.Review:This game is amazing. Many people dislike it for its wonky driving, but the driving really isn't that bad. Once you get used to it, it is amazing to get into. Considering it was made in 2008, it was amazing for its time, and its still wonderful today. I beat this campaign about 3 times on PS3, but that was a while ago. I run it with everything maxed except no vsync, no night shadows, and view distance at 60, and I get ~ 60 fps. Build: http://pcpartpicker.com/b/XthqqsPros:+ Story. The story is really interesting, how you arrive in liberty city, throughout how your character (Niko Bellic) progresses through, and the very end of the main campaign.+ Combat/NPC. The combat is great, although the hand-to-hand combat is a little awkward on PC, but the gunplay is amazing. I have played enough San Andreas to know that GTA IV is a huge step up. The people you encounter, whether they are people you are shooting, people that are walking or driving, or even people you are hitting with your car have very fluid motions to them.+ Car Damage. Some people think it looks bad, but in my opinion it's great because the car deforms in many different areas. Unlike damage that's already programmed to happen, I'm pretty sure it has deformations that happen due to what you hit, sort of like Next Car Game: Wreckfest.Neutral:= Driving. It is a little like driving on ice. Also the cars have weight to them, so while it's good for plowing through a roadblock or rush hour, it's hard to stop and turn.Overall, I'd give this a 9/10 because it's amazing. I spent many a night staying up and playing this on PS3, and PC is even better.Windows 10 instructions:First off, this does require a thing called X Live Less. I'll explain once we get to it.If step 1 does not apply to you and your problem is that you click ""Play"" after entering your Social Club info, but the game doesn't launch, skip to step 4.WARNING: Updating the BIOS can be hazardous, so I recommend watching someone esle on YouTube update their BIOS so you kind of know what you are doing. 1. You need a flashdrive. A CD might work, but don't quote me on it. This first step is for anyone with a Gigabyte ga-z170x Gaming 5 motherboard. If it gets an error looking like this: http://postimg.org/image/9r1g2jrkz/ ... It's because your mobo's (motherboard) BIOS is out of date. Go here: http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5498#bios ... You can see that update F3 fixes for games getting error 8016. You can get that, or F4 which is what I got. The newer ones might work, but I don't know. 2. Download the BIOS update for your Continent, then put it on the flashdrive. Then extract the file (I recommend the program Winrar to extract things, it's free) in the flash drive. Once you do that, turn your system off and then turn it back on. Once the Gigabyte logo appears, press ""Delete"" (NOT backspace) enough times until you get into the BIOS Screen.3. Once there press F8 to get into the q-flash. This is how you update the BIOS. Click on the name of your flashdrive, then go into the BIOS folder that you extracted onto it, then click on that BIOS version. Then let it update. It will finish and might restart your computer a few times, but once you are on your desktop, you are golden!4. Now to fix GTA IV. Go here to download X Live Less: http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ ... The top download link works. Then make a folder somewhere and extract (I recommmend Winrar for extracting files, it's free) X Live Less into the folder. Go into the folder and you will find the files named ""xlive"" and ""xlive_d"". Go into your GTA IV folder (find your Steam folder and go to steamapps/common/Grand Theft Auto IV/GTAIV. Simply move both of the files ""xlive"" and ""xlive_d"" into the Grand Theft Auto IV folder and press ""Yes"" if it asks if you want to replace the current files with your new files. Then right click on the application GTAIV. Go to Compatability and check the box ""Run this program in compatability mode for:"" and then make sure it's set to Windows 7. Then click Apply.5. You probably want to do this step, but you might not need to. Sometimes the game won't let you increase graphics settings because you are 'out of memory.' Right click on the Grand Theft Auto IV game in your library on the Steam app and go to properties. Then click on Set Launch  Options and put in -norestrictions ... Then you will be able to set your graphics as much as you want!Now, unfortunately, I have not been able to play the game by pressing Play, because I am not able to see Niko or any other civilians. The only way I can play is to go the Grand Theft Auto IV folder and double click on LaunchGTAIV. The only downside to this is that it doesn't save how much time you play in the game on Steam. Just make a shortcut for LaunchGTAIV and put it on the desktop and you are good to go! Hope this helps!			"

												You can hang onto ledges and shimmy in this. Can you do that in GTA 5? No. You can't. Buy this instead.I honestly did find this one more memorable. Like the story never took 500 directions. A lot more memorable characters. Aside from that, the other better things I could think of are just the fighting. Fighting in GTA 5 is usually 1-2 punches and they die. GTA 4 you really have to fight. The DLC even had a fight club in TBoGT. And also a slightly different environment. Sure it was cool that GTA 5 had mountains and hills and stuff. But it won't be often you'll get that overflowing city feel of GTA 4. Nothing to climb up your car in, just a setting of New Jersery/New York City based areas. Bumper to bumper traffic that you almost can't escape only adding more and more to the difficulty when it comes to getting through traffic.			"

												Works GREAT with Windows 8.1 :) Also, you will need Games for Windows Live. Which is a must to play online. I like it, it's basically Xbox Live on your PC. The Online is fun, a lot of people play it, played on Modded Lobbies, really fun :) Worth it!			"

												I bought this game because it is summer sale and I thought ""just buy it! it's just 6€..."". After installing I was hyped to play GTA IV once more and men was I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥after this BSwith socialclub and windowslive...Once you overcame this you might think 'yeah I'm finally going to play this game'But you get punched right in the face for that... You have to spend alot of time finding outhow to change your graphics unless you live under a rock and want to play this in 800x600on lowest settings. (to fix this I right clicked on GTA IV in steam ->properties->starting options-> -norestrictions)After that initial pain in the♥♥♥♥♥i could finally play this ♥♥♥♥ing game on highest settings.So if you aren't willing to spend several hours just to get this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥fixed do yourselfa favor and don't but this. If you say I don't care go ahead and buy this..			"

												I was only 9 years old I loved bowling so much, I had all the balls and shoesI pray to Roman every night before bed thanking him for the life I've been given. Roman is love I say, Roman is life Niko overhears me and calls me a yokelI knew he was just jealous of my devotion for bowlingI called him a bumbaclotHe slaps me and sends me to go to sleep Im crying now, and my face hurts I lay in bed and its really cold A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me Its RomanI am so happy He whispers into my ear ""cousin, let's go bowling""He grabs me with his powerful bowling hands and puts me on my hands and knees I'm ready I spread my bowling shoes for RomanHe penetrates my bowling ballIt hurts so much but I do it for RomanI can feel my bowling ball tearing as my eyes start to water I push against his force I want to please RomanHe roars a mighty roar as he fills my ball with his love Niko walks in Roman looks him straight in the eye and says ""we shall hang out again soon"" Roman leaves through my window﻿			"

												Personally I think this is the best in the GTA series. The turn towards realistic gritty environments from the previous cartoonish GTAs is very much welcome and it keeps with the open ended sandbox feeling that have made GTA famous in the past. The detail of the city, physics, graphics, and overall feel of the game is second to none in its class and overall the game is enjoyable to play. There some bugs in multiplayer but nothing that will kill the game.			"

												GTA IV, what's there to say, IT'S GTA. The new Rage/Euphoria engine brings new life to the already awesome franchise, but to me, they missed the spot by making the game just city-based. It's not a huge gamechanger, but I really liked the SA map because it had the big open map. Other than that, it's a really good game, the vehicle damage is cool, driving feels a bit wonky but it's all good when you get the hang of it. Weapons feel good to me, nice damage, more realistic than some shooters.Vehicles, brand new, old, rusty, shiny, they are all there.All in all, it's an awesome game. I suggest that you try it and for the love of the TÖTEM PÖLE, get the Episodes from LC too, because it has so much more to it!			"

												Lots of whining here. Even when this game wasn't working, you could find your way around it and play it, but these ""geeks/nerds/ hardcore gamers"" are somehow too lazy to work it out, and just give up easily, like they do in life, you bunch of failures. Anyways, Rockstar has fixed the main issues with logging into Rockstar Social, and you can play it just fine. The only problem here is the lack of people playing it. Let's go back to the classics, people. The best online experience from the franchise so far. Trust me, you can buy it and it will work just fine, even online. Cheers! See you in the lobby!			"

												Honestly love this game, i have played it xbox so many times and it brings back memories. I recently bought a new gaming pc and wanted to replay gta 4. First i bumped up to all max settings as my pc well surpasses the requirments, the game looked great and hit good frames, but the game stuttered every 10 seconds. I used the auto config and the game looked and ran well but still suffers stutters! Then i went to play online with my friend but apparently to play i need xbox live gold! If you want to play this game online get a ps3 or xbox 360. Atleast on xbox and ps3 its optimised and still plays well.My Specs:Intel Core i3-4170 3.70 GHz8GB DDR3 RAMNVIDIA Geforce GTX 1050 Ti PALITWindows 8.1 x64 "

												I regret to say that while the game is/was great, it's not playable anymore. :(To save your progress it wants you to register a Windows Live account. Unfortunately the registration website does not exist anymore, so obviously there's no way to register (the site is just a 404, there's no redirection to any replacement service nor even a farewell message which is a shame). Unfortunately the game cannot comprehend the situation and it falls into an infinite loop as you cannot even just quit. I had to restart my Windows because I couldn't even start the Task Manager to shoot down GTA4 for some weird reason.I have owned GTA4 years ago when it came out and I enjoyed it very much. It's very unfortunate that the developers didn't expect that the registration website would ever be shut down. Let this be a lesson for everyone: if you create a game, make sure it's fully playable offline!			"

												O que dizer de Grand Theft Auto 4 ou GTA 4? Simplesmente um jogo Fantastico, é um dos meus GTAs Favoritos, e Recomendo Bastante, mas tem seus problemas. Vejamos:PROS:+Dura Bastante+Tem Mods+É um dos GTAs mais faceis de se instalar Mods+Com mod de gráfico, o gráfico do jogo fica Excelente e muito bonito+Personagens Excelentes, tanto do modo história quanto dos personagens dos Eventos Aleatorios+Bastante Realista+Retrata muito bem a realidade+Animações Muito Boas+História Excelente+Enredo Excelente+Missões do jogo Excelentes tanto as Missões da Campanha quanto das Missões Secundarias ou Eventos Aleatorios+Bastante escolhas na campanha do jogo que podem ou não mudar a história do jogo+Bastante Desafiador de se pegar o 100% do jogo igual é no GTA 5+Trilha Sonora Excelente+Muitas Radios nos carros e as Musicas em si das Radios do jogo é Excelentes+Fisica dos carros Excelentes+Dano aos Veiculos Muito bom+Jogabilidade Otima+Sons do jogo Excelentes+Internet ou Tecnologia dentro do jogo (EX: A Lan House, o Celular, etc, podendo assim chamar amigos e namoradas a passear e fazer atividades, um ponto muito excelente ao jogo), tem mais interações com os amigos e as namoradas do Niko Bellicetc.CONTRAS:-Pessimo porte pra PC, no inicio tive que ativar o serial do jogo manualmente sendo que comprei na steam por midia digital e deveria ter vindo ativado e tive que pegar um serial na internet que era valido pra eu poder ativar o serial do jogo, depois se você não estiver com o Game For Windows Live instalado em seu PC o jogo nem abre e se você nao tiver uma conta na Live você não consegui salvar o Save do jogo quando você ta online-O jogo esta Mal Otimizado, assim como o GTA EfLC (GTA Episodes from Liberty City)-Game For Windows Live, além de ser muito lixo, se você não estiver com o Game For Windows Live instalado em seu PC o jogo nem abre, se você não tiver uma conta na Live você não consegui salvar o Save do jogo quando você ta online, demora muito pra conectar e tem vezes que o Game For Windows Live nem conecta-Bug nas Cutscenes da História do jogo, varias vezes nas Cutscenes da um enorme zoom desnessesario e sem foco na imagem-O Sistema de colocar musicas no jogo é totalmente mal feito, você coloca a música na pasta User Music, em formato MP3 e não toca de jeito nenhum-O jogo demora muito pra iniciar e quando você dar Alt + Tab também demora muito tanto pra minimizar o jogo quanto pra voltar pro jogo-Sistema de Combate muito mal feito no caso dar Socos nos NPCs, varias vezes você manda se esquivar-se de um soco e não esquiva ou então varias vezes você dar um Soco no ar perto do NPC e não pega o soco no NPC-Sem o mod de gráfico, o gráfico do jogo é muito ruim tanto o gráfico quanto a iluminação do jogo-NPCs iguais aos NPCs de GTA 5 e GTA San Andreas não sabem dirigir nem uma Carroça-Patch 1.0.8.0, com esse novo Patch da Rockstar não tem quase mod nenhum, então a unica solução é dar Rollback a uma versão do jogo no caso a 1.0.7.0 se você quiser modificar o GTA 4 inteiro ou esperar pra ver se os Moders vão Atualizar os Mods pra versão 1.0.8.0 e espero que atualizem etc.NOTA: 10/10			"

												8/10 - I'm in the unpopular opinion about this but I think Grand Theft Auto IV (when talking about the entire trilogy) is a much much better game than Grand Theft Auto V, the latter which is massively overated. A departure from the previous entries in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV goes the more serious route, which both works in its favour but also hinders the game in many places as there is less focus on exploration, which helps the storyline but this in itself contridicts the fact that the game is an open world game. Now lets talk about the hoaky as ♥♥♥♥ physics, the physics to say the least are very uneven, in places it's relistic as ♥♥♥♥ and in other places its untter dogshit, if you can ignore this eventhing else in the game is basically pitch perfect. If you like games with serious cinematic stories this is the game for you			"

												My Rating: 8/10So where do I start? Well... This game doesnt have the ""latest graphics"" but I dont care. I just care about how colorful it is and the effort in voice acting as well as physics. First off, this game has boring colors but I think the voice acting plus physics were pretty good. Hell, the ragdoll physics were better in this game than Gta v. Its just the story can get kinda lackluster and the map looks plain and kind of boring. But it is detailed in some parts and there is a lot to do also. So basicly (Sorry if I misspelled that) you migrate from Europe to NYC or Liberty City. Your cousin Roman sent you loads of emails about big♥♥♥♥♥teties and vacuum like sukin. Also he emails you that he is a millionare and lives the American dream. Turns out he has a viarety of loansharks on his♥♥♥♥♥and he is poor. You help him and stuff. I haven't completed the story so the lackluster part may vary. Despite Windows Live you should buy this game. There are some bugs and stuff and Ive heard of some Windows 10 thing about how it crashes but there should be some fix. Anyways I had some fun with this game and multiplayer is kinda dead but I dont really care about that.The pros of GTA IV:+ The newest and up-to-date representation of Liberty City in this GTA title feels more like a living, breathing world due to the fact that you've got your NPCs conversing with one another and doing simple tasks like cleaning store windows despite its boring colors.+ The graphics for this multiplatform title look great for its time (2008).+ There are some nice little additions like being able to watch television and laugh at your depressing, narcassistic and cynical protagonist stumble drunkenly out of the local bar.+ Being able to store and bring up cheats on your phone.The cons of GTA IV:- While the graphics look great for its time, it doesn't help that there's this annoying blur-like mask covering the screen (most prominent on those sunny days). Especially in an age where games running on HDTVs are supposed to look crystal-clear. Thankfully, we didn't have this problem in Red Dead Redemption.- There is a certain lack of fun gameplay to be found in GTA IV and that's probably because the developers at Rockstar decided to tackle a more realistic gameplay experience (because it's realistic for the FBI to tackle a one-man army instead of the military, right?) Then again, dark, gritty, and realistic seems to be the trend for videogames in this generation.- Apparently, you have to PAY to get all of the fun stuff the developers omitted from GTA IV and put into the episodic DLC content. Great job making me feel like a sucker, Rockstar... - No real reward after you complete the story.- Lazlow isn't funny and the jokes are just terrible..			"

												Absolutely unbelievable that Rockstar Games has the audacity to leave that game in the stores.Do NOT buy this game if you have any newer than Windows 7. Even then I think you are out of luck if you have sth newer than Microsoft framework 3.5 .The problem lies in this game using 3 antiquities you do have no support whatsoever anymore- Securom (and old, dead DRM System)- Games for Windows Live - Microsoft Framework 3.5- An old social club login that won't connect to the server anymoreGranted, one might find a MFW 3.5, but after looking for 5 minutes I couldn't find a page with the full standalone(the 3MB webinstaller will only install the current 4.0) MFW 3.5 that didn't come from a shady looking site.But even if I could get the game to run, being in the presence of GFWL once more is reason is enough to climb the walls, but this game simply won't work anymore - atleast not via Steam, it ""might"" work with an actual hardcopy.I've been facing many scenarios like this before, but after 4 hours of frustration and trying to apply every possible fix I could find on the internet I'm throwing the towel - that is a first for me.Worst of all things is the lack of support by rockstar games. This is not a 2003 console port, which will blow up with by the potency of current GPUs, this is a friggen game of 2010 which still cost friggen 20 whopping bucks and rockstar seems to incompetent to throw this piece of garbage drm out of their .exe for a game that probably already has received all the damage piracy could have done to it.From Software removed gfwl weeks after it's dismissal.

												Played this gem for hundreds of hours back on the PS3, and it really saddens me to see how Rockstar Games decided to manage the PC/Steam version of it. Bad optimization and framerate stuttering aside, you can't even save your game if you don't have a GFWL account. And as we all know GFWL is pretty much dead and unresponsive, thus preventing me to create a damn account.Do not buy this game. You'll be better off playing it on an old-gen console.Bottom line is: Good game, bad port.			"

												Well, It was great on xbox. (Ran really bad on my computer, so i refunded it) The story, the content, the theme song, sound effects, pedestrians, and of course the physics make the game 10x better than GTA V. The only things that GTA V did better with, were the multiplayer and graphics. But that doesnt mean GTA IV is worse... No no my friend, in my opinion, GTA IV is a much better game than GTA V. It is a great game that you should check out! Also, there is a big, hard process that makes you make an account for social club, and Windows Live. It really sucks, But its worth it.			"

												Personally I think this is the best in the GTA series. The turn towards realistic gritty environments from the previous cartoonish GTAs is very much welcome and it keeps with the open ended sandbox feeling that have made GTA famous in the past. The detail of the city, physics, graphics, and overall feel of the game is second to none in its class and overall the game is enjoyable to play. There some bugs in multiplayer but nothing that will kill the game.			"

												If you are planning to buy GTA or ANY Steam game that was designed for console, READ THE REQUIREMENTS! I can't stress how much time & $$$ some people have lost on games that they can't play because of overly-complicated requirements. I just lost about $8.00...and I'm lucky it was on sale. It always asks for things that I already have or can't seem to get. It's just been a burden with all of the software that is ""required"" you'll run out of storage if you're not carefull! Just take my advise, READ THE REQUIREMENTS! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR!			"

												I used to play this non-stop back when it came out on PS3. The story is more mature than previous titles. The graphics looks amazing and the city feels full off lives and things to explore. I was a big fan of the added multiplayer but looking back at it now it probably lacked a lot of features but so did the main game which I never understood. Why wasn't there any airplanes or more stores to visit like the previous games.Well... those are minor complaints compared to how great the game is if you have a powerful enough PC to run it and the patience to endure Windows Live. 10/10			"

You will have to register with windows live, which requires a MICROSOFT ACCOUNT (Now I have a windows live account, a microsoft account, a social club account, a steam account and my mail to sign up for these AND THE GAME WON'T WORK because I can't login (while I'm pretty sure my password is right) when I try to retrieve my password I'm redirected to an offline website)EITHER UPDATE YOUR PLATFORM OR QUIT THE GAMING BUSINESS, MICROSOFT.While I recommend this game, I do not recommend anyone to buy this.

												As a game, it is flawed in many aspects, but as an immersing experience, GTA IV is simply unparalleled. Its problems cannot and should not be overlooked, but none of them break the game, and there is just so much charm packed into the thing that you can't stay mad for long. Sure, just clipping a police car and having it turn into a chase that takes you far away from your intended target is an abominable frustration, but soon, like a puppy that's just♥♥♥♥♥♥in your shoes, the game will do something completely adorable to make you put down your beating stick and take it out for a walk.

The combat and driving was a big let down but you can get mods to fix that problem. Even the small parts of the game made it that little bit more enjoyable, the internet for example at TW@T or some of the funny things some pederstians would say as you drove past them at 70MP/H.If anybody asked me if they should buy this masterpeice, I would say yes in a hearbeat.

												Whilst GTA 5 has come out, if you're like me and don't have a PS/XBOX, then GTA 4/EFLC is a good alternative. If you are craving some of that GTA fun, then you should get this until GTA 5 comes out on PC in November. It's also great to go back and play the game if you played it when it first came out. A good sequel to San Andreas and a lot of great vehicles and weapons (mostly in EFLC) to play around with in the sandbox that is Liberty City. If you get bored of the story or just messing around, there are thousands of mods out there. I recommend the Iron Man or Hulk Mods. This game has used up a lot of my spare time. If you have a spare £20, I recommend this game to you! I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but I think it is similar but has less content than the GTA 5 equivilant. Thanks for listening!			"

												Spent 1 ENTIRE night trying to get it to work. Doesn't save your game unless you're signed into GFWL. Doesn't work on Windows 8. Crashes ALOT. If GTA V has GFWL, there is no hope for that game on the PC platform.Remove GFWL fully, Rockstar, without making us use mods to remove it, and maybe I'll think about giving it a go.If you are serious about playing this game, and I do hope you are because this game is brilliant, but the fact is, the PC port is rubbish, but if you are serious about it, go and play the console version because I guarantee you that the console version of this game is 100x better than the PC port1/10P.S. If you're wondering why my playtime is 5 hours, it's because I left the game at the sign in screen, hunting through the internet for a solution, wondering what the heck I was doing with my life. Trying to make sh*t games playable is not worth my time anymore. I also wish I had a disk version of this on PC, so I could break it, put it in a blender, set it on fire and throw it in a volcano.

												After loging in to three different accounts to play this pile of console trash. Dealing with the absolute nightmare of trying to navigate to multiplayer. Having no control of which game you join. Playing with a group of children and stoners who blast the mic. Cars spinning constantly out of control making me question if the programers have ever driven a car before. This is a $5 game.			"

												One thing that I recommended you to buy this sheit is: (wait there are 2 things!)1. Tons of mod! They will make this game much more fun then it should!2. Video Editor! a heavenly feature for movie makers like me!Single player story? meh.. it is not strong enough, feels cliche and forgettable...Multiplayer? meeh (it is dead already, unless you want to play with your friends, that will be the opposite! :D )Other aspects are very good i can say..,The Conclusion? buy it!

												Recommended, but not without some heavy caveats. This is an exceptionally poorly optimized console port; there's a good chance you'll have to make some alterations to even get the game running. Beyond the whole Games for Windows Live wrestling match you'll encounter, the game will run with some video cards, but won't let you change the graphics settings to anything better than a minimum configuration (GTX 980 here), as it fails to correctly recognize your card having 2GB+ VRAM. Additionally, you'll likely get stuttering and other performance issues after running the game for a while, and while this can be corrected by force-changing the game's maximum available memory, it still resulted in numerous crashes for me, which were a pain given the game does not save mid-mission.The graphics have aged, and while they're fairly decent, they're still quite ugly in places. Modding helps resolve this issue, but it only makes the port's instability problems worse, particularly the stuttering, performance and crashing issues that arise after running it for a while (longer than an hour). Beyond that, you should know that the exceptionally occasional quicktime events in the game are tied to the game's framerate; in other words, turn that♥♥♥♥♥♥back to the console default of 30 FPS during the final mission or you'll face endless repeated failures due to your inability to climb into a certain helicopter.That said, the game is only $5 when on sale, so you won't lose anything but time and a degree of your sanity due to a lack of mission checkpoints and the likely event that you decide to mod the game only to succeed at making it that much more unstable. I'd say it's worth it, because port issues aside, GTAIV is pretty great as a game. GTAV made huge strides forward in nearly every way, but IV has a more likable protagonist and reinforces your preexisting hatred of bowling.			"

												Addicted, but disappointed.This game is something ive played for years on consoles and never got tired of, however, this PC Port is awful, the only reason people should get it is because of mods that make the game run. Also the fun mods, however this is the weirdest thing, this game runs on my Laptop with a few preformance mods on and some frame drops, however Garrys Mod can barely run on it. weird right?However if there is a sale I would advise you to pick up the game, im not blowing 20 bucks on it.

												GTA4 is a real life vehicle simulator where you are the victom who has had his vehicle stolen yet again for the 4th time and have to call out the police to file the paperwork then call your insurance adjuster to handle the situation so you can get a vehicle to make it to your job.  You have the choice of dozens of insurance companies but the one you choose to use will determine how much you get back for your vehicle and if you have a rental in the mean time which will help you get to work while you wait for them to recover yours or get a new one.  *Spoiler* Choose your insurance wisely and always have full coverage.

												Whilst GTA 5 has come out, if you're like me and don't have a PS/XBOX, then GTA 4/EFLC is a good alternative. If you are craving some of that GTA fun, then you should get this until GTA 5 comes out on PC in November. It's also great to go back and play the game if you played it when it first came out. A good sequel to San Andreas and a lot of great vehicles and weapons (mostly in EFLC) to play around with in the sandbox that is Liberty City. If you get bored of the story or just messing around, there are thousands of mods out there. I recommend the Iron Man or Hulk Mods. This game has used up a lot of my spare time. If you have a spare £20, I recommend this game to you! I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but I think it is similar but has less content than the GTA 5 equivilant. Thanks for listening!			"

												Grand Theft Auto 4 is a highly unoptomised however most computers can run it on low graphics even though it lookes junk that bad but it is still a fun game even so. The map detail is incredible nd you feel like you are living in New York, the AI are smart and realistic and the cars for once are actually heavy in this game. The only negative is that for half the game all you do is just go and kill someone, a group of people, or someone in a car. The only other mission that I have come across is following a helicopter and maybe getting a girlfriend. The phones in this game is pretty cool and also the limited access internet. Overall continuously being told to kill people is fun and entertaining whilst doing it in a realistic New York so for that I would recommend it. Though if you don't mind the age of a game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has much more variety of missions and more of an overall interesting map that you somehow develop an incetive to explore. You don't as much in GTA 4.			"

												This game basically rebooted GTA series with a story and characters you are fully invested untill the end.It feels like a real 100% drama with a great atmosphere of Liberty City(10/10)P.S.Of course I'm reviewing the game and not talking about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Games for Windows Live or bad PC port.

												Spent 1 ENTIRE night trying to get it to work. Doesn't save your game unless you're signed into GFWL. Doesn't work on Windows 8. Crashes ALOT. If GTA V has GFWL, there is no hope for that game on the PC platform.Remove GFWL fully, Rockstar, without making us use mods to remove it, and maybe I'll think about giving it a go.If you are serious about playing this game, and I do hope you are because this game is brilliant, but the fact is, the PC port is rubbish, but if you are serious about it, go and play the console version because I guarantee you that the console version of this game is 100x better than the PC port1/10P.S. If you're wondering why my playtime is 5 hours, it's because I left the game at the sign in screen, hunting through the internet for a solution, wondering what the heck I was doing with my life. Trying to make sh*t games playable is not worth my time anymore. I also wish I had a disk version of this on PC, so I could break it, put it in a blender, set it on fire and throw it in a volcano.

												I was a bit wary about this one by reputation, as it was said this was the most ""real"" of the GTA series to date; not that I ever played III or any of its companions, but I held GTA2 as the gold standard for over-the-top carnage and silliness to be expected of the franchise.  However!  Upon trying it, I was quickly impressed with *both* the immersion of the characters and the story (not something I give full credit to that easily) as well as simply the gameplay of it, and could still spend twice as long on rampages as I could playing the story straight and not get bored of them.  It has its limits, of course, and the mini-games and friendship/relationship aspect do lose their novelty not long in.. but for all that, this still would have to be one of the most enjoyable games I've played in recent times.  Well worth the investment!			"

												Ok before i begin, let me stress that GTA 4 itself is a good game.  I got it on the xbox originaly and thouroghly enjoyed it.  However, the PC port is basicaly broken.  Constant bugs and errors occured throughout my time playing the game.  However, the biggest flaw is games for windows live errors.  A considerable amount of uninstalling of various software needs to take place in order to be able to play the game due to the constant gfwl errors.  It is a terrible piece of software that causes constant inconvinience to those using it!  Overal,l In the state that it is in i would not reccomend it for PC.   However, on console it is a much better game.			"

												You can hang onto ledges and shimmy in this. Can you do that in GTA 5? No. You can't. Buy this instead.I honestly did find this one more memorable. Like the story never took 500 directions. A lot more memorable characters. Aside from that, the other better things I could think of are just the fighting. Fighting in GTA 5 is usually 1-2 punches and they die. GTA 4 you really have to fight. The DLC even had a fight club in TBoGT. And also a slightly different environment. Sure it was cool that GTA 5 had mountains and hills and stuff. But it won't be often you'll get that overflowing city feel of GTA 4. Nothing to climb up your car in, just a setting of New Jersery/New York City based areas. Bumper to bumper traffic that you almost can't escape only adding more and more to the difficulty when it comes to getting through traffic.			"

I beat this game once on the xbox 360 and i'm trying to complete it again on PC (with mods) Multiplayer is fun but would be even more fun if more people played it. It sucks that 12 year old CoD nerds are saying that the older gta games are terrible and that GTA V is the only good GTA game. Wrong, I like all GTA games, I even did a playthrough of GTA SA, GTA VC and GTA V on my youtube channel. If you like gta then buy this game.			"

												The game is really cool, but it has some disadvantages :1) there are no planes and parachutes - only one helicopter;2) driving is realistic, but very hard;3) missions are a bit monotonic.Anyways, I liked the game. I bought GTA IV : Complete Edition and I thing i didn't waste my money at all.I reccomend you buying this cool game!			"

												This is one of the most serious grand theft autos there is. You really take the role of Niko Bellic in a way that seems plausible in real life. The driving isn't all arcadey and fun in comparison to GTAV and the story is of a more serious tone. That said, the gameplay is still enjoyable and the satire is as entertaining as always.			"

Also, it's a good bowling simulator if you like those types of games. But seriously, gameplay was great, although a bit laggy, I fixed this problem via lowering my graphics, which didn't bother me.

												Ok before i begin, let me stress that GTA 4 itself is a good game.  I got it on the xbox originaly and thouroghly enjoyed it.  However, the PC port is basicaly broken.  Constant bugs and errors occured throughout my time playing the game.  However, the biggest flaw is games for windows live errors.  A considerable amount of uninstalling of various software needs to take place in order to be able to play the game due to the constant gfwl errors.  It is a terrible piece of software that causes constant inconvinience to those using it!  Overal,l In the state that it is in i would not reccomend it for PC.   However, on console it is a much better game.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV is, in my opinion, the best entry in the entire series.  The storyline is well thought out and emotional, with rich dialogue.  The game mechanics are also incredibly realistic.  At some points throughout the game, you will find yourself genuinely caring about some of the characters, which is rare in most games today.			"

												I remember not being able to play this game when it was just released because it was horribly optimized. It still is horribly optimized if you are wondering. But PC hardware has become stronger. So if you have a somewhat half decent PC then this game should easily do 60fps.As per the game, as opossed to many people I have talked with, I actually quite liked the story line, driving mechanism and crash damage. I have played some multiplayer in this game and honestly its bad. Worth it just for the single player experience.			"

												A diamond in the rough: GTA4 is Rockstar's first entry into the ""HD universe"" and it changed so much from GTA3, Vice City, and San Andreas. Right from the start the game's driving, shooting, and activities feel arguably unfun and mundane, the color filter gives fictional New York City a drab and dirty look. Pair that with bad PC port optimization and a delayed release after console versions, I can understand why a lot of people would give GTA4 a less than stellar review at first, and for a long time I almost felt betrayed by Rockstar until the DLCs fixed a lot of content fans were asking for.Until GTA5 dropped. While I do enjoy GTA5 for what it is, it has a lot of shallow elements and sacrifices subtlety+nuance for appealing fun. The harsh (not gritty thankfully) realism that GTA4 embraced and embodied in many facets made me appreciate its storytelling more. The *spoilers* unhappy endings of GTA4, mixed with protagonist Niko's inability to find and accomplish the American Dream, despite various risky ventures into crime, perfectly reflect the grim reality of many immigrants that come to America, despite all its glittering materialism and opportunities. *end spoilers* I thought this change from the 3D universe into a much more realistic, appearance and physics-wise, HD universe showed maturity in direction from what are basically regarded as ""mass hooker-and-cop murder simulator car stealer psycho"" games. GTA4 isn't perfect: some missions are plain bad/repetitive, the online portion feels incomplete, and the aforementioned optimization still is an issue on some 2016 machines. But I'd definitely recommend picking it up on sale bundled with the DLC if you liked any of the other GTA titles and skipped this one because of its mixed reviews, or always wanted to a more mature GTA title but didn't like the other titles.

												I've played multiple hours of this game on PS3, figured I would pick it up on here about one year...maybe two years ago?  It has never worked properly.  Even with a supposed recent update, the game is basically unplayable in the form you receive it in, unless you begin searching on Google what config commands you need.  Even then, the game does not render properly, and turns all buildings and roads invisible.So, GTA IV the game is fantastic.  GTA IV the PC port shouldn't be on the Steam store.  Rockstar needs to fix this thing before taking people's money for it.  Just seems messed up.			"

												As a game, it is flawed in many aspects, but as an immersing experience, GTA IV is simply unparalleled. Its problems cannot and should not be overlooked, but none of them break the game, and there is just so much charm packed into the thing that you can't stay mad for long. Sure, just clipping a police car and having it turn into a chase that takes you far away from your intended target is an abominable frustration, but soon, like a puppy that's just♥♥♥♥♥♥in your shoes, the game will do something completely adorable to make you put down your beating stick and take it out for a walk.

												Initially, I was hesitant whether to buy this game in view of many negative reviews, particularly on the difficulty of installation. While I did experience a bit hiccup when started the game for the first time, but that was solved within a couple of minutes and the game just works fine until today. Nevertheless, I do agree with most other reviews that a game should be user-friendly and easy to kick off after downloading. If you are a fan of GTA series, robably you just need a little patience to bear with initial setup process. Apart from that, it is indeed a nice game to play. Furthermore, at a discounted price, you should have nothing to complain about.			"

												Absolutely unbelievable that Rockstar Games has the audacity to leave that game in the stores.Do NOT buy this game if you have any newer than Windows 7. Even then I think you are out of luck if you have sth newer than Microsoft framework 3.5 .The problem lies in this game using 3 antiquities you do have no support whatsoever anymore- Securom (and old, dead DRM System)- Games for Windows Live - Microsoft Framework 3.5- An old social club login that won't connect to the server anymoreGranted, one might find a MFW 3.5, but after looking for 5 minutes I couldn't find a page with the full standalone(the 3MB webinstaller will only install the current 4.0) MFW 3.5 that didn't come from a shady looking site.But even if I could get the game to run, being in the presence of GFWL once more is reason is enough to climb the walls, but this game simply won't work anymore - atleast not via Steam, it ""might"" work with an actual hardcopy.I've been facing many scenarios like this before, but after 4 hours of frustration and trying to apply every possible fix I could find on the internet I'm throwing the towel - that is a first for me.Worst of all things is the lack of support by rockstar games. This is not a 2003 console port, which will blow up with by the potency of current GPUs, this is a friggen game of 2010 which still cost friggen 20 whopping bucks and rockstar seems to incompetent to throw this piece of garbage drm out of their .exe for a game that probably already has received all the damage piracy could have done to it.From Software removed gfwl weeks after it's dismissal.

												A diamond in the rough: GTA4 is Rockstar's first entry into the ""HD universe"" and it changed so much from GTA3, Vice City, and San Andreas. Right from the start the game's driving, shooting, and activities feel arguably unfun and mundane, the color filter gives fictional New York City a drab and dirty look. Pair that with bad PC port optimization and a delayed release after console versions, I can understand why a lot of people would give GTA4 a less than stellar review at first, and for a long time I almost felt betrayed by Rockstar until the DLCs fixed a lot of content fans were asking for.Until GTA5 dropped. While I do enjoy GTA5 for what it is, it has a lot of shallow elements and sacrifices subtlety+nuance for appealing fun. The harsh (not gritty thankfully) realism that GTA4 embraced and embodied in many facets made me appreciate its storytelling more. The *spoilers* unhappy endings of GTA4, mixed with protagonist Niko's inability to find and accomplish the American Dream, despite various risky ventures into crime, perfectly reflect the grim reality of many immigrants that come to America, despite all its glittering materialism and opportunities. *end spoilers* I thought this change from the 3D universe into a much more realistic, appearance and physics-wise, HD universe showed maturity in direction from what are basically regarded as ""mass hooker-and-cop murder simulator car stealer psycho"" games. GTA4 isn't perfect: some missions are plain bad/repetitive, the online portion feels incomplete, and the aforementioned optimization still is an issue on some 2016 machines. But I'd definitely recommend picking it up on sale bundled with the DLC if you liked any of the other GTA titles and skipped this one because of its mixed reviews, or always wanted to a more mature GTA title but didn't like the other titles.

												You can hang onto ledges and shimmy in this. Can you do that in GTA 5? No. You can't. Buy this instead.I honestly did find this one more memorable. Like the story never took 500 directions. A lot more memorable characters. Aside from that, the other better things I could think of are just the fighting. Fighting in GTA 5 is usually 1-2 punches and they die. GTA 4 you really have to fight. The DLC even had a fight club in TBoGT. And also a slightly different environment. Sure it was cool that GTA 5 had mountains and hills and stuff. But it won't be often you'll get that overflowing city feel of GTA 4. Nothing to climb up your car in, just a setting of New Jersery/New York City based areas. Bumper to bumper traffic that you almost can't escape only adding more and more to the difficulty when it comes to getting through traffic.			"

												I love this game. It has it's small problems, and it's well optimized. GTA V lags the sht out of you compared to this, and I'm using an I3 gen core with Intel HD 5500 graphics. So for those who say it's ""not optimized"", it is. You probably haven't fixed the restricted graphics settings or are playing in a bad/unsupported PC. Plus, the story is great. It has a REAL, tidy story like most of the old versions of GTA compared to GTA V. GTA V has a story and it is funny and serious at the same time, but the story in it is too short. Yeah, it's good. Get GTA IV now.			"

												GTA series has always been great. Main character was played well. Only problem is  graphics when playing on the computer. Oh, also missions. Some missions will crash your game, my game stopped at Mission #38: Three Leaf Clover when Niko robs a bank with a group of Irish guys. After taking the money, it would load forever and ever. You also cannot play online with an account, you have to play offline for the game to load.....Whenever the game DID work, I somewhat enjoyed it... but to be fair, there are plenty of other games to spend your $20 on.

First i bumped up to all max settings as my pc well surpasses the requirments, the game looked great and hit good frames, but the game stuttered every 10 seconds. I used the auto config and the game looked and ran well but still suffers stutters! Then i went to play online with my friend but apparently to play i need xbox live gold! If you want to play this game online get a ps3 or xbox 360. Atleast on xbox and ps3 its optimised and still plays well.My Specs:Intel Core i3-4170 3.70 GHz8GB DDR3 RAMNVIDIA Geforce GTX 1050 Ti PALITWindows 8.1 x64 "

												I used to play this non-stop back when it came out on PS3. The story is more mature than previous titles. The graphics looks amazing and the city feels full off lives and things to explore. I was a big fan of the added multiplayer but looking back at it now it probably lacked a lot of features but so did the main game which I never understood. Why wasn't there any airplanes or more stores to visit like the previous games.Well... those are minor complaints compared to how great the game is if you have a powerful enough PC to run it and the patience to endure Windows Live. 10/10			"

												Good Evening I'm Brian Williams, This game is great if you enjoy bowling. No, on a serious note, the negative reviews on this game are for the most part not about the game, but rather optimization. The game is TERRIBLY optimized for PC. I can usually play for about an hour MAX without the game crashing (this time seems to decrease if you have mods installed). So overall, if you are planning on buying this game for the story only and don't plan on using mods, then I would suggest you just buy it on the 360 or PS3 so you won't have to deal with the game crashing. Obviously if you no longer have one of those then just buy it for PC. However if you plan on using pretty ENB's and mods like LCPDFR, then buy it on PC.I hope this review helped you. I recommend this game only because I like the story.			"

												Initially, I was hesitant whether to buy this game in view of many negative reviews, particularly on the difficulty of installation. While I did experience a bit hiccup when started the game for the first time, but that was solved within a couple of minutes and the game just works fine until today. Nevertheless, I do agree with most other reviews that a game should be user-friendly and easy to kick off after downloading. If you are a fan of GTA series, robably you just need a little patience to bear with initial setup process. Apart from that, it is indeed a nice game to play. Furthermore, at a discounted price, you should have nothing to complain about.			"

												I would have loved to play this game. It has one problem though; Microsoft's innovative ''genious"", if you can call it that. I feel generous, so I'll give it better score than it actually deserves. 0.00000000000000000000/100. Not impressed.			"

												The missions, the mods, the story. This is a game about running from the police, no. This is a game where you HIJACK taxis and boats or even helicopters. No Grand Theft Auto is all of these and more the graphics are out of date but that's what mods are for, right. And ten years later still no less fun, but they need to down the specs to work better on low end Pc, when im at school or work, Yes. i game ALOT BEST GAME EVER I CAN SAY IT ANY MORE#7YearsRember GTA III and San Andreas? they bot had a 10 year aniverery, BETTER PORT BETTER GRAPHICS #REMASTERED			"

The game uses gfwl(games for windows live) an unsupported project from microsoft,            and when you start up the game it will prompt you to log in with a microsoft account; to            get around this download this dll http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/            and unpack it to your game folder:            C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Grand Theft Auto IV\GTAIV        3.

Its multiplayer features are really great to play with people but you must have a Live account (Microsoft) which is a downside. Also Rockstar Social Club is really annoying at times but you get use to it. All and all this game is great and I reccomend it to everyone 18+ (Because of the mature content).			"

												♥♥♥♥ everyone else. This game is amazing, and is better than GTA V in ways you wouldn't expect.People keep complaining on and on about the vehicle handling; just go download some mods you degenerate10 year olds.PROS++Good Story.+Funny Characters.+Lively City+Rockstar Replay editor. (PC Master race, ya filthy console peasants.)+GTA IV has a better mod community than GTA V, as it has so many more mods to play with.+The so called, ""Limited Video Memory Issue"" is easily fixable. Right click the game, go to properties, launch options, and put in ""-availablevidmem (How many hundreds of megabytes of VRAM that your graphics card has. Ex: 20.0 for 2 gigabytes)"" Fixed yer game? Quit complaining.+Easily upgradable graphics thanks to mods, so that those six year olds complaining about how datedGTA IV looks shut the hell up.+Better use of Euphoria than GTA V.+If you prefer realism over exaggeration, GTA IV is better than GTA V in that regard.+Better Car Damage than GTA V.+Great for ragdoll fanatics like me.This is a flawed masterpiece, so it does have it's share of downsides.CONS--The visuals are too grimy and a bit dated.-The game is very poorly optimized. (Play with the settings a bit, and use auto configure to combat this.)-Niko is very overpowered.-The stock car handling is Forza on urine.------Roman.-Multiplayer is dead.-Wall Cover mechanic is a bit clunky.-------------------------Games for Windows Live.This is a great game, but it mostly suffers from it's age. This isn't poor man's Grand Theft Auto. Get this game if you favor realism over style. I.E. GTA V.			"

												Dont even bother. Even with the recent update GFWL is still in place and makes the game unplayable. Sure the game launches but you still can not save your single player game without GFWL. I saw online that you can save if you use an offline profile but it seems even that is broken. There are not many games that I downvote but sadly this is one of them.			"

												Grand Theft Auto 4 is a highly unoptomised however most computers can run it on low graphics even though it lookes junk that bad but it is still a fun game even so. The map detail is incredible nd you feel like you are living in New York, the AI are smart and realistic and the cars for once are actually heavy in this game. The only negative is that for half the game all you do is just go and kill someone, a group of people, or someone in a car. The only other mission that I have come across is following a helicopter and maybe getting a girlfriend. The phones in this game is pretty cool and also the limited access internet. Overall continuously being told to kill people is fun and entertaining whilst doing it in a realistic New York so for that I would recommend it. Though if you don't mind the age of a game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has much more variety of missions and more of an overall interesting map that you somehow develop an incetive to explore. You don't as much in GTA 4.			"

												Another GTA game with an overly-long storyline. But this is the beauty of such games: free roaming plays such a powerful role in attracting a mass audience, giving anyone of any age (over eighteen) to navigate through the city, whether that be by modes of public transport as taxi, train or underground, to your own hijacked car/van/lorry/ambulance, to even marching on the pavement, pushing people to the floor freely (so long as the police aren't around). The roaming element means, even after you've completed it, you can still play it as though it was new.			"

												I used to love all the GTA 3 games and finally bought GTA IV. As the other games it's simply amazing. A big open world and so much to do. The only thing that was bothering me a bit was the reduction safe houses. After you progress to the second island you loose the safehouse on the first island and will never get another there. But that is only a minor flaw. After more than 120 hours I'm done with all quests and reached 100%. Now on to Liberty City stories...			"

												A great game, and the first entry into the ""HD universe"", this game I'll recommend despite it requiring a bunch of registrations and services.The storyline and the whole atmosphere are both, in fact, highly depressing, but the best thing is that it's still pretty playable storylinewise, and its atmosphere really makes you stick into it even more, something which is Rockstar's signature way to make games (seems depressing but also quite ""happy"" at the same time.The only two things that are wrong with this version is the registrations AND the mandatory download of the Windows Live services that you have to do and go through before being able to properly play this game, and the poor job that Rockstar's done with the port, requiring you to have extraordinarily high PC specs just to run it in mid or high settings.In overall though, GTA IV really has a special and touching story, something that was obviously been worked on for a long time.I recommend this, and its expansion pack too.

												Grand Theft Auto IV Review--Apart from some Slight Issues with the annoying cousin and little bugs, this game is a good, funny, awesome storyline game that has great land, sea and air physics and alsothe Map is great because its split into 3 parts. This game is really addictive and ive enjoyed the Online mods. would highly recommend if willing to mod for better graphics.(8/10, 69 Hours)			"

												Most people giving negative reviews  becaues   how broken the port is. And i can see why. But Once  you got the game working fine and smoothly (which is not as near as smooth) It can be quite  fun. I never played  GTA V. But I preferd GTA IVover  GTAV. it has more vairity then  5 and  has small little detail that   isn't  needed but at the same time it makes this game  outstandingly good. ( Ex: throwing rocks,  more into realism, and more things to do on multiplayer but  racing into some weird  maps like in gta 5)If you want this game  to work and save corretly, go to windows live tab, then sign in as a offline user. ( and start this game in administrator)			"

												I bet this game used to be awesome. I bet it would probably still be fun to play today. I'll never know, however, because Microsoft and Rockstar both screwed everyone and, despite trying everything suggested, this game just doesn't work for me on a fully patched Windows 10 system. Don't waste your money on this. If you're looking for nostalgia, you'll only find sadness and anger. GTA V is great, but GTA IV will apparently forever be that one GTA title that I never got to experience.			"

												I loved playing this game. I had it shelved in my steam library for a long time before finally deciding to play it again. Much to my dismay, this game has literally become 'abandonware', probably in lieu of GTA5. Basically: This game is the victim of being a single player game that requires you to sign in to a 'server' that no longer exists JUST to be able to save. There are probably other effects from this issue but I wouldn't even play past the first 5 minutes because of not being able to save.			"

												Firstly, this game has a lot of issues (cough, cough Games for Windows live). If you're okay with sifting for solutions to crashes and failures to launch the game, then get it. Don't worry about the specs the game will stutter no matter what, it's just a really crappy pc port. However if you can look past that then it's a pretty ok game. The story is terrific, and the exploration aspects are still there in all their glory.			"

												GTA IV and it's 2 major story add-ons are a great part of the Grand Theft Auto series. Sure, the PC version could have been optimized better, and Games For Windows Live integraation needs to be shut down ASAP, but it's still worth playing through at least once.Don't like GFWL? It'll be shut down by the middle of 2014 and this game will likely get complete Steam integration. Achievements, trading cards, cloud saving, the works!			"

												When you look at a dictionary and you look up “realism”, you’ll no doubt find Grand Theft Auto IV as one of the definitions. Not only are the graphics good, but there is also a stunning amount of visual detail. Be it the varied buildings, the occasional hot dog stand around a corner, the amount of litter on the streets, the citizens going on about their business or the cars accumulating dirt, this game is big and every little street, every little corner has something that you didn’t see in the last one. This game has a great atmosphere and a lot of immersion.The game is set in Liberty City, a spoof of New York City, and Alderney, a spoof of New Jersey. It retains all of the original boroughs of NYC and parodies them. The boroughs of Liberty City are Broker (Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (Bronx) and Algonquin (Manhattan).The game starts out with Niko Bellic, the protagonist, arriving to Liberty City illegally by boat, to be greeted by Roman, his rich, excited cousin, living in a mansion and owning multiple sports cars. Strangely, Roman arrives to Niko in a cheap cab. Later, Niko learns that Roman only owns a small taxi cab business and lives in a cheap apartment in one of the cheapest and grimiest areas of Liberty City: Hove Beach, the home of the Russian mafia. Roman is also addicted to gambling and has issues with paying his heavy debt to the Russian and Albanian mafias. Niko must earn money and try to survive long enough to start living The American Dream with Roman. And there’s only one way Niko knows how to do this.The plot is treated very maturely in this game. This isn’t a light hearted story of a man coming to the city and then running it in a few days with little resistance. Niko is new and small, and personal friendships are just as important as business partnerships. Eventually, Niko becomes more and more important, getting involved with the Russian mafia, Irish mob and even the Italian mob based in Alderney.The combat in the game is hit and miss. While it certainly is solid, it needs some refinements. The game is third person and it has cover shooter elements. So, press a button to take cover. In this game, the system that the game uses to find the best cover for you when you press the cover button is flawed. Sometimes, it will take cover on a wall completely opposite the enemies, which leaves you completely exposed and during the time it takes to get out of cover, they can easily gun you down. On the consoles, the player has a choice: either the camera automatically locks onto the enemies so you can quickly gun them down, or you can freely control it yourself. Generally, on consoles, the camera is controlled by a joystick, which is not nearly as precise as the mouse. On PC, however, the mouse controls are done perfectly and the default mouse sensitivity is great. You can also shoot while driving, and on console, this is impossible. Aiming while driving is difficult due to the impreciseness of a controller and the lack of lock-on. On PC, however, it is surprisingly incredibly easy.The biggest issue of this game is the inclusion of relationships. Niko can hang out with friends and date girlfriends. On paper, this seems cool, but in the game, they call you pretty often and the activities you can do quickly become boring and repetitive. Getting friends and girlfriends to like you can give you bonuses, like free taxi service, discounted weapons, removal of wanted rating and more, but it’s not always worth it.The driving physics in this game are pretty good and you can quickly master driving, but bikes are just impossible to handle. Not only do they get really high speeds out of nowhere, but they also steer terribly and tend to spin out. Niko can also steer boats and fly helicopters and there are no problems with boats, but helicopters are difficult to maneuver and the helicopter controls are terrible on PC.9.5/10PROS:+ Great attention to detail.+ Mature, realistic story.+ Intuitive driving controls.+ Wide amount of content and side missions.+ Immersive atmosphere.+ Realistic physics.CONS:- Mediocre PC port.- The movement controls can be frustrating and get you killed.- Not enough ways to spend money. No more real estate purchasing or car customization like San Andreas.- The helicopter and bike handling is too difficult.- Relationships get distracting and irritating quickly.			"

												I really enjoyed this game even though my computer doesn't have a strong enough graphics card to play it. I enjoyed the plot and the semi close to reality feeling with cell phones and getting together with other characters. Highly Recommend for mature audiences and for people with strong computers (good GPU)			"

												When I first got this game I wasn't super into it but this game quickly grew on me. The graphics in the game are great and all the missions keep you excited. the one thing I don't like about the PC version of the game is the controls for the helicopters, but that problem is easily fixed by just attatching an Xbox controller and play with that. Overall though this is one of the best games I have ever played.			"

												I don't know why people complain about this game being ""a terrible port"" Sure, it's not as easy as hitting install and then play but it's definitely not unplayable. All you have to do is uninstall the GFWL pack that came with the game and download an updated version for it, as for the graphics being terrible all you gotta do is set 2 commands for launch options and that is it. Haven't tried the online mode, nor do I intend to, but single player works fine on Windows 10. No crashes, no stutters, no freezes, just pure bliss.If you really can't be bothered to try to get it to work which honestly doesn't even take more than 5 minutes, then go buy an overpriced copy for your console of choice. :)			"

												Sorry to say bad things about a game I have played on XBox for years, but this is what I have experienced on my Next Gen PC.Pros:- Billions of mods to play with.- You think it will be awesome.- Have it on Xbox 360.- Refund is still possible.Cons:- You have a Windows 8.1/10? Wasted your money.- Game itself is dead and not updated anymore.- Ram is ok but it still uses old drivers = new Nvidia stuff isn't compatible anymore.- Compatibility options don't work either.- All command lines are outdated, so you shouldn't even bother.- Old GFW Live is dead too, new version isn't for this game.- No well known ""fix"" actually works anymore.- Spent a whole day trying all possible solutions. No good.This kind of ghost products shouldn't be on Steam anymore.

												Grand theft auto 4 is the best GTA in my opinion as far as story goes. It is very different from many GTA titles due to its more serious tone however it does have alot of personality similar to is predicesors. The balance between these two apsects is perfect and i feel like thats what distinguishes this Gta from the rest. You play as a immigrant named Niko Bellic Starting a new life in liberty city only to find out that things are not so different from the place he came from. The gameplay is a bit clunky by todays standards but once you get used to it, it wont really be too much of  a issue. The physics in this game are superior to gta v in every aspect and amplify the experience through their fun nature. The multiplayer is simplistic and fun unlike gta v where microtransactions seem to be the focus. This game is a 10/10. The only thing holding this title back is the lack of optimization on pc. Odds are you will have to fix it when you buy it like i have done multiple times. This is basically a console port to pc so be casious of that. However if your confident your pc can run it or you can fix it pick this title up.			"

												GTA IV is a pretty solid game, with an interesting story and some fun gunplay. The feel of shooting someone in GTA IV is brilliant, and extremely satisfying.Driving in GTA IV is alright. The controls feel sluggish, but it's not hard to do. Keep in mind, I am playing with a keyboard and mouse and not a controller.FLYING in GTA IV is terrible. I got to the helicopter mission and have yet to progress, because flying in this game is such a miserable experience. GTA IV is an action game, and is by no means a simulator, but I feel like they tried to make flying helicopters in GTA IV too realistic. Trying to fly anything that has semi-realistic controls with a keyboard and mouse is a traumatizing experience that I do not wish on anyone.Aside from that? Pretty solid game, in my opinion. I would only suggest buying this game if you have a controller, however, as I feel it would make the entire experience much more enjoyable.			"

												Despite some issues I have with being put in the shoes of such a character, this game is excellent. The characters are the most believable i've ever seen in a game with top-notch voicing and animation, the story is good, its hillarious at times, the city is incredibly immersive and the game has a HUGE amount of content.Technologically the game is a masterpiece - the city almost seems alive and it's a pleasure to drive around it's open-world and take in the sights, or just watch the traffic drive past and pedestrians go about their business - it is all overwhelmingly good.The amount of attention to detail is astonishing - the game even has fully functional Pool, Darts, Bowling and even a tetris like arcade game. And getting drunk is♥♥♥♥♥♥your-pants funny.One thing that got annoying very fast however was the saving system, which doesnt save just before the action sequences but when you get the mission - so you often have to backtrack 10-20 minutes. Dying in difficult missions can get frustrating fast.I also wish that there were some way to keep Niko's bodycount down - he is a noble soul and I just wish that the game realised that I was shooting cops in the leg instead of killing them - it would be nice to steer Niko in a slightly different direction.And one last thing - some kind of 'realism' or 'hardcore' mode would have been greatly appreciated, with cops enforcing traffic laws - things like that, it's all a little too easy.Overall though - 8.5/10 - Recommended big time.

												The fact that you have to create a microsoft live account just to save your progress is more frustrating than my cat having♥♥♥♥♥♥under the table. Saving is a basic feature that every game should have, regardless of wether or not someone wants to have a microsoft live account, or any online account for that matter. It took me 29 minutes until i eventually gave up. If you do try to create an account, good luck. You'll need it. Maybe it just doesn't work for me because i'm doing something wrong, but you shouldn't even have to in the first place. If you really want to play GTA, wait for a sale on 5. Please don't put yourself what i went through trying to get the game to use one of the most basic features of all time. There are plenty of other offline games that don't need any sort of account to save with. Buying 21.99$ worth of cat litter is a better investment. Just don't.			"

												tl;dr: This game is a hit or miss. YMMV.Probably not the best game in the GTA series, but certainly one of the worst PC Ports in existence. Only buy if you have a high-end PC. For me, with a FX-8350 and MSI R9 280x 3GB, my game barely managed to keep a steady 60 FPS on max w/o mods. Stuttering seems to be a huge issue with this game.Game includes Games for Windows Live, most of the time for me, it works and updates by itself but sometimes it doesn't, so YMMV.Changing settings seem a big pain for me, sometimes the bar doesn't move so I'm stuck with 640x480 or sometimes the bar moves, but the max it goes it 800x600.Have an iGPU with shared VRAM? Do not get this. I've had problems with my laptop on this game where it only detected the dedicated VRAM and didn't include shared and doesn't use it without setting an option on start-up, I think it was -norestrictions or something like that so it included my RAM.Anyways I have no comment with the story and haven't even really gotten deep into it even though I have 20 hours in my account because it's boring. I usually just blow up stuff and kill people because it's better than the story. Get Grand Theft Auto V instead.			"

												Ahh playing this on PC sure takes me back to the 100s of hours I played on the Xbox 360. Except now instead of playing the game at 30fps in an upscaled resolution with horrendous jagged lines everywhere, I'm enjoying a crisp, fluid 1080p experience with nearly every car in the game modeled to real life vehicles. Running over 40 pedestrians with a Shelby GT500? Why not? PC Master Race!			"

The graphics in the game are great and all the missions keep you excited. the one thing I don't like about the PC version of the game is the controls for the helicopters, but that problem is easily fixed by just attatching an Xbox controller and play with that.

												An epic mafia tale.The first of the 'next-generation' Grand Theft Auto games (in my opinion). This game will always be my favourite in the series. A return to the Liberty City from Grand Theft Auto 3, you take the role of immigrant Niko Bellic who makes the trip to the crime-infested city by boat on the urging of his Cousin Roman (bowling enthusiast). The Bellic's quickly find themselves entangled in a web of mafia intrigue and violence.The story of this game is by far (again, in my opinion) the best that Rockstar has ever made. The writing is sublime, the characters vivid and alive. When progressing through the game the city feels like a breathing and sometimes bleeding beast. The cast of characters tallies up to approximately 50 (48 I think), most of them are voiced and play a role in the story. While not all of the people have a deep back-story or intriguing facets to their character some of them truly shine through (for example: Cousin Roman, Little Jacob, and Mikhail Faustin).Graphically the game looks great - the colours and textures are understated and somber but they serve the scenery well. The game's graphics have stood the test of time fairy well, it would unfair to compare the graphics to those of newer games. With some modding the game's graphics can easily scale-up to the standard of the contemporary games of today. The music of course must be mentioned. The radio station feature is a staple in the franchise and it's well designed in this game. The game contains 23 different radio stations that can be heard when in a vehicle. The content of the stations vary greatly, some focus on different music styles and some are focused on talk-back radio content. The talking segments on the stations are very well written and are hilarious.The cars and the guns. The game sees the character drive (many, and varied) cars through Liberty City, achieving mission objectives. Some of these are need-for-speed esque chase sequences and others are more die-hard shoot outs. Often these two elements go hand-in-hand. Different cars have different control stats, making it difficult to drive some cars while others are smooth and glide easily. This learning curve can be aggravating but it isn't punishing. The gun controls can be wonky at times as the camera can be prone to derping. Summary:Overall, the game is a masterpiece. It's my personal favourite (mainly because of the mind-blowing story) and it's likely it will remain so for a long time. The city Rockstar have crafted (or revived) is stunning at times, and gritty at others. The players can partake in an epic mafia drama, wielding guns and various weapons to punish ""bad-guys"", as well as drive an array of cars that won't leave you bored with driving. If you do get bored, just call Roman for a cab (maybe for bowling, also)!			"

												Sorry to say bad things about a game I have played on XBox for years, but this is what I have experienced on my Next Gen PC.Pros:- Billions of mods to play with.- You think it will be awesome.- Have it on Xbox 360.- Refund is still possible.Cons:- You have a Windows 8.1/10? Wasted your money.- Game itself is dead and not updated anymore.- Ram is ok but it still uses old drivers = new Nvidia stuff isn't compatible anymore.- Compatibility options don't work either.- All command lines are outdated, so you shouldn't even bother.- Old GFW Live is dead too, new version isn't for this game.- No well known ""fix"" actually works anymore.- Spent a whole day trying all possible solutions. No good.This kind of ghost products shouldn't be on Steam anymore. It's sad, because Rockstar is working on GTA V only and have forgotten of this piece of art completely (I'm surprised that GTA SA still works...) You should still buy it for Xbox since it's a really good game. Spread the world, people.			"

												I'm not much of one for the GTA series, but the quality of the games can't be denied. If only the PC port had the same quality. Performance is bad, and dependence on GFWL is bad. I don't have much against GFWL, actually, but it needs to go because the service is shutting down. If you expect multiplayer to work, wait for Rockstar to hopefully do the right thing and remove it. And pray you have a powerful machine to actually run it properly.			"

												GTA IV takes place in Liberty City, in the year 2008.We play as Niko Bellic, an immigrant with a complicated past that just arrived in America, looking for a new life in the ""Land of opportunity""THE X.LIVE-LESS MOD IS ALMOST OBLIGATORY TO REMOVE GFWL, AND BE ABLE TO PLAY IT LIKE IT SHOULD BE PLAYED+ Great graphics for the time (still very good)+ Fantastic physics, the RAGE engine was/is groundbreaking+ The best car handling in the series and cars got damaged more easily (The best car chases of the series because of these factors)+ My favourite story of the series, the darkest one as well ( Niko is a badass and the best protagonist of GTA IMO)+ Big, very detailed open world, Liberty is still one of the most realistic looking cities in an open world game that I've ever seen (not as much variation as San Andreas or V, though)+ Nice variety of weapons (less than SA, though)+ Cars, motorcycles, helicopters, boats+ Great soundtrack, as expected from a GTA game (Especially Liberty Rock Radio)+ Huge mod community+ Combat was the Best in the series (Until V improved it)- Friend activities add a lot of detail to the story, but can get tiresome (this is very minor, as they are not required to progress the story)- Flying rats as the hidden collectibles, A LOT of them (Also minor, and only matters if you want 100% completion)- GFWL. One of the worst DRMs ever. (Fortunately removable by the x.live-less mod)- Terrible PC port. I still can't play it as smoothly as GTA V, many years after release- Less vehicle style variation than previous games (Bicycles and Planes are missing)- Less character customization than SA, on IV we can only change the clothes- Vehicles are not customizable (Mods kind of fix this)I still remember waiting anxiously for this game back in 2008, and even if it has a few less ""content"" than SA in some ways, it was totally worth it!One of my favourite games ever, completely recommended!

												Sorry to say bad things about a game I have played on XBox for years, but this is what I have experienced on my Next Gen PC.Pros:- Billions of mods to play with.- You think it will be awesome.- Have it on Xbox 360.- Refund is still possible.Cons:- You have a Windows 8.1/10? Wasted your money.- Game itself is dead and not updated anymore.- Ram is ok but it still uses old drivers = new Nvidia stuff isn't compatible anymore.- Compatibility options don't work either.- All command lines are outdated, so you shouldn't even bother.- Old GFW Live is dead too, new version isn't for this game.- No well known ""fix"" actually works anymore.- Spent a whole day trying all possible solutions. No good.This kind of ghost products shouldn't be on Steam anymore. It's sad, because Rockstar is working on GTA V only and have forgotten of this piece of art completely (I'm surprised that GTA SA still works...) You should still buy it for Xbox since it's a really good game. Spread the world, people.			"

												I don't know why people complain about this game being ""a terrible port"" Sure, it's not as easy as hitting install and then play but it's definitely not unplayable. All you have to do is uninstall the GFWL pack that came with the game and download an updated version for it, as for the graphics being terrible all you gotta do is set 2 commands for launch options and that is it. Haven't tried the online mode, nor do I intend to, but single player works fine on Windows 10. No crashes, no stutters, no freezes, just pure bliss.If you really can't be bothered to try to get it to work which honestly doesn't even take more than 5 minutes, then go buy an overpriced copy for your console of choice. :)			"

												Despite some issues I have with being put in the shoes of such a character, this game is excellent. The characters are the most believable i've ever seen in a game with top-notch voicing and animation, the story is good, its hillarious at times, the city is incredibly immersive and the game has a HUGE amount of content.Technologically the game is a masterpiece - the city almost seems alive and it's a pleasure to drive around it's open-world and take in the sights, or just watch the traffic drive past and pedestrians go about their business - it is all overwhelmingly good.The amount of attention to detail is astonishing - the game even has fully functional Pool, Darts, Bowling and even a tetris like arcade game. And getting drunk is♥♥♥♥♥♥your-pants funny.One thing that got annoying very fast however was the saving system, which doesnt save just before the action sequences but when you get the mission - so you often have to backtrack 10-20 minutes. Dying in difficult missions can get frustrating fast.I also wish that there were some way to keep Niko's bodycount down - he is a noble soul and I just wish that the game realised that I was shooting cops in the leg instead of killing them - it would be nice to steer Niko in a slightly different direction.And one last thing - some kind of 'realism' or 'hardcore' mode would have been greatly appreciated, with cops enforcing traffic laws - things like that, it's all a little too easy.Overall though - 8.5/10 - Recommended big time.

												When you look at a dictionary and you look up “realism”, you’ll no doubt find Grand Theft Auto IV as one of the definitions. Not only are the graphics good, but there is also a stunning amount of visual detail. Be it the varied buildings, the occasional hot dog stand around a corner, the amount of litter on the streets, the citizens going on about their business or the cars accumulating dirt, this game is big and every little street, every little corner has something that you didn’t see in the last one. This game has a great atmosphere and a lot of immersion.The game is set in Liberty City, a spoof of New York City, and Alderney, a spoof of New Jersey. It retains all of the original boroughs of NYC and parodies them. The boroughs of Liberty City are Broker (Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (Bronx) and Algonquin (Manhattan).The game starts out with Niko Bellic, the protagonist, arriving to Liberty City illegally by boat, to be greeted by Roman, his rich, excited cousin, living in a mansion and owning multiple sports cars. Strangely, Roman arrives to Niko in a cheap cab. Later, Niko learns that Roman only owns a small taxi cab business and lives in a cheap apartment in one of the cheapest and grimiest areas of Liberty City: Hove Beach, the home of the Russian mafia. Roman is also addicted to gambling and has issues with paying his heavy debt to the Russian and Albanian mafias. Niko must earn money and try to survive long enough to start living The American Dream with Roman. And there’s only one way Niko knows how to do this.The plot is treated very maturely in this game. This isn’t a light hearted story of a man coming to the city and then running it in a few days with little resistance. Niko is new and small, and personal friendships are just as important as business partnerships. Eventually, Niko becomes more and more important, getting involved with the Russian mafia, Irish mob and even the Italian mob based in Alderney.The combat in the game is hit and miss. While it certainly is solid, it needs some refinements. The game is third person and it has cover shooter elements. So, press a button to take cover. In this game, the system that the game uses to find the best cover for you when you press the cover button is flawed. Sometimes, it will take cover on a wall completely opposite the enemies, which leaves you completely exposed and during the time it takes to get out of cover, they can easily gun you down. On the consoles, the player has a choice: either the camera automatically locks onto the enemies so you can quickly gun them down, or you can freely control it yourself. Generally, on consoles, the camera is controlled by a joystick, which is not nearly as precise as the mouse. On PC, however, the mouse controls are done perfectly and the default mouse sensitivity is great. You can also shoot while driving, and on console, this is impossible. Aiming while driving is difficult due to the impreciseness of a controller and the lack of lock-on. On PC, however, it is surprisingly incredibly easy.The biggest issue of this game is the inclusion of relationships. Niko can hang out with friends and date girlfriends. On paper, this seems cool, but in the game, they call you pretty often and the activities you can do quickly become boring and repetitive. Getting friends and girlfriends to like you can give you bonuses, like free taxi service, discounted weapons, removal of wanted rating and more, but it’s not always worth it.The driving physics in this game are pretty good and you can quickly master driving, but bikes are just impossible to handle. Not only do they get really high speeds out of nowhere, but they also steer terribly and tend to spin out. Niko can also steer boats and fly helicopters and there are no problems with boats, but helicopters are difficult to maneuver and the helicopter controls are terrible on PC.9.5/10PROS:+ Great attention to detail.+ Mature, realistic story.+ Intuitive driving controls.+ Wide amount of content and side missions.+ Immersive atmosphere.+ Realistic physics.CONS:- Mediocre PC port.- The movement controls can be frustrating and get you killed.- Not enough ways to spend money. No more real estate purchasing or car customization like San Andreas.- The helicopter and bike handling is too difficult.- Relationships get distracting and irritating quickly.			"

												Afer hours and hours of going through the headache-inducing experience that was getting the game to EVEN WORK on windows 10, we had the displeasure of seeing that the online was not a possibility anymore (not listed anywhere, by the way), so we thought, ""okay no problem we can just use hamachi and fake a LAN game), and after the even more painful steps of setting up Hamachi, a ping limit fixer, setting all the launch options, etc. (my point is there is an insane amount of hassle to even get this game to run, let alone run with a friend) we find out that even our LAN game won't be working. We have no way of playing with each other, as advertised is possible, and as was our original intention with the game, and now we have no use for the game.   Please either fix the game on the store to let the player know that the online is completely screwed, because there is really almost no way to even play the game offline, and I'm fairly sure there's no way to play onlnine. This is an atrocity of a game, do NOT bother.			"

												At first, I couldn't get past the Social Club error. But then I fixed it for myself.It is a really fun game. Still few players online (If people knew how to fix the game, there would be more). I would rate this 8/10 - 2 points off because Rockstar needs to fix this error.This worked for me:
#1. Go to add or remove
#2. Uninstall Microsoft Games for Windows & the MGFW - LIVE Redistribution
#3. Install http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient
#4. Go to your local file GTA IV and rename paul.dll to paul.dll.disabled
#5. Open the game in steam and you should be able to boot up into the game without signing into Social Club.
#6. Sign into Windows Live in-game (push home button)
#7. It should ask for you to update, say yes.
#8. After it says it done updating and ask you to exit, Exit the game, a installation should appear.
#9. Install. Then go back to the game.
#10. Make sure you are online on Windows live before starting, and now check to see if Multiplayer works. (Don't do Ranked because nobody does ranked any more. I suggest doing custom search.)

Can't change your graphics?
In the advance boot in GTA IV properties, you put this in:

												The worst GTA game I've ever played.HUGE step forward from the previous title in terms of mechanics and such, but is it enough reason to put this game on every relevant toplist?I'm just sad to see that a better, more realistic system seems to be more important in a video game these days than the actual enjoyablity. Unlike Vice city, or San Andreas, what GTA 4 has to offer is a completely gray city, with gray streets, gray buildings, gray waters (i swear, even the parks look gray!), and gray characters, whom you'd immediately forget, if it wasn't for the constant phone calls you recieve from them, asking you to hang out with them. The missions are pretty fun, but usually ruined by boring characters with accents, who seem to take everything seriously, instead of the fun, casual attitude which was so common in previous titles.The protagonist is an Eastern European immigrant, which would be all right for a secondary character, but oh my god, listening to his voice throughout the game... also, he always talks about his dark past, his pessimistic view on the future, which makes me sad just from playing the game. And I'm an Eustern European, I'm used to all this, so I've no idea what people from other parts of the world are going through when playing this game. Maybe for them, it's exotic. I don't know.So what made this game so popular? - the multiplayer.Which is no more. Well, officially, there's nothing wrong with it. You just can't play it whenever you want to. You try to log in to the Social Club and pray... sometimes it works... most of the time it doesn't...I played the campaign back when it came out, now I got the game when it was on sale, because a couple of riends and I decided to have fun in multiplayer (GTA 5 won't run on my PC, that's why I'm here). Turns out it was a waste of money.Even though I didn't like the campaign, someone might do, but keep in mind that this game has none of the magic of Vice City or SA.If you're interested in the MP, forget it, it's not working. And believe me, it's not because people are too stupid to use it(as some reviews say)... clicking the Log In button 20 times and failing, then trying again 5 minutes later and succeeding? You try telling people that it's their fault.			"

												Despite the need to fix the GFWL drm issues if you love single player GTA then grab this. The multiplayer still works but is dead, so unless you have a group of mates wanting to play with you don't bother.They really should fix the GFWL issue, but don't count on it.			"

												I'm suprised I'm having to leave a negative review for a GTA game, it's a good game overall, but it's a really badly optimized port, even on minimum it drops below 30fps, and I can run GTA V maxed out at over 60fps on my i5 3570k, 8GB ram, and a GTX 1070. Even when maxed out it still looks terrible.Yeah there are tips and tricks you can do to get it running a little better, but you shouldn't have to, it should be optimized right out the box.Suprisingly, I'd recommend playing this on console rather than PC.

												So I heard they just updated the game, so I was kind of excited to go back to it and play since I could never really complete it due to the bad state it was in, I thought they'd fix the game with this new update after 6 years, but what did they do? well I don't know but as far as i'm concerned they didn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥with it or at least nothing to actually fix it, I just installed the game... I literally just installed fresh, and first time I opened it asks me to log into the useless rockstar club app, which they had taken away in early updates and now they brought it back, and also into games for windows live which no one uses anymore, to then just get stuck in the log-in screen of GFWL, second try the game gets stuck in the steam overlay, third try the game gets stuck in the main menu, fourth try the game starts, it loaded a new game; plays the intro and then minutes before i could actually start playing, the game minimizes and tells me that there have been some sort of critical error within GTA V and that I need to reinstall the game, at the end of the message i see this -3 which I don't why it made me think it was some kind of bad joke from the devs, so I clicked and went back in game just for it to actually crash within matter of seconds, so I just uninstalled it after just installing it, almost 3 years of looking at it like a pariah, but with this now this game in front of me is nothing but trash. i'm sorry if this ""offends"" anyon, like i really care about it, but it's my truth and it just makes me hate the game, i would say not its story but i haven't played it enough to know if it's even good or not.If you want a good advice, don't bother with this game, don't buy, don't even look at it, if you have the console version PS3/XBOX 360 just stick with that because the PC version is a complete disaster, something i'd even dare to call a plain scam to be honest.And just to add a tiny bit more, there was a point with this game in which SecuROM wouldn't allow me to play the game, i was so frustrated and literally the only way i could play the game was by using a pirated executable, like seriously? that was the only way i managed to get the game running after i bought it.

												THE Grand Theft AutoGrand Theft Auto IV..where to begin.This game honestly has to be my favourite game of all time.Why? there's alot of reasons why I think this game is a disc injected with liquid platinum.Gameplay:What makes GTA games great? Aside from the story (See below),the franchise has become a titan in the gaming scene because of its addictive gameplay.If you are not completing story missions, you can roam around Liberty City.While doing this you can steal cars,aircraft,go on shoot outs,enjoy the many activities around the city or just screw around doing whatever you feel like doing.The reason I like this game best out of the franchise is because of how well the concept was executed.It captures the GTA feel, of being a criminal in a dark,unforgiving world but contrasts with the fun of messing around.The story (SPOILERS,MATE)You are Niko Bellic,a off-the boat immigrant who is looking to flee is past life of war and despair (and because his cousin claimed to be living it big).What he doesn't know is that he and his cousin get them involved with criminals,the government,the mafia and dangerous people who track him down.You make descisions to kill or free people, which can be kind of hard since it is usaually your friends.He is on the hunt for Darko Brevic,who killed 12 of his sqaud mates in the war.He does jobs for drug dealers,Russians,the mafia and a Irish crime family.Along the way (quite early actually) he meets Dimitri Rascalov,assistant of someone Niko works for.Little does he know he betrays him,destroying Niko and Romans houses,businesses and general lifestyle.Later on, he is contacted by the UL paper (govornment blokes) and is hired to kill terrorists and heat makers.After doing many jobs for the ULP and his friends,the ULP contact and a Mafia boss help Niko find Darko,where you can choose to kill him or let him live his painful life.Soon after,Niko attends Roman and his cab assistants wedding where,depending upon the players choice,Roman is shot and killed or Nikos Girlfriend is killed (very sad scene ;( ) you then kill the mob boss or Dimitri,and Niko settles down and continues his life with his remaining friends.Overall:The best GTA game out there (also one of the best games in general imo).You can clock over 1500 hours like me (not on this account obviously,on xbox and previous account) and still have fun.

												This game is about a man trying to deal with his desire to revenge. Niko Bellic, the antagonist of this story is a Russian immigrant coming to Liberty City (the game vision of New York). The game is funny of course but it also allows us to see the low sides of criminal lives. At no time did I feel anything too cliche or unoriginal, even with all the betrayl and backstabbing in this game.This game looks visually amazing, espically if you care to put mods in it, and the screenshots in my profile are a good representation of it. Driving in an Audi in the middle of Times Square in the middle of a raining night looked absolutely amazing and thats also thanks to the very diverse pedestrians engine. The city comes to life through it, it feels alive, real, and also dark and courrpted. The weather system is amazing, not once did I shake in my chair to the sound of a thunder in the game, and not once did I stop to admire the cloudy beautiful skys and the shiny cars. Even though the game is a bad port failing to run even on a newer systems, the mods make up to that and work on low specs computers as well. The audio in this game is also an unforgetable experience: the music selection is very good and more importantly you get to listen to your own tunes if you choose to do so. The voices in this game are also beliveable and unique, from the heavily russian accent speaker Niko to the fast talker Jacob. The game conveys the feel of an overcrowded, overpopulated city through the sounds of car horns, lines of taxies, endless people and more and more.Some might see the fact the city is small as a downside, and for them I can also say try San Andreas or GTA V. I don't think this game could have been set anywhere else. The gameplay: the shooting, the driving, the social system feels fun and fluid and not forced. By the social system I mean to the fact that you can arrange meeting and date characters in the game through your cellphone.Basicly I can say that Rockstar has outdone themselves with this game and I can't wait to play the DLCs.

												Runs about as well as a potato trying to power a porchlight on my best. (Hp envy with amd graphics card, 12gb ram, windows 8.1, quad-core processor)Whoever says pc gaming is master race has never tried to play GTA IV on pc before. Please, save your frustration, and buy a used copy for your XB360 or PS3. Every 2-3 seconds my screen slightly lags, and I'm playing single player, on a very low resolution.It sucks really, that this game still lags, even at its lowest settings. I'm not sure if it's the Rockstar Social Club, or GFWL, or windows 8.1, but I've played smoother games before. This one will take a lot of patience, if you've already made the splurge to get it. It's like a mixed bag; you win a little, you lose just as much or more. In this case, if you buy it on sale, I'm sure the money saved will barely make the game worth the frustration.Also, I'm using the commandline.txt and still see little to no difference.It's a shame really, I thought this would be hilarious to play, because I got a good chuckle from Roman, but sadly, the best thing you can do is steer clear of this one.

												This game is very good, however, the physics are poor, very poor, I have played GTA: V (now it has been released) and the physics are incompairable. The physics are so much better! I was slightly annoyed at the glitches that never were fixed. But, I love the game overall, the graphics are good it is a shame the physics aren't as good! 7.5/10 therefore, Positive!			"

												The worst GTA game I've ever played.HUGE step forward from the previous title in terms of mechanics and such, but is it enough reason to put this game on every relevant toplist?I'm just sad to see that a better, more realistic system seems to be more important in a video game these days than the actual enjoyablity. Unlike Vice city, or San Andreas, what GTA 4 has to offer is a completely gray city, with gray streets, gray buildings, gray waters (i swear, even the parks look gray!), and gray characters, whom you'd immediately forget, if it wasn't for the constant phone calls you recieve from them, asking you to hang out with them. The missions are pretty fun, but usually ruined by boring characters with accents, who seem to take everything seriously, instead of the fun, casual attitude which was so common in previous titles.The protagonist is an Eastern European immigrant, which would be all right for a secondary character, but oh my god, listening to his voice throughout the game... also, he always talks about his dark past, his pessimistic view on the future, which makes me sad just from playing the game. And I'm an Eustern European, I'm used to all this, so I've no idea what people from other parts of the world are going through when playing this game. Maybe for them, it's exotic. I don't know.So what made this game so popular? - the multiplayer.Which is no more. Well, officially, there's nothing wrong with it. You just can't play it whenever you want to. You try to log in to the Social Club and pray... sometimes it works... most of the time it doesn't...I played the campaign back when it came out, now I got the game when it was on sale, because a couple of riends and I decided to have fun in multiplayer (GTA 5 won't run on my PC, that's why I'm here). Turns out it was a waste of money.Even though I didn't like the campaign, someone might do, but keep in mind that this game has none of the magic of Vice City or SA.If you're interested in the MP, forget it, it's not working. And believe me, it's not because people are too stupid to use it(as some reviews say)... clicking the Log In button 20 times and failing, then trying again 5 minutes later and succeeding? You try telling people that it's their fault.			"

												I'm suprised I'm having to leave a negative review for a GTA game, it's a good game overall, but it's a really badly optimized port, even on minimum it drops below 30fps, and I can run GTA V maxed out at over 60fps on my i5 3570k, 8GB ram, and a GTX 1070. Even when maxed out it still looks terrible.Yeah there are tips and tricks you can do to get it running a little better, but you shouldn't have to, it should be optimized right out the box.Suprisingly, I'd recommend playing this on console rather than PC.

												This game is hard to recommend, mainly because you can't run it on Windows 10. Just no. Nada. No matter how many hours you go searching on the internet for fixes and fiddle with the local files, you won't get any kind of smooth performance from this. Don't buy if you don't want to deal with this.It's sad, because GTA IV is fantastic, and although it isn't without it's faults like it's sloppy driving physics, repetitive missions and it's slow (but still good) story and pacing, it's still a GTA through and through. On top of that, it's modding community alone is worth a buy, even if you already have it on consoles (like me).My recommendation would be to obtain or build a ""Period PC"" for this game (I would go for a Core 2 Quad or Duo partnered with something like a Radeon HD 5770 or similar, with a few gigs of RAM), with an install of Windows XP or {if you have some sort of deathwish) Vista. And this is all assuming you would go through all the fuss anyway just to play a game that's nearly a decade old without support, when you can buy GTA V that would be cheaper and easier than running around eBay or craigslist for ageing hardware (or rummaging around your attic for that old Vista pre-built), and will run on an operating system that you could comfortly live on.I mean, seriously, San Andreas runs better on newer hardware...Through all this, I would still recommend, if you're willing to put up with it. Because it's one of the best games from the last decade if you can run it.**EDIT**: Apparently, there's been a recent update that improves the optimisation for Windows 7 and up. Yeah. 7 years after it was originally released. I haven't tried it yet, as I don't want to mess about with GFWL and the Rocksatr Social Club again, so I still stand by getting an old PC to run it if you really, really want to.			"

The driving and the shooting are  bit funky, but once you get used to it its very funny to watch crash into a post and see Niko fly out the windshield or push people down the stairs.Pros-Interesting story (Episodes from Liberty City tie into GTAIV)-New York style city-Loveable characters -Mod support-Easy to mod the gameCons-Unoptimized -Modding can be a pain (Sometimes mods uses so much RAM the world dissapears)-Latest version of the game is unoptimized, but has lots of mods, while earlier versions are optimized better, but lack mods.Overall good game, pick it up during a sale (maybe even Episodes from Libery City, it includes all 3 games)			"

												I like the realistic simulation of driving on ice whenever you attempt to drive a car, and I also like Rockstar's perfect representation of New York: drab, grey, and full of people taht want to hurt you. If it had some more memes I might make it my game of every-year.7/10 - Niko's face was too annyoing and Michelle betrayed my trust, I thought our relationship was something special.			"

												So I heard they just updated the game, so I was kind of excited to go back to it and play since I could never really complete it due to the bad state it was in, I thought they'd fix the game with this new update after 6 years, but what did they do? well I don't know but as far as i'm concerned they didn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥with it or at least nothing to actually fix it, I just installed the game... I literally just installed fresh, and first time I opened it asks me to log into the useless rockstar club app, which they had taken away in early updates and now they brought it back, and also into games for windows live which no one uses anymore, to then just get stuck in the log-in screen of GFWL, second try the game gets stuck in the steam overlay, third try the game gets stuck in the main menu, fourth try the game starts, it loaded a new game; plays the intro and then minutes before i could actually start playing, the game minimizes and tells me that there have been some sort of critical error within GTA V and that I need to reinstall the game, at the end of the message i see this -3 which I don't why it made me think it was some kind of bad joke from the devs, so I clicked and went back in game just for it to actually crash within matter of seconds, so I just uninstalled it after just installing it, almost 3 years of looking at it like a pariah, but with this now this game in front of me is nothing but trash. i'm sorry if this ""offends"" anyon, like i really care about it, but it's my truth and it just makes me hate the game, i would say not its story but i haven't played it enough to know if it's even good or not.If you want a good advice, don't bother with this game, don't buy, don't even look at it, if you have the console version PS3/XBOX 360 just stick with that because the PC version is a complete disaster, something i'd even dare to call a plain scam to be honest.And just to add a tiny bit more, there was a point with this game in which SecuROM wouldn't allow me to play the game, i was so frustrated and literally the only way i could play the game was by using a pirated executable, like seriously? that was the only way i managed to get the game running after i bought it.

												THE Grand Theft AutoGrand Theft Auto IV..where to begin.This game honestly has to be my favourite game of all time.Why? there's alot of reasons why I think this game is a disc injected with liquid platinum.Gameplay:What makes GTA games great? Aside from the story (See below),the franchise has become a titan in the gaming scene because of its addictive gameplay.If you are not completing story missions, you can roam around Liberty City.While doing this you can steal cars,aircraft,go on shoot outs,enjoy the many activities around the city or just screw around doing whatever you feel like doing.The reason I like this game best out of the franchise is because of how well the concept was executed.It captures the GTA feel, of being a criminal in a dark,unforgiving world but contrasts with the fun of messing around.The story (SPOILERS,MATE)You are Niko Bellic,a off-the boat immigrant who is looking to flee is past life of war and despair (and because his cousin claimed to be living it big).What he doesn't know is that he and his cousin get them involved with criminals,the government,the mafia and dangerous people who track him down.You make descisions to kill or free people, which can be kind of hard since it is usaually your friends.He is on the hunt for Darko Brevic,who killed 12 of his sqaud mates in the war.He does jobs for drug dealers,Russians,the mafia and a Irish crime family.Along the way (quite early actually) he meets Dimitri Rascalov,assistant of someone Niko works for.Little does he know he betrays him,destroying Niko and Romans houses,businesses and general lifestyle.Later on, he is contacted by the UL paper (govornment blokes) and is hired to kill terrorists and heat makers.After doing many jobs for the ULP and his friends,the ULP contact and a Mafia boss help Niko find Darko,where you can choose to kill him or let him live his painful life.Soon after,Niko attends Roman and his cab assistants wedding where,depending upon the players choice,Roman is shot and killed or Nikos Girlfriend is killed (very sad scene ;( ) you then kill the mob boss or Dimitri,and Niko settles down and continues his life with his remaining friends.Overall:The best GTA game out there (also one of the best games in general imo).You can clock over 1500 hours like me (not on this account obviously,on xbox and previous account) and still have fun.

												Its been 8 years since this game was released on PC and nowadays the game is almost playable! Good: +Pretty graphics +Details, this is one of the most detailed games ever made! +Very Realistic +Shooting. The shooting mechanics is fun and has been vastly improved from the other GTA games! +Voice acting is good +The city feels alive on the surface +Taxis. You cant live without them in this game! Trust me!Mediocre /Social life, yeah Niko has a social life in this game. It can be fun for those who love roleplaying but it can also be extremely annoying. Someone calls you on the phone and wanna hang out (which is basicly wasting your time) and you dont feel like it so they will like you less and wont do things for you no more. The only thing you get from it is a casual dialog. /Niko himself. I both like and dislike Niko. I like his personality but i just hate the looks of him. He is a damn ugly guy and no matter what clothes he is wearing he looks like a dorky buffoon. Its very hard to feel awesome and powerful in the role of Niko! /Driving. Some cars are fun to drive, others handle like crapBad: -The phone is a big pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You run across the street and the phone rings and automaticly you stop running, gets hit by a car and you have no clue about what the person who was calling wanted. -Lack of tutorials. youll be thrown in a mission to do crap you havent done before and all you get is a text up in the corner on what to do. -The AI. The AI doesnt know how to drive. I see them crash all the time, changing lanes like morons in front of you, making turns in front of you, taxi drivers who hit everything they can when pulling over. Its a mess! And in firefights they all just hide behind cover and shoots aimlessly and never flanks or anything intelligent. -The story is bad. It starts interesting with twists that involves Niko, his family and his life but later on all Niko ever do is being an errand boy for money. In the beginning i cared but when Niko became the errand boy i just didnt give a crap! The people you work for are not interesting! Its the typhical gangster morons you have seen before with no backstories. -Boring missions. Fetch quests that you dont care about! -Crappy cutomization. You can change clothes, thats it. And Niko never looks cool in any of them! Its either baggy clothes or fancy clothes and not much to choose from. There are no weapon customizations, no haircuts, no car customizations. -No where to spend money. I got alot of money but there is nothing to spend it on! You dont buy houses, furnitures or cars so what are you going to do with the money? All your safehouses is given to you for free and they all contains nothing of interest.  -No feel of progression! You do a mission after a mission but you will most likely feel that you aint going nowhere. You never get promoted, there is no level system for anything and you will never know how far youve come into the game until it ends. -Weapons. You got 2 choices of each weapon class thats it. For a game that focus on killing people with guns this game has almost nothing to offer for people who like guns. Not even a weapon with a scilencer. If you are a hired gun, shouldnt you at least have a scilencer?  -Checkpoints. GTA has always had a horrible checkpoint system and they tried to make things better by the sms (retry) if you fail but you still have to go all the way back to the beginning and drive all the way back to where the action is. -Nothing to do besides the missions. Sure you can play darts and go bowl but that sure gets old fast! There is no fun in exploration because there is nothing to be found except a bunch of pigeons you are supposed to shoot. I would have loved a shooting range, a fightclub or something like that where you could win unique clothes or weapons. -Lag spikes, poor performance, low fps. Still after all these years.... I got a AMD FX6300 4,5GhzOC and two GTX760 SLI, sure its not the best but its hell of alot better than the best systems back in 2008!All in all this game is a pretty fun disaster. It is pretty for sure but the content is crap. I am not a fan of the GTA series because every single game is basicly identical. You are a lapdog the entire game just like all the other games with the same old twists you could see coming miles away.			"

												I own this game on both PS3 and PC and have been playing it for quite a long time. Looking through the reviews its obvious that because of both ""Social Club"" and ""Games for Windows Live"" this game has been plagued with playability issues. This game does work (as of writing this Oct 2016), however Multiplayer no longer works. I wanted to put together a list to try to get the game working for those who are have playability issues. Check it out here.

												Some people have problems running GTA IV on windows 10.Hear is what I did to get it to work.Go to Steam library games and select: GTA IV- Right click mouse and select: Properties- then select: Set Launch Options and input this: -nomemrestrict -norestrictions Then press ok. When you run the game log in with your Social club and select play ofline. Social Club does not work with GTA IV from what I understand.I downloaded the Live Update from windows and installed it and logged in with Xbox live account and it worked fine. Here is the link: http://www.xbox.com/en-IE/Live/PC/DownloadClient.The game played fine after that.I have played it on the Xbox 360 before.Its a fun game and I would recommend it for the.PC only when its on sale just do to the crap you have to do to get it to run.I love Rock Star Games.but you guys should update GTA IV and remove the Social Club and Games for windows Live garbage.Hope this helps someone.

												Horribly optimized game, even if it was made a few years ago.When you get a game you'd expect to pay, download, and play, right? Not with GTA IV, you still need to install the latest version of Windows Live, and maybe a few other drivers.The game's UI is SOOOOOOO counter-intuitive, it says (in my case), that the graphics that I have set are ""exceeding the recommended limit"" and as such I cannot set them higher. The game is using 200mb out of the 8000mb I have available, that's not exactly ""exceeding the recommended limit"".If it weren't for GTAV that's only just come out all Rockstar would have is a rubbish unplayable port of GTAIV and a console exclusive of Red Dead Redemption. You're just embarresing yourselves Rockstar, any who has an OS that was made less then 30 years ago needs to install a tonne of other crap to be able to even launch your game...			"

												This game is briliant.Good graphics,good gameplay and this game have the best story of all GTA games.This game is better than San Andreas and the story beat GTA V's(i own it on my Xbox) story.This game has some very good features like:1.A Cover System gives the player the ability to hide behind any wall, car, or sufficiently large object. 2.The player's phone who is an integral part of the game; many missions and friendships rely on its use, and it enables many other gameplay features, including the use of cheats & accessing Multiplayer. 3.The player can hail a taxi and get a ride to selected destinations, for a fee. 4.The player can now toggle vehicle headlights on or off.5.The player has the ability to watch television in his or her apartment.6.Niko can make decisions in certain parts of the story. And a lot many features.One little thing i hate about this game:People dosen't play multiplayer on PC anymore.On Xbox there are some players but on PC the multiplayer is dead :(.			"

												Great game, but it's ruined by Games for Windows Live. Having to follow multiple guides to get into my save game has prompted me to uninstall this game, probably permanently. If you use Windows Live for other stuff and know how to fix it without going through multi-step guides every time you want to play, it's probably fine for you.That said, the game itself is quite good. I generally found few bugs or glitches, unlike previous games in the series (I used to fall through the ground at least once every 20 minutes, minimum, playing Vice City), and the story line is interesting. Guns, cars, motorcycles, Helicopters, planes, not much more to it than that.			"

												Apparently the website you have to use to create an account to play the game no longer functions. I've made an account and reset the password multiple times because the password is ""Incorrect"" Even though I've resorted to using copy/paste. I bought the game quite a while ago and am only now making this review as I figured I could save others money.			"

												This software isn't supported by the developer, since they obviously would prefer it if you bought lots of shark cards on a different game that's much worse than this one. I'd ask Steam for a refund but that wouldn't accomplish anything. "
