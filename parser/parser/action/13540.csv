												One of the best tactical shooter ever and 2nd best in Rainbow series after Rainbow Six 3.Great scope for tactics. Very nice customization.Teammates don't run into your line of fire or block you, like they do in Vegas 2.Teamwork feels so good! Multiplayer is still alive.			"

												My hardcore gaming carrier started with this game...When I saw the games trailer on youtube it made me work trough my whole summer vacation with my dad for a new pc in order to play this game, I was 16 years old.In this game I have met with my best friend and had a lot of good times and last but not least me, my brother and my friend were one of the best players in the game.It was an unfortunate that the game didnt have good servers so we always had to deal with the high latency but still I think it was the best fps shooter in its time, the story and the online game mods, character designs were unique and still a lots of games today miss these playable options...10/10 would breach trough the window again! :D			"

												Very good game. This and it's sequel are the only Rainbow Six games I've played, so I can't say that the original ones are better or anything like that. What I can say is that if your preference for games is Call of Duty and you don't want to expand your horizons, then stay far away from this game. But.. if you want a challenge with a gripping story line, lots of replay value (I've done the campaign three times now, and about 70 hours of terrorist hunt). It is a step between your run of the mill shooters and super stealth games (like Splinter Cell). You can run and gun and make it.. but it is very difficult.. but by the same token, you don't have to wait for minutes studying patrols movements. Bottom line.. I'm anxiously awaiting the next Rainbow Six installment (if it ever comes out), because I enjoyed this game so much.			"

A great shooterAlthough this isn’t the most tactical shooter, it is still great fun to play as a whole and online. It has its greats moments, however it is possible for this game to become a twitch shooter and there are a number of things that held the game back from being great.- Weird AI movements and actions- Your own squad members making silly remarks- Voice acting isn’t too great- Good graphics			"

												The Rainbow six series was one of the first video game series I ever played; I love the sense of realism you get from them, compared to stale first person shooters. Rainbow Six Vegas has a very entertaining story. Near the end of the first mission I was hooked; I grew quite attached to the main character Logan he was enjoyable to play as. I found myself constantly changing my loadout for the mission, no gun is without purpose. If you ever have ten dollars lying around, I’d suggest you pick up this or its sequel.			"

Rank: 8/10Recommendation(s): Play Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon, run this game as an adminMajor Theme: An old yet reasonable console port with meatBought at Price: $5 - bought during Steam saleThrowing ""Tom Clancy's"" on a title usually means that the game is going to have some meat, or say solid content to it. The only downside is that this means Ubisoft is the sole publisher/developer of the title; boy do they love console ports.Rainbow Six is an anti-terrorism organization who tries to stop threats before they become the front page news. With this, you lead a team with 2 other squad mates to tackle challenges that take place in close quarter building environments and city streets.By commanding your squad mates, you progress through the challenges in the cohesive story. The single player story is about 10 hours’ worth of content, which allows you to get to know characters and game mechanics well. As with many other Tom Clancy games, there is always a sci-fi twist that doesn't seem ""out of this world"".With your squad mates, you can clear rooms, rappel down the sides of buildings, and coordinate to take enemies out. If one of the squad mates manages to go down, the other can be ordered to revive them. In the more likely event that both squad mates go down, you revive them with a ""hypo"". While there is an ""infinite"" health system in place, you will still find yourself dying quite a bit.Biggest issues out of the game? Let's start with checkpoints, checkpoints, checkpoints... The worst thing known to humanity continues and was a ""feature"" back in the day. Rainbow Six doesn't escape this, and it will make you rage. People still arguge about checkpoints somehow defeating ""save cheating"" (the ""art"" or plain intelegence to save before big battles). This is simply untrue due to the fact that consoles simply couldn't save that much data back then. It was a technical reason (and poor one) that has infected modern games. The ""blur"" or what seems to be some horrible pain effect isn't good at all. Because it's a console port, the memory and cpu usage had to be kept down and this horrible awful effect does its job. It is also strangely not optimized that well, so systems on the edge of requirements will suffer frame issues when effect kicks in.Multiplayer, while it does exist, requires an Uplay account, and then a small chance of someone playing multiplayer as well. There are no dedicated servers it seems, so a peer-2-peer system is in place. Only good thing that seems to come from multiplayer is the very precise customization options, it even surprised me in fact.Using an older version of the Unreal engine, AI has issues following and getting into positions sometimes. Once you play enough, you will get used to it. I came in knowing that, and automatically accounted for it. Your experiences will vary in this regard with high certainty.Keys are places in odd spots on your keyboard, and there's quite a few to remember. Left alt for instance changes squad engagement rules and then pressing and holding r shows the gun equipment radial menu. V, B, and N are for room entering commands which change based on engagement rule set.Beyond these aspects, I had fun playing the title. It was unique, yet required some chasing to get it to work on Windows 7.			"

												Rainbow Six Vegas was an effective and divisive reboot of the Rainbow Six series. It took the previously slow and tactical shooter series into a much more modern cover shooter direction. I say divisive because Rainbow Six Vegas caused a split in the fanbase between people who wanted a faster cover shooter and people who wanted a slower game where you plan your movements before executing. Rainbow Six Vegas largely takes place in the titular city of Las Vegas. You play as ""Logan"" an operative for the titular ""Rainbow"" special forces team who enters the city to combat a terrorist threat. The storytelling is a bit muddled and you generally don't pay attention to it that much. It mostly serves to get you from point A to Point B and shoot some baddies. What Rainbow Six Vegas is most well known for it's cover shooter gameplay. While it is faster than all of the previous Rainbow Six games it's noticeably slower than say, Call of Duty or Gears of War. The game is built around using your squadmates to move to different positions so you can flank or take enemies out from a distance. It's much more forgiving as well since it has regenerating health and the enemy AI is fairly dumb. Since you die very quickly the game doesn't devolve into run and gun but it still feels much slower than it should.Besides the campaign, Rainbow Six Vegas also has multiplayer and Terrorist Hunt. The latter is where the game excels in my opinion. In Terrorist Hunt, you and a few friends can team up to take out AI enemies in a series of multiplayer maps. It's very enjoyable and replayable and is where the bulk of the time you spend playing the game will end up. Deathmatch is also available but good luck finding a game for it.It's hard to really describe the original Rainbow Six Vegas without describing how much better it's sequel was. While I do recommend the game if you're a fan of modern shooters and desire something that requires slightly more thought behind it, the sequel comes generally more recommended.			"

Delightfully challenging terrorist hunt mode with u vs 35 or more Ai gunning to take ur head off.  Great single player campaign and nicelydetailed environments.

												The game that got me into tactical shooters. I'm not much an FPS player, but RSV and RSV2 are the games which hooked me. The ability to give squad commands, take tactical advantage of an area and outfit your PCs aren't exactly innovative to the Rainbow Six franchise, but the fluidity of commands, the simplicity of the learning curve and the improved AI are what make the Vegas games my go-tos.

												Rainbow Six Vegas is yet another part of Rainbow Six series, tactical-themed FPS. This time around there are no more planning and you control only two other squad member. Yet it's all good fun. It came out in 2006 and was made by Ubisoft. Also, it was made for X360 first, so it came into PC territory like a proud direct port, lacking slightly in options and not optimized very goodly. At least it got patched up since then.It also came out for X360, PS3 and PSP. The first two should be similar, but PSP is different game. You play solo in that one. It doesn't interest me not even slightly, I am here to see squad members work along with me. You are supposedly saving those two squad members, being lone wolf.Technically, well, yea. Port from Xbox 360. Used to be unoptimized, but I am sure that computers nowdays can easily just power through it. It still however rarely freezes for half-minute. Steam Overlay doesn't work either, have fun alt-tabbing.Even worse, PC version did not support widescreen monitors at release! And while they patched widescreen in later, it still doesn't every wide resolution and even worse, the HUD is still designed for 4:3 monitor. So do some full-screen graphics. Like ""to be continued"" screen. Oh, yea, cliffhanger alert.But I am pretty sure that there are fan patches to fix those.Multiplayer servers were supposedly shutted down, but it actually still works, just requires UPlay account, at least now. Yep, new players will have to fancy around with email adress as nickname, from what I understood. Well, at least it works.Community seems to be kinda there. One times I tried there were no servers, other times there were 5 of them, with players. Seems like people only play Cooperative modes only nowadays, you will not find any Competetive players vs players. Sadly, they all seems to be quite protective, as all the servers I encountered were password protected, so I didn't get to check out multiplayer in these few days.And well, what can I say. It sure was made as a show off for Xbox 360, showing off itself with Unreal Engine 3, while trying to be accessiable to new players. Though, to be honest, I really dislike graphics in this part. That's because while they are cool on technical side, the art style is just awful. Or, rather, it feels like developers applied a really bad brown hue blur effect all over the screen. Music also isn't hot, being urgent but not very awesome. Shame that Rainbow Six main theme is gone.Oh well, at least Vegas setting is kinda cool.Also, yep, this Rainbow Six is now all about telling a good story and having fun. Not more planning before mission, head into action, main hero. Take on them with your regenerative health, until you get instakilled by sniper shot and realize that you can't just charge on even on Normal. Nope, it's still tactical, somewhat, sorry Doomguys.It also got cover system implented, where you hold a button and go into third person mode, as Logan hides behind a wall. You are supposed to spend most of your time in this mode, but personally, I kept forgetting that I can do it and instead kept crouching behind corners, aiming and shooting from the first person mode. Ha. But hey, here is a cool feature that you can do a blind fire from behind cover. Enemies can do it too, also. Gotta snipe those hands.And thankfully, you aren't alone either, for you can still command to your other teammates. Or more exactly single squad. Made of one explosive black guy and one haxor chinese guy, because yay Hollywood must-haves. No offence there, just stereotypical. Yep, just two people who you can't command separately, only to both at same time. To be honest, I am dissapointed that there are so little, I was expecting to get the second such squad and never recieved such. Rainbow Six Lite, gentlemen.But thankfully, they still beat their Rainbow Six Lockdown rivals into jaws, as these two people actually have good enough AI to follow you fast and be reliable at clearing the rooms. And while levels are linear, you get few options on how to enter. For example, you pretty much always have two doors, you can tell them to bang and clear one set while going through another. Or you can also peek under door with snake-cam and call out two priority targets and just tell them to open door, they take out priority targets very fast and accurately while breaching. And I gotta say, I love hostage situations in this game, even if they are scripted.Also, fallen teammates can be saved and made alive again, while you can't. Knowing this, you can guess how this team works. Answer: Like a horrible friends.But yes, thanks to this small squad being reliable and easy to control, I like this game a lot. After all, the reason why I liked single-player tactical shooter is because of working together with friendly AI and making tactical choices and this one more or less provides it, while being accesable tojust launch and have fun. I think that I would take it over Rainbow Six Raven Six, for I don't care about 1-shot-kills so much and AI of teammates in that game acted too dumb. As well as I like ability to be able to order more or less good during gameplay.But with promise that they bring back planning someday or let us play with more squads at the same time.Still would rather take SWAT 4 though.But oh well, this one is fun too.Oh, and there is terrorist mode. In single-player you play solo, so I wasn't so interested. It's quite hard and enemies will try to storm your positions just fine.Oh, yea, and there is multiplayer. I didn't get to try it. I know that it has unlockables. But most of stuff you got to play in single-player is there too, easy to access.But yep, pretty fun shooter where you get to order around to two squadmates and do some job. Shoootiiiiing!			"

												I have some minor gripes with this game like not being able to select your squadmates loadout and not being as tactically indepth as earlier Rainbow Six games or the first Ghost Recon but I still really enjoy it.This game is more forgiving than the earlier Rainbow Six games but it is still not for the faint of heart as enemy fire is quickly fatal and may require you play over a section of the game repeatibly until you get it down to a science.I'd highly recommend this game for someone who likes a challenge and enjoys a somewhat tactical SWAT 4 type experience.

												Rainbow Six is possibly my favorite Tom Clancy book, so I decided to check out this game (and the fact it was on sale helped too).This game was unforgiving, even on normal difficulty (god knows what realistic entails.)The story was good, the gameplay is awesome the AI is.... good for the most part (some are stupid, others are aimbots, but for the most part it's pretty normal.Warning: Cliffhanger ending.Lots of guns that are also in CS (The P90 is as noobular as ever).

												Being a fan of the books and the films that are based upon them i almost jumped out the first floor window when I found that 'Humble Bundles' were doing the Tom Clancy Collection. Its a whole lot of fun, obviously the graphics look somewhat outdated as it was released around 2006. It's pretty clear that Rainbow Six: Vegas is an accomplished action shooter. The story is presented via briefings and overheard terrorist conversations. All of the voice-overs are well done here so it's a pretty decently presented plot. Once again the pc people seem to have been sacrificed to make the console gamers play. Default key positions are pretty strange in some cases, but it seems to me that this was one of the first games i can remember that W A S D became the default forward, left, right back controls (these however can be made to any of your choices) The whole cover system is brilliant as as soon as you go into 'cover' the camera changes from first to 3rd person view, allowing you to see enemies and therefore plan your attack.The weaponry seems to be accurate to the original weapons and from what i can tell the friendly AI is actually quite stupid, as is  the enemy AI (shooting through walls to name one) R6:Vegas on older systems is a serious system hog, but on a 2012 machine the graphics are ramped up to the maximum and it doesnt twitch which has got to be a good thingRecommended for a quick pickup and play when theres nothing else on			"

												Yes, I would recommend......to fans of smart first person shooters that provide realistic tactical challenges and options.>|< Quantatitive Rating = 9 out of 10 >|<______________________________Observations and other musings...One of my all time top picks and definitely a title I would not only recommend, but also buy again if it came out in a remastered edition...that's new higher resolution graphics and physics...not a redone to the point of spoiling the spirit of the original. Only a few other games capture the tactical look and feel of actual close quarters combat: This title doesn’t nail it but it get pretty damn close with the ability to plan on-the-fly and execute tactical maneuvers to place you, or your team, or both in advantaged positions flanking and enfilade fire. There is a moderately good storyline to keep the action going and stitch together each level as you go along through the predetermined paths. There is enough space to each area and possible approaches that it doesn’t  always feel like your on rails. The kit choices are again moderate in quantity and configurations. There are varieties of different classes of small arms and several weapons within each class, but some of the characteristics are a little off at times. The customizations are a nice touch but there could have been more. Once again, this is a favorite of mine. If you like something that’s a little more than just on-rails first person shooter for a decent price, this is it.			"

												The game is based on hunting terrorists in Las Vegas and true to other Rainbow games, a single head shot can kill you or your enemies. There is no tactical planning or waypoint setting, but a map can be overlaid in real time to show enemy/friendly positions and objectives.During the game different approaches to reach objectives can be made which may involve fast roping, abseiling or ladder use to traverse drops and climbs. Your team of two non-player characters can be sent to any location within view (but not separately) and are reasonably reactive to incoming fire taking cover and returning fire when required. The range of weapons and customisation is vast and picking the correct weapons for the scenario is vital for success. My favourite action is being able to sneak view under doors and tag enemies for the NPC's to attack before door entry is made. Onto the health system, there is no health bar in this game. Instead when you are shot your vision becomes blurry. This means you have to take cover and rest until the blurriness has gone. It may not be a realistic health system but it adds to the intenseness of firefights and works very well.There are a ton of weapons to play around with. Sub machine guns, light machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, pistols, shield. All of these are tweak able with different scopes, magazines, laser sights etc. "

Srsly, if your sick of Call of Duty but you still want to play a good Modern FPS that doesn't have the problems that every other modern military shooter has, buy this. 1. it actually requires skill and tactics. 2. Compared to the average FPS this game is actually kinda hard. 3. The loadout customization is really good and your choce of weapons and gear actually matters. 4. while i havent played any online matches yet, the character customization in multiplayer is better than any other FPS ive ever played. 5. Actually decent storyline 6. Srsly buy this game, this is really good for a triple a modern fps. Also, the cover system works VERY well and this game has really good controls. Also for about as hard as it is, i would say about as hard as mega-man 1.			"

												Such an excellent game to play even without friends, amazing story that hooks you from the very beginning with plenty of terrorist hunt maps to play over and over after you beat the story or want to take a break from the intensity. I've seen very few problems with this game but they're only minor, such as your team mates getting in your way while firing at the enemy. Every suggestion that I have for this game is fixed in the second game but there are still a few things in this game that are better than the second in my opinion, like being down in the casinos more and actually being on the strip. I've been to Vegas and insde most of the casinos in this game and can say this, they've done one hell of a job with how everything looks because I felt like I was in Vegas again with how detailed the developers made the places. 10/10 from me.

												I originally got this game as a present from my dad when I was 13, In early 2007. I was a shy kid and when things weren't great at school or at home this game always gave me somewhere I could escape to. I estimate from 2007-2013 I put in around 6000+ hours on vegas 1 and 2, all while competing on the gamebattles EU ladder. Along the way I met some of the best people I've ever met online. I met one of my best friends to this day in a fateful LVU terrorist hunt, in which we discovered the finer points of the MAC11 :). We put countless hours into the game and went from 10 bar scrubs to top ladder players and sadly, saw the game die slowly and the MLG endorsement end. However, the amazing community kept both vegas 1 & 2 alive for so much longer than anyone expected. Quite simply, buy this game. It combines counter strike esque shooting mechanics (recoil is different however) with a fantastic cover system suited perfectly to competitive play. The maps are incredible, some will remember rainbow six 3 favourites such as kill house and presidio alongside newcomers like calypso casino and casino vaults. The player customisation is great also, custom camos, loadouts and even a hilarious face cam player model on the XB360 version. I just have to mention the ever hilarious VIP game mode in which one team has to escort a glock wielding VIP to a safe zone all while another team seeks to prevent it. I was so sad this game mode never made it to vegas 2!tldr; a hidden gem among the bloated FPS genre. BUY THIS GAME !! "

												Overall an enjoyable game and unlike other mindless shooters. I originally purchased this game, hoping to get an experience like SWAT 3 and SWAT 4. This is much more action packed and has  Hollywood production written over  it. Its Challenging at times, and infurating in others. Especially when you dies because an enemy NPC spontaneously respawns 3 feet in front of you. Your teamates AI often times doesnt help you cope. But enjoyable overall. Im looking foward to what R6 has to offer in the games following this.  "

												+ Gorgeous highly detailed environments. The themed casinos really feel alive. There's a lot to just wander around and marvel at.+ Music and ambient sound effects double down on the immersion.+ Large range of weapons to choose from.+ Satisfying cover based combat.+ LAN multiplayer is lots of fun.+ Terrorist's voices add a touch of comedy. ""Should I just run into the bullets?""+ 360 gamepad support.- Getting insta-killed from nowhere sucks. Especially since the checkpoints are few between.- Hard to make out enemies sometimes from the environment.- Enemies can see through things you can't, like foliage.- Didn't think much to the story. It was kinda weak. It feels tacked on.- You won't bother with half the weapons. SInce they are too poor to be useful.- Dull and uninspiring first couple of missions. Game doesn't excite until you get to Vegas.- Tactical gameplay lacks depth. Essentially is just moving your team upto doors and getting them to go in first.- Lack of resolution options. Had to choose 1920x1080 and get my TV to downscale to 1360x768.			"

												It's a cover based FPS with some nice mechanics. It's got some good replay value because there's multiple ways you can take your objective, one time breaching explosively through the door, and the next time coming down through the windows on the side of the building. It's one of my personal favorites, however because it is so old, the online community for it is obviously very, very small, so I'd suggest picking it up if you've got friends to play it co-op with. There's up to 4 player co-op in the story mode, however the co-op was somewhat of an afterthought, so I would suggest putting on the no-respawns setting and playing it on the hard mode as myself and one friend who never played it only both managed to die 3 times through the entire story mode.I'll recommend it for the co-op primarily.

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas in my opinion is just like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon except you're in an urban setting and there are some situations where it's really up close and personal. Just like Ghost Recon, you can command your squad members to take cover, take care of a personal objective (hacking and placing charges), and even handle door situations like (flash & clear, open & clear, breach & clear, and grenade & clear for examples.) All in all if you're into first person shooter (and it only goes into third person shooter mode when you're taking cover), then I highly recommend you guys or ladies to play this game. It's awesome and a lot of fun! Some missions on this game are challenging but it feels pretty good once you overcome and beat it! :)			"

												First of all, it's a Tom Clancy game, so expectations are high. And it does live upto your expectations. The story is good and so is the twist. It has a good choice of weapons, the assault rifles being the best ones. As a FPS game, you get to shoot a lot of enemies and thus, you won't be disappointed at all. The only problem that i felt was that you get too less health, just a bullet or two and you are dead. Overall, this game is highly recommended to all FPS fans out there. :)			"

A casual and accessible tactical shooter that is a joy to play, even if it is no Ghost ReconCompared to more hardcore Tom Clancy games like Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, RB6V can feel like a simplified generic shooter. That may indeed be the case, but it's fun and quite replayable, especially in co-op mode.The gameplay is reminiscent of Gears of War, except you're in first-person mode when not in cover, and you can issue basic tactical orders to your teammates. You'll probably never actually do any fighting from first-person mode, however, because your ability to take damage is very limited even on Normal difficulty, making it almost impossible to win a gunfight without using cover (which puts you into third person view, and lets you blind-fire if you want which is pretty cool).A few of the basic tactical options like the ability to change the weapon rate-of-fire and attach suppressors are present, which is much welcome. You usually have a choice between going all Rambo into the next area, or playing it safe by going in stealthily and taking everyone by surprise with a few well-placed stun grenades. You also get to feel like a badass in some sequences, rappelling down the side of a building then crashing through the window and saving the hostages.The game can be hard at times, but in a way that feels justified and encourages you to rethink your strategy instead of yelling at the screen. It can get frustrating when you fail a mission because an AI teammate went down, but that's not too common because the AI is quite smart and is often capable of clearing a room without your help. Co-op is where this game really shines. It's essential to coordinate the attack plan before opening the next door, and that makes for particularly satisfying breach moments, as you mercilessly pick off those terrorist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then yell ""Clear!"".As is typical with Ubisoft, the game wasn't well optimized and had many performance issues at launch. In 2015, that's no longer a problem with any modern PC able to nail this 2006 game, but there are still a few annoyances that show how little the devs cared about the PC. You can't use the steam overlay. You can't bind controls to mouse thumb buttons. Your choice of screen resolutions is limited unless you edit the ini file. The graphics options are quite limited. If you want a fun co-op shooter that does a decent job simulating tactical special ops behaviour without being too hardcore, get this game (and an extra copy or two for your friends).			"

												Mix together a bizarre regenerating health system that seems to randomly choose whether you die in one hit or not, which defeats the purpose of regenerating health, and cover-based shooting in flashy, claustrophobic Casino environments and you have Rainbow Six Vegas.I beat this on the 360 when it originally came out and had a fun time with it, though I don't remember it being anywhere near this frustratingly bull-♥♥♥♥.  Enemies will no-scope you from cover from 200 feet away with a shotgun and insta-kill you *SOMETIMES* or maybe do barely any damage to you.  This inconsistency makes the game feel like bipolar mess which can either make you feel like breezing through it, or smashing your keyboard in rage because of being one-shotted by some ♥♥♥-hat hiding behind something you should clearly be able to shoot through, only to reload the checkpoints.  And yet, I still found myself wanting to push onward and beat the annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥.It combines a beyond simplified interface compared to previous Rainbow Six games with no pre-planning, but offers reasonable weapon customization.  You can freely add a silencer to almost any assault rifle or pistol, and it gives you the option of using the shield which I found worked and sometimes it didn't.  The AI is reasonably smart, and will try and flash bang you, use lethal grenades when you're using the shield a lot, and I found that they can lose track of you during a fire-fight.  Silencers appear useless at first because of the linearity of the game, but I found it helps keep the AI guessing where you are, so that they won't always be able to find where the fire is coming from during combat, or right before, so it's less about finishing objectives undetected and more about utilizing stealth as a way to ambush.The objectives are quite visually appealing with lots of interesting design choices in the environment, and enemies don't just instantly ragdoll when you kill them, as you'll see a mix of ragdoll with the physics of where you shot them plus an animation based on where you shot them, which makes kills very satisfying.  Overall, Rainbow Six is no longer the tactical shooter it was.  It is now a Cover-shooter, with tactical elements.  I suppose the change was evident from Raven Shield to Lockdown, but it seems they've done what Lockdown couldn't, which was making the game interesting for the player.P.S. For some reason, Vegas 1 looks better than Vegas 2, and plays better than Vegas 2 as well.			"

												The Rainbow Six Vegas games are some of the very best games for co-op that I've played. Afterwatching Achievement Hunter's playthrough of the games I picked it up for my dad and I to playand we have spent countless hours doing mostly the Terrorist Hunt gamemode, but also the co-op campaigns on both Vegas 1 & 2. As good as these games are for co-op, and they really, really are, as single-player games they're just not worth it. Or at least the first game isn't. The campaign is atrocious alone. The writing is garbage, the characters are some of the worst I've seen in a  video game and it's just not fun whatsoever. Terrorist Hunt is always really dull alone and extremely hard. As a single-player game it's one of the worst of FPS, as a co-op game it's easily one of the best. It's a nice sub-series off of the Rainbow Six series but it's a shame Ubisoft decided to keep going with the same more arcadey very much less tactical approach for Siege as well. Vegas isn't very tactical but honestly I don't mind for a sub-series and the cover system is one of the best I've ever played with and it's what makes the game unique. This game is seriously a blast and I couldn't recommend it more if you have friends to play with.Lack of hours is due to all my time being spent on Xbox 360 where I've spent very likely more than 200 hours at least.The Great:++Co-op is incredibly fun++Terrorist Hunt is a blast that somehow never gets old++Cover system is perfectly simpleThe Good:+Lots of Terrorist Hunt maps+Decent array of weapons and gadgets+Very good optimization. Getting 300fps at 4K on a GTX1060+Supports 4K resolution+Very low amount of glitches, only found a couple in a looong time of playing the game+Loadout is niceThe Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:+-Controls could be more refined for mouse and keyboard use-+Average length single-player+-All story-elements are removed for the single-player when doing co-op. Honestly this is a goodthing, but it really shouldn't be-+Terrorist Hunt really isn't designed for single-player, but it still works well enough+-Sound design is nothing special and music is nothing but clicheThe Bad:-Not ugly, more just very dull to look at (brown saturated)-Voice-acting is very poor-The single-player is nothing but a complete bore, but the gameplay does hold it up enough-Checkpoints have huge gaps between so don't die-Single-player campaign is fairly easyThe Horrible:--The writing is incredibly bad--The characters are some of the most forgettable in FPS historySound: 5.5/10Graphics: 5.5/10Gameplay: 9/10 (with co-op) 6.5/10 (single-player)Content/Replayability: 10/10 (with co-op) 6/10 (single-player)Overall: 9/10 (co-op) 4.5/10 (single-player)Again, absolutely recommended for co-op, absolutely not for single-player. 6/10 replayabilityfor single-player if you like Terrorist Hunt alone otherwise there's practically no replayability.

												Flying around, destination to destination and rappelling down from a helicopter to engage a great threat, be it terrorists in Mexico, Vegas or the Hoover dam, this is one of the best (if not the best) co-op tactical shooter experiences you will get.Seriously one of the best R6 games out there. The graphics are great (once you adjust brightness to around 4-5, which makes the contrast much nicer and the game look less bland) and it seriously beats out its sequel, Vegas 2. Interesting level designs, believable and awesome attention to detail- from the wrecked slums of a Mexican ghetto, to the wealth driven Vegas strip with poker chips flying out of slot machines, it's truly a wonderful achievement for a 2006 game. The shooting is wonderful, with a great cover system that, while not entirely realistic, is great for a tactical title. The AI shout commands at eachother, exclaim words of disbelief as their comrades perish, and your allies are not brick stupid like in Vegas 2. It is not without flaws, though. The AI will ocassionally spazz out, this is easily fixed by ordering them to move somewhere, and the game has not been updated since 07, its highest resolution setting makes the Xbox One giggle- this is easily fixed with an auto-patcher (http://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/103-tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas-resolution-patcher/) and brings the game up to date. The game lacks a lot of graphics options, which were supposedly included via a launcher the CD version came with. The story is wonderful, very compelling and intriguing- very Tom Clancy-ish. You can tell they actually cared when making this game, as opposed to its rushed out, still-the-same-graphics and models, sequel. If you want my honest truth, this game is everything Vegas 2 should have been. The customization is the same, the music is better, the audio is better, the settings are much better and the characters are not utterly stupid. The ending to this game is far more rewarding than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they threw in with the sequel, not to mention the plot twists actually make sense and will make you go ""oh"" as opposed to make you giggle like a rampant meth addict like it will in the sequel.If you want a serious, interesting co-op experience...buy this. If you want a game with same-same guns and a decent unlock system, with the same graphics as its predecessor (06 vs 08, same ♥♥♥♥ing graphics and models, gg) you'll want to buy that POS named Vegas 2.Sorry for the run on sentences, written at 2 AM.

												Vegas completely fails as a tactical shooter because there's no tactical aspects or mechanics put into the game aside from very basic commands to your squad. The game ends up being a very mediocre first person shooter with generic third person cover based mechanics put into it that just makes the game worse. The AI for both your squad and the enemies is awful. The gunplay feels very mundane and uninspired. The problem is there is nothing that the game does very well, I think the setting is cool but even then I feel like they could have done so much more with it. The story is very rudimentary, dull and it has one of the worst endings I’ve seen put in a video game. The game has all the aspects of a console shooter like the regenerating health, the dumbed down tactical mechanics and the big focus on third person cover based shooting. It’s completely ridiculous and unrealistic which goes against what the franchise is about, you are basically this unstoppable one man army taking on thousands of terrorists. 4/10 (Mediocre) "

												I can't recommend this game enough. Rainbow Six is my favorite book, and this certainly does it justice. Sure it's a first person shooter, a genre that is almost sucked dry by the industry, but this is a fresh take on the ""absorb bullets and mow down anything that moves"". You go out of cover, you're dead in three shots, maybe less, since enemies can and will headshot you. This may seem like a turn off, but honestly, it feels so good in firefights because the guy that you're shooting at isn't just a faceless enemy in a room full of bad guys, he's the one who could potentially kill you. The checkpoints could be better, but I guess it's saying ""Stop being a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. You can't stand out in the open in this game."" Also, your teammates...they're another layer of strategy. You have to constantly manage your team, citing whether they should shoot first or return fire, put suppressors on, follow you, or breach doors. They're definitely not invicible, and sending them across the room to mow down the enemies while you take cover could bite you in the ♥♥♥ later when they're both down and pretty far away, and you have to revive them whilst getting shot at.

												Great for its unique gameplay, involving managing tactics for a small team and a great cover system. The art design is also very good. Clearing a room perfectly and silently is a joy, but even when you screw up, the frenetic firefights that result are a superb consolation. I would steer all but the most patient away from 'Realistic' difficulty, only because the game sets you on your own at certain points while simultaneously removing many checkpoints. I'd warn people from the sequel as it has some severe pathfinding issues for teammates that utterly torpedo the gameplay, which is odd considering how solid and unproblematic the pathfinding is in this earlier entry.

												At first glance, Rainbow Six Vegas appears to be a very clunky and out of touch shooter, but taking your time to get familiar with the controls and commands reveals quite possibly one of the greatest tactical shooters ever made. This game was released in 2006, so at this point the visuals are a little dated, but still attractive, and easy to appreciate for their time. The mechanics are excellent, with cover based combat and the team command system, this game is about as intuitive as it gets. You will not find a dislike to have about it.			"

												I remember playing this alot on the Xbox 360, and I did like it. However coming back to it on PC is a bit lack luster. The game is still the same I was just hoping for more customization of the options. You can't even increase texture size, only resolution and v-sync. It is very poor port to PC. The game is still alright just it still looks like ♥♥♥. Even for 2006. Oh and if you are having trouble getting the game to run check out the forums they helped me getting it running in under 5 mins. A word to the wise Turn V-Sync on in this game otherwise be prepared for crazy gameplay.			"

												I really wanted to give 'Rainbow Six Vegas' a fair chance, but the sporadic autosave checkpoints made the game very frustrating. I like to play tactical action games like this and 'Splinter Cell' slowly and thoughtfully, so finding myself practically restarting at the start of a mission after dying was deflating after a couple of times.'Rainbow Six Vegas', released in 2006, is truly a product of its time, and playing it in 2016 really shows its age. Its low screen resolution cap, unoptimized keyboard controls, and limitation on character movements (really, no jumping or leaping over barriers?) made the game less playable a decade later. So if you haven't played 'Rainbow Six Vegas' before, I'd say skip it unless you can overlook its limitations.			"

												Bite Size Review - Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six VegasThe Good:+SWAT game, I always like SWAT games+Gun selection is good and varied+Terrorist Hunt, very fun game with friendsThe Bad:-Controls, the age of the game shows here, you can rebind the keys but the configuration that game starts with is not great-Graphics, in a lot of cases graphics are not a big deal for me (HL1 looks good to me still for example), but this game really does look old-Environments, you would think the Vegas setting would be really interesting but after a while it’s just the game chest high walls and slot machinesThe Verdict:At the end of the day, this is an old game that shows its age a lot in my eyes. The graphics are really bad, the story is boiler plate, and the controls really limit my enjoyment of this game. This game was also created around the time that every game developer was first discovering the chest high wall mechanic and their switching between first and third person doesn’t feel overly great. All in all, if you are looking for old school Tom Clancy games buy the first Ghost Recon, if you are looking for newer go for Rainbow Six Siege – this game does not hold up well.  "

I have no idea with other steam users having purcahsed this game but many others like myself are currently suffering launcher issues.

												I played it through to the end out of sheer spite. There's some cool stuff about this game. The environments are lush, bright and somewhat colorful. Also the game is littered with advertisements for Axe body spray XDFor a Tom Clancy game it still does have that tactical shootery thing going for it, but they've butchered the ordering system. Instead of being able to give orders to individual members or different squads you just have the one squad. You can control your character independently of the other two guys under your lead, which you cannot give independent orders to. It feels a little awkward being that this whole ordering system was executed pretty well in previous games.The checkpoint system is in full swing and it is annoying. This isn't one of those games that rewards tactics so much as being very twitchy and knowing where the enemy will come from before hand. Vertical coverage is not an advantage. The only tactic I found that worked with the mechanics implemented in the game is continuously pulling feints and flanks on the AI which seems to be continually distracted. The AI also doesn't implement some tools really well. They'll sometimes just throw a smoke grenade your way and all you can say is ""Thanks for that,"" but that doesn't help you when the AI can somehow see through the smoke in many places in the game.Is it fun? Somewhat? I played it to the end and it's not something I'd subject myself to again unless I had a few friends along for the ride. It just doesn't appeal to me on the basis that I like to plan things out and it's hard to do that in one go, with the obvious advantages of cover and gaining height on targets, when the enemy can spawn in behind you and your men are plain disobeying orders left and right.

You get ambushed a lot but it feels like the naked gun, sit behind crate/small wall and shoot back at enemy thats just barely on the other side. cant shoot behind cover because youll guaranteed hit everything but the enemy. sure realistic but trying to use sights is so slow and such a pain. the dot is larger than the enemies and the other options on weapons are terrible. a laser which isnt visible for ♥♥♥♥ when aiming from the hip/cover, a scope thats waaaaaay to powerful.speaking about weapons, who was in charge of balancing weapons? some guns just have exact the same ammo count and function as a different weapon but have 1 to 5 points less total in damage, accuracy or whatever that 3rd categorie wascontroles feel unnatural on pc, basically no explanation or tutorial beyond 'you can select a team breach option'.... yes and how do i select a different option? trying to move around with the controles and move from cover and handle the team fluently doesnt work well on a keyboard. maybe with the 360 controler and things being dumbed down it might work. doesnt solve the AI thoughgave up after getting frustrated with teammates getting in the way of cover and getting infront of grenade throws. teammates are morons, after stopping a grenade with the back of their helmet they think theyre birds and sit on it to try and hatch it.What this game tries to do gears of war does better. the action is better paced, the guns feel more like guns and not bb guns that you need to shoot someone 6 times with. could name the characters in GOW and dont know anything beyond my whopping 2 teammembers. save your money, dont buy this			"

												I'm reviewing the singleplayer in April 2014. The multiplayer is thoroughly dead (yeah I actually logged in with UPlay credentials). The game has not aged so well. The campaign is short and ends abruptly with a ""to be continued"" screen. The guns feel stiff and plastic, and there's no obvious reason to ever pick the ones with subpar stats. The graphics are not the best even for 2006, and strikingly bad when you're in a helicopter over Vegas. Environments have no interaction aside from ladders, ropes, and the occasional exploding barrel. The story is pretty worthless. The level design is decent with lots of cover and alternate paths, though ultimately each mission is linear. The best part of the game is giving commands to your squadmates, who actually do have decent AI and only occasionally forget to shoot the badguy right in front of them. Unfortunately once you get the hang of sending them ahead to do most of the work then the game becomes fairly easy. I can't even recommend it much for the squad combat because the same kind of system was absorbed into far better games like Mass Effect.			"

												I felt that this game did not age well. I would skip this game and just get Vegas 2. They seemed almost identical except for some improvements in Vegas 2 such as graphics and controls. There's also no XP system in this game, whereas in Vegas 2 you can gain XP as you play. There are also a few less items to use in this one. I play these types of games mainly for co-op with friends. This game left a stale taste in our mouths as a friend and I attempted to play Vegas 2. It was hard to take that game seriously after playing this one. Perhaps I'll give Vegas one more try because maybe we weren't in the right mood from the get-go, but for now I highly suggest passing on this one unless you're really eager for more Rainbow.			"

I've already asked for Ubisoft support. What happens is this: Usually the exes of Steam games are modified so that they HAVE to detect Steam and the license prior to run. Here, Ubisoft went lazy and made a runme.exe (search your binary folder) that reads a runme.data Inside runme.data is specified the name of the exe (in this case R6Vegas_Launcher.exe) that will en up being executed. The runme.exe is the one that holds the Steam license validation... Yes, Ubisoft didn't modify the actual game exe to be compatible with steam, it created another one with the validations that calls the retail one. So if you run the game from Binaries folder Steam won't track your game time. Is it really THAT hard to modify the game exe so it can be fully compatible with steam? Okay the game is old, forget the resolution, (there is patch that changes the congif file online that does the job) give me the overlay with tracking and I'll be able to recommend it.			"

												This game is fun as a single player tactical shooter, with the ability to order your AI teammates to advance, breach/clear rooms etc. However :- the hostiles are sometimes impossible to see. I found myself literally pixel hunting in some of the levels to try to distinguish the enemy AI from the background. It doesn't help that the hostiles can shoot you through surfaces that are transparent to them but opaque to you (including foliage and lattices)- hostiles spawn regardless of your approach; stealth is not rewarded. Blitzkreig through an area and find 5 hostiles round the corner expecting you, reload the area and sneakily kill everyone without alerting anyone, you will still find those 5 hostiles expecting you- checkpoints are few and far between. Ostensibly clear an area, complete the objectives, get 1-hit by a hostile standing across the map behind a hedge, tough **** you're gonna have to do it all again.All these factors make it a frustrating experience to play.

												This USED TO BE the best game for xbox in my opinion, saw this gem on steam and thought id relive past glorious memories... Oh how i was shocked, appauled and disgusted... Where do i start... the hour spent trying to figure out why the game wouldnt load? The fact that the most fun aspect of the game being the Ranking system is NON EXISTENT, thats right there is no ranking system or unlocking anything, everything is already unlocked and available and there are no ranks despite the fact that it clearly states on steam that there is... false advertisement right there... Controller support also doesnt seem to work, the option box is there to allow xbox controller but if you click it nothing seems to happen, i managed to get the controller to work for 3 minutes before it stopped again, i have 4 friends who all have this exact same issue... All in all, thanks steam for releasing a dumbed down ruined version of a once great game. I would attempt to retrieve a refund, but we all know thats like hitting your head against a wall.			"

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas is if anything a mediocre FPS that while entertaining at times, doesn't bring anything new to the table. Really, the game is just simply put, average.The plot is a straight out of a generic action-thriller movie that involves a WMD in the middle of the Vegas Strip, and only you and your squad can save Sin City and all its morally-questionable fun. This plain jane story is presented through some of the cheesiest voice-acting I've ever heard; foul-mouthed terrorists and an overly 'Murican protagonist are the first things your auditory senses will register. Your squadmates are no better either, although Jun has to be the less obnoxious of the two since he has the decency to not spout off 80's era catchphrases and one-liners every 15 seconds. Gameplay is as I've mentioned before, mediocre and not notable in a market that's got more shooters than rounds fired in the average round of Battlefield. The only real variety that Vegas has to seperate itself is a cover mechanic and a few contextual commands for your squad (such as breaching a door). While this may be a step above something like Call of Duty, compared to older Rainbow six games, such as the legendary Rainbow six 3, the oversimplified mechanic is a major letdown. Regardless, the cover mechanic is helpful in combating the hordes of profanity spewing bad guys who seems to have more ammunition than braincells. Once again, your squadmates aren't all that smarter, but they do make a handy distraction when the brown hits the fan and can do a decent amount of damage if you set them up in a good spot where they can rain down lead.While we're discussing ""raining down lead"", Vegas 1 does offer a reasonable selection of weapons, but sabotoges itself with some odd, clunky, and pointless mechanics. Firstly, you are given infinite ammunition for your pistol which detracts from the realism and practically turns your other two weapons into dead weight. If you pair this up with the Shield, you get invincibilty against all frontal attacks, an endless supply of rounds, and a defenstration of any and all realism; the same realism that Tom Clancy games often attempt to emulate. As for your two-handed firearms, you are offered Assault rifles, Submachine guns, shotguns, light machine guns, and sniper rifles. You will find the most use out of Assault Rifles and SMGs since every other weapon is overly crippled in some way shape or form. Shotguns will knock down a goon in one satisfying shot, but have limited range, low rate-of-fire, and slow-reload (we'll discuss this later) Light Machine guns may offer you a chance to live your fantasy of being rambo, but that gets cut short when the fact that it can't hit the broadside of a barn leaves your staring at the sky with your blood-splattered eyes.Sniper Rifles, like shotguns, can take out enemy mooks with a single bullet (headshot not required) but since most of this game takes place indoors...I'll let you figure that one out.As promised, now we discuss the worst part of this game and the source of it's fake difficulty: reloading. Once you press the ""R"" key, your character will, beyond all odds, defying all sense of self-preservation, adamantly reload his weapon or die trying. The saving grace is that reloading is manual-only, but when your primary is a shotgun or light machine gun and a hostile decides to come over and see why you aren't lighting him up, you're a goner as there is no way to stop the animation. You can't switch weapons, can't throw grenades, can't order your squad around, all you can do is watch your character get helplessly riddled with bullets because of an idiotic design flaw. In Terrorist Hunt, which is this game's version of Gears of War Horde Mode, all you do is clear out 15~60 terrorists from the multiplayer maps all on your own. Easier said than done as the game enjoys spawning badguys behind you and into rooms you've just cleared making for some cheap deaths and even more fake difficulty. I know flanking around or behind your target is a tactic used in reality, but Counter-Terrorist teams also don't send you into firefights alone in reality either. As annoying as Jun and Micheal can be in the campaign, you'll start to wish they were there to watch your back.To conclude, if you are a hardcore first-person shooter warrior then you may find Rainbow six Vegas to be enjoyable, but if not, don't waste your cash on this game. It's not good enough to be fun and competitive; it's not bad enough to laugh at. It's plain average.			"

												I want to thank my little brother for buying this game when it was my birthday, im an fps fanatic and i love realistic games,I was never before a ranbow six fan because i was just too young when i first plyed it and i hated that u had toplan youre whole mission op front like wich doors schould be breached and when.In this game the realism is the same but u dont have to plan and study the whole map before starting a mission, i found the graphics stunning since i can only play games from 2009 max :P, the game is pretty straightforward but there are tactics involved like when to brech and clear or when to frag and clear etc. but u only have command of one team and not multiple. For the hardcore fans i recommand to play it on realism mode since u really need to have insight and onlu 1 or 2 bullets and u are dead. I recommend this to any fps fan who loves realism, its just too bad i never had the chance to play multiplayer mode and im pretty shure the servers are offline since siege and vegas 2. Peace			"

												This is one of the first shooter games I played and it's got a load of memories. The graphics aren't bad, some could say they're fantastic for the release. I enjoy ragdolls in action games and this delivers. I used to run a slow computer and this game literally ran as smooth as anything. It doesn't require a buffed computer which is nice. The weapons aren't too varied, but there's still a decent selection [don't worry though, they've got every type of weapons excluding RPGs]. On top of that, the physics are pretty nice and if you're not satisfied you can set them to realistic [you die way quicker and AIs are more difficult]. You won't see someone die from one shot unless the weapon is buffed or you get a headshot. That's also nice, unlike other games, you actually kill them one shot if it's critical. A warning to any choir-boys out there though, this game has some intense language. You'll hear racial slurs, vulgar language, and words you've probably never heard before. As for the story, it's pretty well written with nice maps. If you ever get bored you've got the classic terrorist hunts which are a good practice lol.			"

												Most of the Rainbow Six Vegas 1 levels are more open than the ones of R6Vegas2, you do not have to unlock everything, the story coop supports four players instead of R6V2's two player story coop.R6V2 does seem to be a bit more refined in some areas, but in others it is a step backward from R6V1.

												This game is for sure one of the classics. Although I did struggle tremendously during some missions, its difficulty is one that's hard to come by now-a-days. This game really emphasizes being ""tactical"" and ensuring every move you make adheres to that standard. This is not a run and gun type of game. You will die very easily as your hp recovery time isn't rapid and you can only take a maximum of 3-4 consecutive shots/hits. The only downside, in my opinion, is the checkpoints. It doesn't save often enough so when you get past some difficult part of the mission and die, you have to do it all over again. Most of my frustration stemmed from this. I strongly disliked how difficult it was at some points and when I get past it, I die from say.. someone hiding around the corner. I enjoyed this game very much and would highly recommend it to those who enjoy tactical first person shooters and I mean tactical in the literal sense. None of that run and gun nonsense some ""tactical"" games seem to promote. Another addition to it that may be a pro or con is that the campaign is INCREDIBLY long. At this point, I have no idea when the campaign is going to end. Like I said, this may be a good thing to some and a bad thing to others. It also gets fairly repetitive eventually and therefore, ends up being dry. All in all, a good game!			"
