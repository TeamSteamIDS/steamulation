AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Unreal 2: The Awakening Original Release: 2003 Genre Tags: FPS; Action; Sci-Fi My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Nostalgia chasers REVIEWI personally was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed Unreal II: The Awakening. There is actually a decent sci-fi narrative in there; albeit one that is a bit cliché. And the characters actually have personalities that manage to be mildly interesting. Mix that in with classic Unreal FPS gameplay and you get a pretty enjoyable experience.The narrative will escort you from mission to mission (level to level), as you explore various worlds in the vastness of space to accomplish your goals.  In between each mission you return to your spaceship where you can interact (mildly) with your crew and arrange your armament for the next mission.  Having conversations with your crew allows you to gather background information and expands on some of the lore aspects.  In this way, there are some parallels with the early Mass Effect games.The different missions will take you to diverse environments with various objectives, but the core gameplay doesn’t evolve much throughout the game. However you will be able to unlock new weapons and armaments as you progress, which allows you to keep things fresh as you finish up the campaign.One main complaint with Unreal II: The Awakening is that the movement speed is much slower than in other Unreal games. To be honest, it didn’t bother me that much. Luckily, if it does bother you, there is a way to increase the speed of the game using the console.  So it is true that Unreal II: The Awakening isn’t perfect, but I still really liked the overall experience quite a bit.  I think if you enjoy sci-fi FPS games with decent narratives, and need something new to play: this is a good game for you to consider.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Unreal 2 starts very real, introducing your character, an ex-marine that patrols space for the Terran Colonial Authority with his cozy little spaceship, a funny pilot and a hot female companion (oh and the techie that gives you a bunch of new guns and mods after each mission). The dialogue is fun and the graphics holp up very well but the gameplay is slow and the loading times ridiculous (maybe it has something to do with my system but playing on 'hard' means you will see more of the loading screen than the actual game even when returning to a quickload). LOADING-STANDBY-INITIALISING...The psychodelic intro is nothing like the game. It was probably hard to top the creepiness and sense of alienation you had in the original, as well as it's speed and agility.  Still, the game has enough variety in the settings (very different planets and climates) and the weapons (very cool stuff including a flamethrower, turrets, and even a spiderthrower) to make it worthwhile.

												One of the last of the old-fashioned 'second generation' of FPSs on PC has mature gameplay without the complexities of more modern titles. Like many shooters from 2002-04 (such as Doom 3), its perceived flaws were more a question of originality as we headed toward more complex games like Half-Life 2, something that console shooters of the day like 'Halo' were never tarnished with. This is all of course, nowadays irrelevant. Imaginatively pretty graphics, atmospherically slower pacing, and a story with characterisation ahead of its time blesses this game with somewhat alternative priorities. It's a lot of nostalgic fun, and a great purchase for especially those who aren't extraordinarily familiar with FPSs.			"

												Nice storyline and also quite interesting and difficult game. Graphics is very good considered the year of release. The game can be completed in less than 8 hours with no problems so not very long if you are hoping to have a long gameplay. If you buy it in offer or for a price lower than 5$ I think it would be a good game to try if you like FPS games.			"

												Unreal 2 was amongst the first games to use Unreal Engine 2, Epic's technology that for years rivalled with id software's own engine. Still, after the first Unreal we had to wait 5 years for this and 2003 was just a year before 2004, the year when a lot of big names appeared; each offering something new in terms of technology (Far Cry, Doom 3 and Half Life 2, just to name a few).Interestingly, the developer was Legend Entertainment, the guys behind the expansion pack of the first Unreal game (the company has since gone defunct) and it is a shame they could only come out with a generic shooter. While graphically the game was amazing it had little to do with Skaarj, the main antagonist species we fought so hard in the first episode. The story now is very different (but then again Quake 2 had nothing to do with Quake 1, right?); it revolves around an artifact our marine hero is set out to retrieve. Gameplay-wise Unreal 2 is quite exciting: with John we regularly return to his ship to converse with his companions who can prepare us for the next mission. This hub area has free roaming characteristics until the moment you commence your next mission which is very linear. We visit several planets; all with its own visual theme (we have deserts, snowy areas and even an alien spaceship here) just to  make the gameplay more interesting. Too bad that there are too many cutscenes (the generic dialogues make them boring after a while) and for some unknown reason the game only has very generic weapons. Where is the Flak Cannon we have grown to like? Here you have rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers - all too generic even with their alternative fire mode.The game offers a decent, 9-10 hour long campaign but not multiplayer. I understand Legend came out with an expansion just to add the missing feature to the game. Still, Unreal 2 is a mixed bag. Its unique weapons disappeared from the sequel and while the story was interesting there was not much to go on with the Skaarj. The voice actor for the main protagonist was a definite miscast.It runs well, though. There are some error messages upon launching the game but using Windows XP compatibility mode can solve all the problems. I am upvoting it mainly for sentimental reasons (after all, it was a good pastime before the new generation of FPS games were released in 2004) but perhaps you are better off with the Gold edition of the first game.

Where you go is where the objecctive is.-Character runs a little too slowly-Could do with a little more defense setups (setting up turrets/shields ect)Pros very much outweigh the cons so its a 10/10 from me			"

												As a huge fan of the first Unreal, I was so hyped about this game.  I wanted to like it... I really did... but it's honstly a bad game.  It has almost nothing at all to do with the first, and has a completely different atmosphere and feel.  Some of the enemies and environments are pretty cool, but overall the execution comes off as pretty incompetent for a developer with this much experience.  A resounding ""meh.""  While it isn't all-out terrible, there are much, much better FPS games for the money.  If you dont mind the antiquated graphics, I'd recommend the origninal much more than this one.  If you're looking for an engaging single-player FPS, try Crysis, Bioshock, or any Half-Life game.			"

												First of all i have to say i'm really disappointed by this entry on the Unreal series it really lacks of that distinctive fast paced action combat that most of the other games have but ok let's get to my thougths on the game. I was very exited about Unreal 2, i started it right away after i finished Unreal Gold (which was good af) and it just let me down with slow pace action, weird guns that i rarely used, tryharding to get interested in the side characters, boring levels, tons and tons of loading screens, not feeling like a unreal game at all, generic shooter, the most cheap and zzzz ""plot"" (if you can call it that) and finally the playtime (UG tooke me 20+ hrs to finish it with the ""Return to Napali"" exp and this one less than 10 hrs in the highest difficulty). It was an awful experience really, there where little moments that i really enjoy but man it was a Unreal game! How could it be this bad. But anyway.I didn't like it and i won't recommend it at anyone.			"

There were many occasions of unwarranted game crashes, and ""dying"" time you saved the game, which was really odd.

												It's a lot slower paced than you'd expect an Unreal game to be, and the classic Unreal weapons have been replaced with new ones which are kinda neat but more standard for the genre.

												This game brought back childhood memories, and that may have been one of the main reasons I enjoyed it. This game is excellent (as long as we forgive voice acting), adding a variety of weapons each with their own unique alternative functions. The storyline is great.There is some cons, though. Your character moves unbearably slow, and you have to use cheats in order to accelerate him to a playable speed. There is a variety of enemies you will face, but the apparent main enemy you are supposed to be fighting is the Skaarj an they are there in very few missions. The replayability of the game is low, not to mention that you may become frustrated when you completely forgot to save (there is no autosaves) and then are forced to restart the mission.Ultimately, I loved the game. It was a throwback to the days when games were original and good, and ultimately gave me a shot back at the past.			"

												I've been an Unreal veteran since early 2000's. From playing every single Unreal/UT game, this actually takes #1 spot as the worst in the franchise, next to UT3, and here are the problems with this game: 1. Bugs. I've had crashes happen, and oh boy how this game doesn't like newer OSes. 2. Rushed developement. Seriously, this is a huge sin in Video Game developement. 3. No multiplayer...Well there is deathmatch mode, but you have to edit some files and such to enable it. Better off to just play UT2004.4. Nobody plays it. Seriously, I can't find any decent mods to play on this, except XMP, but I doubt I would even find a good server for that. 5. Movement speed...The Doom 3 guy can run faster than John, like come on now. It was so bad, I actually have to use ""setspeed 2"" cheat to play it. Better off to just stick with Unreal Gold. It's way better and plus the modding community for that is much larger than this.			"

												NOTE: I am extremly biased in my opinion. Being that this was my first game I ever played. And have a deep love for it.Why is it that every game MUST break new ground in gameplay? Solid gameplay is solid gameplay, why must devolopers ""reinvent the wheel"" every time they produce a game? Do we expect novelty because of the high price we pay for games? Perhaps. Or do we expect more bang for our buck from larger developers? Whatever the case, Unreal II has a fine story, the graphics are simply extraordinary, and the gameplay is certainly on par with any game deserving of a 9 out of 10. Plus, I picked up a new copy for $2.75, it's a pretty sweet game on a 6800 Ultra for that price! Think I'll quit complaining and look for some extra levels for this bad boy.			"

												This game doesn't invalidate the full Unreal collection, but before buying it, I would certainly make sure that it saves you money without U2, because you should not pay money for this game. Upon starting the game, you will be walking around, get very board with the slow walking speed, then hit Shift to speed up, only to discover that your slow waddle was actually your running speed when you start barely moving foreward. The running speed is unacceptably slow. Another reviewer, Resi, provided the following advice in their review:Access console using ~Type BeMyMonkeyType setspeed 2Whether this helps the game, I don't know. Your weapons are very weak and extremely difficult to aim. The reticle often seems to have a very loose association with how your bullets wil actually fly and this cupled with the accuracy problems and slow movement makes this a VERY frustrating game to play through. START ON EASY! I learned the hard way.Your efforts are rewarded with a story that is predictable from start to finish with no subtlety or spice to make the journy worth it. You fight through generic sci-fi facilities and planets, killing generic shooter enemies (aliens with guns, humans with guns, bugs) with the Skaarj enemies that made the original so memorable rare and watered down. For comparison, the original Unreal barely had a story, but it explained what was going on on Na Pali with such subtlety that you didn't care. It could be the story of a man trying to survive, or a freedom fighter, or something in the middle based only on your interpretation. Instead, we have a muguffin hunt in space. If you have it, try the cheats above. I will. If you don't, remember, DON'T PAY EXTRA FOR THIS GAME! There are so many good shooters on Steam, you shouldn't have to waste your time with this one.

												I remember playing this when I was younger, and I didn't realise how incredibly generic the entire game is. It's in that awkward period of time where FPS games followed iconic predecessors like Half Life and Quake but did very little to differentiate themselves from it. The movement is slow and clunky, the enemies move erratically, the story is bland and the graphical themes aren't much to write home about in 2003. A huge departure from the original Unreal. The weapon selection is pretty good, however some of them are plagued with slow projectiles and short ranges.Unless you're playing for nostalgia's sake, I wouldn't recommend it. Use your time playing the original or Unreal Tournament instead.			"

												Not Recommended! If you loved the original Unreal this is not the game for you. The environments are linear to the point of being boring. The majority of the game you fight other humans intead of aliens (I found this far less interesting). The gunplay doesn't feel satisfying but the flamethrower flames surprisingly still look good. The story is boring and muddled, only the immediate ending is remotely interesting but then its over. Having a ship and a crew should have been cool, but the developers never fully realized it. The main character's voice acting is the worst in the industry, how he continues to find work I'll never know. If you're looking for an Unreal experience, avoid this game and replay the first!			"

												I love unreal.Love it to death.After Quake and Doom, this was one of my first FPS experiences.And Unreal (tournament) and 2004 was my first full FPS experience.This game however, is garbage when compared to any of them.It lacks any sort of multiplayer, the character movement is not anything like other unreal games, in fact it feels like you're walking around with cement shoes when compared to any of them.The guns just don't feel right, the graphics seem bubbly and strange compared to other unreal titles.Which is odd because this was made by Epic games.Unreal is a superior single player experience, and a classic FPS single player style game.Unreal 2004 is a superior multiplayer and tournament shooter.I owned this game as a physical copy, and I don't even remember buying it on steam, it must of been part of a game pack or something.Either way, don't waste your money, and don't let epic pawn this off on you in some bundle.It is literally the worst unreal game there has been, including the console ports.

												It's... decent. It isn't arena style combat like the UT games, but it is a bit of a mix between the original Unreal and the Tournaments. The graphics look nice for it's time, but obviously don't look great today. The guns are kind of cool, and there are a few challenging and fun to fight enemies. Really, it's just hard to say anything is majorly wrong with the game, but there isn't much they did super well. The guns are kind of cool, and if you played Oblivion, the main character's voice should sound VERY familiar. The biggest flaw with the game is probably the story, it starts off so slow I don't have any urge to play for it. The characters are neat, but I wish I could interact with them more. If you want a good old shooter to waste some time, this game won't dissapoint. If you want the next big hit arena shooter, you're going to want to pass. It's hard to describe this game at all, watch some videos of it. 8/10.			"

												3/10 ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I got it for free and I still want my money back.What a piece of trash. Not nearly as unique as the first Unreal. In fact it isn't unique at all, just standard garbage. The guns are standard shooter game weapons, the enemies suck, so does the dialogue and voice acting. The graphics are balls too even for its time. The game gets progressively harder only because enemies have pinpoint no-miss accuracy and you can die very easily. So as you start getting to enemies that are more bullet spongey or tanks with rocket launchers it gets harder for the wrong reason and quicksave is your best frend in this game. It just sucks though, everything about it is suck awful.It crashes constantly too. It wasn't a problem at first because it was only crashing once in a while when loading a save which is fine because the game can be restarted pretty quickly and you can try to load the save again and most of the time it works. But once it crashed after a level was over and it faded to black to start a cutscene. Before I got to see it, it crashed and when I restarted and reloaded my save I had to redo a little bit of gameplay. If I hadn't quicksaved in a while I would have been super ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Oh well I'm done with this anyway.There should be a petition to have this game legally renamed to Garbage Balls 2.			"

												Perhaps the least known game of the Unreal series - for a reason. It does not feel like Unreal, does not sound like Unreal, does not even look like Unreal. There is just one alien race and three names of corporations reminding you of the other games of the series.Not everything in this game is bad. Graphics are really nice for a 2003 game, and you fight in a wide variety of different environments, from a standard desert military base to the internal organs of a huge planet-covering alien creature. The TCA Atlantis, your own spaceship, has many nice details in its rooms.Unfortunately, it lacks all the best aspects of the first Unreal. Maps and missions are very linear and predictable. Your movement in the bulky mech suit is clumsy and slow. The way of combat is quite different, not necessarily bad but not appealing to the fans of fast FPS. Background music isn't as impressive as in the first U. Storyline is OK but also quite short and flat. You won't feel the same mysterious atmosphere that made the first Unreal so great.Want something like Unreal? A fast-paced survival FPS? Do not buy this. Want a generic sci-fi tactical shooter? You might like this, although I'm pretty sure there are better alternatives.Overall grade: 4/10			"

												I would give this game a 'meh' rating if it wasnt for two things. I could overlook the annoying voice acting, the unoriginal/uninteresting story, the boring characters, and the generic level design, if it wasnt for these two simple things:1. The movement speed of your character is the slowest I have ever encountered in any video game. Ever. This defats the whole purpose of the unreal franchise, since its trademark is dodging and jumping your way through hordes of enemies, evading their oncoming fire. Instead, I'm backpedaling frantically, desperately spewing bullets into my enemies' faces as they outrun and swarm me.2. The gun loadout in this game is incredibly boring and lackluster compared to the other unreal games. instead of ten unique and highly creative weapons, you simply get a standard military loadout and whatever guns that your enemies drop. Probably the most interesting weapon I've encountered is the grenade launcher, simply because its gets 6 kinds of ammo and the ability to switch between them at will.So yeah, those are the gamebreakers for me, and adding all the stuff I mentioned before just makes this game not very enjoyable. The ONLY reason you should get this game is if you're a big fan of the Unreal franchise and want to brag that you've played all of the games.			"

												With windows 10, the only way you can play this game is with the \""reduce mouse lag\"" setting off. This, however, is a gamebreaker, as the Unreal franchise depends on fluid movement and combat. With this setting off, it's tortorous to play, but is the only way to prevent the game from crashing. I was really dissapointed, because I had so much fun with the other Unreal games. If you are an absolute, die hard Unreal fan, you might be forgiving of this. I will die hard for this series, but I will not die this hard. Even from the few minutes I played, it is clear that this game borrowed heavily from Halo: Combat Evolved. Unless you can get this game to work as it is designed to, I recommend you play Halo: CE for the PC instead. However, because it isn't on steam, you will have to find a disc copy (GASP!) like me. If that's too much trouble, play UT2004 instead. To all those that remember a time when PC games actually came in cardboard boxes and not DVD cases.			"

												I remember on January 2003, I got an early copy of Unreal 2 at Hastings, I'm guessing they had a review copy or something like that. Anyways, I remember playing it, liking it, but then again, I was 9 when I played it.Now years later went by and I'm an adult now, is Unreal 2 as good as I remember it?HELL NO.Let's get the positives out of the way first, the graphics of Unreal 2 are good and weapons are unique just like the environments, from a gun that shoots spiders to a grenade launcher with multiple ammo types, the guns are good.But that's about it.Unreal 2's story has nothing in correlation with it's predecessor, Unreal 1 and RTNP.  In fact, the only thing that Unreal 1 and 2 have in common is the fact there's Skarrj, and that's about it. U2 does try to add Liandri, Izanagi and Unreal Tournament references in there, but it goes over the head like the comedy.Characters are nice, but bland.And then there's the gameplay.U2 is single-player only (unless you get the XMP pack of the net), and while the environments are nice looking and unique, it doesn't help that each mission is about the same; go in, kill a bunch of dudes and aliens, solve a puzzle and get the artifact.In between missions, you can talk to your crew aboard the USS Enter... I mean Atlantis, to get briefed about your next mission, learn about your weapons and learn about the backstory of the crew, that's it. It serves it's purpose.But sometimes when normal missions aren't enough, U2 likes to throw a curve ball in the form of defense missions.. and these can BURN. IN. HELL.Defense missions asks you to defend an area or a person for a certain amount of time, using force fields and turrets and Marines with Derpy AI to guard the objective from waves of enemies. The problem is that not only do they break the boring flow, but some of them are a pain, be it the derpy AI marines, the derpy targeting system of the Turrets, the fact that it takes little time for the enemy to plow through your defense with ease or all three.And let's not forget that one DICKWAD on Janus named Meyer... The biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in U2 who constantly ♥♥♥♥♥es about everything. EVERYTHING. With all these things combined, I cannot recommend Unreal 2: The Awakening to anyone, from veterans on Unreal to new players.			"

												Unreal 2 is an underrated little gem that was overshadowed by Halo (which in turn was influenced by the first Unreal). The major difference between the two is that while Halo sucks, Unreal 2 doesn't. The graphics are better, the combat is better and there are no tedious driving segments or pitiful attempts at an epic story with Disney enemies. The story is simple, involving chasing artefacts throughout the galaxy, which serves as an excuse to showcase some epic and varied environments that still impress. Despite the low-key story, there are some good character interactions and a very gutsy ending. The only downsides I can think of are the rather slow walking speed (a sprint function would have helped a lot) and a soundtrack that doesn't live up to its predecessor's reputation. Also note that the game's human enemies are annoyingly difficult on the hardest skill setting so take that as a word of caution if you're planning on yanking up the difficulty level.			"

												An outdated old shooter which quality mark can be placed somewhere between medium and poor. Unreal is loved by gamers for high game speed\intensity and addicting gameplay and this one is lacking both. Don't recommend it even with discount. Still after all this years can't understand how Epic let this thing through...			"

												I'm a die-hard fan of the Unreal series and this one made me say ""wat.""It's just so bad and the pace is completely against everything that was the previous games...Not to mention it looks completely silly and the narrative is awful.  Part of what made Unreal Gold so immersive was that the entire narrative was told through journals and logs that you pick up off of dead bodies or other landmarks...Apparently reading is hard now.

												Awful. A true insult to the Unreal series.Unreal and Unreal Tournament are my two favourite FPS's of all time, Unreal offers a beautiful fast paced single player adventure with Awesome Multiplayer and Unreal Tournament IS Awesome Multiplayer. Unreal 2 is Neither.This game has no reason bearing the name 'Unreal'. The ONLY connections to the previous games are a few similar weapons and the incredibly forced appearance of the Skaarj. That's it. The only other reason it has the name is because it uses the Unreal Engine, which is absolutely stupid, it would make as much sense calling XIII Unreal 3 or Dishonored Unreal 4!Storywise the game offers nothing, you play as a generic Space Marine whose role is to fly around the universe with his Stripper/Captain, an engineer who was probably homeless before this job and the Unreal universes version of Jar Jar Binks. None of whom have much in the way of personality, general likability or interest.Weapons in a Nutshell: The Dispersion Pistol from the first game, Except it can't be upgraded and is never used. A pistol which delivers a lot of damage but has low ammo, rarely used. A generic Assault Rifle (how creative). A shotgun that fires both regular rounds and fire rounds (kinda cool). A Flamethrower that can also fire flammable liquid and then be ignited (or you could just set the target of fire initially showoff). A Rocket launcher. A Sniper Rifle. A Gun that has interchangable rounds, yet you rarely find a use for each individual round, ultimately creating a mess of a weapon, 2 alien laser guns. A gun that shoots spiders (less coll than you would think). And a Black Hole Launcher that is only used in the last level.There is an Escort mission in this game, and the guy you have to escort makes Natalya from Goldeneye seem like Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite. He is such an annoying whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ and you just want to kill him, but killing the guy results in a game over. To rub it in your face, when you beat that level there is a cutscene where Blandy McSpace-Awesome is told to kill him, and he refuses, you don't even get a choice, you just watch as the game gives you the finger.Levels are slow and empty, they usually contain few enemies, the game appears to be playing like Half-Life yet the enemies are all laid out like Splinter Cell, this is a Bad Thing. There is no exploration either, one of the things that made the first game so good was that you had to explore to survive, you found something new each time you played, this game does not, and as such has no replay value.The Biggest sin of the game is that IT IS SOOOOOO SSLLLOOOOOWWWW. Your character moves like he is wearing Lead Armour and there are sections of the game that make you roam your ship just to talk initiate random chatter with people you don't care about, This coming from a series famous for it's fast action gameplay. Oh and the game is 6 HOURS LONG! The fact you move to slow feels like a cheap way to artificially lengthen the game.To Spoil the ending (Because this is one of the worst games I have ever played); Your Crew gets killed (I think you are supposed to care) and you are then sent to see some alien mutate into an uncontrollable beast, This is the Final boss btw. When you kill it you get the aforementioned BFG Black Hole gun and you kill a bunch of identical and now inferior mutants, against an artificial timer as the ship heads to a sun. Oh and turns out some random guy you forgot about betrayed you and you kill him in a cutscene. Offscreen. You don't even get to see the impact. And you escape.Honestly one of the Worst FPS games ever, and it's a shame because the developers clearly put more effort into the art design than the actual game. Yes, despite everything I've said the sole positive feature is that the game looks REALLY good. But other than that there is NOTHING. Oh and there is no Multiplayer either, yes, the series that managed to redefine multiplayer experience has a game with none at all. Perhaps if it an alternate name then perhaps it could jsut be forgotten about as a Generic FPS, but the fact it shares the name with two of my favourite games is insulting.Don't buy this. Play Unreal or Unreal Tournament instead.FINAL VERDICT: Garbage.			"

												Fun game to play if you have an itch for sci-fi shooters. Not a long game, probably 6-8 hours, so definitely get it on sale. Solid all around with a few really cool and unique missions and weapons. I have a few complaints, but overall the game makes up for them.The movement speed in this game is insufferably slow (slower than Halo), and there is no sprint ability. To rememdy this, you can bring up the console with the ~ key and type in ""setspeed 2"". This will double your movement speed and make this game feel much more like the original Unreal and UT2004. You may consider this cheating, but the maps in the game are simply too big for how slowly you move. It really comes down to if you want to spend the game walking really slowly toward your next objective, or actually playing the game and enjoying the combat.My main complaint is how weapons switching works. Weapons are bound to your number keys, 1-5. But there are more than 5 weapons in the game so they decided to bind two or even three weapons to the same key, forcing you to press a key multiple times to access certain weapons. It really breaks the flow of the game and I wish they did it some other way. There is not even the option to use all 10 numbers keys. Story is so-so, but nobody plays these games for the story. The main gist is that you have to go to different planets to collect 7 ancient mysterious artifacts of power. The bad guys want them too and are trying to stop you at every turn. The crew on your ship have interesting personalities and backstories of their own which  give the game a little more personality, but it's nothing special.  "

												Unreal 2 has no doubt let down a great many people since its release, but in my opinion not every title needs to be ""groundbreaking"" or a ""masterpiece."" Was there a significant amount of hype during the pre-release? Of course. Were expectations not met? Without a doubt, as it is literally impossible to please every person. This game is enjoyable to play regardless of the negative aura it's been given by ""shattered"" expectations in the community. It has beautiful visuals, lovely worlds, fun weapons, plentiful amounts of enemies and good music. Was this game worth it's full retail price back in the day? Looking back on it, no. But now that it's in the ""bargain bin,"" if you will, it's definitely a good play-through, if for nothing else it's beautifully rendered atmospheres and the music that adds to it.			"

												Well, after finally beating this game, I liked it. In the regard that the developers stated this was a sequel to the first game, this game was sub-par and hardly lived up to the role of the previous installment. If taken as a separate game, I think it was good and still be considered a classic. I like the environments being large and consist of a variety of different themes to them. Although, the choice of how you want to approach the situation in the environments is usually limited beside the choice of what weapon to use in the approach. Also, this game, in comparison to Unreal: Gold, the levels seem to break up the game into levels. I think in the first installment, the game flowed like it was a sold experience that easily felt like one long campaign. Also, I can't go without mentioning that the levels seem short in general and for some reason, the load times are insane unless it is a short cutscene. The soundtrack is not a masterpiece but still fitting and good. The AI is still somewhat intelligent and can be funny at times. So, overall, I thought the game had some problems but it was still very enjoyable, I would play this game again and definitely would recommend this to fans of the series or first person shooter fans.

												While not a sequel in terms of story, Unreal 2 definitely is the next step in level design.The excellent level design that makes the first Unreal still playable today, also makes this one worth looking into. The story (like the first) is lifted straight out of cheezy sci-fi, and maybe that's part of the charm. Where he game excels is in the design of the levels: Large, Open, and Complex. Each level looks and feels like actual sites would look; some are long and rambling wilderness, others are complex colony bases.Stunning visuals, satifying weapons, and some eye candy that helps tie it together.

												Unreal 2 The Awakening: This game is a true classic, good gfx and good story well put togeather Fps, old it may be but holds it head even today.Its been some time ago since playing this game and i still have the retail version within my games collection, but like many other games on steam some are worth buying again so that you dont need to use your cd/dvd all the time.Well my play time is not so high yet on steam but that will change soon as i need to tweak a few things first within the config file of the Ureal Engine.My Os is win 7 64 bit with I7 processor 3.5ghz ATIGFX 4 gig card, and this game is for Win2000/XP 32 bit, with 32mb GFX card, the price of the game in sales was only £0.89  so thought its worth the risk on my new PC.Game runs no problems but did want to change/tweak a few things within the Ureal Engine to get the best out of this classic game.This may help some others run the game or not on older TVs? as my HDTV is old samsung it will only run games at its highest res of 1920-1080p at 30Hz :( or native res at 1280-720 HD at 60Hz.Well within the game menu min refreshrate is set at min 60Hz up 85Hz so if you set game res within game to run in any res higher than 1280-720 the game will crashout out and give you error for your 3d1. Look in C:\Program Files(x86)\Steamapps\Common.2. Now look for Unreal II The awakening and open.3. Look in System folder.4. Scroll down to the file Unreal2 config5. Now find and change to suit your system?[WinDrv.WindowsClient]WindowedViewportX=1024WindowedViewportY=768WindowedOffsetX=-1WindowedOffsetY=-1FullscreenViewportX=1920 Change to res you want here?FullscreenViewportY=1080 Change to res you want here?Next at 1920-1080 res on my tv the refreshrate within the game is set to min 60Hz, so i need to find it within the config file and change that.Now scroll down and find it.[D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice]UseHardwareTL=TrueUseHardwareVS=TrueUsePrecaching=TrueUseTrilinear=TrueUseVSync=TrueUseTripleBuffering=FalseUseCubemaps=TrueReduceMouseLag=TrueAdapterNumber=-1MaxTextures=0MaxBlendStages=0DesiredRefreshRate=30 Default is 60Hz min in the game menu but i need it to be 30Hz. change this to your DesiredRefreshRate?UseStencil=FalseDetailTextures=TrueUse16bit=FalseUse16bitTextures=FalseUseCompressedLightmaps=FalseLevelOfAnisotropy=16          Default here is set to 1 but i will change this to be 16 for best? check your GFX card for this.DetailTexMipBias=0.800000DefaultTexMipBias=-0.500000AvoidHitches=FalseDescFlags=0Description=HighDetailActors=True  This is set to default at false? change this to say True? i will check this one out again to see!!So excellent all done for now hope this helps. Would recommend this game to all FPS players its old but worth a score of 8/10 easy :)			"
