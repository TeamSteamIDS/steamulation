												This is the one that started it all.Depending on your opinion, this can either be a good or a bad thing.Before things got stupid...before we got Elysium exo-suits....before we had smart dogs...before we had Zombies....before this franchinse became synomous with ""Adding another number/title to it""...we had this.Still mindless run and gun and still incredibly overdramatic.  The spirit of Michael Bay is alive and well within this franchise even at this early stage.  However, the first foray out of World War II for the series was a refreshing breath of air at the time and the original still holds up very well.All Ghillied Up is still one of the greatest levels in ALL of Call of Duty.

												My Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review.Ok, so I have played A LOT of this game so i feel that i'm justified in saying that this game is FANTASTIC. In this review i will go through the pros and cons of purchasing this game. I am trying to come from a perspective of someone who has played this game since 2008, I have purchased this game 4 times, for Xbox 360, PS3, Retail Box and Steam. Over the 4 versions of the game I would say that I have played a good 1000 hours. Yet I keep coming back for some reason. Cod4 is one of the games that I play each and every day. I mostly play Promod, but I dip into Non-modded every now and then.Pros:Mod Support, many, many mods for this game. There is a whole separate game of just mods. To name a few there is Prop Hunt, Promod, One in the chamber and a multitude of others. Smooth uninterrupted game play, I wish more games had this these days. From the ground up this game was made to be as smooth as possible.Developer Console, this is a biggy in my books. Not enough games these days have this. This is the command line that you can use to edit any settings that you would like, you can load maps, change Sensitivity aswell as other settings such as FOV and maxfps. With commands like cg_fov 80 and com_maxfps 250.Cons:There are very few cons for this game. Some of the biggest and most prevalent are the aim botters and silent aim users. If anything this is what will send you over the edge. Another thing is that most of the servers are unpopulated. Don’t get me wrong, there is still a huge player base in CoD4. Its just that I wish there were more.Thank you for reading this review and I hope that it will influence your purchase in a good way. Cheers, Virconium			"

												One of the best games of the franchise, the highly acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a must have for a fan of the Call of Duty games. The games single player experience is phenomonal. From the beginning raid on the Russian tanker, to the cataclysmic end to the U.S campaign, to the brilliant All Ghillied Up mission, the game will keep you hooked, followed by a story that is believable, but not over the top compared to the future releases in the franchise.The Multiplayer is where Call of Duty shines however, and Cod 4 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience but not without flaws due to a variety of reasons at this point in time. When Cod 4 was released, the game included many new features not seen in previous Call of Duty games, such as the now standard Create a Class, Killstreaks etc, all of which feel balanced and nothing too overpowered (except maybe the P90). Where the PC version differs to the console versions is the player count. Cod 4 supports up to 48 players per server and sometimes it's absolute madness, just like the old Call of Duty days. Make no mistake, it's still a really enjoyable experience but console players may find it somewhat jarring coming from console to PC but you can always join a server with less players. There is no Prestige, with ranks taking longer to achieve in its place, and dedicated servers are there which mean less lag compared to the console version.BUT unfortunately, as 2013, Cod 4's server browser and online experience is somewhat annoying. A LOT of servers which turn up in the browser have this annoying redirect mod, which you have to install. This means what may show up as Backlot, standard, TDM, 40 players may redirect you to a Hardcore, S&D, 3 player game. It's frustrating at times to find a decent game. All in all, the game is highly recommended and along with the original Cod, UO and Cod 2. Probably the last GREAT Cod, with future games removing much of the standard PC features and instead being a console port. Buy it.			"

												This game is one of the best examples of why newer isn't always BETTER. COD 4 (Steam) is now one of the best games I own as there are loads of community made servers so you do not have to depend on Activision keeping them up. The gameplay is great and there are now servers with some of our favourite gamemodes like DeathRun, Prop Hunt etc, alongside the classic Call Of Duty maps. Although this game isn't the same price as it's console versions, it's a different, better game entirely. I totally recommend COD 4 for Steam, and would rate it a 9/10.			"

												A Solid Call of Duty title, the first game to become the more fast paced, twitch shooter, 360 no scope, games we know and love today.In all Seriousness, the pc version of this game is great not only because of modding but because of custom servers, free mod tools and a whole bunch more.The campaign is pretty good, the multiplayer though is where its at, And i would recommend playing the star wars mod for this game cause its star wars fever currently. The current playerbase isnt that high, but still higher than ghosts or aw which is fairly sad. At least theres no micro transactions in this game or any 15$ map packs. Everything is included for the 20€. But, at its current sale price of 9.99€, its defnitely worth picking up even just for the crazy fun star wars mod.			"

												Simply the best call of duty. And one of my favorite video games of all time. I think many will agree with me on that. i have less than 100 hours simply since i have nobody to play online with,and that i played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it on ps3 and nintendo wii. and then spent even more hours making montages i would fail at.One of the best single players mode out there,with a neat arcade mode and cheats to use. so it has a lot more replayablity compared most other cods(espeically more recent ones).But the mutiplayer is what really makes this game and thankfully there is plently of servers still online on PC(including fun mod ones). so the game may be dead on consoles,but on PC its worth playing. Also joining a match is pretty quick, almost instant so if you want instant action,well there you go.The gameplay style is more simple,but with enough perks and attachments to keep it from being boring,and i think it all comes down to weapon balance and pretty much every weapon in this game is useful. you can do well with almost any weapon.So yeah the only negative is the price,its pretty fixed at 20 bucks and sales are extrememly rare,and thats coming from someone who spent hundreds of hours on. just be aware the community is much smaller and finding a decent server will take some trial and error.9/10 its like skyrim but with modern warfare			"

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the series at its Finest Hour.Back in 2007, it was a big year for video games, on PC we got Orange Box, Crysis, Bioshock,etc, console players had Halo 3, AC and Mass Effect, even among those big titles, Call of Duty 4 stood out. Its predecessors, namely Call of Duty and CoD2, were already highly successful, but CoD4 was simply beyond most gamers' expectation. I still remember playing this on my roommate's PC and got totally blown away by the ""One shot, one kill"" mission.Singleplayer Story: 9/10The story is straight forward, it is not a role-playing game where you made choices, or a Hollywood movie with lots of twists, you simply move with your squad, and shoot bad guys. However, the developer still manages to put the action pieces together with a nice story, it is not perfect, but can still give you the good old ""Saving Private Ryan"" feeling (like it was in MOHAA). In comparsion, MW2's story tries to give you ""WOW"" moments, like a Michael Bay movie with lots of cool actions, but fails to deliver the glorious feel.Presentation: 9.5/10The presentation is top notch in 2007, some moments are still amazing to this day, like the mission ""All Ghillied Up"" is an instant classic, where you crawled through emeny fields in a ghillied suit, with heavy tanks and patrols moving by, it is one of the most thrilling experiences in FPS history. The graphics are surely out-dated, but they aged elegantly. The gun models, animations and battlefield atomsphere are impeccable even in today's standards, which create great immersion. The pacing of shooting scene/intermission is perfect. There are also lots of explosions, but none feels out of place. Music: 9/10The in-game music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams suits the pace and atomsphere perfectly, whether it is the middle-eastern showdown, or the desolate pripyat city, or the ICBM lauch field, the music always bring the scene to life. It may not surpass the later MW2's music by Hans Zimmer Team, but still excellent game soundtrack.Multiplayer: 9.5/10The MP mechanics was a revolution back in 2007, very fun and addictive even to this day. Most MP maps (aside from a few tiny maps) are well crafted to hold as much as 40-50 players, while still very fun to play with low player counts(8-16), also keep in mind that In later CoD (MW2 above) the player count is capped at 18, which, in my opinion, completely lost the epic battlefield feeling. This game also came before the crappy IWNet ever existed thus supports dedicated server, you can easily find a populated server with playable ping, without the worries about host-migration or host abuse, etc.The weapons are balanced and diversified, not only feel great but actually have recoil(unlike those ""laser guns"" in later CoDs). The good old 3-5-7 killstreaks are simple and effective, as well as satisfying, you won't get ridiculous powerful killstreak (like nuke or AC-130 in later CoDs) but the result is still very rewarding.End of the lineCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the prime CoD experience on PC. With so many blockbuster shooters flooding the market today, you may want to pay this old game a revisit, and see what we gamers have missed all those past years.Edit: My steam profile suggests less than 1 hour CoD4 gameplay, which is not true. My in-game stats shows I played online for more than 500 hrs, coupled with another 300-400 hrs spent playing on mods, my total play time is nearly 1000 hrs. The reason is that I used Steam key on a retail copy to avoid Steam overlay/Punkbuster incompabilites. If you don't mind losing steam overlay, I suggest you do the same, the online gameplay will be much smoother.			"

												After 7 years, this game is still awesome. The story is just absolutely amazing.Multiplayer was the best part of the game, back in the Xbox 360 days basic Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy and 1v1 level boosting lobbies.For me this was better than MW2, after MW2 the COD franchise was starting to die. Would look forward to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered.Multiplayer was more fun back in Call of Duty 4's days, you could have actual strategies in it.And of course how can you forget Campaign mission in Chernobyl, game wouldn't be like this if it wasn't included.(My hours are low, because I completed only the story on PC, basically reviewing Xbox 360's version Multiplayer.)9.0/10			"

												The last good Call of Duty.I can remember back in 2007 when I bought this game for the XBOX 360. It is by far the best Modern Warfare game of the series.Singleplayer starts the whole MW storyline, you play as ""Soap"", a soldier that just joined the SAS, and Jackson, an U.S. Marine.You never see their faces neither they talk during the campaign, which makes it much more easy to take the role of these characters. Gampeplay in SP is rather linear, as such I'm not a very big fan of it. However, from a storyline standpoint I really like it, and in my opinion it should have ended with CoD4.Multiplayer is the core of this game. It is by far the best multiplayer experience the whole series has to offer. Gameplay is much more balanced than in the other MW games, Mod support included, great weapon choices.Call of Duty died for me after this game.			"

My review on the game Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare®I’m gonna do a pros & cons on list on singleplayer, multiplayer and overall.SingleplayerPros: +Very good story (It’s the best story imo).+Very good written characters & and you actually care about them.+The mission are made really good.+The AIs is very good programed.+High replay value.+The mission is well balance on every difficulty.+The singleplayer also offer “Arcade Mode” with additional missions that is really fun to play.Cons:- Sometimes the AI can be a bit annoying.- Yea I think this is the only cons about the singleplayer.---MultiplayerPros: +Very good designed maps.+Very simple class system.+The community is still alive.+Only 3 killstreaks that is really nice imo (UAV, Airstrike and chopper).+Fun challenges.+You can add mods to the multiplayer like “promod”.Cons:-There is some unbalance perks.-Grenade spam can be a huge problem on high player servers.-Spawnkilling can be a huge problem sometimes when your opponents knows what they are doing.-On some servers it require to have the anti-cheat software “Punkbuster” installed, And sometimes for some users the software gets disabled every time they boot up the game (Not a huge problem).---Overall:Pros:+Good game for a very good price.+You can play this game on almost every mid-gen system.+You get that you pay for (That will say you get a very good single & multiplayer experience).Cons:-You have to install punkbuster.Should you buy this game? Yes!!!			"

												+Gunplay feels fresh and up to date. +Still thousands of active players and servers+No nuke, choppergunner, gamekilling streaks. Simple UAV, Air(fail)strike and Attack copter+10-40+ player servers+Mods+Atmospheric and interesting campaign.-No co-op. So, 7 years after release, i decided to buy the game again. This time on Steam...obviously.And guess what ? It still stands its ground. People saying that it's the best CoD game in the franchise are not full of shait or blinded by nostalgia.I first started up the singleplayer campaign. Finished the boat mission and when the text, ""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"", appeared after the end of the first mission, i got chills. Really. It felt just like the first time i ever played the game.And it isn't the nostalgia talking. It was like a new experience...only re-lived.The music, the atmosphere...everything in here is so well done. Atmosphere...a little sense of realism and characteristics...these are something that are missing in the latest CoD games.Since Black Ops 1 it has been just about explosions and over-the-top action. I love explosions...and i love the silly, uber-soldier action...but CoD went too far with it. You don't feel close to the characters anymore. You don't get sucked into the stories or into the world...no. It's just nonesense action. The characters in Blops games or Ghosts, they don't feel like soldiers anymore. Hell, they are not soldiers. They are superheroes. When i play a CoD game i want a game with soldiers, not a Marvel movie directed by Michael Bay...it's like Marvel Transformers...ugghhh...The campaigns in CoD4 and MW2 are the only good campaigns in the new era of CoD. Old era (CoD 1-3) is ofc good aswell, but the gameplay in the latest CoDs is just way better.EDIT: OK, WaW campaign is quite decent aswell and i did enjoy Blops2 campaign 'cus it tried to be fresh and innovative but the story and characters were still just ""MEH!"".Now the multiplayer. This is where CoD4 shines. This is where the roosters at! It still holds up.I expected a dated character movement and gunplay but i was dead wrong. The gunplay is amazing! The gunplay is, in fact, better than in Blops or MW3.Sure, the character movement is a bit smoother in, say...Blops2. But everything else is better in here.Yes, the multiplayer is still alive! Hundreds, if not thousands, of servers full of people! There are 8vs8 servers, 12vs12, 16vs16, 20vs20 even!Latest CoDs only have 8vs8 and that's about it...maybe 12vs12 max but not more. CoD4 is the only CoD where you see 40 people in one server.It also has one of the best multiplayer maps. MW2 had some really cool maps too and Blops2 had couple of decent maps (Nuketown and Hijacked) but CoD4 takes the cake! Pretty much every map is a masterpiece in here!CoD4: Modern Warfare is a must have for every FPS fan!			"

												10/10 Both Single Player and Multiplayer are functional on Windows 10 OUT OF THE BOX.I just want to confirm this for people wondering if this game is still alive. It totally is! Even after a decade, there are a TONNE of servers active with many players still playing on them. You dont need to download any mods or patches to make it work, nor do you need to even touch punkbuster. Not every single server will work because some require maps/files you may not have, but upon failing to connect, they usually give you a link to the site you can get them from. As for vanilla maps / gamemodes, this totally works!! No CD key ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just select a server and connect! Leveling up your rank also functions just fine. In a single 30min TDM i ranked up a couple times so im not entirely sure if it was always that fast or if the server had boosted rates but it hardly matters as your rank is linked to a file on your PC. If you so choose, you can download a MP profile that has everything unlocked, or just enjoy ranking normally. If you know how, you can also port forward and host a live or dedicated server for you and friends right from the game's multiplayer menu. You can even make it public (show up on server browser) for others to join.As for the single player aspect. It's one of the best of the series (story and gameplay wise). I've played Counterstrike for multiple years and often refused to get sunked into a CoD game despite trying many of them due to their weak 'feel good' style of gameplay katered towards a smaller skill gap however CoD4 has been the only exception for me, putting hundreds of hours on Xbox 360 souly for this game many years back. I've run through the story at least 5 times and enjoyed it every time since. It's dramatic, slightly cheesy at times but overall told very well and have solid characters you surely will get attached to. The system req's are quite low as well so nearly any PC from 06 with a 128mb GPU and Pentium 4 will be able to run this game at a solid 60. I'd strongly reccomend this game considering the community is still very much active. Even when the master server goes down, many 3rd party websites offer lists of live IP's you can directly connect to without the use of the server browser. $10 is totally worth it, I couldn't be happier.

												Modern Warfare was a turning point for gaming. It was innovative, different and overall a really great game. This is a game worth playing, and a turning point for Call of Duty and the wholle videogame market. A turn for the worse that is, with the anual , recycled releases and saturated genre... But Modern Warfare is worth playing. If you ever wanted to try a CoD game, make sure it's this one.			"

												Call of Duty franchise has been getting alot of hatred recently, I thought that COD was a really bad game as a main CS:GO player. I was one of the people who just hated people playing COD and calling them a nub. The game was on sale so I bought it as I was curious why people say that COD:MW is good. My god, I started campaign, I was in love already. I loved the story, the characters were very interesting as well. Everything is just amazing. Looking forward to try the multiplayer as well.Don't leave me Price! :(Worth every single penny!			"

Most can be easily patched.9/10 A great game.			"

												First I have to say I have played COD4 alot on Xbox360, getting all the achievements and playing the Campaign over and over again.CoD on PC:-CoD2 :         Super active (Ty @Lyme)-CoD4 MW:   VERY active -CoD WaW:   Quite active-CoD MW2:    Active-CoD BO :      Active-CoD MW3:   Active -CoD BOII :    Active-CoD Ghosts: DEAD -CoD AW:       DEAD-CoD BOIII :   Active-CoD IW : In the trashcan because everyone plays CoD4 Remastered ^^#RipCoD? maybe not, but some quality has been dropping for some time even though I enjoy some of the new titles.Game Review:CoD4 is a great game, however it is not bug free or without its problems. The core gameplay, like beating the campaign & epiologue on veteran, or replaying the gun course to  beat the dev time for the bazillionth time is alot of fun. The MP experience is after all this time pretty decent too. Thanks to good maps, dedicated servers and fast paced action without too much customization.Now 9 Years later I still enjoy this game that blew my mind back in the day, before season passes and mini DLC's brought the full prices to over 120€....  8/10			"

												If you are reading this, buy it now. Activision must be realizing how much it is screwing up the Remastered version. First by chaining it to Infinite Warfare, then adding supply drops, now it's charging money for the DLC. Who charges money for a REMASTERED game? Every game that is remastered and re-released has the DLC bundled in for free.Plus Remastered is unmoddable. No server browser either.Coming back to the original CoD 4, it felt like a breath of fresh air. You can do whatever you want to do with it. And guess what, not only do you get to play the Variety pack for free, but also maps from MW2 and MW3 on certain servers. Let that sink in.All computers today (even those with Intel Graphics) can play this, so none of you have an excuse.			"

 Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare® it's still one game good of series Call of Duty Modern Warfare! It's a Good gen first-person shooter developed by the company Infinity Ward and published by Activision Company. I really like this game because the story beginssomewhere in the near future where there is a civil war involving countries US, UK, and Russia against Russian ultranationalists and rebels in a small country in Middle East.  The story was very successful and also the characters and action!  Levels are:  Prologue  F.N.G.  Crew Expendable  The Coup   Act I  Blackout   Charlie Do not Surf  The Bog  Hunted   Death From Above  War Pig  Shock and Awe   Aftermath  Act II  Safehouse  All Ghillied Up  One Shot, One Kill  Heat  The Sins of the Father  Act III  Ultimatum  All In  No Fighting In The War Room  Game Over  Epilogue  Mile High Club - Bonus mission that takes place on a plane hijacked by terrorists.  Multiplayer  After completion singleplayer campaign will be released an arcade game that prolongs life by enabling replay missions based on points awarded on various criteria, from how many enemies are killed by the time the mission ends.  Are available at Multiplayer several ways like as: Free-for-all | Team deathmatch | Search & Destroy | Domination | Headquarters |  Also you can custom your Class. The multiplayer it's good, have nice maps and it's fun to play with your friends :D  My rating about Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare® |  • Story: 9/10  • Graphics: 8.50/10  • Sound: 8/10  I Recommend this Call of Duty because it's a good game of series Modern Warfare :) The Story it's nice and full of action. The Multiplayer it's also good and is fun to play with friends. Graphics is pretty good and also the sound ;)  By:#CRISTIAN1ELITE  "

												The game that started and made the Modern Warfare franchise famous. I believe the record sales were not produced by this but by its sequel, still, it is the first MW game that took the CoD franchise from the WW II era to a modern setting.It is one of those FPS games that still had a very entertaining and relatively long campaign. MW's single player story takes us to places such as the Ukraine, Western-Europe and even the Middle-East. There are some surprises and the campaign ends in a climax.The richness of the game's multiplayer content and its longevity should not be mentioned. It is, after all, a Call of Duty game.As for purchasing it nowadays? I do not really know... it is very expensive considering it is a 7-year old game. Also, a warning for those of you who wishes to make a purchase: Punkbuster support seems to be discontinued and this is a must to play the game's multiplayer mode otherwise players get kicked out of servers. I believe there are some workarounds you can find on the internet.			"

												Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare is one of the most influential games of the modern era. It almost single handedly paved the way towards modern military shooters becoming a trend. Gone were the days of countless World War 2, Vietnam and space shooters. Now was the relatively untapped potential of modern day shooters.Prior to Modern Warfare, modern military shooters were usually akin to sims. Games like Rainbow Six or Full Spectrum Warrior are good examples. Very tactically complex games with little run and gun action. Modern Warfare replaces run and gun with stop and pop. You use cover to your advantage and duck out with iron sights. Call of Duty 4 is the game I see as popularizing iron sights and probably utilized them the best compared to other games at the time. Moving and firing from the hip is wildly inaccurate but holding your sights down would increase your accuracy dramatically but slow your movement and narrow your field of view. It's an extremely immersive mechanic and one that was designed to compensate for the limited accuracy of analog sticks.That's not all that Modern Warfare gave us either. Modern Warfare also paved the way for progression based multiplayer. Contrary to arena shooters, Modern Warfare instead focuses on letting you customize your arsenal with sights, scopes, underbarrel grenade launchers and even color schemes. And you unlock all of this gradually the more you play. It feels akin to an RPG where the more you play, the cooler your guns become and the more efficient you are at taking other players down. This is still the dominant system in first person shooters and even more popular franchises like Halo and Doom started to use it. And lastly the singleplayer in Modern Warfare is fairly good. It is a mostly scripted and linear shooter with plenty of good set pieces and moments. Along with prior staples of the series like having multiple protagonists and viewpoints across the story. One other thing to note is how much of a PC game Modern Warfare 1 was compared to it's sequels. It has a console, a full SDK and map editor, dedicated servers and so much more. It allowed for things like bots to be added. And even close to 10 years after release you can still find enough people who want to play this game to fill a server. As derivative as later titles in this series got, you have to admire a charismatic and influential game like Modern Warfare. Very few first person shooters have such a lasting legacy that stands the test of time.			"

												The Call of Duty series has long been set in the theatre of World War II. The fourth instalment seeks to change this and alter the formula by taking place in modern times, where the good and bad guys are harder to define, the weapons are more powerful, and the plot is more complicated than just pushing back the Third Reich. The result is a game that is fun to play, whether alone or with others, and that sets a new benchmark for FPS games.The game is neatly divided into two parts: single player, and multiplayer, with more than just human opponents differentiating the two modes. The single player charts the progress of the United States Marine Corps and the Special Air Services, the British equivalent, via a combatant in each. The story is short, and at a comfortable difficulty level, should take no more than half a dozen hours or so. But that's not to say it's lacking in content - on the contrary, the single player experience is intense and filled with memorable sequences and scenes. It's definitely worth playing through at least once.The AI in the single player game is done quite well, for both the enemies and your teammates. Your teammates will stay behind cover, poking their head out to fire at the enemies, toss grenades, follow behind you when you proceed, and in general do a good job of being teammates. A little bit more fire from them would've been appreciated, though. The enemy does the same thing, hiding from your shots and tossing grenades, but they do it a little too well.The enemy's AI, especially on the higher difficulties, borders on the ludicrous side of unfair, as they'll be able to do amazing tasks that even the best sniper couldn't. Throwing grenades a hundred feet with perfect accuracy, taking you out with three shots from an AK-47 while completely out of your view (even with a sniper rifle's scope), and even firing on you the instant you turn corners, as if they already knew you were coming. At some points, it's possible to be aiming at a doorway with a raised rifle for the enemy to appear, only to have them come through, raise their weapon, fire a couple shots, and kill you immediately, all before you could even fire once. There's a difference between a fair difficulty and a frustrating one, and COD4 definitely tends to the latter.Buying this game for the single player experience alone, however, would mean you were missing out on the bulk of the content. The multiplayer of Call of Duty 4 holds an inordinate amount of fun in it, introducing new elements and ideas that make it fresh, fun, and worth replaying again and again.The multiplayer has a variety of modes for you to play through. There's the standard deathmatch and team deathmatch, where in the PC version, entering a game with nearly fifty players can mean staying alive for half a dozen seconds before someone finds you and shoots you. Other modes include Headquarters, where two opposing teams must capture a single point on the map (the HQ) and hold it for as long as they can to rack up points. In Sabotage, your team must find a bomb and use it to blow apart a target. On their own, the multiplayer modes are pretty fun, but they're nothing really new.The Class system of COD4 is the first thing that adds some variety into the mix. Initially, you get to select one of a few pre-made classes, each with a specific primary weapon, secondary weapon, attachments and delightful little enhancements called 'perks'. These perks further flesh out your character by allowing him to do such things as hold extra grenades, take more damage, and sprint for longer distances. At first, there's not a whole lot unlocked: the weapons are mediocre, the perks average at best, and there isn't too much variety. But that's not all…Where the game really gets interesting is the ability to earn experience points as you complete objectives and defeat other players. Earn enough experience and you'll move up in rank, which means unlocking features, weapons, attachments, classes, perks, and challenges. The real point of interest is unlocking the Create-a-Class feature, which allows you to invent your own class with its own weapons, perks, and so forth. As more perks and better weapons get unlocked, you'll find yourself not so helpless anymore, as your jerky, one-shot sniper rifle is replaced by a semi-automatic, your dusty handgun is replaced by a desert eagle, and your perks include such interesting abilities as the chance to take out your handgun as you lay dying and fire a few final shots at your killer, or dropping a live grenade when you die.Challenges add yet another reason to play multiplayer. As your increase your rank, you'll unlock challenges for each weapon that, upon completion, grant you attachments and extras for that particular weapon. Additionally, there are challenges that don't involve specific tools, such as leaping and falling to your death, killing a certain number of enemies while crouching/prone, or shooting down a helicopter.Overall, the multiplayer experience of Call of Duty 4 is astounding, and probably worth the price of the game by itself, as long as you don't mind playing with others. A big issue with it, however, seems to be that once you reach level 55 on the PC version, you can't proceed any further and that somewhat tempers the experience as a whole. Other than this, however, the multiplayer portion as a whole is very well done.Call of Duty 4 is an excellent game, there's really no doubt about it. Top-notch presentation combined with tight gameplay and impressive graphics make it fun to play on the single-player, but it's in the multiplayer aspect of the game that the experience is the best. As far as first-person shooters go, this is one of the best on the market, and is something anyone that's sure to interest anyone who has dabbled in the genre.			"

												Trust me... Get this instead of MWR. This version has a server browser, mods, active community, and a way cheaper price. If you want to play multiplayer, use a third party server browser program liek Game Ranger. A true classic and worth every penny.			"

												Definately one of the or the best Call of Duty games in the franchise. Solid gameplay and originality. I started on this, past World at War they have started to go downhill. If you're considering getting any Call of Duty game, play this, World at War and Modern Warfare 2. Multiplayer is still kicking but you're out of luck if you want any dedicated servers or servers without any scripts or modifications installed. However, I found found a handful of servers which aren't overboard with scripting which I play on. Another thing that should be pointed out about multiplayer is that most servers have XP raises so don't expect slow or legitimate leveling times. If you want this, just wait until the remaster arrives so there will be dedicated servers.Campaign is fantastic aswell. Story is written well and is consistant throughout. Definately worth a buy for FPS lovers.			"

												This is the first modern warfare game of thought many mistakens it as the 4th modern warfare game , wow thinking that it has been release for over 8 years already,but time doesnt change the good amount of content call of duty 4 has to offer / story wise and extended multiplayer content.Remember back then we get free map contents without having to pay for it , yeah its all here. The overall gameplay is proven superior to other next gen cod game as has a way interesting story line     and multiplayer experience any cod has to offer . The graphics might be outdated a bit but its still the best . Only downfall now that punkbuster is currently disabled to you might run into a lot of hacked servers and cheaters but hey there is a bot mod here.http://www.moddb.com/mods/pezbot/downloads/pezbot-011p-for-call-of-duty-4 Wanting to Play Call of Duty ?

												The game that started it all.No, this game was and IS great. No dubstep and autism here. This was when companies were trying to make the most out of the new technology they were given. Call of Duty still had that goosebump inducing storyline, it was practically the only campaign worth replaying. This game in particular gives you a single player experience that you will remember forever. If you haven't played it, stop reading and go play it NOW, you're no good to humanity alive.The excitment didn't just stop at the single player of course. You can NEVER leave out the multiplayer that set the standard for first person shooters for years to come. Though the multiplayer has been long outvalued by the current Call of Duty games, this is where it started. For those of you just joining the franchise, it's comments like ""this game sucks"", ""the graphics are terrible"", ""mechanics are clunky"" that make you look like a fool. For those of us that have been playing Call of Duty from the very start, this game was the best on the market for us. It's insulting when people like you come around and try to criticize it. You can't and won't understand how great of a game this was for us.If you play the single player, this game holds it's value at 20 dollars. Don't expect much from multiplayer these days though. "

												Hello guy's.This is my first review of all time so dont except to much from this. ( I'll try to give my best )A little thing to say : I'll just review the Multiplayer part.First of all -> How did i get my first contact with this game?I started playing CoD 4 back in 2010 ~ i was in school and my friends told me its a great game to play.So i started and getting addicted from this game. It's not all about the graphic. I like the nostalgic gameplay without the new things ( They're great but nothing for me ), with the similar killstreak's and mods.PRO'S ~-> A lot of tactic gameplay-> Many mod's ( CoD Jumper, zombie, hide 'n seek ecc. )-> A lot of funny bugs / exploits ( Every elevator )-> Bouncing ( ! )-> Similar killstreaks-> No OP Weapon's-> Great maps with a lot of nice callouts-> Not that many cheater-> Great wallbang CON'S ~-> A ""lot"" of redirect / bot server-> It's not that much played anymore-> 'Roccat' ( :( )For the end ~I just can say it is an awesome game and everyone who loves CoD should have playd this game.

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the first game of the series to break away from the tried and true World War 2 setting and into the new era of war, involving constant risks of nuclear annihilation and smaller scale, urban combat. Russia has fallen into civil war as Ultra-nationalists attempt to resurrect the Soviet Union, meanwhile an unnamed Middle Eastern country has been overthrown by a warlord with ties to said Ultra-Nationalists. We play as two main characters, one a US Marine called Paul Jackson and a British SAS Sergeant named John “Soap” MacTavish. Starting off we play as Soap who has just been accepted into a SAS squad led by series’ famous and mustached hero, John Price.You are tasked with completing some quick practice training before being briefed on your mission to familiarize you with the game. If you have played any Call of Duty game or any FPS in general over the past decade you will have no issues getting the hang of it. Introduced in this tutorial is the new feature of flash grenades designed to disorient enemies caught in its blast. Mastering these will greatly improve your chances of survival since you will now be fighting in small areas instead of the vast battlefields of WW2 and a well-placed throw can decide the outcome. By far my favorite edition is that bullets can now pass through thin objects which makes it a ton of fun as bullets penetrate all your surroundings, causing you to desperately seek cover behind something sensible.It works the other way around as well so no longer will enemies by able to use a tiny fence as indestructible cover. With that new found knowledge found in your training you are then briefed on your mission to retrieve an object from a well-guarded enemy cargo ship. It is here that you realize that the CoD series has taken a new feel to it. While previous games were more down to earth and grim with the sight of allies being killed being common place, Modern Warfare goes the Michael Bay route with tons of explosions, escaping a flooding cargo ship and jumping into the helicopter at the very last second. It's not a criticism nor a necessarily bad thing but it's a change of tone I felt was worth mentioning.The journey of playing both US and British forces take you all over Russia and the Middle East, both stories are interconnected and give you a greater view of the story instead of being there for convenient teleportation to another cool location. You play as a few other unnamed soldiers, pilots and even John Price for a bit though those are over very quickly and are just keep the game from getting stale by changing up the gameplay such as you having to provided air support and carefully shooting your missiles. Most of these extra characters feel gimmicky and are not really all that fun except for when you play as Price in Chernobyl, on an important stealth mission. That was easily the high point of the game and a moment I will remember long after I stop playing. And that is saying something as there are many high points when playing as the main protagonists.Aside from bullet penetration, the gameplay is the same as previous entries only now you have newer weaponry, gadgets and gun attachments such as a grenade launcher added under your assault rifle. Smoke grenades are back and as useful as ever to pass through heavy fire or be concealed from tanks and such. Another new addition that is extremely gimmicky and neigh on useless are the night vision goggles. You could see just fine without them and don't really serve any purpose other than a bullet point on the new features list. You're never in a position where you have to scavenge for items or ammo, they are refilled after every mission or taken away, you will always have what you need which makes sense considering these elite soldiers won't go in unprepared but feels too “hand holdy” gameplay wise.Especially when it comes to ammo. You are given an obscene amount and I have never once had to switch weapons or take an enemies weapon. That was one change to the series I did not like as you will not use any of the other weapons in the game unless you go out of your way to do so while playing through the campaign. Melee combat has been changed a bit as well, while the previous games had you use your weapons to smack an enemy, Modern Warfare has you automatically pull out a knife and lunge at him which I personally find much more satisfying. The smaller environments both harm and help Modern Warfare, on one hand it is far more obvious how linear the game is but on the other it makes it more in your face and fast paced than ever before.The campaign is short but sweet, it took me about 5 hours to fully complete though it went at break neck speedy action every step of the way and had a shockingly decent story. There is not much motivation to replay it though. 30 enemy laptops are scattered throughout the campaign and unlock cheat codes after finding enough of them yet the cheat codes are usually very underwhelming such as making your screen black and white or other pointless screen effects. The only cheat code that I've unlocked that was decent was the “Cluster grenade” which causes huge explosions once your grenades detonates. To try to motivate you to reply they also added an Arcade Mode once you finish the game that lets you replay any mission and earn points for everything you do. It offers nothing but racking up high scores and is nowhere near enough to get me to replay the campaign after just having finished it.Where the game really shined back in the day was in its multiplayer. It's RPG like progression system to unlock titles, weapons and perks was revolutionary and changed the FPS genre as a whole. For better or for worse is in the eye of the beholder. It introduced the problem that those who played longer have a significant advantage over newer players but on the other hand it is satisfying to be constantly rewarded with stuff for playing and helped differentiate each player. One may have a perk that allows them to run further without stopping, another may simply have more health and yet another player may be able to hip fire far more accurately and surprise you. It makes every firefight interesting since you never know just what tricks your foe has up his/her sleeve. Once you hit level 5 you can build up to five custom classes that will be useful for different situations and tons of fun to experiment with.Be warned though, the multiplayer will crash on start unless right click on your sound icon, go into your recording tab and then enable “Stereo Mix”. No clue as to why but that fixes the issue. Another issue is that if you are playing via Steam make sure to unbind the in-game screenshot key that defaults to F12 as that will also cause your game to crash if you take a screen-shot. Weird steps to make the multiplayer work but it is definitely still worth playing even after all these years and still has a decently sized community so finding a game won't be a problem (as of this review). In a rather cool move by Activision the 1 DLC pack released for Modern Warfare is already included. All in all, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was a breath of fresh air and finally broke the series free from it's done to death WW2 roots.			"

												My playtime on steam does not do justice for this game. I bought it back when it came out on PC on Disc, pre-steam availbilty, and racked up hundreds of hours on the PC version. (Thousands on PS3). This game is definitely the starting point of Call of Duty, and the beginning of what was an amazing game franchise. The game is still pretty active, and there are a lot of modded servers still going such as Zombies, Star Wars etc. Definitely work picking it up if it's on deal, just bare in mind that they are releasing the Remaster of it at the end of 2016 with Infinite Warfare, and there may be a stand-alone remaster - so I'd suggest only purcasing this if it's quite cheap, as Activision have a tendency to be♥♥♥♥♥♥holes.Unlike all the newer COD games (Black Ops 1 onwards) this game comes with the DLC as well (as does World at War) so you'll never have to worry about not finding games, it also has the server browser which allows custom servers.Definitely a recommend.

It makes you seem that you are just put into war to risk your life and to hunt down the wanted. The story is amazing, you are put into the hands of the character, Soap. In Multiplayer, you'll find yourself in a battle between others and you would be able to take them down. Really recommended.			"

												WARNING: This review contains spoiler. You have been warned .OK I dont know where to start. Im a veteran in CS for like 10+ years(?) and I was looking for a great gun blazing fps game with great story mode, and then I saw COD series were on sale, so I bought this for only 5 bucks I think. I chose this besides the newer series because they said this is the hardest of all of COD series.First intro scenes were cool and amusing. Then the main menu, after spending a good amount of time setting the video, sound, and control I was ready. Tutorial bla bla, classic, until that last tutorial. I finished and they recommended me to play in Regular difficulty, I was like ""WTF, I dont spend 10 years playing CS to play COD on Regular difficulty, Lets go veteran how hard would that be"" I totally regret this.It was ♥♥♥♥ing crazy, I was running when we got ambushed. 2 F**king shots then I laid down on the ground ""WTF SRSLY?!"". I repeat every mission for several times, got mad several times, rage quit several times. I must say, the Veteran is fun yet 'killing' you (pun intended) I have to come up with bunch of different strategies just to complete 1 objective. Lets skip to the end, everyone is dying, I saw one of my comrade got shot right in the ♥♥♥♥ing head when he was trying to get me to a cover, Gaz was shot dead in front of my eyes (I miss ur sexy voice Gaz), Capt Price dying, he passed the gun on his hand, I no scope the last 3 guys, credit.... it was fun until that last picture of Gaz, Capt Price, Griggs, and 1 other guy that I dont know who he is (or is he Soap?), I almost shed a tear ""it was only a short time, but why that left me with a huge sadness, it feels like I already knew them for years."" 1 ticket to feel train pls.In conclusion it is a BIG YES from me to buy this game, the story is great, Gaz with his sexy voice, hard difficulty is actually hard. 10/10 would 360 no scope a dog with an rpg again.

												Controls are easy to master. Graphics while showing their age come 2017 are serviceable. There's lots of replay value to be had from the multiplayer side of the game. Going up the ranks and earning new weapons, perks and gun camo is a lot of fun. Unlike the newer titles this game supports modding, as well as the inclusion of a server browser, which is sadly a big plus for a Call of Duty title these days.Would recommend this to any shooter fan.

												While this game is unbelievably nearing its 10 year anniversary, I still feel the need to express my thoughts and compliments towards this game. This is one of the few games I bother to write a review for, due to my extreme appreciation for it.I will be focusing my review on the story only, as there isnt much I can say about the multiplayer other than its better than the new garbage Activision puts out.I began playing this game when I was like 9, and it was simply just the most fun and cool game I had ever played as a kid. While I was probably a bit young to be playing it, it certainly gave me a lovely experience that I will never forget, what I wouldnt do to experience this game for the first time again... The story is simply beyond rich and well written, while it can be a little difficult to follow at times, it's still a near masterpiece of a campaign. That goes for all of the modern warfare series, but specifically applies to this game. It's a mixed bag of emotions with this game, it can be exciting, it can be suspenseful, and it can be saddening.The game itself isn't the prettiest for 2017, but in 2007 when this came out, it must have been like 4k is now, astonishing. Even though its almost ten years old, it still looks pretty decent.The game mechanics are standard at best, but like I've said, its from 2007 and you cant expect a Triple-A 2017 game engine.While this game has some flaws, the story makes up for it completely and has kept me coming back for countless playthroughs. I'll never forget the fantastic experience I've had playing this game.10/10 "

												Call of Duty 4 was the second shooter I ever got into and was the game that really got me into PC gaming. I stil play this game for good reason. Along with one of the most memorable singleplayers I've ever played, this game has the back to the basics shooter feeling, with non of this new ""space-age"" Call of Duty crap. It feels genuine, and the setting, story, and characters all create a realistic feeling of combat throughout our world. The modding tools in this game is what gives its multiplayer the rare life it still has today, almost 10 years later after launch. This can't be sad for many games. Communities of great, humble people thrive on these servers. The people that play this game have stuck around, creating a mature and cleansed community, unlike the ""hip"" games of today, which are filled with people who move from title to title, spreading toxic rhetoric. This game is definitely a rarity in PC gaming: a developed and unique community, and brilliant execution of the game's mechanics and plot.			"

An Amazing GameI've played a lot of Call of Duty 4. Not just on Steam but on console as well. This game has provided me with many hours of enjoyment with my friends. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this game is still thriving almost 10 years after it was released.  It was quite refreshing to be able to play a good Call of Duty game with no exo jumps, supply drops, or microtransactions. This is what Call of Duty should be. A Surprisingly Healthy CommunityThis game is actually quite active, with a lot of servers. Different gamemodes, maps, and mods that make each experience different. The community is also quite mature and I experienced no 12 years old screaming at me about my mom. There are many different servers to accomadate many different playstyles, ranging from 24/7 Killhouse to a fairly tactical hardcore gamemode. Every server that I joined had a good amount of players in it that actually played the game and didn't flame at each other in chat. Mods This game has a substantial amount of mods that are very easy to install and can completely change the game. Whether you want a simple promod or the Galactic Warfare mod which completely changes the game to a Star Wars theme, it's all there. There are even a few mod menus out there that can be used to troll friends and whatnot (they can't be used online). Even though I haven't played very long on PC, I've already installed a few mods like Pezbot (which adds A.I. Bots for offline multiplayer) and the Galactic Wafare mod (which has no online servers that I've found unfortunately), as well as some custom maps. Installation is very easy and can be done in seconds. If you ever get bored of the core game, then mods are always an option. PROs and CONs+Thriving Community+Good performance+Mods+Mature playerbase+Nice maps+Rewarding Progression+Fun Gunplay and Weapons+No microtransactions or supply drops+Decent graphics for a game that's almost 10 years old+Very Good Campaign -Lack of Dedicated Private Match (which was available on console)-Lack of Prestige Mode (which was available on console)-Ping around 130-150 on many servers (I'm located in U.S.)Conclusion/TL;DRAlthough I haven't had a lot of hands-on time with the PC version, it's still brought back a lot of fond memories of the past. The PC verison feels very smooth and polished, and the community is very mature. The gameplay is what Call of Duty should be and the progression system feels very rewarding. The mods also provide a lot of enjoyment as well. Overall, I can see myself spending a lot of time playing this game. Overall Score 9.5/10 "

												Hello, So you like Call of Duty games, well look no further, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the one you need.Here are some reasons:- you don`t need a strong PC to run it, but for more effects newer will always be better- more servers online, just pick the right ones- if you like zombie mod(s) there are plenty servers with no limitations (no DLCs)- small price compared to Back Ops seriesEven if your pocket is big, don`t think about buying something from Black Ops series unless you have at least 4 or more friends to play with.

												One of the best Call of Duty games ever released - this started a new era and the whole series are appraised by gamers and critics. The story is pretty interesting and takes place all over the world while playing as a British SAS Soap or US Marine Jackson. Personally I preferred the SAS missions because of the great characters, the professional team and more interesting missions. The US Marine missions are about war only where you are one of many and witness massive destruction around you. The most breathtaking missions include SPOILER the unforgetabble All ghillied up mission in Pripyat, UA where you play as a sniper with a task of assassination and the mission in the Middle East where you witness the Atomic bomb explosion from very close. END OF SPOILERAll in all, the modern graphics, action gameplay and breathtaking moments accompanied by dramatic music make this the best CoD game ever. The negative thing about it is the fact that it's multiplayer oriented and the singleplayer campaign, though totally awesome takes only 6 hours to finish, which is pretty embarassing.9/10			"

												The single player campaign is an intense, incredible experience, but it is short. To enhance the game's replay, Infinity Ward has included hidden Intel pieces in the game that, when found, unlock in-game single player cheats such as the ability to slow down the game temporarily, turn the game's colors black and white, or get infinite ammo. After finishing the game, the player also has access to an arcade mode, in which you try to get through the game or a single level with a limited amount of lives for the chance to get the high score. Call of Duty 4 comes with innovative and incredibly fun multiplayer.And now onto the multiplayer; the dedicated servers makes it lag free, which is one of the most vital things in multiplayer. The drip feed method of leveling up and unlocking guns as you progress is done at the right pace. The multiplayer consists of sixteen different maps with modes that include the traditional deathmatch and team deathmatch. Other game modes include Domination, in which players fight to secure objective points, Sabotage, in which players must plant bombs by an enemy objective, and Search and Destroy, in which one team defends an objective while the other team attacks. The multiplayer is set up for fast, frenzied gameplay, with wide open maps that have multiple methods of ingress for most areas. There aren't a lot of places in any of the maps that are conducive to camping, which forces most players to stay on the run to survive. Also, whenever you are killed, you are shown your death from the enemy's point of view. This is a cool feature, which lets you know who killed you and how, but it also reveals hiding spots and other player's strategies. The savvy player will watch the killcam replay and seek out their killer's hiding spot, which is a point of controversy, although the killcam can be turned off in private matches. Ultimately, the best strategy in multiplayer is to keep moving at all times and keep a pair of eyes in the back of your head. Customization of the guns make everyone's play style possible, and it also keeps you wanting to play to unlock more things for each gun. Everyone has a unique character, you can be a stealthy sniper, fast shot-gunner, etc. It keeps it fresh and unique. The weapons are fun to use realistic, and are balanced too. The sniper rifles are awesome, fun to use and addictive. Overall, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is an intense gaming experience from start to finish. The story is conveyed much better than the average first person shooters, the gameplay is varied enough to stay fresh, the graphics and sound both deliver, and the multiplayer is addictive. If Call of Duty 4 can attract enough fanboys away from Halo and Counter Strike to experience it, we may have a new contender for favourite first person shooter of all time. It is worth purchasing. Buy it!My Rating - ""Phenomenal"" Traditional Rating - 10/10.			"

Yes its older and dated, yes you will love it and wonder why every other COD game sux so much campaired to COD4.Buy it when its on sale. This usually happens when a NEW COD game is coming out. Dummy up. :)			"

												One of the best Call of Duty games of all time. It is definitely worth the $20 price tag and is actually playable compared to the console versions of the game (same for WaW) When I was originally going to get this game for PC, I was skeptical whether or not MP would be dead, plagued with hackers, or no vanilla esc servers. Boy was I wrong. There are plenty of servers that are populated (20+ ppl per server) that use their own Anti-Cheat, so hackers are rare. If there is a hacker, they usually get banned from the server within 10 minutes by an admin. If you are also weary about not finding any Vanilla COD 4 servers don't worry either. There are several servers that run the game in its original state without mods installed. Don't get me wrong, mods are fun and almost always make games a much better experience, but its fun to go back and play the barebones version of the game. But seriously, if you have never played COD 4 before, BUY IT AND PLAY IT!			"

												I never knew how much I disliked the ""new style"" of CoD until I went back to this game. This has to be the best call of duty I have ever played.

												Start to finish, online or off, Call of Duty 4 is solid gold. Some might decry the single-player’s short length or that it’s more of the same, but its amazing quality and the Arcade mode...more than make up for it. Infinity Ward has delivered on every front, and there is no question in my mind that this is the best action shooter that I have ever played.			"

 Well finally, here is my review for CoD 4: Modern Warfare.  The game which revolutionized the franchise, adding excellent and unforgettable multiplayer maps, killstreaks, guns, etc. But first, let's talk about the campaign, is not a secret that it is kinda short, but it is one of the best campaigns in the story of FPS. Excellent dialogues, great escenarios, great characters and memorable soundtrack, this and more makes this game a well done shooter. Now, the multiplayer, which one is incredible fun, brings new things to the CoD franchise which ones totally change the way we used to see those games. Now we are in the modern warfare, so new weapons and technology. As I said at the beginning of this review, it has enjoyable maps, we have a selection of small and some ""big"" maps, all well done, the killstreaks are just great for this game. I can say more and more good things about this game.I used to play this game a lot a few years ago in the 360. Nowadays, the multiplayer maybe is not that great as it used to be. But don't worry, you can always find a lot of servers with people, there are still a lot of mods, etc. But yeah, my final words: If you for some reason don't have this game yet and you want to buy it, go and buy it, totally worth it.

												I've been playing this game since release, and I'll never uninstall it. When it comes to this game's immersion, intenity, simplicity, fluidity, and overall function...no other shooter can possibly compare, but few can currently compete. Playing Battlefield 4, Insurgency, a few F2P titles and the Call of duty series for years, as much as I love them, nothing can replace this game. If you feel like being a part of a deep story with in-depth missions, singleplayer will give you everything you're looking for...and then some. Once you either crawl through ""vetean difficulty"" or stroll through standard, you get to replay any mission you want where you're graded in real-time through ""arcade mode"". If you'd rather compete with the best shooters gaming has to offer, throw your hat into one of two similar rings. In hardcore mode, you're put in a tactically paranoid position where every single sight, sound, and move is the difference between life and death. A single, well placed shot is all it takes with any weapon you choose. In standard mode, you have the feeling of wearing armor and you might fight through a few hits...but only a few. No matter what your preferred perspective is as a shooter fan, you get it all here in Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare.			"

The PC version has corner-leaning, enhanced visuals (still look decent enough today), dedicated servers, mod support, console-commands (some awesome cheats), and all the other little things we like to see in a proper PC version. This game needs a resugence.♥♥♥♥ the remake. Not worth the purchase of IW, even if it were free.			"

												What can I say about this game that other people have not already said? One of the best in the franchise. The single player campaign is great and arcade mode also makes it fun. Multiplayer. It is well-balanced from perks to guns and has the set 3-5-7 killstreaks. Even better about the online multiplayer is that there are admins who watch servers for hackers so you don't have to worry about that problem! Though the game has some old graphics, nothing really matches up to it. Highly recommended.			"

I played on console since I was not PC master race at the time, so the playtime I have in this game, and the whole CoD series is something I would like to keep to myself...Anyways, this game marked the first cod to feature a perk system, and it is actually somewhat balanced! Yes I said it, balanced. Perks like last stand can seem annoying, but its very forgiving and has very fluid gameplay. If you are a fan of FPS/Comp. shooters.... then you will love CoD4. It will always have a special place in my gaming heart.After this game, in my opinion, the series has been on a constant downhill slump and this game will never be recreated or have a sequel that can compare to it 10/10			"

												Coming from a person who's not a fan of Infinity Ward at all, I gotta be real with you, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is amazing!Call of Duty 4 easily became my third favorite Call of Duty after only 2 hours of gameplay. I can now see why so many of my friends and other people around the world say how amazing Call of Duty 4 is. It's truly a masterpiece. Even though this is the only good game Infinity Ward has made, I still enjoy it a lot!The simplicity of the game, the classic killstreaks, the maps, the gun balance, the gamemodes, the dedicated servers, and the mods is what makes this game amazing. When people think of ""Classic CoD"" they immediately think of Call of Duty 4. While most Call of Duty's nowadays are full of broken game mechanics and poor PC optimization, CoD 4 is a nice breath of fresh air. Even though I didn't play this game back in it's prime in 2007, people are still playing and I can see why. Even haters of Call of Duty even admit that this is ""the only good CoD game"" and that's saying something to me!Even though this game lacks a friends list, co-op, and has somewhat of a low playercount, I can't recommend Call of Duty 4 enough. It's a fantastic game and definitely worth the twenty bucks.My rating 9/10			"

												Coming home to see my pops suprise me with  modern warfare the day after christmas was a breathtaking moment.  No choors or to do list just me and dooty, Plus my 90s soundtracks.  I couldent put  into words how excited I was. New gaming chairs, Mtn dew voltage, And Cool ranch doritos was all I needed to be happy. Girfreind you ask? Not a chance this was during free online days for ps3. I dident have the time to even text them back. Because I was to busy getting my kd just right, about 2000 more kills then deaths and upgrading my mp5k till I became the hero in capture the flag each game. I was the young prodigy my freinds called me until I injured my right gaming thumb (unrelated to cod)  Also My freinds used to call me that young bruce willis but that was for other reasons. Staying up for days on end with doritos stains on my white t shirt and upgraded camo guns on my mind I couldent beat it. To this day when I have the free time to hop on a game of team deathmatch or run around my  favriote map Backlot it brings a small tear to my eyes. A tear of joy, Uav online. Modern warefare was a special time in my life were everthing was just right.  Thankyou, PopsSincerly T-train99			"

The game is absolutely worth its value of 19.99$. I will recommand  it. Its the must buy game for COD fans.  :)			"

Currently it was released remaster of this production. which is not bad but available only when you buy CoD: Infinite Warfare what I think is pathetic. According to me, this is one of the best CoD's that you can buy. The game is designed in most for the multiplayer gameplay but the main campaign is very good but short, as it always happens with these games. Online game lasts for many hours of fun, however, as once the game was a lot of dynamic now it is about hiding in the corners and wait for the kill. There is not a lot of weapons but it's good because we do not have to check every weapon that suits us. Modes are pretty cool, standard nothing outstanding. In the game there are different kinds of perks that will improve our game for example, faster reload. And if it was not enough in the internet you can find servers with zombie mod which are really cool. I think it's great production from which I have many pleasant memories. Many hours once I lost and so far nothing has changed so much that it is a little less players and there is not that much cheaters in game. Definitely worth it to go back to the game for those few hours to play with friends.  "

												You guys...seriously.  What's with the obsession with hardcore?  The TTK in COD is already very low.  One bullet from nearly any gun is just ridiculous.  Great game and it has aged very well, but the server selection is junk.  24 player HC damage is a cluster♥♥♥♥ and really takes away from the 6v6 gameplay that COD was built on.  Let's get some max 16 player count servers with core damage.			"

												Best CoD multiplayer ever!Pure fun, no flying, no double jumping, no cloaking, no laser, no hearthbeat sensor, no EXO crap, no flying grenades, no pew pew. Between 3 or 4 attachment available and thats it. You can only use one of them. No stupid killstreaks, the same three for everyone. Had it years ago on PC and Xbox 360, bought it again (Lost CD key). This is Call of Duty for men, anyway the game is too barebones for kiddys.11/10 Will buy a fourth time if i have to. "

												The game represents everything right about Call of Duty. It's similar yet somewhat dated movement system and game mechanics are likely to bring out the nostalgia within veterans of the series, and also offer new players a simpler more understandable way to play. This is beneficial to newcomers due to the recent Call of Duty installments being far too overcomplicated and unecessarily confusing to say the least. With a memorable campaign, a fun exciting multplayer mode and with many community made maps and servers to choose from, Modern Warfare is a gaming experience that has the ability to live on in the PC community for many years to come.

												This is the only COD game you will ever need to buy. Skip the DLC ridden remastered mess and get this. This is the granddad of all modern shooters... a game so awesome it ruined the whole industry with everyone trying to copy it. People say MW2 is the best COD, but I tend to disagree. MW2 had way too many exploitable perks and guns. MW2 felt much less gritty/serious in tone and even in art style when compared to 4. (I loved the muted color palette of COD4. Why does every COD game have to look like an oversaturated cartoony mess now?) COD4 was the last COD that showed restraint in every regard. No need for overboard perks, killstreaks and loadout systems. It was just you, your gun, your skill and some basic customization to compliment said skill. ANY gun has the potential to be lethal in the right hands, even the pea shooter but laser accurate skorpion. (Which I used to own with.)My only complaints would be the fps and fov locks. I feel cheated not being able to play at full 144hz.It's a shame there is only a few playable unmodded servers even in prime hours. This game deserves to live forever, it's the quintessential shooter.9.8/10			"

It has to be said that this game has the best multiplayer yet, even now ""9"" years after it was released!!! Even the servers are better.I've bought this game 6 times over the years (on different systems) and I keep coming back for more!Also IMO this has the best singleplayer campaign too!			"

There are many out there that are actively played and are fun to be played. (I'd advice Freeze Tag (ftag))In my opinion, Call of Duty 4 is still the best Call of Duty out today.			"

												I discovered the Call of Duty franchise with a demo given by a French magazine. While I appreciated the WWII settings, I was less at ease with a nervous gameplay: bombing, shooting, running.... well, in other words, it was perhaps too fast for me.When I finally indulged myself in CoD Modern Warfare, I would have never though that the modern setting would be something that would make remake in my head the story. You're Soap, a new guy in Price's unit and you're going to be involded in the Russian Civil War and later, in a special team to stop the ultranationalist leader, an ex-weapon dealer. You're also Paul Jackson, a sergeant in the US Army, sent to an unknown country as part of an operation for freeing it from the rule of the new leader. You're even going to be Price but years ago...You're playing people that are in the same moment at opposite directions and your role is to survive. The gameplay isn't only shoot, load, shoot... it's also keeping your cover, destroy tanks, be silent when you need to be silent, snipe....The game is offering enough challenges to hook you up.Yet the nervous gameplay isn't still something I like. That's probably because I'm more used to Doom or Half-Life pace.The graphics are also quite good, though it's mainly revolving around a Middle East town or Russian forests. The only time you can enjoy something different is when you're in a plane above Price's team, clearing the path for them.Characters are people you're getting attached to, whether you're playing them or they're NPC. Yeah, true, it's Call of Duty, which means unexpected death. In the end, Soap is alive, though badly injured, as you're him during the end of the game. Price? You don't know, though CoD Modern Warfare 2 is featuring him. Jackson? Well, he's still somewhere in that unknown country. As for the others that were with you (Griggs, Nikolai, Vasquez, McMillan or Gaz), their fate is sealed in the game. It's up to you to follow the story to find about them.And the game is ranking high in my ""love soundtrack"" meter. Really appreciated these. Really fitting.The commands were probably the harder thing I had to master. Probably because of the cover I have to take when you're used to games without having none. And it's not always easy to fight your way through, even in the easy difficulty.Anyway, CoD Modern Warfare is really a very good game. Too bad the price is still high after all this year but hey, when there is a discount, go for it.			"

												It isn't as bad as they say, and it isn't as good as they say.As a whole it ends up a great deal on sale, and very easily the best game in the Call of Duty series, but it can't meet the hype and it isn't the atrocity the later entries have made it out to be.In essence, if you have to buy one Call of Duty it would be this one, and you wouldn't regret it anytime soon, as it includes lean (something they couldn't implement on consoles), console commands (increased fov becomes an option), dedicated servers, and mods (some of which were blatantly stolen from for features in later entries in the series), while delivering a story that isn't Michael Bay-esque and doesn't make any pretention about being incredibly gritty.

												This game had many top notch review ratings and still rocks. However EvenBalance's PunkBuster is no longer supported for CoD4 so you may have to disable it for both CoD4 client and server as PB is not recommended if it will kick you or your players if PB was enabled in CoD4 server. Using the PBSetup.exe won't help you to get the latest PB Client for CoD4 anymore.Activision appears to lost too much support for CoD4 - such as Punkbuster, Master server and possibly more. I've found out the best way is to install CoD 4X v1.8 patch to wipe out those bugs and server connection problems at once! I won't explain in too much detail but this appears to be the best method to resolve those CoD4 Client issues for our CoD4 players. Please try this download out now and tell us what you think!

												This game had many top notch review ratings and still rocks. However EvenBalance's PunkBuster is no longer supported for CoD4 so you may have to disable it for both CoD4 client and server as PB is not recommended if it will kick you or your players if PB was enabled in CoD4 server. Using the PBSetup.exe won't help you to get the latest PB Client for CoD4 anymore.Activision appears to lost too much support for CoD4 - such as Punkbuster, Master server and possibly more. I've found out the best way is to install CoD 4X v1.8 patch to wipe out those bugs and server connection problems at once! I won't explain in too much detail but this appears to be the best method to resolve those CoD4 Client issues for our CoD4 players. Please try this download out now and tell us what you think!

The campaign is rock solid and a ton of fun. You can play it over and over again and not get bored of it, excellent campaign! The multiplayer isn't as bad as it seems, finding a game maybe a little hard, and you'll run into a hacker from time to time, but overall it's OK.Would only buy for Campaign8.5/10			"

												i remember when i first played this on ps3, it got me into cod but its went downhill since then (after blops 1) but after buying this for 19.99 i think it was worth it, you need a software like GameTracker to get online but if you can get around that its amazing, aside from the awesome singleplayer that i beat on ps3 this has mutiple mods like Galactic Warfare and plenty of zombie maps to keep me entertained for years to come... PROS - MODS, Singleplayer, Galactic Warfare (a mod but idc), arcade mode (if you beat the game and some cheats too) Cons - Honestly none, this is a masterpiece unlike the rest after blops 1 (only thing is connection errors..) 10/10(i beat the game in 7.2 hrs but i will defo play this more, if your reading this and you've not played CoD I'd recommend to buy this NOW!!!!)

Sure, it's old, but the graphics and picture are great. I've never played the newer CODs such as Black Ops 2, MW3, and ghosts, but I will say this one is worth the $20.

												I am the kind of person that absolutely HATES First Person Shooters, ESPECIALLY Call of Duty. I can barely stand even the most subtle shooters such as Borderlands or Bioshock. However, this game is most likely the BIGGEST EXCEPTION to any First Person Shooters because the amazing detail in the game completely makes up for it.If this video game was a screenplay, it would win every Academy Award, including Best Storyline, Best Actors, Best Soundtrack, and for at its time, Best Visual Effects. It was SO good I could not leave my computer screen for 5 entire hours (which rarely happens to me!) Why pay $90 for Ghosts when you can pay $20 for this! Seriously though, you have not lived until you've played this, so I heavily advise you to immediately buy this game!!69/10  "

												I loved this game back in 2007 on my console and I still love it now on my PC. In my opinion this is the last good CoD so far. The multiplayer is great fun and the singleplayer is very enjoyable too. It dosent matter who you are I reccomend this game too you! Have fun!			"

												[UPDATE 2016] Yeah, I'm still playing this game.. Gotta love our dedicated servers.Call of Duty 4 has a very large community dispite being released over 6 years ago.What sets this apart from the recent CoDs in the franchise is the dedicated servers.These servers allow for mods and give admins the abiltiy to keep gameplay and players in check.The competitive scene is still quite active. All round it's still a great buy.			"

												I am the kind of person that absolutely HATES First Person Shooters, ESPECIALLY Call of Duty. I can barely stand even the most subtle shooters such as Borderlands or Bioshock. However, this game is most likely the BIGGEST EXCEPTION to any First Person Shooters because the amazing detail in the game completely makes up for it.If this video game was a screenplay, it would win every Academy Award, including Best Storyline, Best Actors, Best Soundtrack, and for at its time, Best Visual Effects. It was SO good I could not leave my computer screen for 5 entire hours (which rarely happens to me!) Why pay $90 for Ghosts when you can pay $20 for this! Seriously though, you have not lived until you've played this, so I heavily advise you to immediately buy this game!!69/10  "

												*Single Player Review*This is what started it all. Still said to be the best by alot people today, others say it is ONE of the best....me? well what I think is it is one of the best (my fav being MW2) why do I think that is?:1.REALISM: yes while cod isn't realistic, cod 4 is based on serious situations and not on some mad up BS like AW and black ops 3. You start off training for the british sas and meeting GAZ and captain price then move onto your first mission stealing documents on an enemy ship. this is awesome becuase 1. they're britsh and not just americans 2. they are REAL. Then another person you play as is a marine, well you play as 2 (won't spoil what happens to the first).2.CHARACTERS: The best are, Britsh SAS: GAZ, CAP PRICE and Macmillian. Marines: Ssgt. Griggs and Vasquez. ENEMIES: Imran Zakheav and Khaled AL-Asad3.GAMEPLAY: Typical in this day and age of call of duty but it is so simple and fluid that you cannot hate and not have fun in cod with the gameplay.4.STORY: tbh I have to google it but it's pretty much an anti-western terriost group seized a country with oil so the americans go in to capture the leader AS-Asad and pretty folds out from there.5.CONS: If i gotta be honest i'm having a hard thinking about what's wrong...so yeah...nothing, nothing that would take away from the full experience atleast.6.CONCLUSION: COD4 is an amazing game all around without a doubt. If you have'nt played it already you are REALLY missing out go out and BUY THIS GAME. I rate Call Of Duty 4 Modern Warfare Single Player 9/10. Thank you for reading please give feedback i would really appreciate it. THANKS.			"

A Call of Duty - Must Have - for all Who played MW2/MW3 !!!SingleplayerGraphics may be a little outdated, but the Singleplayer contains lots of Action and it is the Prequel to MW2/MW3 so it shows you how everthing started. I always enjoyed the Singleplayer Campaigns of every Call of Duty and this one is no exception.MultiplayerThe Multiplayer still is fun to play and the Community is still pretty active with a huge amount of Dedicated Servers (last time i checked there were about 3k servers or so) with external Anti-Cheat engine. Also there are Lots of Custom Maps, Sound packs and Mods which make the Multiplayer even more Interesting and Fun to play.			"

												I only started playing COD 4 Multiplayer in 2014. And for a 7 year old game (at that time), I had to learn how to play with the community who still plays this game. I did not play COD 4 when it was released in 2007. I have only played the Singleplayer prior to purchasing this game on steam. I have to admit that, the learning curve was steep. For the first few months, i struggled to learn the maps and the guns. At one time, i almost gave up. But i endured for 4 months, playing this game everyday. Now with 53 hours under my belt, I can safetly say that is was all worth it. The community is great, no whining 10 year old whom have somehow slept with your mom, but a community who is united to support this game, as the multiplayer here is the best of the franchise. Coming from a person who has played competitive COD at one point, I wish i was born earlier so that i could've taken part in MLG when COD 4 was around. 11/10 would buy again.			"

												I bought this game to compare with the upcoming Cod: MWR, and also to experience a call of duty with high remarks as I joined call of duty on a later title, that being its sequel MW2. So here was an exciting journey. Cod4's single player is a god damn blast. Still holds a strong story with those key memberable moments and characters. Always a great campaign to play, which was the primary reason why I bought it. Now multiplayer was a shocker. The simplicity of it is a amazing. Having so many games where it just bloated with content that you have no idea what to use, it was not the case with this game. And it was refreshing. Unlocks were simple, and gameplay is still solid. That being, the maps in this game are solid. Each have their own unique characteristics about them, and rarely any are bad. It just depends on your play style, but all in all they are so good. That being there is a learning curve when it comes to checks spots, made locations, and walls that are penetrable. Also note nades are ridiculous and spammy. Surprisingly the community is still strong however most servers are tdm which is disappointing as I really wished to play SnD but that's alright. I think I got my full. All in all this game is a must play. One of gamings greatest leaps with great story, characters, and multiplayer. How Cod has changed...			"

												I was hoping for controller support, which it didn't have, but I'm glad the keybord and mouse were easy to learn. The story was beautifully written and the multiplayer was really fun to play. I was really surprised that people were working together in the game. It seems that even the maps themselves pushed for some level of strategy and teamwork (try finding that in Ghosts). It's also fun setting up private servers and screwing about with the console commands.			"

												There's no doubt as to why old school players prefer this Call of Duty game in comparison to the older versions of the series. The hitboxes are more accurate, the GUI is extremely simple and easy to grasp. Each gun has their own unique feel which really grasps the player into the game. The graphics from when the game was made is indeed playable, graphics isn't an issue in this game as the mechanics and engine run so smooth.I'd suggest getting this on PC due to cheat protection software, punkbuster. The servers are also player hosted and you get a server-list so that you can choose whether or not you want to play with mods and interfere with annoying hackers. Consoles do not offer this.I have yet to play the story mode so I have no review on that for the time being. Multiplayer is a must.			"

												Love this game.. but the online is horible.. need to download PunkBuster and update the game on it before playing online. marster servers are all down so youll have to find a way which took me hours.. ok, when you get the game to play online youll need to update punk buster, then delete the old one and then apply the lastest one.. after that youll need to delete the server cache, then go online and download the cod4 server cache then apply to the cod4 folder. then the online should work. but everytime i want to play i have to delete the server cache and then re apply. no idea why but it works when i do it.. other then that and the modders you come across just find punk buster lobbys and youll be fine. im in New Zealand so the USA servers have really high ping :/ but honestly its an amazing game. just wish they had the online marster servers still. but it is 7 years old so yeah. hope this helps people since i had no clue. happy gaming fellow steam players :)			"

Posted: August 23, 2016
												You know, I used to think highly of Activision because of the Call of Duty series. When this game came out, everyone was losing their♥♥♥♥♥♥and I include myself on that. Even back then this company was sh#tting bad multiplatform crap games that most people never liked, but this one made us all forget about it. Is it good, is it worth it? Well, with the next CoD of Duty having a remake of this game, I might as well bother to review this. And as usual, I'm going to start with the stuff it does poorly. Now there's not much to that, but the issues it has are big.First and foremost, the autosave feature. Jesus #nal f#cking christ, remember when you could just save or quicksave in games!? This is one of the games that pushed the auto-save feature like it was the hot sh#t forward, like it or not. And I don't like it one bit, it's complete bullsh#t. Let me explain: Whenever the hell the game feels like, it will save. You have NO control over it, and the saves are at complete random. It can save twice in a row with barely a few seconds in between, or it might not even safe more than twice on a level. It's way more painful than you think, you can be fighting for over 5 minutes, suddenly get killed by a random RPG and suddenly have to replay most if not all of that. Even worse, it manages to ruin some of the best moments of the game. One of the missions that most people love of this game ends up with you, having to wait for an helicopter that's around 9 kilometers away. I got one auto save when that last objective was told, then I got another auto save when the helicopter was still 7 kilometers away. And guess what, those 7 last kilometers are around 6 to 10 minutes of intense shooting action with way too many enemies storming your place at the same time from all directions. And since I was playing on a high difficulty (more on that later), I died a lot, and had to replay the same area over and over. Bottom line, either have good auto-saves or just LET THE PLAYER SAVE MANUALLY.The other issue this game has is, as I said, the difficulty. Is the game really difficult? No, mainly the different difficulty modes are a standard case of artificial difficulty. You know what changes? You can take more shots, which is normal, but it also changes the amount of grenades the enemies throw, and makes enemies see you as the main target, ignoring all other NPC's. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HELL LOOKS LIKE!? HOW ABOUT A SMALL CORRIDOR CONSTANTLY BEING STORMED BY GRENADES!? It gets REALLY OLD, REALLY FAST.That being said though, this is easily the best CoD game there is. There's a reason why it's getting somewhat remastered on the new♥♥♥♥♥♥CoD. It really is a good experience. The story, while most people would over-look it, it's quite entertaining and decent for all the♥♥♥♥♥♥CoD games get these days. It's not too complex but it's catchy enough for you to want to know what's next. It also isn't too long, which is a shame, but also includes a kickass extra level that aparently is supposed to be really hard, but I kind of beated it on my second try on the Hard difficulty.Gameplay is also okay. You know how all CoD games after MW2 tried to constantly force the multiplayer unlockables into the story mode, as of to tell you ""GO PLAY THE MULTIPLAYER INSTEAD YOU F#CKING♥♥♥♥♥♥""? That makes the gameplay feel stupidly shallow and that doesn't happen here. You get in one mission help from a helicopter, and later the ability to call for bombs thrown by jets, that's it. I wish more CoDs just did that. It also changes the pace multiple times instead of throwing countless enemies over and over, although it does have constant respawning npc's, something I don't like at all.The mission ""All Ghillied Up"" deserves a mention of it's own. If you have played it, then you know why. It's one of the best levels I've ever played and sure as hell is memorable. It's quite inspired from games such as STALKER (funny enough I have no idea what the enemies talk about in this level but I did hear one♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC mention a ""Stalker"" through the first stage of the level), and the soundtrack of it is just perfect. The second stage also ends strong, although as I said, it's painful on high difficulties because of the auto-save.The graphics are also okay, which seems to be what most people are looking forward on the remastered edition, something that quite pisses me off. IT STILL LOOKS GOOD TODAY, YOU F#CKING IDIOTS! WHY WASTE THE MONEY BUYING A SH#T GAME FOR THE REMASTERED WHEN YOU CAN JUST BUY THIS!? The only bad thing the graphics have are the ocasional weird bugs, like NPC's ignoring each other even though they're supposed to be hostile and corpses freezing in mid air until you die and the game reloads an auto-save.Lastly, the multiplayer. I must say I usually ignore the multiplayer aspect on these reviews, specially if the game is this old, however this game did it right. All these new CoD's just flood the game with upgrades and killstreak unlockables which completely miss the point of the modes to begin with, this one kept it really simple and it's fun. However good luck finding anyone to play with. I know for a fact that it still has a strong community, but once the remastered version comes out, I don't think anyone but old school fans will stick around.Is this game worth it? Yeah. Is it worth the 20€ price-tag, though? Nah, it's good but not that much. I'd say, get it if it drops around 5€ or so, but get it if you're truly interested on it and might want to give the multiplayer a try. Otherwise, while it has really cool moments, you might wanna play something else instead.TL;DR Edition: The good CoD game. Really good controls and story, although it has some cheap difficulty crap and a quite terrible auto-save feature. It also has a quite high price tag for how old the game is, if you're truly interested you better wait for a sale, but it's a really good game.			"

												I just got this game today and I'm having a ball on the multiplayer, Kill kill and kill, so fast paced and killing is rewarding. Unlocking new guns and attachments. I do not believe the Multiplayer is as good as it is in Black ops 2, but Cod4 Definitely is worth it's $20. It's a nice casual Call of Duty so you can just sit in a 24/7 server and play for as long as you like (you'll have to play the long♥♥♥♥♥games though if you're playing them) Cod4 is a great starting Call of Duty for new players and will keep having tonnes of player for years to come. All though I prefer black ops 2 over this game Cod4 doesn't get dull for a second! I was having so much fun with my stealth class (Ak silencer, Usp Silenced, 3x Special Perk UAV jammer and Deep penatration Frag and Stun) I could get Quad- Five Feeds absolutely amazing game. Balanced and Fair and I never felt 1 gun was OP.Cod4 has a fun singleplayer mode, but I'll be playing multiplayer as I've finished singleplayer numerous times. 10/10			"

												At first glance, this game appears as just another CoD.  It's not.  This game is the staple of the fps franchise, its a amazing game too. The community is still alive and well. You just need to download a few patches to make up for the lack of punkbuster, but you might not need to as most servers don't run it and have their own anticheat- yes, thats right. Their own anticheat. There are a hell of a lot of good servers avalible, and serverbob.net is the BEST hardcore server. I know its hardcore and not vanilla, but i've met a lot of nice dudes on there. Give it a try!Also, its the only CoD where players can impersonate other players and go unpunished. gg no re.  10/10 would get impersonated and forced to say things i didn't actually say again.   "

												Just because a game is ""old"", doesn't mean that it's not good. This game is the best in the ENTIRE Call of Duty franchise and has massive amounts of replay-ability in the campaign mode, and as well in the online community. Give or take a few hackers every now and then, there are still a great deal of well populated servers that provide hours upon hours of fun for anybody looking to play online. Great game. Well worth the $20 (or whatever it is when you read this)Overall 9/10 - Would play again. Recommeded x4			"

												COD4 has the best multiplayer and singleplayer component of any COD to date that I've played. The campaign's missions are all creative and fun to play. All Ghillied Up, No Fighting in the War Room and Mile High Club are among the best missions in any COD. Finishing Mile High Club on Veteran was one of the most rewarding achievements I've ever recieved. Such an amazing campaign...except for that ending of One Shot, One Kill where you have to wait on the helicopter. That was horrible on veteran.Multiplayer is obviously why COD makes the billions and COD4 is arguably the peak of the franchise. Struck the perfect formula of leveling and unlocking in a competitve FPS. Subsequent CODs simply added more killstreaks, maps, guns, modes etc to keep things fresh, but they are all building off of the success that COD4 created. Amazing game.			"

It was one of the pioneers of the combat simulation first person shooter genre of games.I can tell you first hand that all the praise for this game is well deserved. The music and story are simply astounding. The graphics, for its time, were out of this world, but I honestly think the graphics are still good enough to hold its own against the modern day (Get it?

												An amazing game for its time that still has some to offer.Leaving behind World War II, this was essentially a reboot for the Call of Duty series. And what a much-needed reboot it was. The mounting ennui with the WWII setting for shooters at the time that CoD4 was announced meant it came along at just the right time to win over both old fans of the series, as well as new players coming off of other series which were winding down.You would think that being over four years old would leave it looking quite dated, however  the movement and graphical fidelty hold up well enough to make playing through the single player campaign an enjoyable experience to this day. Which is a good thing because  the multiplayer community is probably near non-existant at this point since there have been more Call of Duty games release since this one than there were before it.

This game is a definite recommend to new comers and veterans of the series alike!P.S: If you want to play this again (that's if you have played it on consoles a couple of years back) and don't know whether you should get the remaster just don't. The remaster is just a cheap cash in method from Infinity Ward, if anything the original looks better on PC than the remaster (just my opinion though).			"

This game is the best in the ENTIRE Call of Duty franchise and has massive amounts of replay-ability in the campaign mode, and as well in the online community. Give or take a few hackers every now and then, there are still a great deal of well populated servers that provide hours upon hours of fun for anybody looking to play online. Great game. Well worth the $20 (or whatever it is when you read this)Overall 9/10 - Would play again. Recommeded x4			"

												This, Call of Duty: World at War, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops were the last good games in the series that were released after Call of Duty 3. This is a solid game on PC and consoles and never seems to dissapoint with the story, gameplay and suprisingly the graphics. This game is a definite recommend to new comers and veterans of the series alike!P.S: If you want to play this again (that's if you have played it on consoles a couple of years back) and don't know whether you should get the remaster just don't. The remaster is just a cheap cash in method from Infinity Ward, if anything the original looks better on PC than the remaster (just my opinion though).			"

												COD4 has the best multiplayer and singleplayer component of any COD to date that I've played. The campaign's missions are all creative and fun to play. All Ghillied Up, No Fighting in the War Room and Mile High Club are among the best missions in any COD. Finishing Mile High Club on Veteran was one of the most rewarding achievements I've ever recieved. Such an amazing campaign...except for that ending of One Shot, One Kill where you have to wait on the helicopter. That was horrible on veteran.Multiplayer is obviously why COD makes the billions and COD4 is arguably the peak of the franchise. Struck the perfect formula of leveling and unlocking in a competitve FPS. Subsequent CODs simply added more killstreaks, maps, guns, modes etc to keep things fresh, but they are all building off of the success that COD4 created. Amazing game.			"

I decided to buy the Cod4-B02 to relive my childhood experiences and to show my brother how superior those games were. So when I started to play this I was amazed how much better graphics this game had than in ps3. The game is totaly amazing in pc would recommed if the MW3 bundle drops to 50 bucks If you havent bought it yet you are a fuc#### Scu####. P.S In my 10 hours I have not encountered any hackers.			"

												Even though i have only 4 hours on this game as of me writing this review, I have played this on Xbox 360 from 2 days after it came out, until 2014, so I have play too many hours on here. If you're going to buy Infinte Warfare just for the remaster of this, DONT. You're falling into Activision's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buisiness schemes, and probably by January, the remaster will be standalone on the store. This game is still a gem, with soo many active servers, it's unreal. Don't waste $80+ on just a remaster and a game that most people will think is absolute trash, and wait, or just buy this, crank up the settings to max, and enjoy.			"

Most consider it the best Call of Duty game ever made and I can see why It was revolutionary when it first released but I didn't not play it till about 4 years after. So to me I have no nostalgic feelings towards it really which I suspect is why most people consider it the best as it was the first next gen modern shooter, I liked MW2 more really. The campaign was mad fun to the point where I beat it multiple times on every difficulty. MultiplayerTo this day I still play it every now and then. I got all the gold guns and completed all the challenges. There are still some cheaters but if you play on a popular community server then they tend to get banned pretty quickly. Lots of popular mods including Prop Hunt, Pro Mod, Zombies & Parkour Jumping9/10Great Multi, Still fun & Still looks good for its age "

												Pretty fun game I bought this during steam sales would recommend buying during sales because for how old the game is its not really worth $20 but i guess thats just activision being activision...Anyway the story line is pretty good in fact Modern Warfare 1,2 and 3 all have great a great story, (back when call of duty campains where good) in this game you play as both S.A.S and U.S.M.C fighting against both middle eastern and russain forces, and you even do a joint operation thats pretty cool I would say.Call of Duty 4 is pretty well optimized and I had no problems running this game even during a Multiplayer session with about 48 players in the game. this is probably one of few call of duty games that are well developed for pc most of the new ones get bad reviews becaues of the ports not being very well and probably suppy drops too but this one is really well done.Now lets talk about the pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Great story line it makes you want to buy the other modern warfare games to continue the story.-Well optimized -Gameplay is really solid and fun -Visuals are neat obviously this is not the BEST looking game ever but it still looks pretty nice in my honest opinion-Game has some nice mods and it even comes with a mod launcher when you purchase the game-Multiplayer is still very much active some good amount of servers you can find with no problem-all DLC is free Cons-With a game thats almost 10 years old you can expect cheaters to be in your lobbys but even then you can probably avoid them if you`re in a server with admins.-the game sometimes feels about weird when it comes to melees at least from my personal experience.-the anti-cheat is no longer suported so you might need to keep an eye on who is in your games when playing MP.that pretty much my review for this game again like I said at the begining I would defiantly recommend this game if you never played it or even if you want to play it again for nostalgia reasons but buy it on sale its worth to save some money, I hope this review helps someone. :D "

Not to mention the Mods. The things people ave donw tiths game is truly amazing. If you like FPS's and you are a Call Of Duty fanboy looking for action with amazing graphics, You cannot go wrong.

You need to try it out, unless your like a Advanced warfare fan that likes to double jump and jump on walls xD because this is the ''Classic warfare'' totally worth it 10/10			"

												CoD 4:Modern Warfare is a literal classic. A must-have for your game library. Try to think not of the argument that it's a stereotypical CoD on the multiplayer side, but that it is a very arcade version of CoD. the single player is immersive, i had alot of fun with my playthrough, and the multiplayer is more arcade-type gameplay. overall alot of fun. 10/13 headshots.

												There's no doubt as to why old school players prefer this Call of Duty game in comparison to the older versions of the series. The hitboxes are more accurate, the GUI is extremely simple and easy to grasp. Each gun has their own unique feel which really grasps the player into the game. The graphics from when the game was made is indeed playable, graphics isn't an issue in this game as the mechanics and engine run so smooth.I'd suggest getting this on PC due to cheat protection software, punkbuster. The servers are also player hosted and you get a server-list so that you can choose whether or not you want to play with mods and interfere with annoying hackers. Consoles do not offer this.And the campaign has a amazing story so I have no review on that for the time being because you need to enjoy it for yourself.			"

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the sucessor to Call of Duty 3. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare takes place in modern times. Its campaign is really good and solid, whereas the multiplayer is the same way but it is no longer populated with legitamate servers. This game has a lot of Prophunt, Deathrun, and other servers if you're into that. This game is very good and at its state right now it'd rate it a 6/10			"

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is considered by some as the game that put fps games into the modern era and others consider it as the game that ruined the fps genre for the modern era. I personally believe that it set a fundation that many fps games followed, (warmode maps are based off cod 4, sniper ghost warrior 2 is an attempt of recreating a mission from the campaign). Cod 4 was released in the November of 2007 and the last cod game with free dlc, the game was remastered late last year. *Please note* This is a campaign review (I'm experiencing performance issues with multiplayer and that will be added to the review once fixed).PositivesGreat graphics for time periodAmazing frame rate (no frame rate drops)Good voice actingThis game puts you in a scenario to determine the best difficulty for your skill levelGreat variety of missionsGreat variety of weaponsRPGs, rocket launchers, bombs and any other explosions are done perfectly'good guys' don't aways succeedThe game puts you in the perspective of multiple peopleStory and missions are set in multiple time periodsAllie characters have interesting and varied personalitiesMy teammates actually shot the enemies and actually kill some enemiesNegatives:Way to short about 5 hours longAI positioning and spawning areas and timing is lazy and dumb (game showing its age)All enemies look the same (again game showing its age)My teammates always cut me off or bump into me in the first mission or prologueOverall cod 4 is one of my favourites games and is a nice breath of fresh compared to modern games. This game had so much potential and only lived up to some of it. If they could of made the campaign 10-20 hours long then fixed AI spawning issues in the remaster and obviously update graphics we'd have two out of this world games. I rate the campaign a 8.5/10 and I know that people still play the multiplayer and we can even join servers down under. I got it for $13 AU on a humblebundle sale and it sits around the same price on♥♥♥♥♥or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so your definitely getting your moneys worth so why not buy it? "

												Considered one of the best in the Call Of Duty series and I would have to agree. The visuals and graphics are great (as close as you'll want to get to actual combat) and the story is pretty engaging. The switching back and forth between characters is well done. By the end of the game you'll actually care who lives or dies.A warning on the difficulty level though. Set it too high and this game can get really frustrating really quick. Makes you appreciate the kind of hell real life soldiers have to go through.			"

												My third stop in my journey to play all the CODs (for PC) in chronological order. Reviewed for its playability today.Pros:- Pretty good graphics- Decent story, although not particulary memorable- Some pretty sweet maps in the campaign- Great, simple multiplier with classes and ranks (and still lots of people playing)- Since this is the first of the COD games with their famous multiplayer features, it's as basic and un-bogged down as possible; good old fashioned, quick-paced gameplay- Runs smoothlyCons:- Campaign is pretty short - finished it in about 6-6.5 hours on advanced difficulty- You'll find yourself at the maximum multiplayer rank before too, too long (no prestige system or anything that I can see)- Some features you might miss from later games in multiplayer- Some cheesy dialogue in campaign, and I only found myself caring for about one or two other characters			"

The game still looks really good for its age (released in 2007), and still retains one of the best storylines in the CoD franchise. Price and Soap are lovable, and really make you want to play the story ot the end to  kill Zakhaev . The guns are also good, without too many stupid attachments and skins like you find in CoD these days, and follows a sensible setting that is quite relevant now.Overall, a great game, and in my opinion the best CoD.10/10			"

												Mea, It's a great shooter game for sure. For being old graphics are defently nice. I was able to run this with high graphics on a $300 laptop without any sort of graphics card, so performance is great. Multiplayer is not so great. Whilst there are always matches to join, alot of them are modded and require something to download. If you are new to the game (like me) there are no real matches that are just a bunch of new folks. Would be nice if there were ranked matches. As for the campaign, umm, I killed some people on a boat, and got board and went to go play some AC.

												Pretty good alternative to CSGO, since Valve is messing up pretty hard recently. CoD 4 offers a ""hard to master"" and intensive gameplay and is not comparable to the todays Call of Dutys. The game offers a server browser and full mod support which creates many different servers and difficulties.I rate 9/11Also, the story is not bad. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Definitely the best call of duty game ever made in my personal opinion. If you are contemplating getting modern warfare remastered or this (the original) I would recommend the original. it runs better even on the highest settings ( depending on the specs of your pc) and all in all it feels smoother than the remastered as the new one requires a bit more higher specs as it's new. If you are worried about the original game being barron because the remastered has been released that isn't the case as people are still playing the original because it runs better.			"

												There's no doubt as to why old school players prefer this Call of Duty game in comparison to the older versions of the series. The hitboxes are more accurate, the GUI is extremely simple and easy to grasp. Each gun has their own unique feel which really grasps the player into the game. The graphics from when the game was made is indeed playable, graphics isn't an issue in this game as the mechanics and engine run so smooth.I'd suggest getting this on PC due to cheat protection software, punkbuster. The servers are also player hosted and you get a server-list so that you can choose whether or not you want to play with mods and interfere with annoying hackers. Consoles do not offer this.And the campaign has a amazing story so I have no review on that for the time being because you need to enjoy it for yourself.			"

The game still looks really good for its age (released in 2007), and still retains one of the best storylines in the CoD franchise. Price and Soap are lovable, and really make you want to play the story ot the end to  kill Zakhaev . The guns are also good, without too many stupid attachments and skins like you find in CoD these days, and follows a sensible setting that is quite relevant now.Overall, a great game, and in my opinion the best CoD.10/10			"

												Mea, It's a great shooter game for sure. For being old graphics are defently nice. I was able to run this with high graphics on a $300 laptop without any sort of graphics card, so performance is great. Multiplayer is not so great. Whilst there are always matches to join, alot of them are modded and require something to download. If you are new to the game (like me) there are no real matches that are just a bunch of new folks. Would be nice if there were ranked matches. As for the campaign, umm, I killed some people on a boat, and got board and went to go play some AC. So over all, if your not new to mouse and keyboard shooters and you don't mind downloading mods to get in the majority of matches, this game is great, however it is just not ""my cup of tea"".			"

Reviewed for its playability today.Pros:- Pretty good graphics- Decent story, although not particulary memorable- Some pretty sweet maps in the campaign- Great, simple multiplier with classes and ranks (and still lots of people playing)- Since this is the first of the COD games with their famous multiplayer features, it's as basic and un-bogged down as possible; good old fashioned, quick-paced gameplay- Runs smoothlyCons:- Campaign is pretty short - finished it in about 6-6.5 hours on advanced difficulty- You'll find yourself at the maximum multiplayer rank before too, too long (no prestige system or anything that I can see)- Some features you might miss from later games in multiplayer- Some cheesy dialogue in campaign, and I only found myself caring for about one or two other characters			"

												Considered one of the best in the Call Of Duty series and I would have to agree. The visuals and graphics are great (as close as you'll want to get to actual combat) and the story is pretty engaging. The switching back and forth between characters is well done. By the end of the game you'll actually care who lives or dies.A warning on the difficulty level though. Set it too high and this game can get really frustrating really quick.

												This stuff right here...is a legend among first person shooters. Much like doom, quake, unreal touranment, and Halo made awesome contributions to the FPS, so has infinity ward's first entry into the Modern era of shooters. I have enjoyed this game tremendously on the Xbox 360 and getting the PC version made it even better.Story: One of my favorite First Person Shooter campaigns to date, honestly it is brilliant and no other call of duty game has exceeded it (Except MW2 in my opinion) or matched it (black ops got close though) and few other FPS have matched it in story. However it is about 6 hours long so keep that in mind that the 20$ price tag might be too much. The game looks dated yes, 720p 60FPS on the Xbox 360 it's not hard to max out. I used the nvidia control panel honestly to spruce up the game's visuals. The game is brilliant and a ton of fun so it is was definitely worth 60$ back in 2007 but I don't know about now.Multiplayer: I honestly could not get it to work it kept crashing but there are fixes just look on youtube. The multiplayer as a remember it is amazing but with the community now I can't be sure.Bad Stuff: umm, multiplayer may not work for some I guess? and High priceFinal Verdict: If you feel confident that you can get the multiplayer to work the game is worth it's 20$ price tag. However If you can't I'd wait til it gets on sale.			"

												This game was the one that put Activision and the whole Call of Duty franchise on the map. But unlike the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children that it spawned, COD4 is a prime example of ""simple is better"". There are 3 killstreaks, 3, and that's all you'd ever want because it is the gameplay, the brilliant maps, and the deadliest of deadly weaponry that count in this game. The proof is in the puddin' and this game brings buckets of it. Released in 2007 (as of this review this game is 10 years old).... and the online community has adored it, and promoted it to this day and for many years to come im sure.By far my favorite shooter game everTry it out once, glance up at the clock and realize that you've been playing for 12 hours straight... that's just what it does.ENVOY RATED: 10/10			"

												Most people who played this in its heyday call it the best Call of Duty, and it's not hard to see why.PROS:+A campaign which set a new standard for future Call of Duty games+Gameplay with modern features like ADS and regenerative health, but some classic features like leaning.+A simple, easy-to-follow plot without all of the levels of convolution shown in the sequels.+Awesome multiplayer with create-a-class and killstreaks, but without a lot of game-breaking things seen in later games.+The famous sniper level which everyone tries to remake nowadays, but none have done successfully.+Dedicated Servers!+Few hackers! You have to work to find them.+Free DLC!CONS:-Still some broken multiplayer options ie noob tubes, juggernaut perk, martyrdom, last stand, and frag x3. A number of servers auto-kick players for using these weapons/perks, though.-Some useless perks in Multiplayer, ie eavesdrop.-Little replayability beyond Multiplayer.If you loved CoD 4 in the old days, you can pick this up and play without worries. If you want a fun FPS to play, you can grab this and have a blast. It's easily one of the best games of the 2000s.			"

The physics, the game play, the weaponry, the accuracy, all A++.Pitty though it all went downhill from there: CoD-WaW or -BlackopsXXX, and mainly because IW and Activision couldn't sort their sh*t out.

												One of the LAST non-cash grab call of duties on the market. The earlier CODS were made with love, passion and the release dates for each one were spaced out. We would soon find out that future call of duties were not going to be the same. Instead they take zero notice to the community and just come up with the regular bull-crap game machanics as the last one and maybe a jet pack in between. If you want to buy a non cash grab, non yes-man bull-wank then I suggest this, or anything before it and Modern warfare 2. The only reason I have played modern warfare 3 on consoles was because it carries the story of the game before.Dont give activision or any of those devs anymore money. They are greedy un-responsible devs that actually pay popular curators to give them good reviews. Such as IGN, every review from them is perfect ""9/10 best shooter of the year"" ""most innovative shooter ever made, 8/10"" does that not seem mysterious to anyone?If you want to watch a non-bribed honest and hilarious reviewer then watch Mack From worth a buy:https://www.youtube.com/user/worthabuyguys?gl=CA Its the same game everytime with the same squeaker camping, un-skillful and unfun game as the last one. every game is rated M by the ESRB but really this is for 5 year olds.

												Pros:+ Good story with emphasis on the threats of our time.+ A strong atmosphere is set from the beginning with the intro mission and cut scenes.+ Great character build. Cpt. Price and the villains are very memorable.+ Weapons feel superior and powerful. You don't have to empty a whole clip into an enemy's face like in CoD2 to bring him down.+ The environments where the missions take place help to enhance the feeling of modern day warfare.+ Lot's of replay value.+ Tactical approach is supported instead of going in guns blazing.Cons:- The game's extremely short, the credits came up when I thought I was a quarter through.In general:Video games have it easy depicting modern day asymmetrical conflicts compared to historical battle arrangements. These in-and-out missions with a small number of participants involved go well with the 'one man army' concept that video games are bound to. I hated CoD 2 for that reason. World War 2 was anything but a place for a 'one man army'. It was quite the opposite, there were statistics on how many tens of thousands of men would be needed to advance 3-4 miles in Battle of Normandy and likewise. The gore, the confusion and the feeling of being overwhelmed were just not present in CoD 2. The feeling of having the upper hand on the battlefield feels just right in CoD4: Modern Warfare because the way wars are fought has changed.			"

												This game has probably the best multiplayer out of all the other CoD games because of two things:Mods.Dedicated Servers....okay that said you should just pick up this one for it's multipalyer...]""BUT WHAT ABOUT DA CAMPAIN SURR?""Okay, if you actually give a sh!t about the campain, it's okay I guess. If you're a lazy f**k and just want to play multiplayer but don't wanna do the campain. Scroll down. The games starts you off with some borderline autistic charcter named Soap. The reason I say this is because Soap says nothing of value. Soap contributes as much plot as Speedwagon, he stands in the background awkwardly and does what he is told to do. Oh, and you are british I guess. You also have some guy named ""Gas"", who is named this because he farts alot.There's also some bearded guy with a gay hat named ""Price"", he yells at you by saying ""Soap you muppet, do this or something...I don't know."" you do some training and after being horrible and called a♥♥♥♥♥ Price says you're ready to go.You go onto a ship to check out whats on board, and then murder everyone for British pride. But then you find out ""OH MY GOD PRICE A BOMB!"", so as you start getting the f**k out of dodge, a plane says ""HI HONEY I'M HOME FOR A IMPORTANT PLOT MOMENT OF BLACK SCREENS AND DISORIENTATION! DID YOU ALSO ASKED FOR A 'RUN TO THE FINISH IN A CERTAIN AMMOUNT OF TIME MOMENT?"", as this happens, you hear some SAS bloke scream ""JUMP FOR IT!"", which is stupid, where am I jumping to exactly? The oceam? The Helicopter? This game never bothers to tell you so you just assume you jump to the heli.MEANWHILE, you go into the vision of some autistic quiet President named Obam-wait, sorry my bad, ""Yasir Al-Fulani"". This bloke goes through a silky smoth 30FPS level of seeing his country go to♥♥♥♥♥♥or something, also you see some♥♥♥♥♥in a blue jacket who is SPOILERS:Important late game, you starting to see a patern here?

Your chopper gets shot down and you go do stuff, and there's an AC-130 segment, everyone thought it was cool but it was really just a drawn out turret segment.MEANWHILE AGAIN!You go back to Paul Jackson and shoot some more stuff and then you go to ""WHO KNOWS"" and shoot at some more stuff with the ""SHOOT STUFF UP"" brigade. Theres also some chick pilot you save I guess, not a good waifu though.Oh yeah and then theres a nuclear explosion and Paul dies from radiation because everyone is a casual scrub that dies to exploisions.Meanwhile with the Brits, Nikolai says some stuff about where Al-Asad is and then you go and shoot him a bunch, but THEN Price gets some phonecall n Al's phone and says ""THAT BLOKE THAT CALLED ME WAS IMRAN ZAKHAEV!""So now we go throught he boulvard of broken dreams with flashbacks where we play as Price and some other autistic sniper bloke. You both shoot at a bunch of things and then shoot Zakhaev. *NOW I DON'T F**KING CARE WHAT YOU SAY, HE SHOULD HAVE DIED. HE LOST AN ARM, AND WAS BLEEDING EVERYWHERE. AND WAS SHOT BY A F**KING 50 CAL. NOBODY SHOULD EVER SURVIVE THAT AND THIS GAME'S LOGIC IS FLAWED.*Rant aside, Sniper bloke gets hurt and you go through a spooky mission with dogs. The end there.So now we are back with the SAS blokes who get shot at a bunch but get away because PLOT.And then we see the Black dude from the USMC come back, and now it's a Joint Op with USMC and SAS blokes, making it the ""SLIGHTLY QUIET BUT AT THE SAME TIME LOUD BLOKES THAT BLOW STUFF UP"" brigade.So in this next level called ""The Sins of the Father"", (No i'm not making a joke it's litterally called that.)You go to some base and cross dress as russian Prostitues to lure in Zakhaev's son. So he comes along and says ""YO GIMMIE DA PUSSI BOSS!"", but Gas says ""NAW BOSS YOU UNDER ARREST!"" and then Zakhaev's son in the gool ol' Japanese anime style fassion, shoots himself in the head....yeah there's no sugar coating there, he litterally just shoots himself. And then Zakhaev gets edgy about it and starts cutting himself to Linkin Park and Three Days Of Grace.You then find out ""OH NOES! ZAKHAEV IS LAUNCHIN' NUKES!""So you go to the power station and Black Man gets captured, so you save Black Man and then walk around a bit and then OH MY JESUS CHRIST WTF!Yeah Zakhaev launches nukes.So you go in and start shooting at some ruskies and then you go inside the launch facility and then you find out OH HEY ZAKHAEV IS OVER THERE!So you race away and then get shot at by some helicopters who were related to Mr. Plot Plane from the begining of the game, and then you get horribly rekt because a bunch of SAS operators can't drive worth crap. A helicopter ""SWHOSHES IN"" and takes you all out. So heres what happens...Black guy dies first.Gas gets shot in the head/spine IDFK.Price throws a 1911 at you and says ""SHOOT THEM YOU MUPPET!""And then you kill russian man Zakhaev.Also remeber the guy from the begining of the game I said would be important some how? Yeah the resistance leader says ""YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT COMMRADE! 99 BOTTLE OF VODKA ON THE WALL!""And then you get pulled away too space.THE END.  	tl;dr RUSSIANS, NUKES, AMERICA F**K YEAH, SAS BEST UNIT, KILL RUSSIAN MAN BLOKE.In all honesty, this story made more sense then all the other CoD games, so you should try out the story for ""sh*ts"" and giggles.Also theres a in-game cheat that turns on ""Classic style"" which speeds up the game a little and plays fancy music over everything.2/-1 It's okay.And probably the only good CoD game there will ever be for the rest of time.

												This game has probably the best multiplayer out of all the other CoD games because of two things:Mods.Dedicated Servers....okay that said you should just pick up this one for it's multipalyer...]""BUT WHAT ABOUT DA CAMPAIN SURR?""Okay, if you actually give a sh!t about the campain, it's okay I guess. If you're a lazy f**k and just want to play multiplayer but don't wanna do the campain. Scroll down. The games starts you off with some borderline autistic charcter named Soap. The reason I say this is because Soap says nothing of value. Soap contributes as much plot as Speedwagon, he stands in the background awkwardly and does what he is told to do. Oh, and you are british I guess. You also have some guy named ""Gas"", who is named this because he farts alot.There's also some bearded guy with a gay hat named ""Price"", he yells at you by saying ""Soap you muppet, do this or something...I don't know."" you do some training and after being horrible and called a♥♥♥♥♥ Price says you're ready to go.You go onto a ship to check out whats on board, and then murder everyone for British pride. But then you find out ""OH MY GOD PRICE A BOMB!"", so as you start getting the f**k out of dodge, a plane says ""HI HONEY I'M HOME FOR A IMPORTANT PLOT MOMENT OF BLACK SCREENS AND DISORIENTATION! DID YOU ALSO ASKED FOR A 'RUN TO THE FINISH IN A CERTAIN AMMOUNT OF TIME MOMENT?"", as this happens, you hear some SAS bloke scream ""JUMP FOR IT!"", which is stupid, where am I jumping to exactly? The oceam? The Helicopter? This game never bothers to tell you so you just assume you jump to the heli.MEANWHILE, you go into the vision of some autistic quiet President named Obam-wait, sorry my bad, ""Yasir Al-Fulani"". This bloke goes through a silky smoth 30FPS level of seeing his country go to♥♥♥♥♥♥or something, also you see some♥♥♥♥♥in a blue jacket who is SPOILERS:Important late game, you starting to see a patern here? Oh, and Fulani gets shot in the face by some weeb named Khaled Al-Asad, who also happens to have a anime collection. Oh and he also has some golden Deagle, this made all the 12 year old boys go like ""WHOAAAAA THAT DEAGLE SHOT WAS SO REALISTIC! AND HE ALSO HAD IT GOLD IT'S SOOOOO COOL!"" I'm surprised he didn't miss that shot, the gold plating, holding the deagle with one hand, and trying to aim with sh!ty sunglasses should have made him miss his first shot.So now you go back to Soap and go to some place in russia or something to find some bloke that I forgot the name of, I think he's some resistance leader, also SPOILERS HE'S TOTS IMPORTANT AT THE END OF THE GAME XDDDDDDSpeaking of important charcters that will appear in either the ""ending"" or ""next game"", we meet NIKOLAI!

												I've just beaten the game, My thoughts so far: this game is awesome. The gameplay is dynamic. There's no way to stop moving or shooting. You will always face an enemy.What's more, it's full of checkpoints, so that you don't repeat your actions again and again. Be aware: for this reason, the game is quite short. But that's not a problem: the game follows a story, and there's no reason to extend it.That's what SP has to offer.In my opinion, the MP is not good like SP: it's all about running and shooting. There's no ""feel"" in it.If you're only interested in MP, don't buy it.Otherwise, do it. The game will offer you plenty of fun.			"

												When you think of makes a good FPS game, you must look at the past.  Call of Duty 4 aka Cod 4 was my frist ever FPS i picked up back in 2007.  I feel in love with game game as soon as i loaded up the first level of the campaign.  The missions were so much fun and i always made sure to get each piece of intel on each mission.  It gave me a purpose to play the campaign becasue i wanted to see hoe clever the Dev's could be at hiding their locations.  Multiplayer: I have no words to describe how good & balanced the online realm is.  All guns feel super strong and i feel like im doing a lot of damage with each shot i take.  This game has been out for 9 years and i still come back to it each day i can.  That says a lot about a game when you still have the drive to play it after so long.  I would highly reccommend this game to anybody who wants to experience a truly good FPS.			"

												I should preface this with the admittance that I am not a fan of First Person Shooters.  I played the original Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games before the franchises became more focused on special effects, shock value, and multiplayer than they were about storylines; but I had a falling out with the story when $60 games couldn't be expected to offer any more than three hours of enjoyment outside of dealing with the horde of snotty kids online.I did, however, play through Modern Warfare 1 and 2 as they went on sale, and I was thoroughly impressed.  As you can expect just by looking at the store page, the game is visually stunning.  What you don't see, however, is the storylines (plural) that you follow as Army Rangers and Spec Ops fight to ensure America's continued global dominance amidst emerging threats (MW 1) and to ensure America's survival as all hell breaks loose (MW 2).  While the single player game is challenging (frustratingly so on some parts), the story line only gives you about 5 - 6 hours of gameplay and doesn't offer any outside-of-story single player enjoyability as you would see in Modern Warfare 2.All in all, I'd give the game an 6/10.

												The definitive version of the Call of Duty series by far. Pre-set killstreaks, User-made lobbies, mod support, and no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Me and a gaming friend once went into a lobby where we were told off when we jump and shoot'd. Though the rule was extremely silly we both had a solid laugh at the situation.I got kicked from that server after my gaming friend accused me of jump-shooting for the eighth time or something. We were on a ship, it was raining, the floor was slippery, and they were probably just worried for my well being; a truely lovely community.			"

												By this point, Call of Duty as a series has been over-rated and totally blown out of proportion. Yet after all that, it only takes a few minutes in COD4's single or multiplayer to remember what made the series so popular in the first place. To skip what is objectively the best multiplayer game of its decade just because of some misplaced praise would be a true shame.			"

												Still the best first person shooter around. It had everything, it was set in the present (instead of the now boring WWII scenarios), had a great, really great, story, all kinds of different missions (sniper, plane and vehicle for example) and it played wonderfully. The story just sucked you right in, the graphics looked awesome and realistic. And it didn't matter that it was short; it had non-stop action; there was not one boring moment in the entire game. Add to that the multiplayer that really did some new stuff as well, and there you go, the best FPS still around. Games don't get much better than this.[Rating: 97/100]			"

CoD 4 did so much for the FPS genre, really putting the genre in the limelight and this game still holds up after all these years, even more so than the newer releases in the series.

												Campaign: Loved it. I liked the parts in it where you had to just snipe and nothing else. I just wish it was longer than it was. 10/10Multiplayer: Sweet baby Jesus, it could not get any worse. The hackers were in almost every lobby. After a while of getting destroyed by hackers, the match gets repetitive and you're just thinking ""oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god, just let this end already"". Literally would give the multiplayer 1/10 or 2/10 top. So really overall if you just play CoD for the multiplayer, which a lot of people do, then do not even think of getting the game. But if you are planning just to do the campaign and leave multiplayer alone, then I would definately recommend it. I like playing multiplayer a lot so I do not recommend it.			"

Almost like halo with Easy & Legendary. Recruit: If your too scared of dying you start with this. ""Laugh as slow AI try try to take you down with much fire power but instead you kill them quicker, except let's not forget you take less damage""Regular: Unlike recruit you take normal damage and its still a bit easy also. ""Your skills will be tested against AI with programed tasks of taking you down""Hardened: Now it begins to get harder, on hardened enemies have increased health and bullet damage is heavier. ""Hardened is like Heroic, the AI will behave a bit more skillfully and different strategies must be used. Examples are headshots and using your flash bangs and grenades carefully.""Veteran: If your ready to rip your hair off for each time. Then be prepared to order your hair regrowing sample kit. Haha I'm kidding. Veteran is the highest difficulty and the most insane that some players have a hard time passing the first level on it. ""Face death over and over as enemy AI have double health, double damage and move in different patterns"" I do suggest you work your way up with the difficulties and try to do headshots on veteran, it does kill the AI quicker.

												First of all, this game is fun, no doubt, but there's glaring issues.Problem 1: Setup. You have to jump through hoops to get punkbuster goingProblem 2: Punkbuster is only enabled on a few servers which kick you for not having proper FOV.Problem 3: Still kicked after adjusting FOV but doesn't say why.Problem 4: Joining non-punkbuster server will always have a hacker.Problem 5: Hacker tools > Server admin toolsProblem 6: Spent money on the game and the game is useless.Maybe remastered version will be good?

												Call of duty Modern Warfare was the forgotten start to the modern warfare series and did have the best campaign. It will throw your feelings around, make you sweat, and even keep you thinking what you could have done better. The easiest difficulty is even hard at some parts where death is possible if 1 wrong move is made. I have played through every difficulty and The top difficulty is nothing short from gritty realism. 2 shot deaths. Wind changes, less speed, more enemies. OVerall this game I give my thumbs up.			"

												Started playing this game in late 2008 on the 360. It is and always will be, my favourite FPS. From the way almost every gun feels to dying 3 times to the same airstrike. I absoloutly love COD4. Nowadays its just for fun although the haydays of competitive back in 2009 will always be in my heart. If you enjoy FPS's and you hate the COD franchise : please, please, please, give this game a chance. This is where it all began for me and this is where it will end. REGENISIS!!! - on a side note, plant a tree. It really is one of the most productive things you can do for this world. Keep it classy my friends and goodnight. ~~  FⒶll in L❤ve, not in line			"

												    Greatest COD ever, well at least in my opinion. This is a classic COD ( Call of Duty ) with an outstanding and interesting campaign. It also has a very fun multiplayer where you can play the game as it was intended or, you can play around with the awesome mods such as, Paintball, Hide and Seek, Prop Hunt, and my favorite Deathrun, and there are tons more. In conclusion, this a 10 out 10 game that I recomend for anyone who wants to play some Classic Call of Duty. This game cost less than half of what COD:Ghost cost and its 100 times better. If you got money BUY IT!!!!!!!!                                        Thanks for reading, Your Cure.			"

There are great mods such as Rotu (Reign of the undead), Hide and Seek (prophunt), paintball and many more. This game is good, but it's a shame it costs so much on Steam.

												What the hell kind of name is Soap!???Following on from the successful Call of Duty 2, developer Infinity Ward moves to modern warfare with Call of Duty 4. Story: Modern Warfare starts off normally enough, with the opening mission guiding the player through a training session involving firearm use as well as general movement of the character. However, once we hit the second mission things start to get interesting. It involves a SAS soldier by the name of John ""Soap"" MacTavish who is after a package on a Estonian Freighter. This mission is tense, exciting and memorable and sets the tone for the rest of the missions in the game. The pacing of the story is superb and never do you feel at any point that the campaign is boring to play through or lacks variety. Each mission is designed expertly and contains memorable characters, level design and scenarios. The story was easy to follow and is the start of the Modern Warfare storyline.Graphics: The game has started to show its age and rightfully so, as it was released a full decade ago. Textures look muddy by today's standards and there is not much detail in the character models, vehicles and weapons. They all look pretty basic. As a result, it would be difficult for this generation of gamers to completely immerse into the experience and they may not enjoy the game as much.Sound: Gunfire, soldier's screams and the whir of vehicles are captured accurately and sound authentic. You really do feel like you are in the midst of a battlefield when these sounds effects go off and credit to Infinity Ward for having excellent sound designers. The voice acting is also superb. Each voice actor brings an authentic performance to the table which allows the personalities of the characters such as Captain Price to shine as well as depicting emotion well.Gameplay: The gameplay of Call of Duty 4 has set the benchmark for all other FPS games to follow. It is fast, frenetic and highly addictive. Controls are tight and it feels very smooth to move your character around the level and aiming is easy to accomplish and highly accurate. It often feels very satisfying to land a kill may it be in the single-player campaign or multiplayer. In regards to multiplayer, it is still active to this day and at any given hour you should be able to enter a server filled with people and play.In summary, Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare is an outstanding first-person shooter game. It has redefined the modern FPS and its formula of having blockbuster action set-pieces and zippy gameplay has been copied over and over again. It is a must-play for any gamer.9/10.			"

												At this point in time the graphics look dated compared to what they were in 2007. That being said this game is a console port, so it was never meant to look amazing. It's just as fun as when it came on on the single player side. Multiplayer has all but died off much like Chernobyl. It's hard to no recommend this game being that it changed the FPS genre completely. Modern shooters today are what they are because of what this game accomplished. When COD4 was released it was a shining light of what the future would hold, unfortunately the franchise became a cash money grab and filled and filled with run and gun mechanics. If you want a game with a decent story, good shooting mechanics this is it. But don't be surprised when you're not rewarded for using tactics, this isn't Counter Striker after all.			"

												Wow... This is where it all began people. No stupid overpowered 1-hit-kill pistol shot to the foot known as GHOSTS, but a real FPS at its origins,The campaign is by far the best one in the entire CoD franchise. There's good pacing, ♥♥♥♥ing excellent stand out moments and you don't spend every mission shooting foreigners who don't deserve it.The multiplayer is...broken. Well, it is somewhat fixable, but you shouldn't have to wave through 50 google searches to fix the problems. The first problem is punkbuster, the anti cheat. It's not being updated anymore so some people have to upadte it manually. Servers don't show up unless you spend 10 minutes replacing some random DLL file. I can't join ANY of the servers without getting kicked, so I have to use GameTracker to find a server that works for me!Currently the only server I can even use properly is Europe Cracked (Which you can find on Gametracker.com/cod4 google it) And it's 24/7 TDM. The game is awesome, but I recommend buying the Retail Version (I heard it's not as buggy as this version.The Cod franchise died with MW3. Rest in piece, you will always be remembered.			"

												To start off this is a great game. Didn't take me long at all to realise that. I have not played campaign yet so im not gonna say anything about that. To be honest I was supprised. There are not many cheaters. Why? Because this games multiplayer has dedicated servers so admins will ban cheaters. This is a great thing and I wish every call of duty had this because it would make the game last longer and make it a better multiplayer experience for everyone. Im getting off topic but Cod4 has many players on everyday that i've found day or night. As said before not many cheaters also different gamemodes to choose from. If you are thinking about buying this game I would suggest you do because its worth it.			"

												This is the game that revolutionized an entire franchise, and even perhaps an entire genre. Whether or not Modern Warfare has done so for the better is debatable, but make no mistake that this entry Call of Duty has had an enormous impact on the games we play today.On the single player side, Modern Warfare offers nothing more than a generic plot with repetitive gameplay elements. You hide in cover and eliminate waves of enemies. There are a few spectacular set pieces, but not enough to have me praise the campaign whole heartedly.The multiplayer is a fast paced, adrenaline pumping, and solid first person shooter. Every key stroke translates into an immediate reaction. Immediately gunning down foes with a few clicks is undoubtedly satisfying. The only downsides are the kill streaks which reward good players, putting casual players at a disadvantage and the swiftness of your demise.As a game which style is now heavily borrowed by others, Modern Warfare is worth a look.Grade: B			"

												At this point in time the graphics look dated compared to what they were in 2007. That being said this game is a console port, so it was never meant to look amazing. It's just as fun as when it came on on the single player side. Multiplayer has all but died off much like Chernobyl. It's hard to no recommend this game being that it changed the FPS genre completely. Modern shooters today are what they are because of what this game accomplished. When COD4 was released it was a shining light of what the future would hold, unfortunately the franchise became a cash money grab and filled and filled with run and gun mechanics. If you want a game with a decent story, good shooting mechanics this is it. But don't be surprised when you're not rewarded for using tactics, this isn't Counter Striker after all.			"

I absoloutly love COD4. Nowadays its just for fun although the haydays of competitive back in 2009 will always be in my heart. If you enjoy FPS's and you hate the COD franchise : please, please, please, give this game a chance. This is where it all began for me and this is where it will end.

												Call of duty Modern Warfare was the forgotten start to the modern warfare series and did have the best campaign. It will throw your feelings around, make you sweat, and even keep you thinking what you could have done better. The easiest difficulty is even hard at some parts where death is possible if 1 wrong move is made. I have played through every difficulty and The top difficulty is nothing short from gritty realism. 2 shot deaths. Wind changes, less speed, more enemies. OVerall this game I give my thumbs up.			"

												CoD4: Modern Warfare, the release that showed the hieght of the Call of Duty series' prowess. Absolutely excellent storytelling, suprising-as-hell twists that really manages to leave you feeling like you've been punched in the stomach (in a good way) and a multiplayer that was great and open to modding.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the top of the tri-angle and for good reason. It is the first of the series to implement kill-streaks without going over-the-top, it is also the last of the Infinity Ward games that provides a believable and compelling story that gives you the proper highs and lows rather than just simply pumping you up over and over.CoD4's story is the closest you get to a military ""drama"" in that it properly uses the highs and lows of successes and failures. It has one of the most believable stories of the series while mantaining the fresh coat of ""modern"".			"

												I used to be a lonely console peasant and I owned cod4 back then loved it! got it for PC and I was expecting it to be filled with a few problems like every COD game (not as much as the new ones though) but like every cod game all the players just sat in corners with SMGs on hardcore and I realised that it's not so much the players fault for sitting in those corners as it is the games fault for allowing that play style to have existed in what is essentially an arcade shooter. I look through most of the COD games and see they all have the same fault, they don't punish players for having a lack of skill they just throw them laser beam accurate weapons to the 12 year old kids and huge middle fingers to anyone else.

												Started playing this game in late 2008 on the 360. It is and always will be, my favourite FPS. From the way almost every gun feels to dying 3 times to the same airstrike. I absoloutly love COD4. Nowadays its just for fun although the haydays of competitive back in 2009 will always be in my heart. If you enjoy FPS's and you hate the COD franchise : please, please, please, give this game a chance. This is where it all began for me and this is where it will end. REGENISIS!!! - on a side note, plant a tree. It really is one of the most productive things you can do for this world. Keep it classy my friends and goodnight. ~~  FⒶll in L❤ve, not in line			"

												Single player review:Decent game, the usual ""shoot them up"". Not much replayability value, so get it cheap. Liked:Some of the acting was surprisingly good.Disliked:Cheats. As in, they make it insanely annoying to try to use them in single player mode. Listen, I've gone through the game several times, now I just want to screw around a bit. It's my game, on my computer, I'm not trying to cheat in multiplayer (there's enough others doing that, damned if I'm going to play with them in the first place).Yes, I can get most of the cheats to work. God mode, ignore ammo usage, etc. Then, suddenly, the game just disables it and cheats stop working. In the middle of a battle (usually at some sort of transition). Attempting to re-enable the cheats fails, game just ignores the commands.  Very, very annoying, and limited the replay for me even more.I'd recommend it, but get the game really, really cheap, because you won't be playing it very long if, like me, you aren't a fan of multiplayer.

												I used to be a lonely console peasant and I owned cod4 back then loved it! got it for PC and I was expecting it to be filled with a few problems like every COD game (not as much as the new ones though) but like every cod game all the players just sat in corners with SMGs on hardcore and I realised that it's not so much the players fault for sitting in those corners as it is the games fault for allowing that play style to have existed in what is essentially an arcade shooter. I look through most of the COD games and see they all have the same fault, they don't punish players for having a lack of skill they just throw them laser beam accurate weapons to the 12 year old kids and huge middle fingers to anyone else.

												Single player review:Decent game, the usual ""shoot them up"". Not much replayability value, so get it cheap. Liked:Some of the acting was surprisingly good.Disliked:Cheats. As in, they make it insanely annoying to try to use them in single player mode. Listen, I've gone through the game several times, now I just want to screw around a bit. It's my game, on my computer, I'm not trying to cheat in multiplayer (there's enough others doing that, damned if I'm going to play with them in the first place).Yes, I can get most of the cheats to work. God mode, ignore ammo usage, etc. Then, suddenly, the game just disables it and cheats stop working. In the middle of a battle (usually at some sort of transition). Attempting to re-enable the cheats fails, game just ignores the commands.  Very, very annoying, and limited the replay for me even more.I'd recommend it, but get the game really, really cheap, because you won't be playing it very long if, like me, you aren't a fan of multiplayer.

												Wow... This is where it all began people. No stupid overpowered 1-hit-kill pistol shot to the foot known as GHOSTS, but a real FPS at its origins,The campaign is by far the best one in the entire CoD franchise. There's good pacing, ♥♥♥♥ing excellent stand out moments and you don't spend every mission shooting foreigners who don't deserve it.The multiplayer is...broken. Well, it is somewhat fixable, but you shouldn't have to wave through 50 google searches to fix the problems. The first problem is punkbuster, the anti cheat. It's not being updated anymore so some people have to upadte it manually. Servers don't show up unless you spend 10 minutes replacing some random DLL file. I can't join ANY of the servers without getting kicked, so I have to use GameTracker to find a server that works for me!Currently the only server I can even use properly is Europe Cracked (Which you can find on Gametracker.com/cod4 google it) And it's 24/7 TDM. The game is awesome, but I recommend buying the Retail Version (I heard it's not as buggy as this version.The Cod franchise died with MW3. Rest in piece, you will always be remembered.			"

												This game has a multiplayer mode and singleplayer. The singleplayer is good fun and can be quite cultivating, although lacks strong replay value. The multiplayer, where the focus of attention is, has unfortunately reached a state of decay. Unfortunately, nowadays, the only things you'll find are 24/7 Crossfire/Killhouse, some absurd zombie mod, or some terrible custom map that only allows for usage of the M40A3 sniper rifle. These are not of enjoyment, and it's unlikely a recovery will be made any time soon.6/10, was noticably better 10 years ago			"

												Call of Duty 4 is an amazing game, the campaign is as fun as can be. If you're looking to replay the campaign and enjoy the nostalgia, or have another chance at playing the legendary mission, ""All Ghillied Up"", then I have to recommend this game.HOWEVER, if you want to experince the greatness that was CoD 4 multiplayer, then I have some terrible news for you, don't even buy the game if thats your intention. Nearly every single multiplayer server is modded in some way, and makes every gun kill you in one shot, or completely changes the experince, because apperantly, modding the ♥♥♥♥ing game to obilvion is more fun than playing the original game. All of these modded servers ruin the experince. Of course this wouldn't be a problem if there were servers that were not modded, but thats not the case, nearly all of the servers are modded. The fact that so many people have modded nearly all of the multiplayer servers has ruined the whole nostalgic experince for me, and its very frustrating. Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game if you want to play the multiplayer, because you'll get nothing but a bunch pointless mods that make playing matches utterly unenjoyable. If you like mods, then go for it. And if you see anyone in the Positive Review section for this game telling you that the game is balanced and fun to play, they're lying to you, and have obviously not played multiplayer for more than 2 minutes.

												Ok, lets get started. (WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD)Pros: Almost no hackers in multiplayer.         Single player has a good enough story.         It's at least better than infinite warfare.         It has close-to-realistic physics. Cons: The sniper rifles do not kill within one hit in multiplayer. I have hit people in the head and they dont die.          In singleplayer, you are almost always spotted in the stealth missions. Especially in ""All Ghillied Up"".          Annoying teams where the enemy sets all their C4 in a corner.          Almost all maps are made like they are for the sniper. I swear, every corner you go to, there is a camping sniper with the M21 ready to hip fire and spray your a$$.          That one guy on your team that flashes you untill you die. (Im talking about that perk that lets you have multiple grenades)Ok, there may be more cons than pros, but somehow, the game is still good and addicting. "

												Ok, lets get started. (WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD)Pros: Almost no hackers in multiplayer.         Single player has a good enough story.         It's at least better than infinite warfare.         It has close-to-realistic physics. Cons: The sniper rifles do not kill within one hit in multiplayer. I have hit people in the head and they dont die.          In singleplayer, you are almost always spotted in the stealth missions. Especially in ""All Ghillied Up"".          Annoying teams where the enemy sets all their C4 in a corner.          Almost all maps are made like they are for the sniper. I swear, every corner you go to, there is a camping sniper with the M21 ready to hip fire and spray your a$$.          That one guy on your team that flashes you untill you die. (Im talking about that perk that lets you have multiple grenades)Ok, there may be more cons than pros, but somehow, the game is still good and addicting. "

												Easily the best Call of Duty game ever made, and well qualified to be one of the best mutliplayer experiences ever, CoD4 has sucked over 25 days of my team before I ever got the game on steam. Even now, qualified and well run servers provide a platform for multiplayer gameplay unrivaled by many, so don't think this game is dead just yet. Not that the game is all multiplayer, the campaign is more than adequate in its own regard. This the game that ushered me into the competitive mutliplayer world, and for anyone who wants to see Call of Duty at its best, this game cannot be ignored.			"

												FPS Perfected. It would not be a stretch to say that CoD’s initial try at a modern FPS not only set the groundwork for how big the franchise is today, but has also inspired the genre to be as big and as multi-player focused as it now is. Out of all the games on the 50% off list, this will be the one you’ll least regret. From a single-player standpoint, IW finally stuck to telling a single narrative and it worked. It was the first game that, to me, felt like a purposeful story. Characters were made to appear more personable, but don’t really stand out until later on in the franchise. Team AI hardly got in the way while also being useful, and enemy AI was firm but fair. Although it would be unfair for me to criticize the game for its monotony in killing hordes of enemies, it would have been nice to be able to do so in more creative fashions (i.e. more AC-130-like levels and levels that required more driving or stragegy). Luckily, this is expanded upon in the franchise and was still more than I could have ever asked for out of a game that’s almost 10 years old. But the obvious winner and the main reason why this game has more players on it than the latest installment of the franchise (Infinite Warfare(IW)) comes down to its multiplayer. Nostalgia aside, the maps, weapons, and well-designed perk systems still hold up and are emulated in your most cherished FPS. The challenge systems for weapon attachments and XP were also a nice touch, including the implementation of camos and golden weapons. Even though the graphics aren’t on par with today’s titles, there’s still enough content in there to keep you engaged. It just bites that the prestige system was only on console systems and the latest remaster - but I still won’t give in to that darn cash grab with IW. Whether you buy it to relive the glory days, or you’re buying it to see what a genre-defining FPS is like - there’s no reason to not have this title in your library.			"

												I did not bother with the single player campaign as I finished it on console already. I bought this because I refuse to pay 60 bux for the other cod games  which are old as F now!  (looking at you  $60 black ops 2)Great game on pc with large numbers of people playing in a single game, I only found a few servers worth playing on though. Punkbuster issues for some servers with no fixes working for me. Overall I think i'd rather pay 3 bux for it used on xbox 360 and at least play with friends here in this country.

												This will be my review for the three call of duty modern warfare game.Those game single player campaign can each be finished in less than 10 hours, unless those game are on sales dont buy them solely for single player, not because sp is bad but just because it short.The multiplayer will be great as long as there will be player for them. Modified my review based on a comment i got not long ago, seem like when i checked multiplayer server it just so happened to be at a bad time, seemed dead back then but it does not now.			"

												I always enjoyed Call of Duty games, though to be all honest, I only play them for the single player... Why? Because the storyline has always been great and very wonderful. The single player storyline of this was very excellent.The multiplayer was kinda eh... Like it is Counter Strike like which is great but I dislike the idea that i must ""farm"" my levels to get unlocks. Not to mention the kill streak rewards... Oh  and anther thing, if you dislike a weapon, espeically a weapon that someone is good at(Such as a grenade launcher/Sniper). Suck it up butter cup because the more you rage the more  they will camp... Cause I sure had fun pitching up a tent and sitting there.Either way 10/10, been too long since I played this game but I enjoyed it immensely, I should replay the storyline again it was great.			"

												This game is what people say turned the call of duty franchise around forever and I will be talking about what it did wright and what it did wrong.Cons- Everyone is rank 55 so if you have the balls to go up against these guys you're in for a fight- Everyone runs around with AK's, MP5's and M4's so if you are low on ammo and don't like these guns then good luckPros- The campaign is incredible and you should definatley play it if you want to because there is the best level in call of duty in my opinion- Not everybody runs around with noob tubes (under mounted grenade launchers) which makes it acually playable- Not all of the good guns are locked to higher levels so you won't have to wait to rank 3000 to get a good gun (the level cap is 55, I was exaggerating)- The gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to understand and the controls are pretty simple- There are no overpowered killstreaks because the game only has 3 so you don't have to worry about some guy destroying your team with pavelows and harriers- It has dedicated servers so you don't have to wait for 5 minutes while trying to find a game and a bonus is that you can have up to 50 people in the game at any point which makes some amazing games that you will remember.- If you don't like the built in modes there are some pretty cool mods that you should try out like a cool zombies mode and freeze tag.sorry for any bad grammer or spelling			"

												One of the finest Call Of duty campaigns. Some of the levels feel a little badly designed, such as the mission in which your supposed to fight your way down through a village to reach extraction when it's quicker to run through them all and wait for your team mates to catch up but for the most part its excellent. I especially like the main focus on the SAS and that first mission aboard the ship is one of my favourite in CoD history. The game also features one of the best final levels in a game.This is also the first part of the modern Captain Price trilogy, one of my favourite game characters.			"

												FPS Perfected. It would not be a stretch to say that CoD’s initial try at a modern FPS not only set the groundwork for how big the franchise is today, but has also inspired the genre to be as big and as multi-player focused as it now is. Out of all the games on the 50% off list, this will be the one you’ll least regret. From a single-player standpoint, IW finally stuck to telling a single narrative and it worked. It was the first game that, to me, felt like a purposeful story. Characters were made to appear more personable, but don’t really stand out until later on in the franchise. Team AI hardly got in the way while also being useful, and enemy AI was firm but fair. Although it would be unfair for me to criticize the game for its monotony in killing hordes of enemies, it would have been nice to be able to do so in more creative fashions (i.e. more AC-130-like levels and levels that required more driving or stragegy). Luckily, this is expanded upon in the franchise and was still more than I could have ever asked for out of a game that’s almost 10 years old. But the obvious winner and the main reason why this game has more players on it than the latest installment of the franchise (Infinite Warfare(IW)) comes down to its multiplayer. Nostalgia aside, the maps, weapons, and well-designed perk systems still hold up and are emulated in your most cherished FPS. The challenge systems for weapon attachments and XP were also a nice touch, including the implementation of camos and golden weapons. Even though the graphics aren’t on par with today’s titles, there’s still enough content in there to keep you engaged. It just bites that the prestige system was only on console systems and the latest remaster - but I still won’t give in to that darn cash grab with IW. Whether you buy it to relive the glory days, or you’re buying it to see what a genre-defining FPS is like - there’s no reason to not have this title in your library.			"

												It has its moments. The Call of Duty series from 3 and onward had started to become a fairly straight line, with some things to pick up on the way. The series now seems to 'innovate' by the means of inventing a new game mechanic and only using it for a couple levels, never deviating from the Call of Duty formula of straight line run and gun with cinematic moments. This game was the one that did it right before the ones after it screwed it all up. The cinematics don't completely run your game, should you mess up it's your fault, which is a refreshing change if you've played the more recent Call of Duty games before this one like me. Would I say this is a good game? Ehhhhh... would I say it's a good Call of Duty game? Yes, the best after 3; and if the franchise keeps going as it is, that might remain true forever.In summary, like mentioned above, it has its moments. I didn't feel like my hand was being held during the campaign, and that if I didn't keep close to my squad and work with them that I'd probably get myself or all of us killed. At the same time, the singleplayer doesn't have too much replayability due to its straight line cinematic nature, except to play those key moments in the game again. I'm not going to rate based on the multiplayer, because I haven't played it and I don't really intend to... and multiplayer in Call of Duty games is expected to be good. Given all the information and my own opinion, I recommend this game if you are a fan of Call of Duty and its later games after 3. If you don't really care too much for Call of Duty or never played it, but intend on trying to get in to it, I'd recommend this one for the campaign. It touches on some interesting points, utilizes cool ideas for levels, and despite the occasional hollywood moments, manages to bring a small feeling of actual modern warfare in some of its missions.

												Best Call of Duty released, ever. I loved the barebones essentials of both Multiplayer and Campaign mode. No WMD style perks in Multiplayer made a very fair skill gap between veteran players and newbies. Each weapon had it's advantages and faults where you wouldn't see common usage for just one of them. The story was amazing and blew my mind when I first played it, especially the sniper mission. The only downside to playing on PC is the amount of hackers that also play. The simplicity of downloading a hack makes it to where anyone can have them. Still nonetheless 10/10.			"

												I'm on the border of a negative review but I can't. The characters, the story, the gameplay, and the multiplayer all blended together to make one of my favorite fps games of all time (top 3). The only problem I found is that the punkbuster and multiplayer is by default out-dated and doesn't work. So I went through the steps to fix it and replaced the files and whatnot. But everytime I want to play multiplayer it just resets back and the servers don't show up. Its the server cache file that just never wants to work after the game has been put awayFor that reason, I am waiting for my refund and will return to mw1 on ps3			"

												50 thousands kiddies used to play this. Now they're all above their twenties.I still remember the day when I played MW1 for the first time. It was like the winter of '08 and my poor Radeon X1300 with it's ol' good friend P IV 3.0 Ghz provided me unique 30fps-on-minimal-settings experience but it was something special anyway. Almost 10 years passed on and I still do know where to lie on that freaking plain to pass ""All Ghilled Up"" misson on Veteran difficulty. I still can do a pretty nice kill streak with my fav' m40a3. There are the best memories of both multiplayer and singleplayer gaming in there and I have a couple of words to Infinity Ward and Activision as well after new Call Of Duty games: ""Mission Failed, We'll Get Em' Next Time"".

												This is hands down the best Call of Duty. Modern Warfare 2 was good as well but everything after that was horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ If it weren't for all the glitches, MW2 would be just as good as this one. Really the only bull♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game is Martyrdom and Juggernaut. Beyond that this is the most balanced and best mapped COD ever. If you are playing anything past MW2 then you are missing out.			"

												Call of Duty 4, a game that no one should ever disrepsect. Even after the 7 years (8 years in 3 days) the game is still hilariously fun to play, with friends or by yourself.         With all the mods like Death Run, Hide & Seek, etc. The game may not be the same as it was the 7 years ago that it was made, but it haas obtained more of the funny moments. Even though you can't searach the server list without seeing,""HIGHXP 300XP / KILL!"" it still has the fun aspect of that, you can mess around with your friends and randoms without having to bother about levels like you did on the consoles 7 years ago.         CoD:4 was the game that got me into gaming, and I still play it to this day! Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a game to be owned by all FPS players and all steam members, even if the PC you own cannot run it.			"

												This game provided me with some fun time and got me hooked until I've finished it: good cinematic scores, good story, good immersion.Game is stable in singleplayer, useless in multiplayer, and is not something I go back to replay. So, if you want a good singleplayer shooter with not a lot in replayability and a good story, this game is for you.			"

												It was once a good game, but now, only modded servers and stuff. Community hosted CoD servers are just BS. The amount of mods and stuff in the files, I don't know what to say. Some may like this how it is with so extremely modified XP rates and stuff, and then there is us that hate it.And the price.. Come on Activision. You still charge for this?! Even with Steam Sale going on, the pricetag is ridicuolous. I could pay 0,99€ for singleplayer, but then again, that isn't worth if you've already played through that so many times in your earlier years..We have to add PunkBuster files ourselves since PunkBuster removed this game from PunkBuster.. I don't even know if servers used PB or not while I played now. Felt like that wasn't the case with the amounts of people with 100+ kills and 5-10 deaths.			"

Visuals 10/10 : Excellent level design set in war-torn areas in the Middle-East and Eastern Europe. Even though this game was released in 2010 when run on max settings the textures look incredible. Soundtrack 8/10 : Great sound quality with a decent sountrack accompaniment.Gameplay 10/10 : Infinity Ward crafted an incredible balance of FPS game mechanics, and when experienced on a modern system is one of the smoothest shooters of its kind. The maps lend themselves to thoughtful firefights with an emphasis on teamwork.			"

												I highly recommend this game to players on all platforms. It may be one of the old Call of Dutys but many people still play it and it has a great campaign mode. Plus its availible for Mac. The Multiplayer os always loaded with people and you can host your own server with whatever you want. The best thing about this game is that it could probably work on any computer no matter how old. I play on the old Macbook and it runs 100%. Highly recommned this to any gamer.			"

												This is one of the only Call of Duty games I can live to respect. It was the first game of the incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ downfall. Call of Duty 4 has aged well, why? Well because all CoD games run off the same engine, so they all look the same. The gameplay? If you've ever played a CoD game after CoD3 (besides 4) then you know what the gameplay is like because they are all the same. ♥♥♥♥in hell, CoD could've been something great... But this was the start of the impending doom.Those lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

If you are going to purchase this game now, or in the near future, be sure that you know you purchased it for the campaign, and not for the multiplayer, because the multiplayer is filled with squeeky kids loaded up with hacks and mods, ready to annoy the crap out of you from your first match.

												Hands down the best Call of Duty game ever created. Incredible graphics, incredible story, incredible gameplay, innovative and revolutionary multiplayer. This game had it all and still does. When you play this game over again after playing all the new call of duties, you have to appreciate how a far more simple formula always makes for a better game. Infinity Ward/Treyarch needs to take a break and realize that they're losing their fans because of how overcomplicated they are making the series now.			"

												If I can appraise Call of Duty for one thing, I don't know how they do it, stll manage to stay relevant in gaming.Gameinformer magazine and IGN alike giving this game the absurd 10/10 ratio that it's recieved just baffles my thinking process every time. Campaign : Aim down the sight and shoot. Think of that and your plot basically forms itself. Mulitplayer : My God, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess. Even during the Xbox 360 era, the Multiplayer was barely functional. Somehow the PC version seems even less playable.Good luck getting a server to play on your side by not making you download ♥♥♥♥ing ANYTHING. Even if you filter the mods section completely ♥♥♥♥ing off in your Server search menu, guess what? You STILL have to download on the most random of ♥♥♥♥ing server picks, hell, even if you turn downloads OFF it still manages to make you continue to download!I can't detail in words the frustration that came from attempting to play this travesty. Also, Punkbuster is a complete failure, don't be shocked. Apart from needing a Master's Degree in Rocket Science to figure out what server won't ruin your day, you finally get to the Multiplayer. Now, just imagine for a second, that this is your first time in about 2-3 years playing a shooter game that uses the same formula. Now imagine coming back to the series, and spend money on it no less, and notice how annoyingly frustrating it is to spawn on a map that has Sniper towers galore, and add the absurd spawn points to the equation and what we have, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Attack Helicopters alike, is something I'd dislike having to refer to again as : The worst pain you've felt in your life multiplyed by cancer. If rating this game is a thing the rating I would give it is a Widest 1 cm puddle in the gaming industry / Drinking Cyanide.End drunk rant.			"

Hell no1.Over priced the game should be 10$ or even 5$ due to its age but no they still want 20$ for a almost unplayable game with zero support2. No more punkbuster support 3 .All moded servers 4.90% of the players or more are legit hackers thanks to punkbuster being gone 5. I couldn't find ANY servers that were there for people who had any type of skill...I use to be a in pro sniper clan and well you won't find any at all anymore sadly 6. 99% of the players i have seen these pass 2 years or so have been the type of @sshats who camp spawns with lmgs and marty and claymores you know the pathetic people who don't actually play the game? just there to ruin the game for other people I would never ever recommend this game to anyone anymore its just unplayable for anyone willing to actually play the game with skill P.S I know some fanboys/noobs are going downvote this that's because they are morons			"

												Honestly, I love this game. It has a great variety of guns, maps, and still has a thriving online community. I have over 25 hours logged online with my friends, so you can tell I at least like this game. However, this is where the fun stops. After many hours of constant grinding, I finally got up to level 55, the highest level, and I was overjoyed. Then, God decided I should be punished for being alive and decided to glitch out the game and reset my stats, back to level one. On top of that, there was an error message regarding a bad key code. (to clarify, I bought this game legally and did not download a cracked copy.) Since this game was from steam, there was no key code, and I was forced to reinstall. Since my friends were still playing the game at that point, I started the long climb to 55 again, and was once again greeted with a F*** you and a stat reset.I am writing this a warning to anyone who thinks this game looks fun, and just because I am butthurt, be prepared to start over every several days.8/10 gameplay-23456/10 for resets "

												My joint-favourite COD game with MW2, and one of my favourite of all time. It has aged very well and still has an active online-multiplayer community, albeit having many modded servers. Every COD since COD4 has tried to recreate the fantastic set-pieces and scenes featured in this, and have all fallen short of such greatness. It really makes sense that this COD of the entire series is the most deserving of a remaster. If you haven't played it yet, buy it. It's worth it. "

												The games a classic, lets remember it that way.I first purchased this game because my xbox 360 broke and wanted to re-live one of the classic call of duty's, pc gaming has always appealed to me more due to higher fps, better graphics etc, there's way more freedom, and this game  benefits from that over the console version, looks a lot sharper and is far more enjoyable.Maps such as the christmas crash is something consoles never had and is something different when first playing, more players per lobby, different modes and options for custom servers.However..The lack of servers available to play the old school way, as in the way it was intended, to play game by game and rank up one by one is next to none, very small amount of servers that host console game rules and even less that rotate maps, if you've only ever played on console think of it as playing a private match with a ten minuate timer and keep re-starting the game until you get to level 55.Also you cannot prestige in the PC version, i entered a lobby that has a custom xp per kill, got to 55 within a day, money wasted and game done with.Game now sits un-used install on my computer in the event I want to plug the xbox controller in and killer half n hour or so, always nice to go back to but never what it was.

												Bought this game purely because I read multiple descriptions from multiple sources that it was ''the best fps game ever''.I spent the entire game waiting for the game to start. It was infuriating. Every mission found like it was a slow, step-by-step tutorial. With the exception of RPGs, there was no need for weapon switching or experimentation as you were given the best primary for the mission each time.The story, though stated in other comments to be rich and exciting was dull.I would bother to elaborate, but I don't feel the game is worth my effort.TL;DR:-game is overrated.-story is boring-weaponry is boring-dogs are OP-missions are too linear-grenades are too OP+some mildly amusing voice lines during the credits+post credits mission was good (though I was still partly convinced that was actually the real first mission due to complete lack of depth)graphics - averagestory - badcharacters - averagemechanics - relatively poorability to replay - I have no desire to do so (non-existant) weaponry - very badBuy something else			"

												Basically buy this game if you only want to play the campaign, Activision has stopped updating Punkbuster services for this game and thus you cannot play multiplayer.Not worth at full price at all.			"

												This is an excellent game. However, I don't recommend this game for a number of reasons and I'm getting a refund. First of all, they're releasing a remastered version right away, but that's not why I don't recommend it! The reason is that World at War got an update letting you use a gamepad/xinput  with this game but this game still has stupid wasd movement even though it uses the exact same engine. I'll probably get the remastered version whenever I can after it comes out.			"
