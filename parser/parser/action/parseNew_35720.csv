												Imagine a gorgeous, detailed graphical story. A story of goblins, dragons, wonderful lands and gorgeous colour. Imagine a story made of heroes undertaking an epic quest to protect the kingdom from a terrible menace and journeying far and wide. Now imagine that story being brought to life, animated, and you being in control of the heroes. That's Trine 2.The artwork is jaw dropping, not because of technical wizardry or the number of polygons it pushes on screen, this isn't a game that will murder your graphics card, but instead the artistry comes from attention to detail. The watercolour feel of the skies, the glorious use of colours and sweeping vistas to sell the graphical novel element, and the heroes and villains, brought to being in near hand drawn detail. Behind this rests a solid, if somewhat generic feeling soundtrack, but a narrator who really sells the atmosphere, combined with solid voice acting for each of the protagonists (and indeed, the antagonists), it helps immerse you in the game and the story as a whole.The mechanics of the game are a refinement and improvement over the original Trine, with you switching between heroes on the fly and using their respective strengths to fight and puzzle your way through various environments, however this time it feels much slicker, and much more confident in what it does, there's many points where you'll be scratching your head, only to have the light flick on with a genuine ""AH HA!"" moment. It's never punishingly difficult, but it's pleasantly challenging. The lack of gore and fantasy nature of the game makes it very family friendly too, older children will get a kick out of the fantasy setting, and adults will no doubt get many of the references. In this it resembles a Pixar film, a comparison I make very affectionately.Do please check this game out, it deserves your time and attention.			"

												This game is completely different from all other 2d games... It's like you put your headphones on, ignore everything around you and you're in a new, amazing world, full of things to discover with a facinating nature. The best part about the game is the enviroment, its beyond all other games. The details and animations are awesome. It puts you in the mood for epic battles and doing puzzles like never before. The atmosphere is a drug itself. Does have funny achievments actually worth to spend time getting, they're both fun and challenging. You can upgrade your heroes to do even more neat stuff. Also got multiplayer, cooperactive mode so you can play it with your beloved friends. I must say that this game is catchy, not addictive in a bad way, but once you get the hand of it, you really wanna play it alot. BIG shoutout to the music, it fits the game perfectly. Worth the money NO doubt. I think this game is why god invented the word 'magic'. Do yourself a favour and buy it. Yes, right now.9.5/10 "

												The best thing that I like about this game, is its graphics.Every single level, character, enemies, background and platforms are well refined. Just look at the trailer and screenshots! It is exactly as pretty as the actual game itself.It is a puzzle platformer with a little bit of action in it. There are a lot of ways to tackle all the puzzles, and a lot of different approach to advance the levels.The story itself is quite interesting. The puzzles are interesting and not too overwhelming. The boss fights pose some challenge but not impossible if you get to know how to fight (or just checkpoint-abuse).The flexible difficulty settings make this game suitable for different type of player. After you defeat one playthru, you can replay all the stages from the start again with your already-unlocked skills to get past the stages in different way, and to collect the experience vials whereby you cannot collect in your first playthru.Multiplayer is best played with friends that has almost the same progress to avoid spoilers and trolling.The achievements added quite a bit of challenge and replayability if you're going for 100% completion.My score: 10/10			"

												This game is a proof that 2D gaming is not dead at all. The game is beatiful, the artwork the colors and design.The way you have to go is linear (to the right),  but to make it there you will find a lot of puzzles and obstacles. You control 3 characters, each one with different talents to learn, and abilities to use. you will need them 3 to get through the puzzles the game presents.The game is not short, it will take you a good time to get to the end. And even if you do, you will not have unlocked all your abilities. After you finish it you will most likely try to complete it on the hard difficulty, and get all the collectibles.After you find every single collectible item, you will be able to play the locked levels.The most fun I had with the game is playing with my brothers. The online play on this game is amazing, as you will find the three characters at the same time, interacting with each other.Pros: Beautiful game amazing graphics, tricky puzzles that don't get repetitive, as they are always different. Great online play. I recommend it, as it's a very enjoyable experience.Cons: Sometimes getting through the game to find collectibles can be a pain. The game is not perfect, there are ways to 'cheat' and skip puzzles, specially on multiplayer mode. Try not to find gameplay guides and videos, they will probably show you the wrong way.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Trine 2: Complete Story Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Platformer; Adventure; Puzzle; Coop; Beautiful Artwork   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTrine 2 is the sequel to the instant classic that was the first.  And it successfully takes a big step forward from the first game in all the positive aspects.  However, not too much was changed, ensuring that the charm achieved in the first game is still prevalent. Like its forefather, Trine 2 is a light game that is easy to digest but offers gripping visuals, a mystical atmosphere, and enticing gameplay.  All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution.  The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure.  I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet.Keeping in the tradition of the first game, the best aspects of Trine 2 are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting. Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming. The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly. Trine 2 somehow even manages to feel even more mystical than the first, and also has one of the most immersive 2D environments in the realm of video games.The gameplay is light and quick to grasp. Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level. But various difficulty levels and a “hardcore” mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge. And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining. Trine 2 also offers a decent amount of increased depth to the character development aspects of the game compared to the first installment of the franchise. There are more abilities and items; and more varied strategies are needed to solve the puzzles.As a direct sequel, the whimsical narrative is continued from the first game and the endearing trio of characters return. Even though it is a direct sequel, though, the story is quite separated from the original. So it won’t be the end of the world if you haven’t played the first game; but you probably should because it is also fantastic.Also the option of playing in cooperative mode adds an additional layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay of the Trine series is a joy to experience with friends.So like I did with the first game, I would say that Trine 2 is worthy of your consideration regardless of your standard preferences. Check it out.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

TRINE 2: COMPLETE STORYA majestic platform puzzle game with a dash of action.Rating 6/10It’s similar in many ways to the classic Shadow of the Beast series and The Lost Vikings. You take control of one of three heroes, a wizard, thief and knight, whilst being able to character swap at any time even mid jump.  It's this fluid change from styles in the middle of battle or solving a puzzle that adds another dimension to what could turn into fairly simplistic gameplay. There are times when it doesn't work such as having your thief or knight die and only being left with a wizard who is rather useless in a fight. However there are enough character reviving checkpoints that it doesn't become too much of an annoying handicap.Despite being a fairly traditional side scrolling platform game it's a truly beautifully made game, in artistic terms it's near perfect. It's this beauty coupled with the fun physics puzzles and quick action that keeps you playing as the plot is non-existent and the voice acting is weak.The DLC adds a few new environments such as dusty desert and the inside of a giant worm and whilst every bit as stunning as the main game by this stage Trine 2 has overstayed it's welcome and it's a fairly boring slog through the last seven extra levels. The DLC doesn't add any real new mechanics or gameplay, it’s just more of the same.So whilst trine 2 doesn't offer much in the way of innovative gameplay or a great story it's beauty has to be seen.

												Trine 2 is a wonderful physics-based platformer. The levels are all well-designed and afford just the right amount of leeway to let the player figure out creative solutions to obstacles. All three heroes that the player (or players - the game has online co-op that works great) controls have unique abilities that can be combined in clever ways to traverse the environments. Sometimes it feels like you can abuse the physics engine to bypass things, but I'm pretty sure most of it is intentional, as the inverse that is often present in physics-based platformers just isn't there: you'll never feel like you came up with a solution that should have worked but got cheated because the physics went wonky. It's just the right blend of physics sandbox and puzzle game.The only real issue is the combat. It's super simple, and so long as your warrior is alive, absolutely trivial. It's perhaps best to treat enemies as just another physics toy. Fighting them hand-to-hand quickly becomes dull, but you can pick up enemies as the wizard and see how they're affected by the environment. Thankfully, it's a small enough part of the game that I don't think anyone should be dissuaded by my complaints, especially since respawning at a checkpoint doesn't reset enemies, so you never ever have to go through a fight again.On the presentation side, Trine 2 is absolutely flawless. The supersaturated graphics are utterly gorgeous. Every single frame of this game would make an excellent wallpaper. It simply is that beautiful. The audio is perfect, with great music and excellent voice work. And the story is simple but very well written and charming. Everything comes together to look, feel, and sound like a fairy tale.			"

												Trine 2 is a beautiful game. The gameplay overall is decent. The problem is that the gameplay is too simple and too recognizable. Puzzles are basically you levitating stuff to get to shiny balls in the air and if you are aiming for a complete playthrough that is what you are going to be doing the majority of the time, and after a while it gets to be a chore. The combat and platforming works well enough but is hardly challenging and even boring at times. If you have played Trine 1, then there's nothing new in Trine 2 except the visually pleasing looks. If you expect a beautiful standard platformer you wont be disappointed.

												10 REASONS why you should buy this title:1. Easy to understand controls (recommended to play on X360 controller)2. Characters has unique personality (each class has its own ability)3. Simple Skill tree (upgrades are part of the game If you stuck and don't know what to do, you should start thinking about purchasing upgrades)4. Outstanding graphic (even though game is quite old It's still nice looking 2D platformer)5. Tons of fun (play with your friends to share better experience)6. The narrator voice fits in this game7. Long-but-interesting-story (there is FREE DLC INCLUDED!)8. Cooperation at finest (If Knight can't go up somewhere, call Wizard)9. Stuck? Reload last Checkpoint (If one of you will go further, you can either load last checkpoint or wait till it teleports you)10. They've announced Trine 3 (yay!)Not convinced? Well take a look at the gallery then.			"

												What about Trine 2? The first had been great, the 2nd manages to be better in every aspect, the addition of the coop for example is a resource that matches perfectly with the game.The gameplay remains based on intelligent puzzles, but the coop gave another dynamic to the game, there was the addition of new skills to characters, as well as a greater number of enemies, a factor that was limited in the first. Graphically the game is amazing, the art work is one of the finest I've seen, the sound part is also amazing, soundtrack, effects, voice acting. The plot is simple but effective. The Goblin Menace DLC is a good extension to the game and a very good way to prolong the fun, features beautiful and varied scenarios, although it has some minor glitches, but doesn't affect the gameplay at all.I highly recommend it, especially in coop!9/10			"

												La version française de ce commentaire se trouve aprèsA great and very beautiful platform game: splendid graphic and animation, great music and the puzzle are could be quite challenging (not every time as some as easier than other). Also, you have some battle to go through (against goblins mostly and other kind of monster as well as boss). And to do all that you are in control of 3 different characters in 1: a mage, a thief and a warrior.Let me explain more exactly what is all about : in fact, you manage one character at the time but you always have the choice to change during the game as each one have his own strength and weakness. So to pass some of the puzzle you have to use one specific character... but you can make it more challenging and try to only use one character during the whole episode.The story itself is not the most original even if it is funny, but is quite interesting to follow and is well tell.I have not yet try the multiplayer part, but for what I have seen in some videos, you play with  one or two partners one of the hero and so you can help each other... well that could help to pass some puzzle faster and have great fun as well ;o)So to make it simple, is for me one of the best platform game of this year (2014)! I don't see the time going and have some difficulty to stop playing. Luckily, there are always a pause between the different chapter (and a quite funny one).-----------------------------Un très beau et excellent jeu de plateforme : graphismes et animations magnifiques, très belle musique et les casse-têtes peuvent être plutôt exigeant (pas tout le temps car certains sont plus faciles que d’autres). Aussi vous avez quelques combats à faire (contre des gobelins majoritairement et d’autres types de monstres ainsi que des boss). Et pour faire tout cela vous allez devoir contrôler 3 personnages différents en 1 : un mage, une voleuse et un guerrier.Laisser-moi vous expliquer exactement ce qu’il en est : en fait vous allez contrôler un personnage à la fois mais vous aurez toujours le choix de changer durant le jeu car chacun a ses forces et ses faiblesses. Donc pour passer certains casse-têtes vous devez utiliser un des héros… mais vous pouvez vous donner plus de défi en gardant le même personnage durant tout l’épisode.L’histoire en elle-même n’est pas la plus originale même si il y a pas mal d’humour elle reste intéressante à suivre et elle est bien contée.Je n’ai pas encore essayer la partie multijoueur, mais pour ce que j’en ai vu à travers plusieurs vidéos, vous jouer avec un ou deux autres joueurs un des héros et ainsi vous pouvez vous aider… en somme cela peut permettre de faire certains passages plus rapidement et pas mal s’amuser ;o)Donc pour faire simple, c’est pour moi un des meilleurs jeux de plateforme de cette année (2014) ! Je n’ai pas vu le temps passer et j’ai eu du mal à m’arrêter. Heureusement qu’il y a une pause entre les différents chapitres (et vraiment drôle avec ça).			"

But even if it was as ugly as sin I would recommend this, because it's one of the best co-op experiences you'll have on the PC.Taking on a knight, wizard and a swinging thief, you dive into the beautiful world of Trine solving puzzles and laughing at the mishaps and physics amusement that occur. Not so fun as a single player, but still worth a buy.			"

												Trine 2 is easily one of the most beautiful games today. It is a really addictive game, with an innovative approach to the platformer genre.The main point that makes Trine 2 so enjoyable is that it requires thought to play: you have to solve puzzle after puzzle in each screen, and eventually fight some enemies and bosses. There are plenty of bosses.Another nice thing (for me, at least) about Trine 2 is that the difficult increases gradually, but the curve is not too steep: you get a chance to learn how things work in Trine 2's world, and how your powers work. Trine 2's characters are very well designed, and they complement each other nicely, leaving nothing to be desired. All in all, Trine 2 deserves one of those Oscars for games, if there were one.  The only downside I see in Trine 2 is that some of the Steam Achievements are nearly impossible to get, but that doesn't get in the way of the game at all.I highly recommend Trine 2.			"

												Okay... So that wasn't what I expected from this game since I have played the 1st Trine.Trine 2 is way more better than it predecessor (the childish Trine).This game is most enjoyable when playing with friends (I did play it with my friend till the end).I have finish all the standard levels + DLC levels and find this game quite challenging.There is a bug that make a level unpassable and I have stucked for 30 minutes trying to figure out what's wrong.Turned out you need to restart the level to progress.Despise that, this game is really worth the hassle. Try it out! "

												Platformers come in many shapes.Twitch-platformers and reflex-platfomers, which I can't stand, and puzzle, action, and physics platformers, which I enjoy.Trine 2 is an action-puzzle platformer, maintaining a good, steady progression flow [versus getting stuck trying to hit the same platform jump for 10 minutes, like some platformers], offering a good variety of physics, combat, and puzzle challenges.Few of these challenges will be overly demanding on you- combat especially isn't meant to hinder your progres as much as offer palate cleansing or distractions to puzzles,  But there's a lot of creativity and style in the game, and it ends up being enjoyable in the same way all the best classic [eg, nothing like Meat Boy] platformers are.PROS*Fun single-player with plenty of unlocks and secrets, that manages to keep you steadily 'just challenged enough' to make for a relaxing-yet-stimulating engagement.*Astoundingly good co-op. You thought single player was fun? Imagine being able to leverage your partner for crazy combos, reinterpret all the puzzles in new and delightfully clever ways, and, best of all? 'Accidentally' drop your partner into lava, drop a box on their head, or smash the platform they're floating on.Hey, it's what friends are for.*Co-op is easy to set up, has a decent selection of hosting options, and plays very smoothly.*Good variety of stagesStages range from small dungeon corridors, to open city or dungeon expanses, to vertical shafts, to underwater caverns, to skyscapes and more. I never found myself dissatisfied with stage progression.*Good variety of puzzles*Good variety of unlocks*Good, consistant blend of action, combat, puzzling, platforming.*Very stable (very few bugs and no major bugs)NEUTRAL*Each stage tends to emphasize the same enemies. Would have been nice if there was more variety and sub-bosses.*The expansion abilities offer tons of fun new dynamics- but can significantly reduce game difficulty.*While the stages and enemies have flair and creativity, there's no story whatsoever to speak of. Generally not something that platformer players really worry about but since this is also RPG, I'm going to make a note that's a tag based only in being able to find items to gear your characters up with, and being able to unlock/upgrade abilities.*Workshop support, but last time I checked, no legitimately decent offerings. The few that look good, tend to have a lot of bugs, like falling into or through terrain.*The characters are a bit dim. The humor here is definitely subjective, though thankfully, never offensive or intrusive [think mild 'you're so fat' and fart referencing humor].CONS*The expansion content feels like a clumsy afterthought. If you already own Trine 2, you really don't need to buy Complete Story unless you really want to play the main game again, and try the new expansion abilities in it.---This game is one of my absolute favorite co-op games, and if you're at all into co-op gaming, I can't recommend it enough.The most 'nasty' things are spike pits, carnivorous plants, skeletons, and goblins, so it should be playable with relatively young children, as the game doesn't include gore, frights, or offensive humor.4.5/5Bonus:If you like Trine 2, you may also want to give Ibb & Obb a look- it's a pure puzzle-physics platformer, so a different vibe, but it has good puzzling co-op (and is far more of a challenge for the brain than Trine 2). Do however note that there's a bug that, if not yet fixed, makes the last level unable to be completed for a small number of players.			"

												Trine 2 is the definition of what a plaformer should be.  The graphics are top notch with great lighting.  The fluidity of the animation and controls are perfect so that while some of the puzzle sections may be difficult at times they are never blamed on the slick controls.  The levels are long enough to be enjoyable and not too long where they get boring.  Each level offers a variety of landscapes and scenery, all of which are beautiful.  The storyline is forgettable, but still sets up a good reason for why you are playing the game.  The three different characters offer very different ways of playing and each offer different ways to solve the puzzles.  Think of it as an action only version of Quest for Glory where each character has a different solution to each puzzle.  The addition of the Goblin Menace, the Dwarven Carverns and now the Workshop has helped expand and continue the gameplay of this fabulous series.  The best part of this game is the multiplayer offering.  Now with online multiplayer, this game truly shines when playing with two or more players.The price for this game, when on sale is typically under $4 for the entire complete story.  Take advantage and don't miss this great game.  Bound to be a classic in gaming history.			"

												This is a fun adventure game with 3 characters to rotate between - all have different skills and weapons.  Also very colourful and visually pleasing.  Playing single is fun but playing co-op is even funnier.  It is especially helpful if you have a friend who is better at games than you.  :)			"

												After the release of Trine 3 which is considered a mixed bag it is high time I reviewed the sequel which is better in every which way than its predecessor.The premise remains the same in the 2nd episode of Frozenbyte's amazing franchise: the mysterious object called Trine binds 3 heroes together who all have different abilities and gameplay style. In terms of story they have switched from skeletons to goblins. Not much of a change but you know it's all about saving the kingdom once more. We have the same 3 characters from the first episode and in terms of timeline we are a couple of years after the events of Trine 1.What shines in Trine 2 is its graphics. Not that the first one was ugly, quite the contrary! Still, they managed to make the game even more beautiful (the water effect is stunning). In fact, the first game was updated with the sequel's engine and it is now only available in Enhanced Edition version.Overall, the gameplay remains the same but they have tweaked it a bit here and there. For instance, the wizard cannot conjure floating triangles but can pick up monsters. The heroes all received some new abilities and each now seems to be more useful. And, of course, we have some puzzles that utilise physics and have to be solved accordingly.The longevity of the game has also increased. Levels are more complex and much bigger. There are tons of collectibles to find - poems in treasure chests and also paintings (no equipment, though). You'll probably not be able to collect them all in one go! And let us not forget about the achievements - there's now a threefold increase. I believe Trine 2 is an example as to how a sequel should be done. For fans of the first one it is a must and for those hating the 3rd (and preferably last) a revisit has been due for some time. The game also features proper multiplayer i.e. it is not LAN anymore.

Posted: December 4, 2013
												The indie games market became a very good alternative for the young game developers willing to step up in their careers. And I’m not only saying this because many of the games I am talking about are truly masterpieces of their genre from any point of view. On the contrary. Fun characters, divine graphics- the starting point for an impressive gameplay. Still, I never would have thought that a sequel was going to animate my screen and I couldn’t have been more wrong about it.  Trine 2 is here, I’ve played it and, since I’m a hard-working guy, here’s a very meticulous review.Same as the first game, the three heroes, The Wiseman, The Knight and The Thief…pardon me, I meant The “Inventive woman” are united by a magical artifact called The Trine, whose goal is to protect the land from a new threat. Therefore, the inevitable goblin infestation. So, the three characters are up for a new adventure which, unlike the first game, takes a little longer time to play.In a very bizarre way, Trine 2 makes me think of Terry Pratcher’s novels, maybe because of its strange atmosphere that I picked up by reading this author’s books. The Universe presented in this title is so subtle that you can only be overwhelmed with its complexity. Even if it is an Indie game that we are talking about, the narrative value can not be ignored since this time, the characters are better shaped by their developers, humanized I might say, from the voiceover’s point of view as well as from the action’s point of view. I will even go further and say that Trine 2 offers a very pleasant story for all ages, even if it’s a 12+ game, precisely because the narration has something to offer to everyone. Nostalgic to say at least! Still, there are some missing bricks to this wall. The key of this story is nice indeed, but the main problem is the poor narrative construction. I think everybody would have been happier if someone would have added some solid touches to this aspect. The motivations are clear, meaning that the land is full of goblins, but the story as a whole concept could have been more complex. Who knows, maybe Trine 3 will surprise me when the time comes. The three key-elements that a player must take into consideration when starting this game are : cooperation, cleverness and physics. These elements are as important as the three main characters. Even if, on a regular basis, Trine 2 is a platformer, these elements are very necessary while dealing with a certain level. At the beginning of the game, there is a tutorial to teach you what every character can do. The Wiseman, because he is your starting point, is not the every-day Gandalf that everyone got used to. He is more of a clumsy magician for he has no idea what a fire ball really is. Still, he has his own tips and tricks, he can make objects appear from nowhere, such as boxes, or even make them levitate to get to certain locations. The Knight, on the other hand, is the muscled genius among the three characters. Even if he’s not very bright, he’s compensating by his strength, also being the best choice when it comes to a one on one fight with your enemies. Equipped with a shield, a hammer and a sword, he’s the defensive one of the trio. Last but not least, The Thief. And no, you’re not going to break chains or sneak behind your enemies, because her abilities are more rogue-like. She has a hook to reach to certain points otherwise inaccessible and an elastic loop to fight at the distance. What’s truly interesting and new is the way you switch between these characters to complete a level. The puzzles are sometimes so twisted that they really work your cleverness off! But that doesn’t mean there’s only one way to deal with a puzzle. Frozenbyte finally made it with this platformer: the experience is multidimensional, despite of its puzzle-platformer prejudices. To solve a certain puzzle, the player has at least three ways, which is pretty unexpected among the game mechanics that other developers use.  The characters’ control is absolutely beautiful. After pressing a key or a button if you’re playing on a controller, the task is immediately registered by your game. This is one of the most satisfying platformers I’ve played since Sonic Generations. No platformer fanatic could ever find a misstep concerning this aspect. The game control is perfect, I would say.Trine 2 is not only made of twisted puzzles, but also of battle sequences and a handful of bosses every now and then. These fights are meant to break the monotony of a certain level, full of enigmas. Still, the gameplay is so rewarding that the player can use his characters’ abilities to knock down the enemies. And because something had to be done when it came to options, each hero has a set of five abilities that can be improved using the experience points you get. What I find extremely stressful is that some of the abilities you get using this tree are only necessary for a specific level. The player has to reassign some of his points in order to finish a portion of the puzzle. I must say that this procedure is free, so you don’t have to repeat anything to get more experience afterwards. One of the major gains of this game is the cooperative multi-player, online and local, a huge step from the previous game and probably one of the reasons for which we strongly recommend a bundle. Two more players can be added to one session, each one of them being able to control in an active way one of the three characters, which makes the puzzles a lot easier, as far as I’m concerned. That being said, I must admit that I found myself playing this game even for the third time, just because it’s fun to find new ways to complete a level: a very nice move coming from Frozenbyte, although Zon@ thinks they should have done this from the beginning. We are finally getting to graphics. Did I mention this is an Indie game that comes from a small studio where are working about 20 people? Well, Trine 2 is a masterpiece of beauty. Want to hear something more spectacular that this? The game engine has been totally reconstructed. The game not only that looks divine, but its physics is very accurate. From the well animated background to the small details , nothing has been left out. And everything is the work of a very small, but talented, team. I know it sounds like I’m trying to get under their skin, but I’m telling the truth. The animations, the flow, the light and all the other elements gave me the impression that I was watching a moving painting. The colours also made a huge impression on me, one I will not easily forget. The sound itself is quite an experience. Not only that the narrative part is well represented on script, but the voices and the entire performance of the characters are as authentic as they could be. It sounds just like a very posh movie. The soundtrack is exactly what the game needed to complete the atmosphere: the way it highlights the key points of the game makes your blood rush and your adrenaline keep pumping which turns the whole experience into a sound feast.  Is Trine 2 a good game? I’ve been praising it a lot so yes, it is! It’s one of those games you have to play in order to find out what a creative genius really means. If the first game managed to get my attention, Trine 2 has upgraded to a very high standard among platformers.  "

												This game is amazing... especially the online and local co-op puts it on a very high spot of my ranking list. That is before even considering the amazing gameplay, beautiful graphics and great music. A lot of details can be found on every screen of the game and the game really benefits from playing it with three players. This mix of platform, beat 'em up and puzzle elements just provides a lot of unique gaming moments and is highly recommended. A must-have for anyone that likes fantasy or any of the aforementioned genres :)			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable cooperative platformers I've played.  It's perfect for having an easy-going expireance with any age group.  I played through the whole game with my little brother (15) and sister (10) and we all had a great time.The puzzels are varied - most of them aren't chalenging, but ocasionally some with requier a crazy act of skill too get past.  This slight chalenge really never got frustrating as much as it infused the game with a little excitement.  Almost everything about the game is fun.  Simply put.If you have 2 other people in your family who would enjoy a good time, get this game when it’s on sale (or a full price if you want).One technical note is that one of the characters is a lot easier to play with the keyboard and mouse – rather than a gamepad – so 1 person on the PC with 2 others on controllers is an ideal setup.

IntroTrine 2 is a amazing looking game with great dialogue thoughout the game which are its best features. There are three characters to choose from and a ton of collectables in the game.Good Points The grathics look great with bright colours and amazing visuals, Each level looks diffrent from the last so you wont get bored of the looks. Controls for Thrine 2 are simple and easy to remember, if you dont like using a keybored and mouse then you can use a controller since it has full controller support. Trine 2 runs very well which means almost any computer will be able to run the game. If your still not sure then you can play the demo to make sure it runs alright. There is a bit of replay value, you can can play the game on hard mode or you can try and find all the secrets and get all of the   achievements which arnt so hard. The dialogue and Narrators are great and fit in with the game perfectly. Some times they can moke you laugh and sometime they make you think. There is a co-op option which is great fun with a freind which makes the experience even better. I would recommend you play Trine 2 with a freind. Being able to choose from three diffrent characters is a great idea becasue you wont get bored of the gameplay since you can just swich to a diffrent character. Its very useful to solve puzzles.Bad Points The storyline is... Rubbish. Its a simple ""kill the bad guys to save the world from evil"" style which has been done so many times and they done nothing to spice it up. You end up not giving a damm half way though the game. I find the game to be easy, really easy. There are puzzles in every level but you end up solving them in seconds. The enemies are the same from biggining to end and since you level up, it becomes easy. The game time is short. You can complete it in about 5 hours if you dont collect or find secrets. If you want to find the secrets and take things slowly then it will take about 7 to 8 hours.OverallOverall I think Trine 2 is a good game which is fun to play with freinds. But its easy to move on to diffrent games. You will most likely end up forgetting about it once you have finished the game. I would recomment Trine 2 if you want to play it with a freind and if you like good looking games. I rate Trine 2 7 out of 10. "

Trine 2: Complete StoryIf you liked the first, odds are you'll love the second. What did it for me was the visuals—they're even more breathtakingly enchanting than the first instalment of the series and that was enough to make me want to keep playing. The gameplay felt very similar to the original title, although that wasn't really an issue for me: not much of an attempt to improve, but then why try to fix what ain't broke. The story is the low point in my opinion, and felt like it was just there to feed lines to the characters and narrator—who are all still doing a great job.Pros:Visuals are even more detailed, gorgeous and immersive; Clever, slightly more challenging physics-based puzzles;Fantasy creatures on a larger scale;Build-up to boss fights increases anticipation;Gameplay adapts to your play-style;Casual base, yet deceptively intricate mechanics;Soundtrack and VO are true to the first instalment;Goblin Menace DLC adds a bit of much needed length;Co-op doubles the fun.Neutral:New upgrades are original and fun, but ultimately aren't enough to change/improve core gameplay in a significant way.Cons:Uninspired story and collectibles;Trine 3 advertisement each time you quit the game; "

												For someone who's not played Trine 1, this game has been a joy to experience. The story is easy to catch on to, even if you like me haven't experienced the prior game. The characters are different and likeable, and the whole game has so much charm to it! The game looks and plays beatiful(ly). Solving puzzles and platforming in stunning environments is a lot of fun, and Ari Pukkinen's soundtrack really adds to the experience. The only slightly negative thing I have to say, is that while the story is pretty good, it sometimes feels a little bit too slow. Some levels are a bit long without any proper story progression in them, and I wish that there would have been a bit more funny dialogue in levels like this. This is hardly the game's fault though, probably just my impatience..All in all Trine 2 is a really good game, and I reccomend it to all people who like platformers mixed with puzzles! :)			"

												A rare beast:  A game which works equally well in both single AND multi-player modes!  Indeed, the very nature of the puzzle-solving changes quite dramatically depending on which way it's played, as many puzzles have multiple solutions, and some of these solutions require more than one character to implement them.  An almost perfectly-designed game in every regard, with sumptuous graphics and charming characters and oodles of imagination and, oh my Lord, a STORY!!!  It's all impressive enough to even bypass the prejudice I generally harbour these days towards ""lighter"" fantasy fare, no small feat, I can tell you.   Guess I should play the first one some time...Verdict: 9/10.			"

												This game pisses me off, and I mean that as a compliment. You know a game is good if the puzzles are challenging enough to p*ss you off and not because of bugs, glitches, or some other issues. So thank you very much Frozenbyte for p*ssing me off in the best way possible! :D			"

												Really a delight to play. The graphics are absolutely beautiful and the audio is excellent. It's the first sideways scrolling platformer I've spent much time on in ages. The levels are well paced and the gameplay is challenging without being infuriatingly difficult. The game is presented almost like a fairytale. It reminds me a lot of Pandemonium![en.wikipedia.org] from 1996.			"

												Really liking this game so far, especially playing online with friends! Stunning scenery and fun gameplay. The achievement-hunter in me appreciated the huge number of achievements available. Haven't played the single player yet, but am hoping to complete Trine 2 in the future with friends.Here's some highlights from an earlier playthrough we did:

												Trine 2 is the same as Trine (1) and keeps the story of our three heroes on. You (as the player) can switch ingame between the wizard, the knight and the thief. All three got their own specialties and you switch characters on spot (so one disappears from screen and is replaced by the other).I think that the big success of the game is exactly that thing. In an RPG you would have to choose your character/avatar before you even start playing, but here you can create a box with the wizard, climb with the thief and fight the enemy on top of the tower with the knight. I gotta say that it isn't addictive, but it is fun.So if you hate playing RPG's because you always regret which class you picket in the very end, than this is an nice adventure you will like. It doesn't last that long, comes at a fair price and is enjoyable.8/10 Okay wizard! You do the ramp in front! Thief, you jump over it and in midair I will crush-land on the enemys skull!			"

The little adventures that you're set out on are just so much fun. It is also extremely fun to play this in co-op with close friends and family. I haven't yet finished the game, but I'm sure I'll enjoy it all the way through.			"

												Frozenbyte continues the legacy of the original Trine in this worthwhile sequel as the game features many of the same trademarks that made the first so successful. Trine 2 plots a new story and setting that takes full advantage of the developer's creative prowess. This action/adventure platformer maintains its unique perspective on the classic genre and revitalizes to modern standards. Any casual gamer armed with a good controller will find themselves lost in world of Trine given its clever structure, voice-acting and detailed fantasy world. It should be noted that Trine 2 features a downloadable content pack called ""Trine 2: Goblin Menace"" that is played as a separate campaign.The Goblin Menace downloadable content (DLC) is a worthwhile expansion for Trine 2 that unveils a variety of new settings with increasing difficulty. The story is rather simple, but stems directly from the sequel so the plot seems like a true continuation of the original game. Fans of the Trine series owe it to themselves to purchase and play through the Goblin Menace!			"

												An immensely beautiful game, this has to be the best side scrolling puzzle game I have ever played. I started this game with a couple of friends and I was quite surprised as to how amazing this game looks. It really is mesmerising, there is quite a few different settings you explore in this game. Be that snow, forest, cave, castle, desert or whatever else, they are all done so well and just look amazing.The characters are pretty distinctive from one another and the story is narrated like a fairy tale, which gives the game more of a fantasy feel to it.The puzzles are interesting and require team work to get through successfully, which makes the game a lot of fun. There’s enemies to kill and bosses to defeat, working together to defeat all evil and save the day!From what I did hear (which wasn’t much because of the nutters I played with) the storyline seemed pretty decent, and soon after we completed it they brought out DLC as well. Which I haven’t yet completed, but looks just as fun.This is a great indie game franchise and I think everyone should give it a go.			"

												I finished the ""Complete Story"" version of Trine2, which is an extended version of the regular Trine2. The extra content (""Gobling Menace DLC"") is almost of the same size as the original, and it's equally nice, maybe even prettier! It took me about 13hrs to beat the whole game, and it wasn't particularly difficult, especially when you get the hang of it.GameplayIt's essentially a puzzle platform game, with a bit of action (battles) at some points. You have three characters (fighter, mage & rogue archetypes) that you switch to any time during play; each character has unique abilities that will help you get through the various puzzles you come across. Each level of the game (there are about 20 levels for the ""Complete Story"") has about 10-15 puzzles to complete, with save/checkpoints every one or two. Most puzzles are typically ""get to the right of the screen"" type, over chasms or mechanisms or beating foes, and can usually be solved in a multitude of different ways. The puzzles weren't too challenging, and some of them might be a little repetitive, i.e. you could easily go through them using ""standard"" techniques. There's also hints to get you going, if you're stuck on a puzzle for too long. I played with WASD keys + mouse, and there are also some more keyboard shortcuts; controls were quite simple to learn & master and I encountered no problem. No glitches or weird bugs fell to my attention, and the physics engine of the game was quite robust.Theme/Graphics/SoundThe story is all set in a fairy-tale world, which some might find a bit ""underaged"" (as if it's meant for children, i.e. far from ""mature""), but I didn't mind that so much. The graphics are ASTOUNDING, computer-made but beautiful, and fleshed in 3D even if the game is essentially 2D. Lighting and other visual effects are particularly well done and there's some pretty animations at the end of each level. There's a great variety of ""worlds"" you're going to have to go through: from dark dungeons to ice-caverns, to jungles, to deserts, to floating-islands, even to the belly of a giant beast! Each is rendered in a very pretty and unique style. The three heroes (along with the narrator and some other characters) are very well voiced, all along the story and at each level. The music is nice too, although I can't state anything special about it.My OpinionRecommended, if you like puzzle-platform games that aren't too difficulty. The graphics are also a BIG plus to this game. You might wanna pass this, if you don't like fairy-tale settings or puzzles :)			"

												A pretty good platform game with decent co-op. These games are well-known for their graphic design. It looks really good. The story is alright too, if not a bit thin and a little short. There's a certain dose of humor in there, though, which is good. A few annoyances with the physics and manipulation of objects, in particular when playing with someone else. A small dose is just funny, but at times it becomes a bit too much, I feel. There are plenty of ""hidden"" stuff to find, which I really appriciate. Some are very hard to reach. I experienced a few connection hiccups when playing co-op, but the cause might have nothing to do with the actual game.The game certainly deserves a recommendation from me.			"

												""Beauty is power; a smile is its sword.""Trine 2 represents a 2-D jump & run adventure game with impressive artwork, beautiful design and sophisticated puzzles. As already introduced in the original Trine you can switch on the fly between three different characters, a knight, thief and wizard (still no fireballs). It is also the basis for the great puzzle system this game offers, and the multitude of possibilities to solve each one of them.The balance between combat and puzzle sections leave no room for boredom. And the adjustable level of difficulty gives newcomers and veterans a fair chance to prove their abilities. Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.The DLC in form of Goblin Menace adds a couple new levels, a new story, and several new skills which will also be available in the original game.Overall Trine 2 feels more refined than its predecessor and the beautiful artwork in combination with the creative puzzle sections are very persuasive and entertaining. In addition it offers enough content to justify itself as a worthy sequel to Trine.Fun fact: Due to relatively poor sales for Trine 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the conversion for the expansion for these consoles was deemed not be cost effective, thus Trine 2: Goblin Menace was never released for these platforms.--My rating system consists of five categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere -	Details-	Puzzles-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: A-RankDetails: S-Rank(It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.)Puzzles: S-Rank(To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.)Story: B-RankCombat & Controls: A-Rank [with a gamepad]--To conquer all achievements of Trine 2, you will most likely spend around 40 hours.

												First thing I noticed was that this game has very beautiful graphics. It is a 2D platformer, but it looks so dynamic and magical. I enjoyed a big part of the game almost only because of the graphics. It enhanced it, let's put it that way.The gameplay is good as well. There is some action and you have to solve some puzzles to get further in the level. The combat is simple, and not overwhelming. Some puzzles are simple, others are quite difficult to solve. The co-op mode is good as well. You play basicly the same levels, but now with two characters. I doesn't make it easier at some points, because you really need to help each other. So it makes it really interactive.The story is nice as well. The characters are good, they are well involved in the story, not just observing people who don't interact at all. Really, I don't have anything negative to tell about Trine 2. I just love this game, it is fun to solo, and fun to play with a friend. I would recommend it to everyone. It is on sale quite often, so you can save a lot of money on that.My rating for this game: 8/10			"

												26-Aug-2016 : Finished main story + extrasSetup : Windows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadREVIEW :I have mixed feeling about this game. I love the first one, but this one... it's like the developer hates the players and just want to make our gameplay miserable. The thing that I hate most about Trine 2 level design are ""slippery when wet"". This slippery floor make it impossible to backtrack to get missed collectibles, you either have to restart from checkpoint or restart the level entirely (if you're playing hardcore mode). The collectibles are a lot more than the 1st game and some of them are in really hidden and challenging position, but the not so fluid control make it really frustrating to get them.Other than that, like the 1st game, it has beautiful graphics and music. The story is mediocre, more like children story. Since it has multiplayer up to 3 players, I guess it's a good family game to play with your siblings or children (if you're a parent). CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.			"

												There's something special about the Trine games. They combine the best parts of artistic design and exploration for the sake of beauty with a thinking mans puzzle mechanics which can be combined and utilised in interesting and unexpected ways. Along with fantastic extras like co-op, challenges and the likes (all of which are actually worth trying out and fun in their own rights) this is one of the games I've loved from the moment I first picked up.As for the rest of the series, Trine 1 holds a special place in my heart because I picked it up first and because it set the bar so high, but Trine 2 raises the bar and takes nothing away- it's prettier, it has more content, it's more responsive and technically improved and it's just an all round improvement, and then Trine 3, while I appreciate it a lot more than most despite its failings is still the lesser of the three.Picking up the whole series is absolutely my recommendation, but if you only have time for one, Trine 2 is my suggestion.

												I have to say that I was much more happy with this game than the first one, and that is simply because I was able to play online co-op with a friend. The whole premise isn't necessarily original, but the levels you go through are pretty interesting, and it is so enjoyable to plan things out with a friend as you are playing along, accomplishing the puzzles.Some of them took us a good while to accomplish - some because they were actually hard, and some because we simply missed something and would feel stupid afterwards. But that's why I liked this game so much more than the first, because I had a friend to talk to that gave a different perspective. Neither of us one-sided the game, meaning that both of us were able to give our perspectives on what we were supposed to do - it wasn't like one of us had all of the answers.Further, both of us easily assigned ourselves roles: I was the thief, and my friend was the wizard (sorry, knight, you're not exactly that useful unless you're absolutely needed!) and we got through the game in one sitting. Playing the first game got sad because things are much more annoying to accomplish on your own in the puzzles, and I simply don't think it's as fun.So would I recommend the game? Yes. Great graphics, some nice humor to the premise, nice little puzzles and levels. But definitely make sure you have somebody to play it with!			"

												If somebody told me six months ago that I'd ever play a game as beautiful as Trine, I would have scoffed, and yet here I am, playing its sequel - a game that takes its astoundingly high production values and raises the bar to unimaginable new heights.So, for anybody who is unaware, Trine 2 is the sequel to Finnish developer Frozenbyte's 2009 side-scrolling fantasy puzzle platformer, which refines and continues to build what I suppose I should be calling the ""Trine franchise"". All the majesty of Trine is present, though there are a few changes that are definitely worth giving attention to.Read my full review (with screenshots) here: http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/trine2.php "

												Trine 2 is a very fun and challenging little game that features both singleplayer and coop! I find the game to be much more enjoyable to play with two friends, but it's completely fine to play it by yourself too.In Trine 2 there is three characters availible to play as, Pontius the Knight, Amadeus the Wizard and Zoya the Thief. Every character has its own attributes that is needed to complete the puzzles and continue through the levels. In singleplayer mode you can switch between all three characters when you need to, and in coop every player plays one character.In the first game your heroes saved the kingdom from an undead invasion, after that the heroes separated and lived their own lives, until now. The Trine warps the trio to a mysterious place that they have never heard of or seen before. The three heroes slowly discover the path out of this mysterious place while someone is observing their progress through a magic mirror...There is also a DLC called ""The Goblin Menace"". If you are unsure if you want to buy this game, I can totally recommend it! I've had tons of fun playing this with my friends, was it laughing at eachothers deaths and ridiculous ragdolls or trying to figure out the puzzles, finding ""cheaty"" ways to skip the puzzle and try to get to the next part of the level.The DLC adds quite a few more levels of gameplay and an amusing storyline which was very enjoyable!I recommend this game to anyone! Especially if you have two friends to play it with. And while at it, why not get the DLC and have even more fun?			"

												Trine 2 is a side-scrolling action platform and puzzle video game developed by Frozenbyte. It is the sequel to Trine and was released on Windows, OS X, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on December 7, 2011 and for Linux on March 31, 2012. Trine 2 allows three players to play the iconic roles of a wizard, a thief, and a knight in a simultaneous cooperative mode. A Director's Cut edition was confirmed during Nintendo's conference at E3 2012, and was available via Wii U's eShop on the console's launch day in all regions except Australia and Japan.The Director's Cut edition is Frozenbyte's first self-published title on a console format, although this edition will be released by Nintendo themselves in Japan on January 2014. On October 28, 2013 it was announced via the PlayStation Blog that Trine 2: Complete Story will be coming to PlayStation 4.It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe. It's the first PlayStation 4 game to support stereoscopic 3D.Trine 2 is a puzzle platform video game, requiring the player to use the skills of the three characters, Amadeus the wizard, Zoya the thief, and Pontius the knight, to navigate each game level. As with the first game, the mystical ""Trine"" has bound the three characters together into one common entity, and thus the player controls only one character which can be switched to the other two at any time. Each of the characters has unique abilities: Amadeus can use magic to grab onto certain objects in the game world, and create boxes and planks to be used to get around; Zoya can strike at objects with her arrows, and grapple onto certain surfaces; and Pontius is strong in combat against foes, can bash apart walls, and deflect projectiles with his shield. A combination of these elements is necessary to complete each stage in the game's world.Characters have individual life meters, and if one character's meter depletes, that character cannot be used until the next checkpoint is reached. If all three characters lose their life meter, the player must start back at the last checkpoint. Throughout the game world are special magical vials, and for every fifty of these collected, the player receives a skill point, which can be used to gain abilities through a skill tree for each character. These skill points can be used collectively for each of the three characters, and can be traded between them.Trine 2 also supports up to three players in a cooperative mode. In this mode, each player controls one of the three characters, but all must be unique; three players will be forced to play as Amadeus, Zoya, and Pontius. Two players can switch characters as long as both agree to the swap. If a character dies, the other players can revive the character at the next checkpoint. The skill tree is shared among all characters, based on the hosting player's saved game.Rate: 10/10			"

												One of the greatest co-op game I've ever played. Its both fun and entertaining. I play this with my boyfriend and we just enjoy playing it together (even though he's finished this game for a hundred times. Hyperbole intended ;) ) and we just never get tired of laughing so hard when playing this (we're just both really busy at the moment). I'd reccomend this for the adventure seekers, but not so much about guns.			"

												When did gaming culture love graphics more than content? This game right here. This game is the perfect example of how you can make a turd of a game, then make it look pretty and everyone will love it. Other than that there are no saving graces what-so-ever. The story line, is the most cookie cutter thing you can imagine. ""We need to save the princess."" -> That's the entirety of the plot. The characters are bland and boring. Each of the three main characters, are about as cookie cutter as you can get. The interactions between the characters offers no additional story or plot mechanic to make you care about any of the events or personal ramifications of their quest.Gameplay, terrible. Just terrible. Can you press the RB button on a controller? Yes, then you will destroy this game no problem, even on hard. Spam the mage abilities to solve the ""puzzles"" (this term is used to a looser degree than my mom), it really is that easy. When in battle, just switch to either the warrior or rogue, fight off the enemies, of which there is really only 1 type with a couple variations, then switch back and run forward. With all the ""hints"" turned off from the beginning, I never once got stuck on a ""puzzle"" for longer than 45 seconds. Don't buy this game, it's just a turd that was spray painted gold. The last boss of the main game, I laughed when it was over because it was so bad. I would rather sit through the last hour of Mass Effect 3 again, than buy another Trine game... Fact, not fiction.

												Take control of three bound together heroes in the beautiful second installment of the Trine series, each hero filling a specific role required for progressing which means it's a perfect for playing alone, switching between the characters when necessary, or if you want a real challenge, play a character each with a couple of friends and see just how much you begin to depend on one another. :P In my opinion, Trine 2 is a wonderful improvement from the first game as it removes a few unnecessary restrictions, has some mild gameplay improvements, and improves drastically in general quality introducing some stunning backdrops and soundtracks, the only thing I felt was lacking was uses for the Warrior, unfortunately he seemed to have more of a role in the first game as there'd be plenty more enemies for him to smash away at, but trust me, if you enjoy fantasy, action, and puzzles, you'll want in on this adventure. ;)			"

												Usually with 2D platformers, you're given an obstacle with one answer on how to solve it.  Trine has been that exceptional, and very beautiful 2D platformer that allows you to create your own solutions to the level obstacles ahead.  With Trine 2, not only has the difficulty increased, but it now allows for online co-op where three friends can take control of each of the three characters, creating the new challenge of how to get everyone across the obstacles together.  This is a wonderful game to play with your two closest friends that can also provide quite a laugh when your friends formulate plans that look far too dumb to work and then it actually succeeds.  When you find you or your friends saying, ""wow, was I supposed to do that?"" you just know a game like this is truly the refresher that the 2D platformer needed, even for people who didn't originally care for the genre.  I would easily recommend this game, especially for the $15 price tag.  Hell, I'd have paid $30!			"

												10out of 10.This game was amazing. We were so sad when it was over but then realized it took 8 to 9 hours for us to complete it. The characters, the scenery and the storyline were all fantastic. The game is up to three players and can be played online, LAN or on one pc with controllers. The game play took a little getting used to and if for some ungodly reason you are still running Windows XP, they say it is compatible but in reality is very buggy. It truly is a great fantasy adventure. Great game with others! Also a fun story and I highly recommend!			"

												I really, really love Trine 2. This game is not only a successor to Trine, another game I love, but an overall enhancement. While the core gameplay stays intact, it did receive some nice tweaks, e.g. summoning a box has been greatly improved and you don't need to draw a true square. The most impressive thing about this game however are the graphics. Trine had very good visuals, but what you get here is simply amazing, pure eyecandy :)So, if you enjoyed playing the original Trine, then this is a must-buy!!!! It's just as simple as that <3			"

The game has interesting story, and game itself is not short, just opposite of that, it will take you quite some time to finish it, and you'll probablly try to beat it on harder difficulty after that.

I often found myself just standing still, admiring the colorfull scenery. It's extremely immersive. It's the Disney cartoon of games. I cannot overstate how tremendously good the atmosphere is in this game.If you enjoy platforming, if you enjoy vivid rainbow colors, beautiful environments, enchanting music AND the ability to enjoy this in co-op with up to 3 friends, then you simply MUST have Trine 2. Ofcourse, if you haven't played any of them first, buying Trine 1 will not disappoint you.			"

												Trine 2 follows up the original game with everything one could have hoped for in a follow-up: more variety (in combat, enemies and environments), more beautiful graphics (which I did not think was even possible), and last but not least, support for online co-op multiplayer! Simply put - it is the perfect sequel. Everything that was great about the first game (refer to my previous recommendation for details) is still great in Trine 2, if not better. Other notable changes include boss fights and the removal of the limiting ""magic meter"" mechanic of the original. The story this time around is also pretty neat and the same humorous banter between the three characters is on display. The game is extremely fun to play with a friend or two online, but it is definitely also worth playing solo, if that's all you can manage. In summary, Trine 2 is an all-around amazing game, and the price is right too. Highly recommended!			"

Posted: August 8, 2015
  TL;DR  : Trine 2 is a platformer / puzzle game, and is one of the best coop games I've played. The game is gorgeous and runs very well, but the story is quite meh imo. Story / SettingReally wasn't the best part of the game, I'm not into these stereotypical RPG game stories. The characters and dialogues can be fun sometimes, but that's it. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I feel like the game doesn't even explain what the Trine is, and the backstory simply wasn't interesting. The content of the hidden chests disapointed me every time, but well, at least I got the achievements that went with it. GameplayThe game really shines when you're playing with someone, online or localy like I did. It can be fun alone but cooperating with someone makes it way better, wether its for the puzzles or for the combat. The only issue can be the point of view when playing multi, its not always easy to see some areas where things can be hidden, but it might be the same in single player which I haven't tried. Overall the game is easy, a few puzzles took us a few minutes but that's it. If you really want to find everything in this game it'll be more about looking everywhere than solving hard puzzles. Some entrances can be hard to find. The fact that you can just rearange the skills of your characters made it a bit too easy as well. Same thing with the respawn system, you can die on and on and on and respawn a few meters behind, whereas the enemies keep all the damage you've done to them. Some achievements are a bit harder and were the only real challenges in this game, but all of them were fun to get. PerformanceWonderful graphics, even for 720p mid quality. it runned at 30 fps with these setttings which was enough for me in a game like this one (no need for high response time or super smooth gameplay like in a FPS)Style / Graphics It was probaly the best looking game I've been able to play on my laptop. Every map or areas is full of great lightning, creatures, buildings... etc.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   TL;PL  : Trine 2 est un platformer, et est un des meilleurs jeu coop auquel j'ai pu jouer. Le jeu est magnifique et tourne bien, même si l'histoire n'etait pas très intéressante. HistoireClairement pas le meilleur élement du jeu, ce genre d'histoire de RPG stéreotypées sont assez lourdes. Les dialogues et les personnages sont marrants parfois, mais c'est tout. Peut-être que je n'ais pas fait attention, mais je crois que le jeu n'explique même pas ce qu'est le Trine. Le contenu des coffres etait décevant à chaque fois, mais bon au moins ça permet d'obtenir des succès. GameplayIl faut vraiment jouer au jeu en multijoueur pour l'apprecier complétement, que ce soit en ligne ou localement comme j'ai fait. Ca peut etre sympa tout seul mais le fait de coopérer avec quelqu'un rends le jeu milles fois mieux, que ce soit pour les puzzles ou les combats. Le seul problème en multi est le point de vue de la camera, c'est pas toujours facile de voir certaines zones à l'ecran, où certains objets peuvent être cachés, mais c'est peut-être la même chose en un joueur. Globalement le jeu est vraiment facile, certains puzzles nous ont pris quelques minutes mais pas plus. Pour tout trouver dans ce jeu, c'est plus une question de regarder partout que de résoudre des puzzles compliqués. Certaines entrées peuvent être vraiment difficiles à trouver. Le fait que l'on peut simplement changer les compétences que l'on a assignés aux personnages rend également le jeu un peu trop facile. Pareil avec le système de respawn, on peut mourrir autant de fois qu'on veut et réapparaitre un peu derrière, alors que les ennemis gardent tous les dégats infligés. Certains succès etaient compliqués et ont été le seul vrai challenge du jeu, mais tous les succès sont sympas à obtenir. PerformanceLes graphismes sont supers beaux, meme en 720p et qualité moyenne. Le jeu tourne à 30 fps avec ces options ce qui est assez pour ce genre de jeu à mon avis (pas besoin d'un temps de réponse très rapide ou de gameplay très fluide, comme dans un FPS)Style / Graphismes Probablement le plus beau jeu auquel j'ai pu jouer sur mon portable. Chaque map a de supers effets de lumières, et de très beaux batiments et créatures.			"

												Frozenbyte did it again, best 2D/3D sidescrolling platformer become the bestest!if you haven't play Trine before, you should be, the story about those 3 hero hook up with Trine 2.but if you just skip the first one it's not a big deal tho, not much different. Trine Reviewhere my review link for Trine, since there's not much different for the second Trine, Trine review still legit for this one.I'll just review the different between those 2, I differentiated it to positive and negative, since it's my opinion you may not agree with me with some points. here it is :+ New type of puzzle, not like the first one that concentrate on destroying, opening gate with lever, grappling platform to platform. In Trine 2 really test your cunning eyes and sense, play with waterfall, bubble, and else!+ Removal of floating triangle is a beast, now it's not a Thief-centered-puzzle-solving anymore since Zoya can't grapple to any of Wizard hand made box or planks.+ Pontius got a big buff and become more dependable in fight and puzzle solving, now he can jump farther with charge jump, and range attack with throwing hammer.+ Amadeus now can levitating enemy, so now he can be used for fighting while Zoya or Pontius not available. It's a big buff for him, not like on the first Trine, when your attacking hero both dies you'll ♥♥♥♥ed up if surrounded by enemy with Amadeus.+ Despite of increase damage of fire arrow, level 2 skill give Zoya explosion, it's a good nerf altogether with buff, it's done a little improved damage and makes take down enemy from afar much more harder.+ Reworked fire arrow projectile and damage. damage now based on how long you stretched your bowstring, not just 2 spam fire arrow attack can kill almost everything. and the fire arrow projectile now same like normal arrow, not boosted speed like before.- The first thing you'll notice is there's no Energy consumption in Trine 2, so there's no energy vial to be sure. In my opinion, removal of energy consumption makes this games a little bit easier. apparently, you can use unlimited fire arrow and levitating.- Zoya can't shoot grapple below 45degree shooting angle, it's a little bit annoying. whilst in Trine you can shoot below that point- removal of individual skill points, em-em, yes it makes the entire gameplay of Trine 2 become harder, you may not miss every single exp vial since gaining skill point is a tough job.- There's no equipable item anymore in Trine 2, so you can't modify each hero more farther just like before. I really don't understand why they remove this feature. Now hidden boxes just give you secret, artwork, or piece of letters. d'oh.TL;DRBest 2D/3D platformer I've ever played! the gameplay, story, graphic, it all absolutely perfect.It is obviously better than Trine, but that not makes you skip the first one, since they offer you different type of puzzle (not much).

												I liked this game its fast paced and easy on the eyes, there were some challenges along the way, but with the power of friendship and team work we managed to beat it.Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.I've finally come to realise just how great This game is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront. Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. Trine 2 is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock ""as if he'd keep driving"" or ""as if she'd do that""he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100%movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.

												For what it's worth, this is amazing.A charming fantasy platformer with some very clever puzzles that had as much to do with weight and balance as with the usual block-shifting, switch-pulling nonsense that’s the norm for this kind of game. If you played the original, Trine 2 is basically a bigger, better and more beautiful version of the same. It's fun, smooth and co-op online works like a charm. True that it has an unremarkable story (cliché) but, overall, fans of puzzle games will not be disappointed.Highly recommended.			"

												This is coming from someone who never played (or heard of) the first Trine and played with a friend on the Medium difficulty. I’ve played it a bit in single player before doing that, and I wasn’t terribly impressed with it.Trine 2 is basically a playable fairytale; it’s not a very interesting story, but it’s set in a very charming and magical world. The playable cast are the traditional Mage-Warrior-Thief combo, but they each are quite charming in their own way (like the world of Trine itself). Amadeus (the Mage) can create boxes and planks, Pontius (the Warrior) is a great fighter and can use his shield to both fly and protect himself and his allies, and Zoya (the Thief) is, quite refreshingly, an archer with lots of nifty tricks up her sleeves. All three are rather stereotypical: Amadeus is a smart coward scared of his wife, Pontius is a gluttonous stereotypical hero more concerned with food and saving princesses and Zoya is a shifty, greedy woman. Sadly, they don’t seem to really interact all that much during the game except during moments where the player has little (if any) control. It’s a shame because the personalities clash so much that it makes for some fairly amusing dialogue.I can happily say that while this game is a sequel to Trine, it never feels like you missed anything. Sure, there are some little references to it (as far as I can tell, at least), but it’s a standalone story in its own right. Sure, it’s nothing special to begin with, but it’s refreshing to play a little fairytale instead of this big complex story with multiple plot twists. It took my friend and I about 8 hours to finish the main game (I’ll edit this when we do the DLC) and it never was too hard, though I would recommend playing on Classic and not Unlimited, as that really does force you to work together and not independently. However, I would also highly recommend playing the game with two players instead of three or one for reasons I’ll delve into later.This is mainly a puzzle game where you have to find a way to go from point A to point B with all the tools given to you, such as boxes, pipes, fire, portals and more. However, there are a TON of hidden little nooks and crannies scattered throughout the game, and since it’s mainly EXP (because yes, there is a levelling system), it’s actually rewarding in a concrete way. There are also hidden paintings, which are basically concept art, and hidden poems, which are foreshadowing the story. Not necessary, but certainly fun to hunt down. Notice how I said this is mainly a puzzle game. There are little combat breaks in the game that seem to separate puzzles, which is a welcome addition. However, they lead to a problem within the mechanics of the game and they’re why I can’t recommend playing this with three players (on Classic). To properly explain, however, I have to address the levelling system. It’s quite simple: pick up 50 hidden doohickeys and you level up, gaining a skill point for your account that can be used for either Amadeus, Pontius or Zoya. Amadeus will be able to create more objects, Pontius mainly gains combat abilities and Zoya gains different kinds of arrows that can assist in both utility and combat. As a result, Amadeus will not be very useful during combat, while Pontius and Zoya will be very useful (especially Pontius). The problem here is not quite Amadeus: it’s Pontius.See, the bulk of the game is puzzle-based, so Pontius can’t really do much but stand around and wait for the others to clear the way to the next battle. Furthermore, his special ability (breaking rocks and wood) becomes obsolete as soon as Zoya gains explosive arrows, which are much more flexible since a lot of the hidden EXP bottles are hidden up high. Therefore, the player stuck with Pontius (in a 3P Classic situation) would be mostly useless and Amadeus finds himself helpless during battle (he can help, but not as much as the others). As a result, I found that playing with two players, one dedicated to Amadeus and one dedicated to Zoya, led with the most satisfying game experience as we could switch to Pontius whenever needed instead of having deadweight with us. We didn’t even need to get Pontius’ skills until Zoya (for me) and Amadeus (for my friend) had all their skills unlocked.While the game is very, very forgiving (except, I’m guessing, on Hardcore), having lots of checkpoints that fully heal every character as often as you wish, there are still some annoyances (provided you don’t mind how forgiving the game is, which I didn’t). This mainly comes with the few ‘boss’ battles that appear throughout the game. They always take the same form: a big goblin with a massive club. Furthermore, this goblin kills anyone in a single hit and takes a fair bit to kill compared to other enemies, which is quite annoying. Also, I can’t imagine fighting the last boss in single player, though it’s a great fight where, once again, Pontius isn’t very useful.Visually, the game is actually pretty stunning, being very colorful. Lots of shadows and lighting make the game ‘pop’ and seem alive. You can clearly see everything on the screen even when it’s dark, which I feel is crucial in a puzzle game as the main challenge shouldn’t be finding the pieces, but figuring out how they fit into one another. The music is also very pretty, being very soothing most of the time and kicking up the tempo and intensity when needed. However, none of the songs really stick in your head, instead blending into an immersive soundscape. The whole game, being a playable fairytale, has a delightful cartoony feel to it, from the character designs to the story to the sounds and visual design. While the shallow combat seems a little tacked on and only created to give Pontius a purpose, the combat scenes are so short that it shouldn’t be counted as a huge negative. I would highly recommend this game for 2P coop players and cautiously recommend it for 3P coop players and single players, as I feel the former would leave one player bored (assuming they play on Classic, as Unlimited is simply too easy as far as I’m concerned) and the latter feels like it’s missing something. The game isn’t too hard either, making it perfect for both casual and hardcore players, though it does seem more casual. Nevertheless, it’s a nice little game that’s definitely worth your time.Do note, however, that the trailer (quite sadly) shows more of the DLC than the game itself. I’ll edit this when my friend and I get through the DLC, but know that it’s like a sequel (or a part 2) to the game; Trine 2 itself has 13 chapters and the DLC adds 7, to give you an idea. Who knows, maybe my complaints are fixed in the DLC?			"

If you are an achievement freak like myself, prepare for a challenge. Luckly, these devs here didn't go in the trend of making impossible multiplayer achievements (which is utterly annoying), and they can usually be obtained solo. Some few require multiplayer but they are more often than not just silly: stand on the top of the Knight's shield and so on.Also, it is SO PRETTY.			"

												Trine 2 continues the adventure of the same 3 heroes from Trine 1, with the same gorgeous graphics and awesome music and sound effects the Sequel excels in capturing everything from Trine 1 and improves on it. The levels are even more varied and much more lengthy, including new enemy types, new traps, more puzzles and even more collectibles. If you enjoyed the first game you most definitely need to pick up Trine 2! Trine 2 also includes an expansion pack which adds more levels and continues the adventure!			"

 A compelling game, that is at the forefront of the genre Genre: Puzzle PlatformerYea!-Gorgous Graphics-Multiple ways to pass each puzzle-lots of collectables to be had for 100%Meh!-Character Interaction and Story-Nice and simple combatBleh!-Same as Trine 1, not really anything added-Length, wish it was longer(will pick up DLC in future)The LowdownA nice and easy going puzzle platformer which is very forgiving. There are multiple solutions to every puzzle from swinging accross to making boxes to jump over. COmbat really is not a hidderance and mostly just there to break up the puzzles, which is not a bad thing at all. The game's art asthetics are just gorgous, the backgrounds are simply amazingly detailed, which you just have to be amazed by. There are tons of achievements to achieve if you are into that as well as many hidden objects to collect in each level for the scavenger. While not necessary a bad thing the game is more of an expansion to Trine 1, with not adding any new elements. But Trine 1 did everything great so its great they didn't tweak with the formula that works. AT about 7 hours it is a short game without the DLC, but I do plan on picking that up sometime in the future.Verdict: BUY IT [/b] "

												Stunning visuals and exquisite music are what set this game apart from other platformers. Every scene in Trine 2 is polished to perfection, making the variety of environments deeply immersive. The puzzles can be solved in a variety of different ways, giving much freedom of choice to the player. With 3 unique characters, the fighting mechanics of this game are surprisingly abundant and allow you to slay goblins and dragons with a multitude of combos. The DLC is included in the Complete Story and is a short, but equally amazing continuation of the story that is able to combine beautiful art, music, and gameplay.			"

												Best choice ever for this holiday. Both action, platformer and puzzle game. You use 3 characters and switch between them to solve puzzles that usually block paths in order to keep going further (you will also get ambushed by goblins during certain chapters). If you want your friends to help you solving the puzzles, you can invite them to join your party or, if they are at your home, they can play on a local co-op by pressing the Start button from their controllers (they will play as one of the other 2 characters). In the end it's a good puzzle-solving action game with a pretty creative style and puzzling.			"

												A very fun and interesting game; any individual can challenge him/herself by using only a character for a level (which is also part of the achievements).However, just like any other games, this game is not absolutely free of bugs - characters can somethings take damage even before an attack animation by the mummy mobs (can be a headache if you're playing hard HC) or die out of nowhere suddenly (in the 6th level of DLC expansion when you're standing on the goblin machine). This can really be a pain.Furthermore, if you are those who like to pursue achievements, some of them for this game can be extremely cancerous to complete, like the experience collection achievements. The devs like to hide some of these exp in places you can barely find without the help of forums and online tutorial videos.But all in all still a good game if you just want to have some fun relaxing gaming moments during leisure time.

												Trine 2 is less of a sequel, and more radical cosmetic surgery. Frozenbyte have exploded the formula into a beautiful, rainbow-sodden spectacle. You don't realise how few purple and green crystal-lit caverns there are out there, until you're forced to stop and bask in one. Trine is a fairytale platforming adventure, based around a magical floating sconce that's bound together the souls of a wizard, a knight and a thief. The story itself is sweet enough – perfectly charming and a shade too earnest – but what really drives you, beyond the irresistible instinct in platformers to travel to the right, is the satisfaction that's gained from solving the inventive physics-based puzzles. Playing solo, you can swap between characters instantly as you require their different skills. The Wizard can levitate objects, conjure boxes, and eventually planks, allowing him to bridge gaps and create steps. But he's all wizardy and crap in a fight, so tap him out when goblins and bosses appear. The Thief can fire a grappling hook and swing from wooden surfaces, and her bow makes her the best ranged fighter. Then there's the Warrior, who dishes out the melee damage with his sword, deflects lava with his shield, and smashes delicate stuff from afar with his hammer. If you've played the first game, you'll be thinking “well, this sounds pretty familiar. Shouldn't you be focusing on the new stuff?” The weakest thing about Trine 2 is how broadly identical it is to the first game. The energy bar has gone, and there's online co-op play, but Trine 2 amounts to a skill reset and a bunch of gorgeous new levels. The flexibility of the puzzles and the overlapping powers mean that often there's no pure, one-way solution. In particular, the Thief's agility becomes less essential as the Wizard learns to conjure more simultaneous objects. Solo, this doesn't matter. Multiplayer changes the nature of the game. First off, and this is such a superficial observation that I feel obliged to say it in a stupid way, it's nice to do a solve on a puzzle with a friend. The first Trine had local multiplayer, bizarrely hidden in a sub-sub-menu, but Trine 2 brings it to the main menu, and adds online matchmaking and text chat. It's now easy to drop into a game with strangers or pals. More fundamentally, dividing the powers between three players, instead of one player swapping between the powers as he sees fit, means that progress that could only previously be made by one character now has to be achievable by all three. Frozenbyte have addressed this in two ways. Firstly, the Wizard can levitate items that he's standing on in multiplayer. But life's too easy with a magic carpet. A more elegant solution is Unlimited mode. Tucked away in the 'host a game' options, this allows multiples of each class on screen. It's more chaotic, more flexible, and more fun. It solves some huffier moments, like when the Thief realises she's a complete spare wheel. And that moment where the Wizard decides to avoid a boss fight, hanging out by the partner-regenerating checkpoints while an endless stream of Thieves and Knights do the work. Trine 2 may retread a lot of old ground, but it's beautiful. It's like Frozenbyte are saying “Oh, did we make Trine? We meant this.” The same moderate puzzling challenge, the same characters, the same charm and some problems fixed.			"

												This game is sooo good. It's so shiny and dazzling %) Beautiful visuals and entertaining game play. Puzzles lack certain elegance, but are ok overall. I think it took a great improvement since the first Trine. While I never felt like to rerun a level in the first game, I do enjoy complete levels in Trine 2 over and over again. And I haven’t enjoyed co-op this much since Bionic Commando on PS3. That’s says a lot, trust me :) I really recommend this game. Really fun experience that you can share with your friends.			"

												As a newcomer to side scrolling genre, I was sceptical on how I will perceive the game on my point of view. This game was able to put my interest into any game that shares it genre. As for presentation, Frozenbyte shows us that this game is more than getting the character from the left side of the level to the right side of the level. Unlike any other games that sometimes can feel like chores playing them, this shows me otherwise. I was literally astonished by the beutiful background and some of the best ambient music in today's gaming.Apart from it's eye candy graphic and artwork, this game packed with the puzzle and gameplay. All of the puzzle that I encounter is not too hard but it requires some brain exercise on figuiring out which way is the best in cracking the puzzle. But, as the game progress, I found out that some of the puzzle can be easily bypassed by gravity field. It is not game breakiing, but it left me some bad taste in my mouth.In overall, this game set the bar high for any other games in side scrolling and platforming genre. I have tonnes of fun investing my hours into this game whether alone or with my best friend. Playing coop is highly recomended. If you guys into action fantasy type of game, this game is must owned.			"

												I don't think that I regret buying the game since I did have a fun time playing it. But I'm torn between whether source of that fun was the game or the fact that I occasionally got to kill my friend by being a straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I wouldn't go so far as to warn people off by the game by any means but at the same time I'm not going around telling anyone to buy it. But I guess that if you do have a few friends willing to try a co-op puzzle experience then Trine 2 wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for you to try out together.If you want to read a more detailed review of the game you can find it over here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/08/trine-2.html.

												The Good: Online co-op (finally!). Scenery so colorful you may go blind (in a good way). Awesome puzzle platforming that doesn't restrict your options (there's usually two or more ways to solve the trickiest puzzles, and the simple ones always have more). Unlimited character play so you can co-op with up to 3 wizards if you want, then switch to 3 thieves or 3 knights if need be. The boss battle at the end of the game (which I won't spoil) is freaking epic!The Bad: The Wizard used to be able (in the first game) to conjure 7 boxes, 6 planks and a triangle that floated, was grappleable, and could be made to explode, now he only conjures a maximum of 4 boxes OR planks, and the triangle is sadly missing (this is partially solved by playing in Unlimited mode, as each copy of the Wizard can have their own stack of 4 objects).The Ugly: What ""ugly""? This game is gorgeous!			"

												This is a game for you if you like platforming and lite puzzle solving. The game also features very stunning visuals throughout the entire playthrough. Most of the level backgrounds are impressive and give the platforming layout a nice sense of depth.Hard difficulty is recommended as the various traps can be run through in easy and medium difficulties without taking much damage. In hard difficulty you usually die instantly if you try to run through the traps like a headless chicken.Online co-op is available for maximum of 3 players which I highly recommend as every character has their distinctive (and important) roles to play. The character roles also become more apparent when you play co-op as you can't swap between the characters (like in offline) as you please (if you disable the option), but need to work together to overcome the obstacles. Plus, it's always funny when someone screws up and as a result the whole group dies instantly.The three playable characters are wizard, knight and thief.Wizard can conjure various metallic platforms to jump on and is especially useful to reach some of the very hard to reach places. He also has a cute wizard's hat which usually flies off hilariously when he dies.Knight has a shield + sword combo for defence, and to assist the wizard with platform creation he can magnetize the shield. Knight can use the shield to glide through the air like Mary Poppins.Knight also has a big hammer which he can use to bash enemies and break wooden objects.Thief is the nimble one as she can use grappling arrows to swing from wooden surface to another. She also has few stealth tricks to confuse the enemies, and can create low gravity bubble which comes in handy from time to time in co-op. In addition to normal arrows the thief can also shoot ice and fire/explosive arrows.The levels are scattered with experience bubbles and vials which are used to unlock all the abilities of the characters. In addition the levels feature treasure chests in various secret places which unlock poems and concept art that can be viewed from the main menu gallery.Checkpoints are frequent throughout the levels. Characters are healed (amount depends on difficulty) and resurrected at the checkpoints.Enemies are mostly goblins with various equipment like shields, spears and armour. The enemies drop experience and sometimes health pickups that heal every member of the party. Levels also have themed wild life which can both aid and hinder your progress.As a negative point the cutscenes cannot be skipped in multiplayer which isn't a problem in first playthrough, but can become tedious if you're planning to play it through more than once in co-op.

												This game is incredibly beautiful, both visually and the music. It's a fun puzzle game where you play as either a humble Wizard, a brave Knight or a sneaky Thief who are on a quest to see where the Trine takes them this time. Not so much fun to play alone perhaps, but if you have a friend to play it with, it's an amazing little game with a lot of character. I'd really recommend it if you like these sort of games or just appreciate the beauty.			"

												I don't know if this counts as a review, but:I'd recommend this game for its beautiful art, theme song (and the OSTs: listened and still loving it) and fun gameplay( controls are fluid IMHO); solo or multiplayer. Of course it's even more fun when multi, because sometimes you get sabotaged and die :pEven the voice-acting and dialogues are hilarious at times.Trine 2 even has an interesting storyline to it, what more I can ask for?I think this is the first OMG-it's so fun to play physics puzzle game I've ever played. You learn new ways to get past obstacles if you replay the levels, especially if you want to get all the achievements.Hardcore&hard mode involves a lot of 'OMG! OMG!' and 'NOOOOO....' from me X)			"

												I don't want to get into details about the game, because you can try it with the demo version. It is simply beautiful, with enchanting music, not spectacular but good story,  some action and some physics based puzzles. If you are looking for a great couch co-op game, then look no further. Also consider getting the Complete Story pack, but Trine 2 will be the most outstanding part in this bundle. My daughters simply love this game. Thumbs up.P.S. At the moment I keep a tally on two game music composers: Matt Uelmen for Diablo 1/2 and Ari Pulkkinen for Trine 1/2			"

												One of my favorite games on Steam. Fantastic platformer with fun puzzles and combat. You can switch between the 3 different characters at any time, and each one has different upgradeable abilities and weapons, so you can play according to what play style suits you best. The game is beautiful both visually and audio-wise. Overall Trine 2 is much improved over the first game (which itself was really great already). I totally recommend both this game and its predecessor for any gamer!			"

												Trine 2 is a pretty fantastic 2D puzzle-side scroling/platformer. Don't judge me by my playtime, since I already  play the first one for a decent amount of time, and I must say that Trine 2, stays true to the original while improving every aspect from the first one.  Beautiful graphic and clever , well thought mechanic is the strong point of Trine 2 (also 1).Story (9/10)Since I just play a small amount of time on this game and haven't got at least a quarter of the journey yet, I leave this one mostly at 'pending'. You probably ask why I give it a 9, its solely because of the excellent, bedtime-fairy tale story narrative, the narrator is just plain amazing. And I really look forward for the rest of the story, so far it has an excellent main pot, setting, and pace.Graphic (11/10)For a 2D side scrolling, Trine and Trine 2 offer a very distinct art style and stunning background, lifelike, and capture the fantasy setting perfectly. The graphic is the first thing that caught my attenttion to this game. I'm not  a fan of 2D platformer with 3D background, hell.. I find most of the background-character combination is just bland and dull, I'd rather play a full 2D platformer. But Trine manages to do it flawlessly. No or really rare platformer treat your eyes  like this. The set pieces are also varied, atleast until now, but I can see the creativity in there, I bet I'll see many more gorgeous places as I go through. It's purely beyond amazing. Gameplay (10/10)Balanced, well thought, unique, diverse, and clever. I like on how you solve the puzzle, its not 'linear', with 3 characters available, you can choose a variety of ways to solve the puzzles. The map layout is one of the best layout I've ever seen in a platformer-puzzle game. Also, this game make an intellegent use of its physic. Overall its fun and of course challenging without being unreasonable / over the top. What I meant with ""over the top"" is in many puzzle game (not only platformer), the puzzle is like..complicated, complicated in a way that its breaking the fourth wall, I mean..when I solve the puzzle, I was like..uhh..really? Trine didn't fal lto that category, the solutions are logical. If I can name other game, it'd be Portal 2, the same unique concept with 'ordinary but creative' problem solving method.Music (9/10)Another game which has an amazing soundtrack, when I can say a game OST is amazing? Its when the soundtrack is well placed and help to set out of the mood. Conclusion (9/10)Apart from the story, its a great game so far, I'm looking forward to find another great places, puzzles, and when the story unfold. Stunning graphic, awesome music, and consistently great gameplay and puzzles are the reasons why I could give a high score on my really early review.P.S: I probably won't review Trine 1, since Trine 2 is a much improved version of Trine 1, so my review will be the same for both game anyway.

												Trine 2 has easily earned its rightful place as one of my favourite videogames of all time. Absolutely gorgeous, fairly intelligent and easy to play, the game is eye candy through and through. The mechanics are fun to manipulate and I love the fact that levels can't be solved with just one way in most cases. Another aspect of the game I thoroughly enjoy is the voice acting. It's pretty obvious that the game is meant to appeal to a younger audience as well, but it still manages to avoid cheesy liners, instead delivering clever dialogue and amusing conversations. If you're looking for something relaxing that looks and sounds good do yourself a favour and buy Trine 2.			"

												Trine 2: ːcsgostarːːcsgostarːːcsgostarːːcsgostarːOne word for this game: Amazing.First of all, let's talk about the art style. I particularly love games with good art style maybe 'cause I like to draw, and this game has a great graphic in terms of art style. So much vibrant colors, sometimes a exuberant jungle with a lot of tones of green, or a desert; dark caverns, frozy mountains and much more. One place richer in detail then other.Another thing... there are puzzles, a lot of them!! Not so hard that anybody can solve them :D each puzzle require some kind of skill from our characters. Even with so much puzzle, this game doesn't becomes boring 'cause always can change your current char ːsteamhappyːI didn't give it five stars 'cause sometimes the physics in the game doesn't work correctly. Without this, I can say that I enjoy the game!			"

												Trine 2 CS is an enchanting 2D side scroller game that steps into the realm of realism and jaw dropping graphics. Trine 2 bestow us with spectacular scenarios with ever changing level dynamics that shifts its paradigm with every level, the level of detail immerse you and binds you deeply into the game.Trine 2 offers gameplay that is far more challenging and enticing than the previous version - Trine2 is a far cry from its predecessor in all the department and completely sets the benchmarks when it comes to 2D side scroller games. The lush , vibrant and detailed environment grasp you and moves you towards it. The Goblin Menace DLC deserves a special mention since it takes the game to a whole new level both in term of variety and features - loaded with new abilities and off the charts looks this is perhaps the best DLC ever created for any game.Topped with brilliant music that soothes you and gels well with the game dynamics - the highs and low provide a perfect blend with the ever changing moments in the game. The really intriguing aspect of the game is the gameplay - a whopping 20+ hours of normal gameplay is not expected specially from an indie developer which obviously came as a surprise. You can stretch anywhere between 40-50 hours if you gunning for 100% achievements.Aside from few lackluster boss level (which is good but not groundbreaking ) and some minor glitches here and there - Trine 2 is a gamer delight - oozing with beautiful graphics, bright colour, great gameplay with ever changing dynamics and tactics makes the game a must have item in your game library. Here's hoping that the next installment will be even more challenging and gorgeous than ever. "

												The story isn't interesting and the checkpoint system is kinda dumb. Everything else is fun. Gameplay is cool, maybe even better with three instead of two players. And there are always various possibilities to get ahead. The artdesign is amazing, while you shouldn't have big expectations soundwise.Trine 2 with the DLC (""Complete Story"") will entertain you for more than 8 hours. It's worth buying it during summer/winter sale. 8/10			"

												Did you want yet more platforming adventures like the original Trine? To once again take on the role of the three intrepid hero’s on another adventure? Then this is definitely the game for you.This game is just stunning to look at. The backgrounds are designed beautifully and drag you into a fantasy world that just screams to be explored. Every level offers something new and exciting. With so many varied climates and locals this really does feel like an epic adventure, even more so than the original.This platformer took everything its predecessor did and multiplied it by 3. The gameplay is super fun, again like the first one there are always multiple ways to finish each challenge, whether it be by brute force or graceful finesse there is a play style to suit you. I loved the differences between each hero and how all their skills complimented each other. The story is great, it has far more depth than the original. With the clues as to what happened scattered throughout the adventure I was very eager to see its conclusion. Also with the addition of the complete story DLC another mini adventure awaits that is very enjoyable. From start to finish this title is phenomenal.I loved this game to no end. I don’t usually like platforming but this is just too good to pass up. Just the right amount of challenge. You would be a fool not to get this even at full price and now with the DLC included there is no excuse not to try this game. Just make sure to play the original one first, after all that game is great too.Have fun ^_^			"

This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Trine 2 then skip to Results and read from there.Frozenbyte strikes again with a continuation of to the epic Trine series. Trine 2 takes all the great aspects of the original and makes it so much better. With improved graphics, smoother gameplay, better character customization, and more levels Trine 2 is a brilliant continuation.Story:The kingdom has recovered from the turmoil that struck in Trine. The heroes are being summoned again by the powerful Trine. Goblins have attacked the kingdom again, but who are they being led by. Crown Princess Rosabel asks them to help her rid her kingdom of the evil that if not dealt with will destroy everything.  As you progress you will learn about the Rosabel and her sister Isabel. How did the kingdom change since the last adventure and why did the Trine summon the same heroes? Campaign:The campaign consists of thirteen levels which start off with a brief tutorial as seen in the original and twelve additional levels. The levels are a lot longer than in the original offering more puzzles and secrets. Throughout the campaign you will fight three bosses each more challenging than the last. You will find secret poems, portraits, and more throughout the campaign which make you want to go back and search over again. Gameplay:Trine 2 gives you the same characters as the original: Amadeus (the wizard), Pontius (the knight), and Zoya (the thief). Unlike the original Trine there are no real items in this version just the basic experience orbs/jars, health potions, and chests with secrets inside. The skill trees are different than in the first one as well, they offer about the same amount of abilities. These abilities let you conjure more items, and use them in different ways. In Trine 2 you play as one character as a time, but you can switch though them instantly. If one of the characters die you respawn as one of the other two characters nearby. The brilliant combat system allows you to choose how you play the game. You can be hack ‘n slash melee hero (the Knight), a magical spell user (the Wizard), or an archer (the Thief). Results:Trine 2 is an epic platformer that pushes the ideas of original series by combining puzzle solving, hack ‘n slash, platformer, and RPG into a single game. The campaign offers secret items, poems and portraits, which reveal even more depth to the story. The brilliant story combined with beautiful level design and hundreds of secrets creates a fantastic game that does justice to the amazing series. Trine 2 is a game I would buy a full price and offers much more than other platformers, but if you are unsure and can get it on sale then I wouldn’t hesitate for a second. Pros:+Character customization+Amazing story+Beautiful scenery and level design+Elegant music and ambience+Fantastic combat systems+Awesome boss fights that keep you pressed+Brilliant voice acting and cut-scenesCons:-Removed items that allowed you to further customize your characters			"

												Trine 2 is undoubtedly the sequel Trine deserves. Stepping up and changing several things to make the game somewhat different than it's predecessor. Let's begin with the graphics, for a start. The back drops for each level provide each stage with variety. From lush green woodlands to a witches' home scattered with books, potions etc. Each stage is different and unique. Providing different puzzles and secrets to find. The puzzles are very similar to the first game. Using Amadeus the wizard to move blocks and Zoya to climb up to otherwise unreachable areas, and of course Pontius just killing stuff for the most part. The puzzles do sometimes have a certain level of challenge but for the most part can be solved by knocking heads with your friend(s) and working it out. As I mentioned in the previous review of Trine, this is undoubtedly a series that is best played friends, for the full experience. But if you do happen to be somewhat of a Billy no mates then you can play alone, which does however make the puzzle solving seem a little more difficult. The characters, as previously mentioned are the same as the first game;Zoya the Thief, Amadeus the Wizard and Pontius the knight all with their signature qualities. The level up system still exists as well allowing you to gain various useful abilities to help you solve particular puzzles or just kill enemies quicker. The characters themselves also seem fairly three dimensional, in terms of personality, compared to the first game. Pontius is a kind hearted yet fairly clueless knight. Zoya is a strong willed thief and Amadeus is a fairly cowardly wizard, who at times comes across as a bit of a perv too.Trine 2 is definitely worth a look if you've played the previous iteration of the series or enjoy the challenge of platforming and puzzling. A wonderfully looking game and definitely worth a look. Good Day!			"

												You and your friends are in a puzzling situation, as there are plants shooting straight upwards in a big gap infront of you, you say to your friend, playing as the thief, ""how should we cross without diing?"" and he says ""i have an idea"" and he switches to the mage, he creates a block and tells you to jump on, you do so, and he slowly moves the crate across the map with his magic ability, once you are across, you switch to the mage, and he jumps on, letting you guide the block towards where you are.In this lovely little game, you will expierience much harder challenges, i just told this one because it was quick enough to tell. This game is truly boring in single player, make sure you have a friend to go along with you :) otherwise the expierience is boring, you can hold up to 3 players, and the server is non-hamachi, so anyone can make it. the graphics, even on lowest setting, look very beautiful and the music is amazing, and if you get its dlc Goblin menace you get a special ability along with the ones you already have, such as, for the thief who wields a bow, a special arrow that once it hits any solid area, will make a big bubble, anything in side the bubble expierences low gravity, this allows players to jump through the bubble and get a bit of a jump boost beause of the low gravity, the special for the knight is he can hold his shield over his head and use it as a glider, the wizard, or mage can magnetize the object he makes, so that he can make an airship, or a platform on a wall, AGAIN YOU CAN ONLY GET THESE THREE POWERS IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE DLC, the dlc also  comes with the complete pack, which happens to be on sale at the moment. Heres someting i love about trine 2, say you are hosting a private server, and you have the dlc, but your friend doesnt (this actually just happened in a match i was in, i had the dlc) what will happen is your friend cant unlock the special powers, but the one with the dlc can, this makes up for some interesting teamwork,magnitize this, low grav bubble that, fly across here.now here is how you unlock powers, you have to collect 50... gems, we will call them, once you collect 50 gems you get one lvl up point, you can use that level up point on abilities. the most points it takes to unlock the ability that requires the most, is 4, and gems arent too rare, but i do suggest trying to get every one you see, the abilities are VERY helpful, maybe you need to solve something so you an get over a wall OR unlock the low gravity bubble and just jump over it, you need to take advantage of the abilities you unlock, they are helpfull.If you seriously read all that, feel free to friend me, and congratulations for being awesome, you diserve  this :)http://www.pinterest.com/pin/341851427934625882/ "

												Trine 2 is everything the gorgeous, satisfying, and creative original Trine was, just a little greater. Each character has a greater selection of abilities which means a greater range of solutions to every problem. The greater number of levels each feel themselves greater: more entrancing, more extravagant, more epic. The storyline... hasn't changed much, which is to say that it still barely exists and that still suits the overall experience. There's no need to play this series in order as there's so little to miss. Even mixing levels from the later Goblin Menace expansion into the main campaign of the original wouldn't lead to much confusion, save for the loss of all those new abilities. The new highest difficulty, however, is noticeably more punishing than the original's, and sadly this isn't a good thing. Trine 2's Hard plus Hardcore setting has more of an effect on combat than any other aspect, which is by far the game's weakest feature. Trine is, after all, a puzzle game at its core and once established, it's difficult to make a puzzle harder without mucking it up with added complexity. And complexity isn't what Trine's about. It's about relatively simple people on a relatively simple quest acting creatively.			"

												Trine 2 is one of that fair games where you just know hot it goes all since the start. While the storyline is not a complicated trouble, it allows the player(s) to have a fun and fluid game experience, with few combat encounters and many puzzles, most of them with more than just one way to get over them.Trine 2 allows you to play solo or coop, being the Wizard, the Warrior or the thief, any of them with their own skills, and many puzles will need the combinated partnership of all them. This game goes on his better when you have 2 mates to play with, but still as a solo adventure will grant you many hours of enternaiment.This game offer also a beautiful music and visual experience, whle being a 2D working, Trine 2 shows some incredible scenaries, and the soundtrack will get you deep into the game.

You play as three heroes joined together by this magical artifact called the trine and you progress through the levels by switching between the three (mage, rogue fighter).  There are usually multiple ways to solve puzzles but I do think had a little too much emphasis on the mage.  Also has a co-op mode but haven't tried that yet.

It's your friends because this game has nearly infinite ways for you and your friends to ♥♥♥♥ eachother over, for example you can destroy platforms under your friend to let them fall into certain death, deflect firebolts into your friends, levitate chests so they can't jump up, destroy everything the magician builds or as it happened to me hold a burning explosive barrel above the thief while she's falling down so the rope hits the barrel and instead of beeing safed she pulls herself into the explosion.... I hate my friends.... and my life.10/10 the last time I've hated a friend this much was in Super Mario Party 5			"

												Hands down one of the most beautiful looking games ever made, gorgeous detailed environments, vibrant colors, great sound, lighting, controls are tight and responsive, physics are spot on, characters are charming and unique. Puzzles are fun, you can approach them in different ways. This game will fully immerse you in its fantasy world when you play it. All around a superb little gem. I highly recommend this title even if just for the looks alone its worth it.			"

												This game is incredible! The puzzles and challenges were really well made, and the co-op is amazingly fun! The ability to combine the different skills from the 3 heroes allow you to solve puzzles in uncountable ways. One of the combinations I use the most is the archer's anti-gravity sphere with the mage's large plank, creating a floating bridge. That pretty much allows you to go over a large gap without any trouble. Gather one or two friends and be creative together!A must-buy, for sure.			"

												Trine 2 is another excellent puzzle platformer from Frozenbyte. It is very similar to the original Trine, especially compared to the Trine Enchanted Edition which uses the same engine. This review is for Trine 2 Complete Story, which includes both the original campaign and the Goblin Menace DLC.Trine 2 offers some of the best puzzle platforming out there with gorgeuous art, beautiful soundtrack and fun fairytale world and story. Compared to the original Trine, the leveling works little bit differently, the three characters have slightly different abilities and there's no item system anymore. The core gameplay is still hugely enjoyable, and mainly consists of fun physics based puzzles and  simple combat. Especially with the Goblin Menace DLC the game is also a fair bit longer than the original Trine.My main complaint would be the low difficulty level. Even on hard most of the combat encounters are rather easy and adjusting the difficulty level does little to the physics puzzles. At least the game adds some new elements to its puzzles like water and steam to keep things interesting.Goblin Menace DLC adds a decent amount of levels and beautiful new environments. The level design is not quite as fun as the original campaign and it's rather light on story elements, but it's still a great piece of extra content. In the Complete Edition both the main campaign and the DLC can be played back to back.Between the superb art and fun gameplay Trine 2 is easy to recommended to anyone who likes puzzle platformers.The good:- Superb art- Great soundtrack- Excellent Lost Vikings inspired gameplay with fun physics-based puzzles- Interesting fairytale worldThe bad:- Puzzles are too easy as the physics engine is trivial to abuseThe ugly:- Zoya's animations can sometimes get stuck- Got stuck in the Belly of the Beast level due to a bug, reload fixed the issue			"

Well earned 10/10A very well made jumping + puzzle solving side-scroller that provided WAY more fun than expected.The grafics are very beautiful, the artstyle is detailed and nice to look at. You can tell that there was a lot of effort put into making this game.Puzzles are challenging (if you want to reach all the upgrade points) and very fun to solve, but nice and fairly easy if you just want to get to the end of each level. So it offers both challenge and simple playthrough at once - which I absolutely appreciate.The story is a little childish but interesting to follow. Nothing to strange or uncommen rather typical fantasy stuff nicely writen and very simple to understand with a little touch of fun along the ride.I absolutely recommend this game if you are into side scrolling / adventure / puzzle games with fantasy background.

												This game is a truly wonderful experience; the fun that can be had while playing with a loved one or a friend makes it a must have. I have some very fond memories of this game and the laughter that it brought to my ex-girlfriend and me while playing. She wasn't a gamer, but this game was an exception for her as she enjoyed the co-op and found it fun. It was a great treat to share a hobby with someone I cared about. For that, I will always be greatful to Trine 2. For anyone wondering if they should purchase this game or who has someone that they want to spend time with and make memories (or simply have fun) you should immediately purchase this game. The combat is both fun and easy making it easily accessible to all types of gamers and different ages. The characters,  the environment, soundtrack, and visuals are endearing and truly magical. There will be plenty of times you will find yourself simply marveling at the world you have entered. To all potential buyers; I hope that you enjoy this game and make plenty of memories that you will cherish. This one purchase that you won't regret and is a good purchase even at full price.			"

												Oh man. If you enjoy platformers, this is a great game to play.This game is amazing even if you are just playing solo, but it definitely shines as a cooperative experience.The aethetics are GREAT! So much detail in every part of the level. You have to switch between 3 characters (rogue/wizard/warrior) to complete different puzzles, and there is an upgrading tree that is simple, but well-done.The instructions are very seamless and easy to use (and you even start off in an interative menu screen).The puzzles are actually quite challenging, as you have to juggle the abilities of 3 different characters (ex: wizard creates boxes/moves objects, rogue swings around, warrior breaks things). Admittedly, I have had to resort to ""cheating"" in the form of my friend levitating 2 of us through puzzles we couldn't figure out. There are also some very nice tricks you can figure out depending on who you like to play as. For example, the ROGUE can shoot gravity arrows that can annoy your friends, slow down animations [remember aesthetics are GREAT], or slow down flamethrowers or those cannons that keep melting you in the face. That being said, the rogue has an improved jump (if it's against a wall/ledge) and the gravity arrow not only increases your ENTIRE party's jump, but also allows you to effectively leave your other 2 friends behind since you no longer need the wizard to levitate you anywhere.The rogue can also uselessly latch onto (applicable) surfaces with her swing, and watch as your other members try to solve a puzzle or make it across a gap of wooden supports that are touch-sensitive -  which means that she could also trigger them with said swing right before a warrior's landing, causing him to fall to an untimely death.The WIZARD can use loopholes (depending on your settings) to levitate yourself or your friends, and will also be your main character for solving puzzles and dealing with hazards since he is the only character with object manipulation. For example, you might need the wizard to hold a platform above a flaming ground of death. Or you could also pull that log just a little to the right so that your rogue misses her spider-man swing, falling to her death. There are a lot of pipe-based puzzles (for diverting air currents or flames), and the solutions for those are not always cookie-cutter - you might have to bash that pipe to get it to orient the correct way.The WARRIOR is your tank/fighter. His shield can negate hazards like flamethrowers, those cannons that melt your face off, and he is basically the person everyone will run to when enemies spawn. Some encounters have several enemies spawn with archer support, and, as always, everyone will run to the warrior for protection. The fighting can become a challenge if you are playing solo (or have moved on ahead of your friends), so levelling up the warrior's skill tree can be useful for survivability.  There are also many obstacles that can only be destroyed by the warrior's hammer (or later, by a levelled-up fire arrow from the rogue).Trine 2's biggest beauty, however, is the cooperative aspect.Oh man.I have laughed 5 minutes straight on Skype trying to watch one of my friends (wizard) jump onto a platform but couldn't because of his own conjured box. I have laughed 5 minutes straight just from 2 of us dying and having to watch the 3rd person march over to a (usually very close by) respawn point.I have laughed countless times from a mistake from the wizard causing one or more members of the party to die.I play a rogue.

-Quick Review-Trine 2, is a 2D platformer that combines three different heroes into one (if you’re playing single player) or select one hero and work with two or three friends to try to complete the various puzzles in the game.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You are summoned by the Trine (A mysterious Dwarven object), which links a Wizard “Amadeus” , a Knight “Pontius” and a thief/entrepreneur “Zoya” together to save the kingdom. The story itself is put together like a bed time story, very straight forward and amusing to listen to.Game Play: (note, at this time 06/20/14 – I have not played the original Trine) As has been hinted above in the story section, you can switch between three very different heroes. You can actually complete the levels without switching at all, but generally switching makes solving puzzles much easier.There is a little bit of combat where you need to smash in some Goblin heads, but the most challenging aspect of the game is the environments which are definitely out to kill me. Plenty of death holes in the ground.There is also a quaint leveling system in the game, when you collect “experience orbs” you level up and are given a skill point to assign to a character and ability. By upgrading skills you make puzzle solving much easier and often times dynamic. I’ve solved puzzles with Amadeus’s boxes that I could have done faster and easier the “correct way”. But that aspect gives the game a sense of freedom.Multi-player:  I had the privilege to play this game with a friend, and let me say this game is amazingly more fun to play with one or two friends. The difference is that if you are playing with others, you are limited to which character you play as. If you’re playing with just one friend, which leaves one free character either of you can switch or rotate with. (For us, it was Pontius… Sorry buddy, you’re good at fighting, not at plat forming). Achievements: Here’s the basic break down for the achievements: Collect all the things, Find all the things, Do a few special things with each character, then Beat the game on Hard core mode on Hard difficulty, and you’ll have all the achievements.The game has 97 achievements, I was surprised that a game like Trine 2 had so many achievements, but it provided a great deal of entertainment and a fair bit of replay-ability to get the rest of the achievements.Price: The price for Trine 2 is $19.99. I played 30 hours (and that will increase as I work on getting the hard core achievements) that is a pretty fair price for how much time I’ve put into it. Good news though! We are in the Steam Summer sale (06/20/14)! The game is on sale right now for 85% off, in other words the game is $2.99 That is a great deal, if you’ve been wanting to play a platformer puzzle fantasy game, now is your time. You have until June 30th to get it at this current price.If you’re still not sure if you’d like to play it or not, you can also download a demo to test out first; you can’t be persuaded anymore than that. Conclusion: I really enjoyed the game. If you’re just looking to relax and play a fantasy adventure game, I highly recommend this game. It was fun to play, not overly difficult however the Hardcore kicked my butt; it’s not something you’ll just waltz through. But the easiest difficulties make the game seem very friendly.			"

Posted: November 27, 2013
												Another spectacular,mesmerizing,gorgeous,endearing and utterly charming entry.A definite Downloadable GOTY of 2011.I loved the first Trine. The game came out of nowhere and blew me away. My friend and I finished the game on co-op although I had to plow through the last agonizing and infuriating level by myself, but that's beside the point.If anyone ever played and loved Lost Vikings on Sega, this game is definitely for you. This Nvidia phys X physics engine is still limited to a two dimensional game but I can see it expanding further. Although this time around the engine can pump out even pretties graphics and textures which I didn't think was possible.The soundtrack is amazing, it calms down your nerves and makes you forget about all the worries in the world. The author was the one who made the soundtrack for the Angry Birds by the way. The narration is realistic and believable. The game once again feels like watching and playing a fantasy tale. At times, I simply wished to simply run forward and sink in the world of Trine without any enemies or obstacles. I just wanted to enjoy the foreground, the background, the physics, the tessellation particles, etc.As with the first game, you collect vials and then use them for upgrades. 90% of the vials are more or less easy to obtain, much like in the first game; and there are several ways of obtaining almost every vial. You no longer retain your upgrades and abilities from the first game, so you have to reacquire the old ones as well as obtain only a couple of new ones.Apparently the story takes place a few years after the first game. The awkward alleged womanizer wizard Amadeus is older now and is now a family man. Pontius is still the dumb and fearless fat knight and Zoya is still the same slender thief.The trio is quickly reunited for a quest to save the kingdom, again.The thief is still my personal favorite character to play. The acrobatics are still rewarding to conduct and you want to pat yourself on the back every time you manage to shoot the grappling hook as you fall to your death and suspend yourself in mid air. The thief will be the one to get most of the vials, artifacts and other miscellaneous collectibles (like drawings and poems) from hard-to-reach areas anyway. However, later on the wizard becomes extremely effective since you are then able to conjure several items and be able to float yourself and the entire party across impassable lands.The physics and the general precision is once again impeccable. The story now introduces orcs as opposed to the same old boring skeletons and other creatures. There are a handful of bosses still and they are fun to battle. The melee system is still as refined as in part 1. You can block, swing, shoot arrows and use the environment to your advantage (for instance dropping a rock onto an enemy while playing as a Wizard)The game CAN get frustrating sometimes, especially when you attempt again and again to jump on that ledge or attempt to swing over and get that orb or vial. It's not the fault of the controls per se, it's the physics and the gravity that often prevent you from conducting flawless maneuvers.The game apparently also has more replay value than the first one. There are more unlockables and extras this time. Once you finish the game, you can start a new game + and experience some new things, allegedly. PLUS, this time we get online co-op. Yes, thank you very much. Whereas the first game only featured a 2 player offline co-op, someone always had to be the brains and play as the two characters most of the time. Not this time. Now you can play as one of the three characters. You can use either text or voice chat to coordinate movement. I strongly recommend playing this game in co-op mode. It might get repetitive at times, but no puzzle is every the same so there is still enough variety, plus I don't think I saw a single piece of environment being recycled.In general the game is quite easy. It does not call for a repeated frustration. There are plenty of checkpoints that will resurrect your dead companions and there are almost always more than one way of overcoming an obstacle.The bottom line is that this game makes you regret that the world of Trine is only confined to a video game.

												Trine 2 is one of those rare sequels that completely eclipses it's predecessor. Trine 2 surpasses the original in terms of content, mechanics, graphics, lore; nearly everything is a step up! The only aspect worse than the original (although opinion), is the music. Trine 2 is an experience that none should miss! I highly recommend this game for it's enjoyable story, exceptional mechanics, absolutely entertaining cooperative play, and extremely unique replayability.			"

												If you have never played either Trine or Trine 2, I recommend you play Trine first, not an absolute must though. I bought the Trine complete pack (1&2 + DLC) for a little less than 3€ (=$4) and now after I've played both of them through, I can say I could've paid a lot more for an experience so good. The game works in every aspect an adventure game should, but really shines in visuals: everything is SO beautiful I just sometimes stand there for a while looking at everything. The gameplay is great too and even gets a lot better in Trine 2. The voice actors are lovely to listen to (seriously) and the story is childishly funny, and a bit obvious in that childish way too. It does fit the game though! Overall rating from me: 9/10			"

Get it while you can!So-----------------+ graphics+ soundtrack+ fun puzzles + stable singleplayer° Story is not that complex... but some people care about that and some don't- rather short campaign (depends on wether you want to collect all the stuff [experience, poems, paintings] or not)- Puzzles are sometimes too easy- even in hard mode (difficulty however...... doesn't affect the puzzles but the strength of the enemy mobs).

												I'm not one for puzzle games. In fact, I'm terrible at puzzle games; so much that I end up frustrated and jumping off metaphorical cliffs in agony every time I play one. ButTrine 2, ah my friend, this may be the most beautiful game I have ever played. The environment and the colours, the characters and their movements and skills make me forget I'm playing that puzzle solving I always dread. And I actually enjoy it!Love how you can switch between the three characters and combine their skills to advance.Absolutely worth it.			"

You have a wizard a thief (archer) and a warrior. All have upgrades  so spend your experiance points wise because you need all 3 chars to get thru.			"

The trine returns to our heroes, the rogue, wizard and fighter and takes them on another journey, which doesn't last very long, yet is entertaining and very fun to play out in coop.The Complete Story also features some post-story gameplay about a Goblin vendetta against the human race. This game has some awesome graphics and offers a ton of laughs when playing together with a buddy.Final verdict 8/10+Neat story, very fun in coop, great graphics in each of the levels- Some puzzles are harder to solve than the end bosses are to defeat			"

But still that's a great game, a jewel in many ways. Beautiful, stylish, magical, colourfull and sparkling. 100% Worth playing.			"

												This game has absolutely amazing graphics and the fun but effective gameplay grabs you from the first few minutes till you are hooked. I love the switching of the characters and the games chapters are well thought out and never repeated making this game a real pleasure to play. I hope there are more games in the Trine series on the way soon ;0}.			"

												Trine 2 is an amazing game. Especially with 3-player co-op. It is more of a puzzle type game with you having to work with each team member (who each have special abilities) to complete a certain area. The graphic are one of the stand out features hovever. The world looks so beautiful especially the water, the underwater areas are the best looking parts of the game.I would recommend this game, however, after about 3 hours of playing, the areas began to feel a bit repetitive in terms of gameplay, but still a great game in general.8/10			"

												This is an example that you don't need an movie-like action game or a CoD replica to make a game. For those of you who already play platform games rub your eyes and prepare to witness some beautiful gaming. For those of you who aren't really into these games (and didn't immediately reject it before reading the reviews) I implore you to give it a try and experience a completely unique experience. Beautiful designs beyond comparisson, diverse gameplay with many different ways to solve any puzzle and a multiplayer option for a most enjoyable co-op session.			"

The Gameplay is solid with Excellent connectivity In the online cooprative Mode. So if you grab 2 other friends, you can jump, Slash and Build your way through Trine 2's Gorgous Landscape.

												Trine 2 is a wonderful experience that is best enjoyed with a friend or two. The cooperative play is surprisingly fluid, with multiple ways to solve a puzzle and work together with any of the three classes (even your own). The game's technology and general look is far from outdated, and is still quite pretty even when compared to more recent titles. All in all, this is another must-have to add to your collection.			"

												Trine 2 is a puzzle/adventure platforming game as ingenious as it is stunning. If you like puzzles, thinking outside of the box, and... bopping goblins? You will probably fall in love with Trine 2 in a heartbeat!Below is a list of attributes pertaining to Trine 2, and some personal opinion in regards to how they did.STORY: 4/10""Feels like it's missing something... Oh, yes! More goblins!""I'll give Trine 2 a cookie for being relatively unique compared to most other games. The execution is fine, though the game does leave you feeling like there should be more. Additionally, some aspects of the plot can be seen coming a mile away. Fortunately, there's at least one or two good twists in store. For the sake of spoilers though, I won't disclose them here. The story of Trine 2's is not one to be taken seriously.Of course, you weren't looking to play this for the story, were you?GAMEPLAY: 7/10""Think of it as a test of manhood. Or mousehood.""Earning a few extra points for its fairly clever implementation of skills and the three heroes, Trine 2 really lets you play the game in your own style, be it through finesse, sheer force, or stuffing boxes into sacred places they clearly don't belong! If you get stuck at some point or confused, the narrator offers some clues on how to proceed. Compared to most games that babysit you along, this is much more preferrable.Admittedly, the controls do take a little getting used to, and even Normal Difficulty can be downright brutal if you're new to the game. Thankfully, a lot of the achievements (if you're OCD like I am) can be obtained without getting your rear end handed to you. Some are possible right at the main menu! *Hint, hint.*DESIGN: 10/10""No pixel was spared.""Trine 2 is outrageously beautiful. Beautiful to the point of losing sight of your character on the screen! ... Seriously, this happened to me playing it. But that's okay because Trine 2 is a literal slideshow of eye candy and scenic splendor. Rewarding to watch just in its own right. Being able to play in it, let alone interact with it, is an added bonus.Perhaps the nicest part about its shiny graphics is that you don't have to cash in on your life insurance policy to make a system capable of running it. Even with a simple dual-core PC, Trine 2 runs magnificently at high detail.SUMMARY: 7 out of 10.Normally, I detest games that emphasize graphics since they usually have horrible gameplay and/or story about as in-depth as a piece of cardboard. Trine 2's storyline isn't the greatest, but it makes up for it in its unique and fluid style, gameplay, as well as the lovely panoramic scenes the game immerses you into. It's a game that isn't trying to sell you some epic story or brand-spanking new mechanic... It's just fun to play! "

												This is an excellent puzzle platformer with a bit of light combat thrown in. The story is told in short failtale verses and the occasional simple cutscenes between levels. The controls handle nicely and are fairly easy to pick up as the game does a good job of introducing each skill as the player unlocks them through defeating monsters and gathering collectables. Multiplayer is also handled wonderfully and is supported in both online and local for up to 3 players, with the option of each player either sharing the 3 heros or having their own set of heros to switch between freely.However, by far the most impressive part of this game is the presentation of the levels. Each level (or chapter) of the game is absolutely beautiful, every part of the environment feels completely organic and looks as if it was pulled right out of a fairytale. Each level is also packed with multiple puzzles, many of which are obstacles needed to be solved in order to advance while others are simply to hide experiance items and unlockables.The difficulty isn't too hard for the most part, but some of the puzzles can take a bit of luck to work properly, while others can be solved in a multitude of ways. This can be made easier depending on which of the heros is leveled up an which of their skills are unlocked first. The Wizard mainly for creating boxes and platforms, moving heavy objects and solving puzzles. The Knight is primarily for combat and protecting the others from either enemies or environmental hazards. The Theif is easily the most mobile and focused on platforming with her grappling hook, but can also assist in combat with her bow.If you're even slightly interested in platformers I would highly recommend this game.My only suggestion is that while the mouse and keyboard controls work well enough, I would recommend using a controller to play as the game felt more natural to be played with one and thus was much more enjoyable once I plugged it in.

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous problem-solving game that I missed out on for way too long.  It has challenges requiring the use of multiple characters that will remind any SNES fan of The Lost Vikings, but with graphics to match the modern day.  Interestingly, most problems have multiple solutions, even allowing you to use just 1 of the 3 characters to get through whole stages.  On top of that, it has a very forgiving default difficulty in case you're more interested in the puzzles than the adventure game aspects.  By and large, a relaxing game, well worth the time and price.			"

												While not quite the masterpiece Trine 1 was, Trine 2 is still a very good game.The difficulty was lowered for some reason, which is a move I can't understand since the first one was too easy in my eyes. The characters are mostly the same - though they seem to have lost their mana bar, and some abilities too.The inventory is gone, and with it all the relics you could collect. Instead, you get artwork and poems in hidden chests.The levels are still as beautiful as before - and with the ""complete story"" edition they'll last you far longer than the original Trine did.All in all, it's more of the same - and since Trine 1 was so short and fun, I don't mind that one bit.

												I'm an only child of only children, but playing this game over the past couple of years invariably makes me feel what I imagine a visit to the home of a favourite - and awesomely bent - aunt or uncle would evoke. Trine magically knows your needs and wants, and playfully prods you into the midst delightful surprises and puzzles, without ever holding a sense of obligation or responsibility over your head. You might not visit that often over the years, but you're always delighted to go back.If that's too abstracted: It's a utterly lovable co-op physics platformer, with so much love put into every nuance I want to hug the people who made it to death. From the gorgeous, richly rendered parallax set pieces, to the far-above-par voice acting, and the brilliantly characterized animation and physical mechanics of it all (fun to watch *and* play), Trine 2 oozes charm and heart from every pore. Honestly, I just check into this little storybook world every few months when I want to wipe away the inexorable cynicism about gaming off my face and replace it with an ear-to-ear grin.Here's to you, Trine [2]!

												Trine 2 is a fantastic visual and sound game. As soon as you load the game up, the visuals are amazing, HD and there are 3 characters to control. The game is tough and has puzzle and platforming areas, boss fights are fun, and the sound is top notch as well. This game included bonus content and levels! Well worth the price!			"

												I was a huge fan of Trine1, the atmosphere, gameplay, music and puzzles were great. I was unsure how they could make Trine2 any better, Oh, how I was wrong. Frozenbyte did an amazing job with this new installment of the game. The game seems like art, it's very colourful with amazing background imagery while you're playing throughout the game, and the music fits right in. This is a very pretty game to play and be amazed. The way Trine2 is played is pretty much exactly the same as Trine1 with a little bit of differences, like the skill trees.COOP has been a lot of fun with 2 or 3 players. It can get a bit chaotic(and hard) if you're not working together and just missing around.If you played through Trine1 and enjoyed it, you will love this game. I would highly recommend picking up this game.			"

												Puzzle games have, like many genres, evolved significantly since their arrival onto home consoles. We can look back on titles such as Adventures of Lolo[en.wikipedia.org] for the NES, and Doki Doki Penguin Land[en.wikipedia.org] for the Sega Master system, it’s easy to see how far we’ve come. Trine 2 is an example of gaming evolution done right; it takes its foundation from the platforming genre and implements many other elements to provide us with art, action, and strategy… with a bit of frustration thrown in for good measure.When starting up Trine 2 for the first time, the first thing that will catch anyone’s attention is the incredibly bright atmosphere. Frozenbyte did a wonderful job of providing the player with visual stimulation in the form of exceptional graphics, bright colors and detailed environments. This is something that is usually not the center of focus for puzzle games, but they managed to make it the most eye-popping aspect for me. I was simply blown away at how impressive the artwork was, and how it created a realistic looking environment; it's an enticing environment that satisfies many emotions. A prime example of this being the level. “Searock Castle,” a level that presents many hazards like any other, but is so pleasurable to the eyes that I often found myself saying, “huh... this would be a nice vacation spot!” Of course, I would ask for the travel package that excluded the protoceratop-sized crabs, circulating flamethrowers and hostile ogre-like enemies.Onto the secrets and puzzles. Each level has carefully hidden one to two treasure chests that contain either a painting or a poem. Sometimes the chests are in plain sight, and it's simply a matter of creating a strategy to access it. Other times it's in an obscure location that one would never consider venturing. Because of the uncertainty, many times I found myself hacking away at walls with my hammer to see if it was a destructible passageway. Although this may sound tedious, I liked this because it really made me want to explore the level, instead of progressing along like an assembly belt. The puzzles and obstacles themselves are also well done, but an apparently easy puzzle can quickly turn disaster with a simple misclick or a miscalculation of game physics. It puts the players problem solving skills, and patience, to the ultimate test. The keyword here is patience, and I cannot emphasize this enough, because players without patience will find themselves quite frustrated. A perfect example of this is when a player accidentally destroys an existing platform that he/she had previously created, or accidentally moving a box/plank to a location that requires you start over. You know the solution to the puzzle, you know that you can complete it, but you're required to start the entire process over again due to an accidental slip up or a misclick. This is not unique to Trine 2 in any way, as many puzzle games punish the players for a mix-up in controls or accuracy. But for some reason, it felt notably more frustrating in this game. Which leads me to my next topic: The controls. I have mixed feelings on the controls. Initially, I was using a Logitech F310 gamepad, which has been my go-to gamepad for years now. The combat and movement felt flawless with the d-pad, and I never once found myself questioning my input commands.However, the analogue stick controls were an absolute nightmare, and I often found myself incredibly frustrated with inconsistent sensitivity, movements that felt random in nature, and collision physics that felt over-dramatic. To prevent further frustration, I switched to a mouse and keyboard halfway through the game. Right away, all of my frustrations subsided, and I felt like I was once again in control of my movements. Perhaps it's the accuracy of the mouse, but the analogue controls felt incredibly inaccurate when trying to be precise. I'm not pinning this entirely on the controls of Trine 2, as it's highly possible that my gamepad is simply not the ideal gamepad for this type of game. But for me, I found that the keyboard and mouse provided far, far more accurate and smooth controls.The only moment of overwhelming frustration came during the end of the game, but it wasn't in the form of a puzzle or an obstacle. Well, perhaps it could be considered an obstacle, as I encountered a glitch that stopped me in my tracks. On the level “Icewarden Keep”, the player reaches a part where is a barrage of enemies that flood the area, along with a particularly strong enemy that emerges from a gate to your right... a gate that needs to open in order for the player to progress. Unfortunately, this gate never opened, and this enemy stood behind the gate swatting at thin air. This happened not once, but twice, both times requiring that I restart the entire level. This was especially frustrating since this level, in my opinion, was one of the most grueling ones in regards to difficulty. I did some research, and apparently I'm not the only one who has experienced this glitch. I was relieved when the gate finally opened, but was a bit upset that I had to truck through that brutally difficult level more than once.The story is nothing overly special, but it has a nice touch to it. For a platforming puzzle game, one can't expect a legendary tale of sadness, revenge, love and deceit in the realm of Final Fantasy IX. Instead, it's a fairly streamlined story that addresses the subject matter in a linear and chapter-like fashion. Pleasant, but nothing overly memorable. Overall, I highly recommend this game to those who are interested in a fluid, obstacle-based platforming puzzler. It's short, but sweet, and a fantastic entry to the genre. I would hesitate to recommend this game to those who may a prefer a bit more action in their games, and those who aren't particularly thrilled by the notion of extended puzzle solving. As I mentioned before, it's a game of patience, and this can be grueling for some. But for some like myself, it's all worth it just to have that sign of relief once you cross the finish line.			"

												I simply wouldn't change anything on this game.Graphic is top-notch, sound effects are nice and music is awesome. Graphic and music together create on the player a relaxing magic world feeling that kills any stress (also because puzzles are not hard if done with all 3 characters).I loved the irony of the dialogues between the 3 characters that more than once made me literally roll on floor laughing.Now, the gameplay part. The game is quite easy BUT there are challenges (such as achievements) so that even if the puzzles are easy, they ""suggest"" what to do to make them harder.To sum things up, this is one of the best games I ever played (works on linux too) and I enjoyed every hour I spent on this. I strongly suggest you to buy it.			"

												This game builds on the previous game and has everything the previous game had. Gorgeous art, atmospheric soundtrack, excellent gameplay. The storyline is as almost nonexistent as in the first one, but essentially, Trine 2 sees you back in the shoes of the wizard, knight and thief as you try and find your way through the puzzle/platformer levels.The abilities of the characters have been slightly re-jigged, in order to keep the gameplay fresh, but also to avoid the RPG trope where a character loses all the abilites he got in the first game at the beginnign of the sequel! The gameplay still works best with more than one player helping each other out - in fact, perhaps more so than the first due to the new abilities.It has, particularly with the Gblin Menace expansion, a great amount of gameplay for the price. The Goblin Menace adds (amongst other things) another crazy boss level, but it's much more down to skill than insanity and pure blind luck like the first one! It still stands in my mind as one of the best examples of a final boss level - it involves using all the abilities and skills you've learnt and working with your co-players in a classic multi-stage boss level.All in all, following on from the last one, 9/10 - it's brilliant fun multiplayer with an Xbox controller, but loses the one point for the lacklustre storyline and confusing keyboard controls.

												I'd have to say this game is wholly worth it. I've only briefly owned this game, but I've had plenty of fun with it, having bought the triple pack on sale to play with two friends. Each of our gaming sessions is filled with plenty of laughter due to the antics that are pulled with the game's mechanics and just a little bit of wonder towards the fairytale-esque art style of the game (which I personally find graphically gorgeous.) The game in its own right is very fun and with friends the fun is leagues greater. The gameplay offers some very neat mechanics both puzzle and combat wise and wraps them up neatly in a nice little adventure game package. If I had any qualms about the game, though, it'd be the limited amount of levels/content. A level creator or something of the sort and a community game mode to match would make this title golden.

												While not quite the masterpiece Trine 1 was, Trine 2 is still a very good game.The difficulty was lowered for some reason, which is a move I can't understand since the first one was too easy in my eyes. The characters are mostly the same - though they seem to have lost their mana bar, and some abilities too.The inventory is gone, and with it all the relics you could collect. Instead, you get artwork and poems in hidden chests.The levels are still as beautiful as before - and with the ""complete story"" edition they'll last you far longer than the original Trine did.All in all, it's more of the same - and since Trine 1 was so short and fun, I don't mind that one bit.

												Trine 2 is a puzzle/adventure platforming game as ingenious as it is stunning. If you like puzzles, thinking outside of the box, and... bopping goblins? You will probably fall in love with Trine 2 in a heartbeat!Below is a list of attributes pertaining to Trine 2, and some personal opinion in regards to how they did.STORY: 4/10""Feels like it's missing something... Oh, yes! More goblins!""I'll give Trine 2 a cookie for being relatively unique compared to most other games. The execution is fine, though the game does leave you feeling like there should be more. Additionally, some aspects of the plot can be seen coming a mile away. Fortunately, there's at least one or two good twists in store. For the sake of spoilers though, I won't disclose them here. The story of Trine 2's is not one to be taken seriously.Of course, you weren't looking to play this for the story, were you?GAMEPLAY: 7/10""Think of it as a test of manhood. Or mousehood.""Earning a few extra points for its fairly clever implementation of skills and the three heroes, Trine 2 really lets you play the game in your own style, be it through finesse, sheer force, or stuffing boxes into sacred places they clearly don't belong! If you get stuck at some point or confused, the narrator offers some clues on how to proceed. Compared to most games that babysit you along, this is much more preferrable.Admittedly, the controls do take a little getting used to, and even Normal Difficulty can be downright brutal if you're new to the game. Thankfully, a lot of the achievements (if you're OCD like I am) can be obtained without getting your rear end handed to you. Some are possible right at the main menu! *Hint, hint.*DESIGN: 10/10""No pixel was spared.""Trine 2 is outrageously beautiful. Beautiful to the point of losing sight of your character on the screen! ... Seriously, this happened to me playing it. But that's okay because Trine 2 is a literal slideshow of eye candy and scenic splendor. Rewarding to watch just in its own right. Being able to play in it, let alone interact with it, is an added bonus.Perhaps the nicest part about its shiny graphics is that you don't have to cash in on your life insurance policy to make a system capable of running it. Even with a simple dual-core PC, Trine 2 runs magnificently at high detail.SUMMARY: 7 out of 10.Normally, I detest games that emphasize graphics since they usually have horrible gameplay and/or story about as in-depth as a piece of cardboard. Trine 2's storyline isn't the greatest, but it makes up for it in its unique and fluid style, gameplay, as well as the lovely panoramic scenes the game immerses you into. It's a game that isn't trying to sell you some epic story or brand-spanking new mechanic... It's just fun to play! "

												Holy hot dang! Frozenbyte finally delivered a great game! Trine 2 is everything the first Trine should have been. Trine's main faults, IMO, were brought by its level design, where every obstacle could easily be passed by simply exploiting a single character, often ""breaking"" the feel of how progression should have gone. Now just about every screen feels like it was exquisitely planned out. It's brilliant, and not only that, it's gorgeous! Godddddd, is Trine 2 ever purdy!Also fun as the mfin' dickens to play with friends.			"

Not only does it provide eye-soothing graphics it also serves you with a remarkable story and a solid gameplay. On your journey through this beautifully crafted, mystical land and well narrated story you will guide three characters, each with its own unique set of mechanics.Do not hesitate to embark on this journey yourself or with a friend or two, it might provide you with an experience you will not forget so easily.

												Experience on Linux so far:+ Solid.The game:You control three main characters in a 2D platformer environment with simulated physics. The three characters are the fantasy cliche (warrior, mage and thief?) with different abilities that can be an asset or weakness depending on the scenario.The controls are weird, you use both mouse and keyboard, which takes some getting used to if you have played platformers for 20 years using only a joystick.Did I mention that is nice looking? I enjoy the playthrough videos as much as playing the game, just because the graphics are so detailed and well made. Audio is awesome and complements the art style.This is not a game that I enjoyed very much, not my style of gameplay, the high score I'm giving is based on the game being so well made. Very impressive.Score:4/5			"

												Steam sales have ruined me.I honestly forgot about this game because I had it on the back burner. I played 20 min, then switched to some other game I was dying to play after a steam sale, and then forgot about Trine 2. Never again. I'm so sorry Trine 2. You didn't deserve my neglect. But you were worth the wait.I seriously love this game. If you like platforming/puzzle games like Rochard, you will love this game. Granted, I have not finished it yet, but I had to stop mid game to say that I'm seriously impressed. This game offers the beautiful styling of a 2D platformer of the modern genre, yet offers a unique twist. There is an RPG element of leveling a class of character. And you get 3 primary characters to level and play at any given time. With 3 different classes to evolve and switch between at any given moment.... That's a mouthful. It sounds confusing but it's easy once you experience it. Lets say you have an enemy that is best suited to be taken down with brute force. Push left bumper, swittch to my brawler and take them down. 3 seconds later, I have a puzzle that requires some blocks to be moved around. Push left bumber, switch to my wizard. Move those blocks with my magic. 3 seconds later I have an obsticle that requires a finess jump. Push left bumper, switch to my archer/acrobat. Jump over that obsicle. It's really just fun. Pure and simple. If you like platformers. If you like modern, rich graphic, puzzle solving platformers, then I bet you will enjoy this game. I'll update this review after I finish the game... but so far I'm thoroughly impressed.			"

												This is one of those games where playing with friends makes an amazing game even more amazing. Its a puzzler where you can swap between 3 characters at any time and you will find yourself having a blast both trolling and assisting your teammates especially if you are a completionist and need to find all the hidden locations. The story is excellent and the graphics; both character and environment are beautiful.  Dont be surprised if you catch yourself being memorized by the environment yourself.I will say this is a very linear game and there may not be a tremendous amount of replayability. It would have been nice had Trine offered a level editor much like Portal where you could build a level and challenge other steam people to complete it. 9/10			"

												A visual feast of breathtaking artistry, I can't recall ever sampling anything quite like it. Reminds me of walking along the Bayeux tapestry marvelling at the skill of it's creators, this game also unfolds horizontally as it tells it's story and draws you ever deeper with the  sheer complexity of detail, imagery and vibrant colour.A wonderful fantasy game where the three interchangeable characters draw on their arsenal of skills to overcome the puzzles placed before them. The ways in which it's possible to devise scenarios for your own and friends unintended but  ludicrous and suicidal deaths kept us laughing, with borderline hysteria, until 05:00 AM. Works very well as a 2/3 player internet game (worth turning on the unrestricted character choice option) but probably advisable to have a skype call up rather than having to type in problem solving suggestions. The craftmanship and the beauty of the scenes, especially where water has been animated is truly astonishing and worthy of a gaming Oscar! "

												Coming off it's success of Trine, Trine has lost none of it's glamour, and in the process has added only everything wonderful. I really enjoyed the first trine. It's story, music, gameplay, all of it was generally delightful, allbeit short. Trine 2 follows wonderfully in it's footsteps.Here we find our three heroes not really looking for adventure per say, but the Trine once again find it for them. This time they are taken off to save a world of enchantment and a battle between sisters. In the process they find themselves fighting goblins. There is no reason to argue with story line here, as the story is short, succinct, not complicated, and enjoyable for the game. In terms of gameplay, Trine 2 builds on it's predecessor, working out many of the physics kinks that were so lauded. The characters do basically the same thing, with the addition of a few extras - the knights glide, and magnet shield, the thiefs special gravity arrow, and ability to hide herself, and the wizards magnetic objects, and ability to trap enemies inside boxes, as well as ability to pick up enemies. All in all, the gameplay of this game is smooth and for the most part without problems. 9.5/10In terms of graphics, Trine 2 looks superb. The artists who worked the concepts of this game have done a phenomenal job yet again. The colours, the look, and the increased depth make this side-scroller look even better. The graphics themselves could be a little nicer, sharper, and slightly more realistic in some areas - the characters for instance - but all in all this game is more than pleasing on the eyes. 9/10Music in this game is one thing that I really enjoy. The embience coupled with the wonderful sound track is above par. Music is a lost art when it comes to video games sometimes, but Trine 2, like it's predecessor, does an excellent job of creating wonderful atmosphere and putting the right music at the right time. And just add in here, the narration of Trine 2 is just as fun as the first. 9.5/10 (BTW, I'm a music teacher)Co-op is such a hard thing to get right. It's hard to know when it's too much, or when it's not enough. It's a good thing that co-op over the internet was added to this game. It makes it so much more fun to play that way. The only drawaback to this games co-op is the same as last times, the controller configuration. More often then I would like to admit, the control configurations seem to be out of wack. Responding to the wrong thing, or not working at all. Multiple keyboards is still an impossible task sometimes. The co-op itself is fun to play with friends, but if the work on controller configuration were fixed the co-op would be even more fun. 8.5/10Overall, this game is wonderful. It can be short, or long, depending on what you plan to do with it. It can be easy, or you can challenge yourself, as I have, to find new ways to beat certain areas. If you find it too easy, put it in hardcore mode, on hard, then give it a whirl. Enjoy the colours, the embience, and try and find a friend to play this game with you. You won't win any major tournaments while shooting dozens of people, but you will find yourself enjoying the fact that you've made it through a game using your brain. Trine 2 - 9/10			"

												A trine is a group of three. It was also a clever 2009 puzzle platformer starring a trio of adventurers, each with specific talents. Lucky us, now we have a sequel, Trine 2, that offers more fun physics-based challenges, more beautiful vistas, and adds online multiplayer to the mix.The first thing I noticed about Trine 2 is its stunning visuals. Each scene, from forests to caves to lazy beaches, shines with rich detail and startling lighting effects. There is always something amazing to distract you. Trine 2 easily makes for one of the prettiest games of the year.  If you played the first Trine, you'll find a very familiar game here. Players run from left to right through fantasy spectacles, surmounting obstacles and slaying a few goblins along the way. You have three heroes at your disposal: a wizard that can conjure blocks and platforms, a thief with a bow and grappling hook, and a knight with sword, hammer, and shield. The brilliance of Trine 2 is that it mostly leaves the choice of which hero to use up to you. I love it when a game lets me off my leash and tells me ""have fun,"" -- and that's the kind of game Trine 2 is.It does fail to teach the player some important mechanics, though, resulting in slight exasperation when you don't realize a solution is even possible. The wizards platforms, for instance, can be stuck to swinging spiked maces, resulting in a pendulum conveyance. That's really cool, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up before I found myself stuck at the bottom of an ice slope for a little too long.When playing by yourself you switch between the three heroes at will. In a matter of moments you might slash through some goblins as the knight, switch to the thief to grapple to a high platform, then switch to the wizard to move a heavy block in front of a flame thrower. Trine 2 is also very friendly about multiplayer gaming, allowing up to three players to join the adventure either locally or online. I find the game becomes easier this way because you've got more than just one brain working on problems and you can multitask, but it's still satisfying.The few boss fights prove slightly disappointing. While visually impressive, they don't require the same thought as the rest of Trine 2. Merely crossing a chasm can be a real conundrum, but felling a giant beast is as simple as giving it a few whacks to its weak spots. I do love the way the bosses are foreshadowed early on in levels, though.			"

The game is an absolute gem. There is a lot of detail and the colors and lightning are superb. The atmosphere is amazing. My kids play it together on the bigscreen with two controllers. I must say that if you are not used to controllers this game can be difficult at some points but my kids are flying through the environment.It starts easy but as you advance everything on your path will test or kill youAllong the way can (well must) pick up vials thats give you XP. There is a talenttree for each of the 3 chars you can play with to boost weapons or unlock other weapons or abilities and can be (re)set whenever you want so your chars got the proper tools for the fight.Just buy this game alright!!!

The gameplay was great, a tradtional 2D physics platform with a simple skill tree system which balances out really well. This game is truly an indie masterpiece.

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous physics-based 3D platformer, and it’s meant to be experienced with friends. The most important difference from the original Trine is that this game supports three-player co-op over the internet. It may seem like a ""well, duh"" feature, but it makes a world of difference over the previous local-only game.By building on its successes rather than messing with its entertaining gameplay, Trine 2's simple concept of trekking toward the right side of the screen feels more like an otherworldly adventure than just another platformer. The abilities of your three playable characters - Wizard, Rogue, and Warrior - synergize superbly. Though at times you may feel overly dependent on another character's unique skills, the often misplaced trust you put in your friends’ talent will generally lead to hilarious and unintended successes. Frequently, the way to figure out a puzzle is to throw yourself at it until you discover a solution. A side-effect of this is death, but thankfully, it’s hardly a penalty. As long as one character remains alive and makes it to one of the many checkpoints in a level, the others are instantly revived. If everybody dies, all progress is saved and everybody is reincarnated at the latest checkpoint. This serves the flow of the game well, because your sense of adventure is never punished; indeed, being practically immortal in a platformer is surprisingly fun!Don’t expect much from the story; other than giving a reason to run to the right, it exists only to provide context to Trine 2’s challenges and puzzles. The reward for figuring out each scenario is mainly a sense of progression – but it works. Progression could mean accumulating experience potions that grant each character improved skills or new abilities, or it could mean discovering hard-to-reach chests that contain pieces of concept art or a narrated stanza from the main antagonist’s journal. Simply getting to the next level is often reward enough, because this game’s vibrant visuals are stunning.Trine 2's artistic merit is absolutely jaw-dropping. The title screen alone sets the bar for the rest of the game. (Try starting the game at different times during the day!) Half of my play-time was spent taking in the stunningly beautiful backdrops and set pieces. I felt guilty when I solved a puzzle without fully admiring the obscene amount of effort put into the graphical presentation of this game. The quality is consistently superb - worthy of your attention all the way through to the last chapter - and every shade of the rainbow gets a feature performance. The fun to be had in applying home-brewed solutions to solving puzzles with your friends is what sustains Trine 2 until its end. Along with constantly being rewarded with beautiful vistas and remarkably decorated interiors, finding all the hidden goodies will definitely tempt your inner completionist. Although you may need to set personal goals to warrant a second play-through, Trine 2 is a very entertaining game to play over a week with one or two of your friends.			"

												This game is amazing!!! The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is really fun, and the co-op works great! The game is ment to be played with three people, although the single player is alright, in order to get the most out of this game, find two friends to play it with. All the puzles really work well in testing the players' ability to cooperate. Each character has their strengths and weaknesses, making it necessary to work together.As you play along, you get skill points to spend to upgrade your character, which can be refunded if you decide to switch characters with a friend.Over all, without giving too much away about this game, I have to say that it is a must buy. If you enjoy 2.5D games, puzzle games, co-op games, or even just hack-and-slash games, this is something you would enjoy.8.5/10			"

												Trine 2 is a side-scrolling action platform/puzzle game developed by Frozenbyte. And obviously, it is the sequel to Trine.The game improves everything from the original by adding more fun to play abilities, such as Monster Levitation(grab and levitate monsters), Monster Prison(catch enemies in boxes) and Metal Magnetizing(conjured objects can be magnetized) for the Wizard, there is also Frost/Fire/Explosive Arrows, Stealth Movement and Low Gravity Field for the Thief, and lastly there is Frost Shield, Fire Sword, Hammer Throwing/Explosion, Charge and Magnetic Shield for the Knight.Besides the gameplay improvements, the game is even move beautiful than the original Trine (#1, #2, #3) and the soundtrack is even more impressive.For me, Trine 2 is the best of the series. It provides a lot of new great content that offers hours upon hours of fun in local/online co-op with friends or solo.			"

Each character has a talent tree which allows players to respec without any cost at any time of the game.The visuals are quite colourful and easy on the eyes.

If you want to spend money in game - this is the game, which deserve this money.PP: The soundtracks are built on the main theme and they are changed with musical means and sounds very good. This wants to be very smart and clever. I am musician and for this reason i congratulate the composer of the melodies!			"

												For fans of stereoscopic 3D gaming, this game is a must-buy.  There are many games which look fantastic in Nvidia 3d Vision, but the Trine games (especially 2 and 3) are so good as to be useful for modeling the technology, in my opinion.  Furthermore, unlike many games that work well in 3D Vision and nothing else, the Trine games have additional 3D modes to make the game compatible with pretty much any stereoscopic setup you have.  If you have a modern 3D TV and choose to play this game in 2D, you are doing yourself a serious disservice.  Get an extra-long hdmi cable, if you have to, and attach your computer to your TV!  (Or invest in a 3D Vision setup, if you are a fan of stereoscopic 3D movies and games.)The game is oodles of fun with a friend, in both local and internet co-op, with the difference being that the two characters must share a screen for local co-op; netplay has no such limitation, and you can get separated if you are not careful.  That said, I recommend the latter for those who have both options available to then.Sadly, the game has its share of internet MP bugginess, worse than the first game did (but not as bad as the third).  It was so bad that my friend and I (with him in America and me in Japan, both of us with excellent internet connections) were not able to complete the DLC's final boss, which is arguably broken for multiplayer (possibly local MP as well, given the way the boss spazzes out and gets confused when more than one target is available).  So while I must shake my finger at Frozenbyte for not play-testing and bug-proofing the multiplayer more, I cannot in good conscious give this anything other than a thumbs-up, for its combination of appealing platforming, charming characters and voice acting, and jaw-droppingly gorgeous visuals, which really must be viewed in stereoscopic 3D to be fully appreciated.Artistic Value: 9.5Fun Factor: 8 (probably lower while playing solo and/or in 2D)My Score: 8.5			"

												A trine is a group of three. It was also a clever 2009 puzzle platformer starring a trio of adventurers, each with specific talents. Lucky us, now we have a sequel, Trine 2, that offers more fun physics-based challenges, more beautiful vistas, and adds online multiplayer to the mix.The first thing I noticed about Trine 2 is its stunning visuals. Each scene, from forests to caves to lazy beaches, shines with rich detail and startling lighting effects. There is always something amazing to distract you. Trine 2 easily makes for one of the prettiest games of the year.  If you played the first Trine, you'll find a very familiar game here. Players run from left to right through fantasy spectacles, surmounting obstacles and slaying a few goblins along the way. You have three heroes at your disposal: a wizard that can conjure blocks and platforms, a thief with a bow and grappling hook, and a knight with sword, hammer, and shield. The brilliance of Trine 2 is that it mostly leaves the choice of which hero to use up to you. I love it when a game lets me off my leash and tells me ""have fun,"" -- and that's the kind of game Trine 2 is.It does fail to teach the player some important mechanics, though, resulting in slight exasperation when you don't realize a solution is even possible. The wizards platforms, for instance, can be stuck to swinging spiked maces, resulting in a pendulum conveyance. That's really cool, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up before I found myself stuck at the bottom of an ice slope for a little too long.When playing by yourself you switch between the three heroes at will. In a matter of moments you might slash through some goblins as the knight, switch to the thief to grapple to a high platform, then switch to the wizard to move a heavy block in front of a flame thrower. Trine 2 is also very friendly about multiplayer gaming, allowing up to three players to join the adventure either locally or online. I find the game becomes easier this way because you've got more than just one brain working on problems and you can multitask, but it's still satisfying.The few boss fights prove slightly disappointing. While visually impressive, they don't require the same thought as the rest of Trine 2. Merely crossing a chasm can be a real conundrum, but felling a giant beast is as simple as giving it a few whacks to its weak spots. I do love the way the bosses are foreshadowed early on in levels, though.			"

												This game is god damn beautiful and plays really well you and your two best buds go on an awesome adventure and its the one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. The game play is varied largely if you want to fight and have very little use in puzzles be the knight, if you want to be flexible and helpful with both be the archer, and if you want to be the puzzle master id suggest the wizard, and thats where most of the fun comes from playing your way and putting all your heads together for a great time.

There are many games which look fantastic in Nvidia 3d Vision, but the Trine games (especially 2 and 3) are so good as to be useful for modeling the technology, in my opinion.  Furthermore, unlike many games that work well in 3D Vision and nothing else, the Trine games have additional 3D modes to make the game compatible with pretty much any stereoscopic setup you have.  If you have a modern 3D TV and choose to play this game in 2D, you are doing yourself a serious disservice.  Get an extra-long hdmi cable, if you have to, and attach your computer to your TV!  (Or invest in a 3D Vision setup, if you are a fan of stereoscopic 3D movies and games.)The game is oodles of fun with a friend, in both local and internet co-op, with the difference being that the two characters must share a screen for local co-op; netplay has no such limitation, and you can get separated if you are not careful.  That said, I recommend the latter for those who have both options available to then.Sadly, the game has its share of internet MP bugginess, worse than the first game did (but not as bad as the third).  It was so bad that my friend and I (with him in America and me in Japan, both of us with excellent internet connections) were not able to complete the DLC's final boss, which is arguably broken for multiplayer (possibly local MP as well, given the way the boss spazzes out and gets confused when more than one target is available).  So while I must shake my finger at Frozenbyte for not play-testing and bug-proofing the multiplayer more, I cannot in good conscious give this anything other than a thumbs-up, for its combination of appealing platforming, charming characters and voice acting, and jaw-droppingly gorgeous visuals, which really must be viewed in stereoscopic 3D to be fully appreciated.Artistic Value: 9.5Fun Factor: 8 (probably lower while playing solo and/or in 2D)My Score: 8.5			"

												A very enjoyable platform, especially in co-op,  the levels are quite well designed and fun. The game allows switching between 3 different characters with 3 different abilities in order to solve certain puzzles to pass levels. Each character has a talent tree which allows players to respec without any cost at any time of the game.The visuals are quite colourful and easy on the eyes.  The story is good and the banter between characters are entertaining.			"

												Perhaps one of the most visually beautiful games I've ever played, Trine 2 is a true masterpiece. But it's not just a pretty face. The game also comes with a charmingly voice-acted story told in the style of a traditional fairy tale, as well as 3 different playable characters with their own unique abilities and play styles, which can all be played simultaneously in co-op!

												I warmly recomend this game. It is with great soundtracks and great story line. I congratulate Frozenbyte and the composer of the music. The grafics and animations are made very realistic for 2D and are very beautiful. If you want to spend money in game - this is the game, which deserve this money.PP: The soundtracks are built on the main theme and they are changed with musical means and sounds very good. This wants to be very smart and clever. I am musician and for this reason i congratulate the composer of the melodies!			"

												WOW! What an improvement over the first one!Mostly pros and a few cons.Pros:- The first game was stunning and this just blew me away with how much it improved over the first game - It has better puzzles- More level traversing mechanics that work REALLY well- More character skills that are easier to execute- No mana (this was mostly superfluous in the first game)- Enemy battles are more engaging- Much more fluid controls  > Using the Rogue's grappling hook to get on to a platform from underneath is much easier > The ability for my character to make it onto a platform with a jump is much more lenient > Easier to summon and destroy things with the Wizard (quick squiggle = box, botched line = plank (yay) instead of box (boo), which was frustrating from the first game)- I can read the narration and skip faster to get into the level as a resultCons:- The only thing they haven't improved from the first game is that the Rogue needs a grappling hook aim when using a controller as she often latches onto the wrong platform or the wrong part of a platform. The grappling hook should also be able to retract further making it as easy as it should be to get on to platforms (despite that they somewhat improved this from the first game).- Things that are CLEARLY made of wood can't be grappled on to- Spiders sometimes spawn camp and this can become a little annoying- The camera is appalling in so many instances (normally too zoomed in) and it would be far better with a player controlled zoom function!

												This is an example that you don't need an movie-like action game or a CoD replica to make a game. For those of you who already play platform games rub your eyes and prepare to witness some beautiful gaming. For those of you who aren't really into these games (and didn't immediately reject it before reading the reviews) I implore you to give it a try and experience a completely unique experience. Beautiful designs beyond comparisson, diverse gameplay with many different ways to solve any puzzle and a multiplayer option for a most enjoyable co-op session.			"

												A game where you have 3 characters, which you can use in lan and online co-op! Amazing game for people who like RPG and puzzle games. Use Amadeus the wizard to kill enemies with boxes and build your way up. Use Zoya the thief to grapple on just about anything made of wood, and swing to the other side of the map, and kill your enemies with your bow and stealth. Use Pontius the knight to slash your way thorugh the enemies and break walls with your hammer of destruction!I would say, fun for everyone.			"

												I simply wouldn't change anything on this game.Graphic is top-notch, sound effects are nice and music is awesome. Graphic and music together create on the player a relaxing magic world feeling that kills any stress (also because puzzles are not hard if done with all 3 characters).I loved the irony of the dialogues between the 3 characters that more than once made me literally roll on floor laughing.Now, the gameplay part. The game is quite easy BUT there are challenges (such as achievements) so that even if the puzzles are easy, they ""suggest"" what to do to make them harder.To sum things up, this is one of the best games I ever played (works on linux too) and I enjoyed every hour I spent on this. I strongly suggest you to buy it.			"

PROS:+ awesome gameplay mechanics with 3 characters+ level design+ skils/powers of each character+ fairy tale story+ visual look+ online co-opCONS:- couple of bugs/glitches- removed items from first gameComment:A fantastic and gorgeous game, loads of fun when you play with your friends! It takes what Trine gave us and enhances it through online co-op and 20(!) levels. The enemies are more difficult this time but the gameplay still revolves around puzzle solving and obstacle removing/dodging. If you loved the first game you will love this. They even added various difficulties including Hardcore mode which does not let your characters respawn until you reach the next checkpoint. I can really recommend this game to both casual and hardcore gamers.			"

												The second installment of trinity: galactic expedia unleashed, breaks new ground in the gaming landscape. Trinity, or Trin for short is a tale about Duncon Stone, a recently rehabilitated drug addict recovering from severe trauma at an asylum in baltimore. Duncon, or dunk as the inmates call him was a former software engineer for microsoft but after raising a mutiny against steve jobs he was publically executed on the streets of johanesberg where he worked. What they didnt expect was that his corpse was exported to colombo where the doctors worked on him. they utilised various new implants and turned him into a man like machine called the Trine. Trine is a code name for the project, Transplant Ressurected infantry of new Eden. New eden is a bioengineering cartel that spans oceanic borders that funnels billions of dollars worth of biotechnology and unlicensed equipment into key geographic areas. The TRINE project is an attempt to create a global po-lice force designed to implement a new regime once individual governments topple following an expected economic collapse post global financial fiasco. As a Trine unit you are subordinate to your task master, some inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who goes by the name of ""the cammel's muel"".  CM is what the guys in the lab call him, but to Duncan stone he is the epicentre of a world of suffering under his rule. CM send you all over the globe doing secret missions to merge and consolidate important equipment under his roof. On one uneventful escort mission to secure a new type of balistics device, Duncon gets hit by the typical natural disarster employed in all games these days, you guessed it.. lightaning!. that's right, he takes a bolt to the head which fries the inhibitor chip that CM daddy uses to control him. But the other players know this. and they're coming for you. The game then turns into its multiplayer feature here, which is essentially a treadmil of experiance grinding in order to gear up for the boss fight back in the New eden facility. Its very uninspired and doesent add much to whats already out there in terms of Trinity's mian competitors, namely farming simulator 2000 and football manager 2014. In any case you get some cool guns and the matchmaking system is okay. Once youre geared up you get to face off against the cammels muel in an all star battle of the ages. We're back to single player here now guys just for the record. after a grindy battle of tearing down his health and toking up on heal potions through the entire fight you eventually kill him. Unfortunately for stone, the facility does actually explode trapping him in the compartment underneath. THe game ends with duncon stone putting himself into cryosleep since he is faced with no other alternitive. This sory arc therefore is the prequel of Demolition Man, which aired in the 80's. Overall, not a bad film. Demolition man had some cool plot twists and the actor played the part well. 4/10 in terms of special effects, the 80's dont really compare to where we are today. Either way, if youre keep to tune into some good old fashioned film, Demolition man is the way to go.Until next time, stay snazzy!			"

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous problem-solving game that I missed out on for way too long.  It has challenges requiring the use of multiple characters that will remind any SNES fan of The Lost Vikings, but with graphics to match the modern day.  Interestingly, most problems have multiple solutions, even allowing you to use just 1 of the 3 characters to get through whole stages.  On top of that, it has a very forgiving default difficulty in case you're more interested in the puzzles than the adventure game aspects.  By and large, a relaxing game, well worth the time and price.			"

I love the switching of the characters and the games chapters are well thought out and never repeated making this game a real pleasure to play. I hope there are more games in the Trine series on the way soon ;0}.			"

												Se o original já era excelente este consegue superá-lo na maioria dos aspectos, grande sequência mantendo em grande parte o ótimo estilo clássico side-scrolling, com história de fantasia medieval, dessa vez com gráficos e efeitos de física muito melhores além da interação maior com o ambiente e os objetos, os mapas estão com uma qualidade e detalhes excelentes as musicas novamente estão excelentes, a unica coisa que senti falta é o sistema do inventário e um pouco da história e clima mais sombrio que tinha em algumas partes o primeiro, fora isso melhorou em cada aspecto, jogo excelente e recomendado.

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous physics-based 3D platformer, and it’s meant to be experienced with friends. The most important difference from the original Trine is that this game supports three-player co-op over the internet. It may seem like a ""well, duh"" feature, but it makes a world of difference over the previous local-only game.By building on its successes rather than messing with its entertaining gameplay, Trine 2's simple concept of trekking toward the right side of the screen feels more like an otherworldly adventure than just another platformer. The abilities of your three playable characters - Wizard, Rogue, and Warrior - synergize superbly. Though at times you may feel overly dependent on another character's unique skills, the often misplaced trust you put in your friends’ talent will generally lead to hilarious and unintended successes. Frequently, the way to figure out a puzzle is to throw yourself at it until you discover a solution. A side-effect of this is death, but thankfully, it’s hardly a penalty. As long as one character remains alive and makes it to one of the many checkpoints in a level, the others are instantly revived. If everybody dies, all progress is saved and everybody is reincarnated at the latest checkpoint. This serves the flow of the game well, because your sense of adventure is never punished; indeed, being practically immortal in a platformer is surprisingly fun!Don’t expect much from the story; other than giving a reason to run to the right, it exists only to provide context to Trine 2’s challenges and puzzles. The reward for figuring out each scenario is mainly a sense of progression – but it works. Progression could mean accumulating experience potions that grant each character improved skills or new abilities, or it could mean discovering hard-to-reach chests that contain pieces of concept art or a narrated stanza from the main antagonist’s journal. Simply getting to the next level is often reward enough, because this game’s vibrant visuals are stunning.Trine 2's artistic merit is absolutely jaw-dropping. The title screen alone sets the bar for the rest of the game. (Try starting the game at different times during the day!) Half of my play-time was spent taking in the stunningly beautiful backdrops and set pieces. I felt guilty when I solved a puzzle without fully admiring the obscene amount of effort put into the graphical presentation of this game. The quality is consistently superb - worthy of your attention all the way through to the last chapter - and every shade of the rainbow gets a feature performance. The fun to be had in applying home-brewed solutions to solving puzzles with your friends is what sustains Trine 2 until its end. Along with constantly being rewarded with beautiful vistas and remarkably decorated interiors, finding all the hidden goodies will definitely tempt your inner completionist. Although you may need to set personal goals to warrant a second play-through, Trine 2 is a very entertaining game to play over a week with one or two of your friends.			"

All I have to say is that it is the same awesome game with great sound and freaking amazing graphics and style, but it gives you so much more than its predecessor.So what's new? At first it seems like not much have changed but then...I noticed a whole bunch of improvements. Boss fights are now more interesting and not that repetetive, enemy units greatly vary and always fun to beat, at times puzzles seem a bit harder making you stop for awhile to think everything over and LOCATIONS (and yes I caps it) so many freaking beatiful locations - every level is just a piece of art you must see.4I finished this game in 8 hours playing it with my girlfriend in local co-op.

												Trine 2 is a side-scrolling action platform/puzzle game developed by Frozenbyte. And obviously, it is the sequel to Trine.The game improves everything from the original by adding more fun to play abilities, such as Monster Levitation(grab and levitate monsters), Monster Prison(catch enemies in boxes) and Metal Magnetizing(conjured objects can be magnetized) for the Wizard, there is also Frost/Fire/Explosive Arrows, Stealth Movement and Low Gravity Field for the Thief, and lastly there is Frost Shield, Fire Sword, Hammer Throwing/Explosion, Charge and Magnetic Shield for the Knight.Besides the gameplay improvements, the game is even move beautiful than the original Trine (#1, #2, #3) and the soundtrack is even more impressive.For me, Trine 2 is the best of the series. It provides a lot of new great content that offers hours upon hours of fun in local/online co-op with friends or solo.			"

												Trine 2: Complete Story is an hybrid between a platform and puzzle game developed by developer Froze Byte and follows the adventure of three heroes, Amadeus the Magnificent, Zoya and Pontius the Brave, as they are guided by a mysterious magical entity, the titular Trine, to face a dark plot involving their kingdom. The Complet Story edition adds to the original some tweaks and include the only major DLC for the game, Goblin Menace, for free.The main beef of Trine 2 is about using the unique perks and abilities of each character or combine them as needed in order to advance in the levels you are thrown in: while there are some enemy encounters through the game, they are a rarity and are easily overcame with the trio's basic abilities (even the few bosses featured are pretty straightforward, save for the final bosses, who are more puzzle game fare in nature). Amadeus the Magnificent doesn't have any combat abilities to speak of and is rather fragile, but can conjure crates or move elements of the scenery to help his comrades. Zoya, instead, is a classic rogue character: she can move faster and jump higher than the other two characters, use a grappling tool to swing around on wooden surfaces and damage enemies from afar using her bow and different kind of arrows. Finally, Portius the Brave is a very sturdy, shielded warrior who fills the role of the group's tank against enemies and heavy damage dealer: after unlocking some of his additional abilities, however, Portius also becomes useful during the platforming sections as a support character.The levels of Trine 2 feature several experience orbs you can collect to level up your characters: each level gained unlocks an ability point you can spend in the talent tree of each hero. Some of these unlocked abilities only enhance the skills the characters already posses, while others introduce totally new gimmicks capable of making the later section of the game much easier to handle.It can be argued that one of the main attraction in Trine 2 are its impressive visual, especially for being a side scroller game: all the characters and environments are rendered in great 3D detail and the scenaries are multiple layers to them. The art style also feels rather unique.One of the main novelty of Trine 2 in comparison to the original game are its only features: a party of three players can experience the whole adventure while playing together online, each controlling his/her own character. On top of being a rather entertaining experience, the multiplayer element also makes the game easier to handle and mixing the heroes' powers much more straightforward.Trine 2's replayability is a bit scarce: once you've been playing through the whole game and found a solution to all the puzzles and obstacles, the only real reason to come back for a second run is to play with your friends or change your default character. There are also collectables to be found inside the levels (pieces of poetry and paintings/concept art), but finding them isn't exactly a serious challenge.The Goblin Menace DLC is the only additional content released for Trine 2 and follows the story of Amadeus, Zoya and Portius after their great adventure as they try to save Amadeus' wife from an aggressive army of goblins. The DLC doesn't offer any new gameplay elements whatsoever, both in general mechanics and characters' abilities: on the other side, however, it lasts for some interesting hours, has its own story and, if possible, the level design is even more complex and gorgeous than the one from the main game.Trine 2: Complete Story is an entertaining game with its own peculiar identity and apparel that I found very enjoyable, moreso if taken on with a pair of friends along the way			"

												This is another begrudging approval. Trine 2 is not a bad game, but it's also not awesome. Most of it is, well, boring. Admittedly, that boringness is nicely polished.The first Trine had a neat gimmick in the ability to instantly switch between the three character classes, and the fact that you sometimes had to use this to solve puzzles. The problem is that Trine 2 doesn't really build on this in any meaningful way. It's just more of the same. Add to that the fact that the story is even less relevant to our characters this time around (they don't even know the people who the story revolves around) and it's hard to care about anything that happens.The combat requires no thought and you can generally brute force your way through without any problems. Even the boss fights can be bulldozed through with simple repetition. And once you put enough upgrades into the wizard the same can be said for the puzzles. That means that the early game and first few levels are significantly more challenging because you won't have those abilities yet. But put in a little time and thought and the game becomes a breeze.It looks very nice - they definitely upped the graphical fidelity this time around. It comes at a cost though. The first Trine ran just fine on my standard work laptop, while Trine 2 gets about one frame a second.There also seems to be less banter and fewer jokes between the characters this time around. It's still there a little bit, but it's disappointing there's not more because that was largely what made the first game so charming.If you absolutely loved the first Trine then it's probably worth a quick playthrough of the second. But while there are some nice cosmetics and a few hours of diverting gameplay, the series seems to have misplaced its soul.			"

												This is another begrudging approval. Trine 2 is not a bad game, but it's also not awesome. Most of it is, well, boring. Admittedly, that boringness is nicely polished.The first Trine had a neat gimmick in the ability to instantly switch between the three character classes, and the fact that you sometimes had to use this to solve puzzles. The problem is that Trine 2 doesn't really build on this in any meaningful way. It's just more of the same. Add to that the fact that the story is even less relevant to our characters this time around (they don't even know the people who the story revolves around) and it's hard to care about anything that happens.The combat requires no thought and you can generally brute force your way through without any problems. Even the boss fights can be bulldozed through with simple repetition. And once you put enough upgrades into the wizard the same can be said for the puzzles. That means that the early game and first few levels are significantly more challenging because you won't have those abilities yet. But put in a little time and thought and the game becomes a breeze.It looks very nice - they definitely upped the graphical fidelity this time around. It comes at a cost though. The first Trine ran just fine on my standard work laptop, while Trine 2 gets about one frame a second.There also seems to be less banter and fewer jokes between the characters this time around. It's still there a little bit, but it's disappointing there's not more because that was largely what made the first game so charming.If you absolutely loved the first Trine then it's probably worth a quick playthrough of the second. But while there are some nice cosmetics and a few hours of diverting gameplay, the series seems to have misplaced its soul.			"

												Trine 2: Complete Story is an hybrid between a platform and puzzle game developed by developer Froze Byte and follows the adventure of three heroes, Amadeus the Magnificent, Zoya and Pontius the Brave, as they are guided by a mysterious magical entity, the titular Trine, to face a dark plot involving their kingdom. The Complet Story edition adds to the original some tweaks and include the only major DLC for the game, Goblin Menace, for free.The main beef of Trine 2 is about using the unique perks and abilities of each character or combine them as needed in order to advance in the levels you are thrown in: while there are some enemy encounters through the game, they are a rarity and are easily overcame with the trio's basic abilities (even the few bosses featured are pretty straightforward, save for the final bosses, who are more puzzle game fare in nature). Amadeus the Magnificent doesn't have any combat abilities to speak of and is rather fragile, but can conjure crates or move elements of the scenery to help his comrades. Zoya, instead, is a classic rogue character: she can move faster and jump higher than the other two characters, use a grappling tool to swing around on wooden surfaces and damage enemies from afar using her bow and different kind of arrows. Finally, Portius the Brave is a very sturdy, shielded warrior who fills the role of the group's tank against enemies and heavy damage dealer: after unlocking some of his additional abilities, however, Portius also becomes useful during the platforming sections as a support character.The levels of Trine 2 feature several experience orbs you can collect to level up your characters: each level gained unlocks an ability point you can spend in the talent tree of each hero. Some of these unlocked abilities only enhance the skills the characters already posses, while others introduce totally new gimmicks capable of making the later section of the game much easier to handle.It can be argued that one of the main attraction in Trine 2 are its impressive visual, especially for being a side scroller game: all the characters and environments are rendered in great 3D detail and the scenaries are multiple layers to them. The art style also feels rather unique.One of the main novelty of Trine 2 in comparison to the original game are its only features: a party of three players can experience the whole adventure while playing together online, each controlling his/her own character. On top of being a rather entertaining experience, the multiplayer element also makes the game easier to handle and mixing the heroes' powers much more straightforward.Trine 2's replayability is a bit scarce: once you've been playing through the whole game and found a solution to all the puzzles and obstacles, the only real reason to come back for a second run is to play with your friends or change your default character. There are also collectables to be found inside the levels (pieces of poetry and paintings/concept art), but finding them isn't exactly a serious challenge.The Goblin Menace DLC is the only additional content released for Trine 2 and follows the story of Amadeus, Zoya and Portius after their great adventure as they try to save Amadeus' wife from an aggressive army of goblins. The DLC doesn't offer any new gameplay elements whatsoever, both in general mechanics and characters' abilities: on the other side, however, it lasts for some interesting hours, has its own story and, if possible, the level design is even more complex and gorgeous than the one from the main game.Trine 2: Complete Story is an entertaining game with its own peculiar identity and apparel that I found very enjoyable, moreso if taken on with a pair of friends along the way			"

												If you're looking for something to play with a couple of mates, look no further. Ridiculously good combination of action and puzzles, with a pretty good sense of humour. I play this with both casual and lifestyle gamers, and everyone loves it.Smoother controls than the original, and a bettere balance between puzzles and action. If you're the kind of person who likes telling people how to play games, don't play this game with your friends. It's really boring if someone is telling you how to do everything.			"

												The wonderful and ingenius second installment of what I think is the best physics based puzzle game franchise. This sequel offers a unique fairytale storybook style in contrast to the dark, somewhat dungeon based original. The game feels more open than its predecessor despite removing items and replacing them with sparce non-gameplay influencing collectibles. This game is packed with impressive, long levels and excellent replayability. Players have to be more creative and conservative as puzzle are not as easily circumvented though solving them is more interesting and visually rewarding. This game is well worth buying at a sale (about $5) and has an equally incredible expansion pack (about $2 on sale) that adds a new chapter to the story and plenty of new levels and skills to play with. I truly recommend fans of puzzle games and casual gamers to buy this game. Also, see my review of the original Trine.			"

												that was bright and funny experience even though i hate platformers.you can complete the game in multiplayer, which is great, and you also can switch characters with you friend.each character has his unique skills, but for me the most interesting was wizard: he can create objects fromthe air literally. and after that you can use telekinetics to operate with those objects. i never saw anything like this before, so i was very exited. i am extremely bad in jumping and such, but with telekinetics i could build a bridge for myself and help my dexterity-gifted companion reach some difficuld places. i could never imagine that playing the platformer game can bring me so much fun!and the graphics,   i should mention that this game is really beautifull and full of cute details. try it and see by yourself!

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous, fun game that I would wholeheartedly recommend, even though I am not someone who normally enjoys puzzle games. The world is vibrant and colorful, with great music and fun, if simple, characters to go along with it. It is a light-hearted, relaxing, fun game with a lot of charm. The puzzles were enjoyable. I had a good laugh with my co-op partner. We trolled each other and had quite a few memorable moments playing the game. I feel like the wizard was the most well-thought out character in the game and that the thief and knight didn't get quite as much attention as the wizard, but this is a very minor nitpick. Playing the thief and the knight wasn't a bore; I mostly played the thief during my playthrough and still had a great experience. The puzzles were creative, but not frustrating. I didn't feel that any of the puzzles were unfair. I found myself laughing at the silly mistakes we made more often than not.The balance between combat and puzzle sections leave no room for boredom. And the adjustable level of difficulty gives newcomers and veterans a fair chance to prove their abilities. Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.The DLC in form of Goblin Menace adds a couple new levels, a new story, and several new skills which will also be available in the original game.Overall Trine 2 feels more refined than its predecessor and the beautiful artwork in combination with the creative puzzle sections are very persuasive and entertaining. In addition it offers enough content to justify itself as a worthy sequel to Trine.Fun fact: Due to relatively poor sales for Trine 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the conversion for the expansion for these consoles was deemed not be cost effective, thus Trine 2: Goblin Menace was never released for these platforms. The graphics are top notch with great lighting. The fluidity of the animation and controls are perfect so that while some of the puzzle sections may be difficult at times they are never blamed on the slick controls. The levels are long enough to be enjoyable and not too long where they get boring. Each level offers a variety of landscapes and scenery, all of which are beautiful. The storyline is forgettable, but still sets up a good reason for why you are playing the game. The three different characters offer very different ways of playing and each offer different ways to solve the puzzles. Think of it as an action only version of Quest for Glory where each character has a different solution to each puzzle. The addition of the Goblin Menace, the Dwarven Carverns and now the Workshop has helped expand and continue the gameplay of this fabulous series.Trine 2 takes everything that made Trine fun and improves on it. It has better combat, and more entertaining puzzels. The soundtrack is great, and the game looks visually gorgeous, I have got to say Trine 2 Really is pretty great overall, and it is still modable, so again, this is a great aspect to have if you are looking to get your moneys worth. I would reccomend Trine 2 to anyone looking for an Indie game, a Sidescroller, Puzzle, or artsy looking game. I have got to say there is a good ammount of fun to be had with Trine 2, so dont pass judgement too quickly.The mechanics of the game are a refinement and improvement over the original Trine, with you switching between heroes on the fly and using their respective strengths to fight and puzzle your way through various environments, however this time it feels much slicker, and much more confident in what it does, there's many points where you'll be scratching your head, only to have the light flick on with a genuine ""AH HA!"" moment. It's never punishingly difficult, but it's pleasantly challenging. The lack of gore and fantasy nature of the game makes it very family friendly too, older children will get a kick out of the fantasy setting, and adults will no doubt get many of the references. In this it resembles a Pixar film, a comparison I make very affectionately.Do please check this game out, it deserves your time and attention. "

												The brilliant artistry, great soundtrack, and immersive real-time puzzles in this game are, if possible, even better than it's predecessor. Although Trine 2 features less RPG elements than Trine 1, the fun is none the less for it. In Trine 2, you play once again as Pontius the knight, Zoya the theif, and Amadeus the wizard, while battling new foes, using new abilities, and solving new puzzles, all in a thoroughly beautiful fairy tale world of action, myth and mystery.Once again, I recommend this installment of the Trine franchise to any and all gamers.

												Where do I even BEGIN with this game?First, the gameplay. The puzzles in the game CAN be difficult at times, but they can be solved in many ways.Second, the story. What could be said that hasn't been said already about it? It has everything anyone could possibly want in a fairytale story: Three heroes on a quest,  majestic fantasy lands, and a villain the heroes must wage war on.Third, the characters. They all have their own personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Amadeus is a wizard, so he can conjure boxes and planks and lift objects. Pontius is a knight, making him the go-to guy for battling enemies. And Zoya is a thief--whoops! I mean archer. She has a bow for ranged attacks, and uses a grappling hook to swing from point A to point B.Fourth, the music. I'm just gonna come out and say it; Ari Pulkkinen really outdid himself here. Such incredible melodies and crescendos make it all the more enjoyable. Listening to these compositions, you'd think these were actually covers for songs by Blackmore's Night!Fifth, the cast. The voice actors from the last game made it to the sequel. Namely, Kevin Howarth(Amadeus), Victoria Kruger(Zoya), and Brian Bowles(Pontius). But there are also two other voice actors that do a good job as their characters. Also, Terry Wilton(narrator), I love you, but you GOTTA stop milking your role here. You're just too good! You have a gift.Sixth, and most importantly, the presentation. When Frostbyte said they featured every color of the rainbow, they weren't kidding. In fact, I saw a couple of rainbows throughout the game! it all looks so bright and vivid like a fantasy world would normally look.So, that's all I gotta say. Check this game out for yourselves. You WON'T be disappointed.			"

												I cannot recommend this game highly enough. Trine 2 is one of the best platformers I have ever played. The game gives you an unparalleled ability to experiment and solve navigation, combat and item collection puzzles in a multitude of ways. It also has a wonderful physics system, tight controls, great voice acting and it's also one gorgeous looking game.  "

												The wonderful and ingenius second installment of what I think is the best physics based puzzle game franchise. This sequel offers a unique fairytale storybook style in contrast to the dark, somewhat dungeon based original. The game feels more open than its predecessor despite removing items and replacing them with sparce non-gameplay influencing collectibles. This game is packed with impressive, long levels and excellent replayability. Players have to be more creative and conservative as puzzle are not as easily circumvented though solving them is more interesting and visually rewarding. This game is well worth buying at a sale (about $5) and has an equally incredible expansion pack (about $2 on sale) that adds a new chapter to the story and plenty of new levels and skills to play with. I truly recommend fans of puzzle games and casual gamers to buy this game. Also, see my review of the original Trine.			"

The story got a little deeper, the levels became more challangeable, and the skills also developed well.A few added cutscenes support story telling. The characters got the same synchronspeakers and the scenaries and background songs are as great as in the first part. If you need a more detailed review watch my review on Trine 1 which you can find on my profile page.Trine 2 has nothing new to offer in the game universe but is a great jump and run, puzzle game combined with fighting elements and a fun multiplayer option.

												Probably one of my favorite games. I'm really picky when it comes to games, but this one stands out to me. Ambition all around. Very detailed animations, great physics, controls are comfortable and it's just REALLY beautiful. Highly recommended to play in 3D if you can get your hands on it. But, it's probably less fun if you play it alone. Co-op it and you're going to be laughing a lot. Solo is alright too but it's really intended to be played together. But for the price, especially during sales it's worth it. (Still can't believe the price of this game actually drops to 1.50 during the sales, these devs deserve a lot more for this ambitious game.)Voice actors are silly, I find it pretty comedic. Story's easy to follow because they don't overwhelm you with a ton of hierarchies.			"

												The brilliant artistry, great soundtrack, and immersive real-time puzzles in this game are, if possible, even better than it's predecessor. Although Trine 2 features less RPG elements than Trine 1, the fun is none the less for it. In Trine 2, you play once again as Pontius the knight, Zoya the theif, and Amadeus the wizard, while battling new foes, using new abilities, and solving new puzzles, all in a thoroughly beautiful fairy tale world of action, myth and mystery.Once again, I recommend this installment of the Trine franchise to any and all gamers.

												Where do I even BEGIN with this game?First, the gameplay. The puzzles in the game CAN be difficult at times, but they can be solved in many ways.Second, the story. What could be said that hasn't been said already about it? It has everything anyone could possibly want in a fairytale story: Three heroes on a quest,  majestic fantasy lands, and a villain the heroes must wage war on.Third, the characters. They all have their own personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Amadeus is a wizard, so he can conjure boxes and planks and lift objects. Pontius is a knight, making him the go-to guy for battling enemies. And Zoya is a thief--whoops! I mean archer. She has a bow for ranged attacks, and uses a grappling hook to swing from point A to point B.Fourth, the music. I'm just gonna come out and say it; Ari Pulkkinen really outdid himself here. Such incredible melodies and crescendos make it all the more enjoyable. Listening to these compositions, you'd think these were actually covers for songs by Blackmore's Night!Fifth, the cast. The voice actors from the last game made it to the sequel. Namely, Kevin Howarth(Amadeus), Victoria Kruger(Zoya), and Brian Bowles(Pontius). But there are also two other voice actors that do a good job as their characters. Also, Terry Wilton(narrator), I love you, but you GOTTA stop milking your role here. You're just too good! You have a gift.Sixth, and most importantly, the presentation. When Frostbyte said they featured every color of the rainbow, they weren't kidding. In fact, I saw a couple of rainbows throughout the game! it all looks so bright and vivid like a fantasy world would normally look.So, that's all I gotta say. Check this game out for yourselves. You WON'T be disappointed.			"

												Kill my boyfriend and refuse to respawn him. 11/10.This game has beautiful visual effects, a trio of unique characters who each possess different abilities to help get you through the levels, and a co-op system so enjoyable that you can intentionally get your friends killed and troll around with them. (read above)The controls are extremely easy for both controller and keyboard, the music is addictively enjoyable and it'll have you (and friends) working together to get through the many puzzles and stages in each level. If you enjoy fantasy platformer games then this is an ideal game for you.Want this game during a steam sale? This is definitely worth it. But, I'd only recommend it for an on sale price as I wouldn't pay $20 for the full pack.			"

I love the local co-op mode with 3 xbox controllers. It is a very fun and bonding experience, which I have not seen replicated at this level so far in any other game.

												I haven't completed the game as of yet, but I must say it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. It has to be experienced co-op aswell. Perfectly crafted. I do hope they continue to make more games like this as it is absolutely wonderful. By far one of my favourite co-op gaming experiences to date.			"

												Got Trine 2 in a bundled special offer together with Trine and Trine 2 Goblin Menace.Trine 2 developed pretty good. The story got a little deeper, the levels became more challangeable, and the skills also developed well.A few added cutscenes support story telling. The characters got the same synchronspeakers and the scenaries and background songs are as great as in the first part. If you need a more detailed review watch my review on Trine 1 which you can find on my profile page.Trine 2 has nothing new to offer in the game universe but is a great jump and run, puzzle game combined with fighting elements and a fun multiplayer option. The Goblin Menace DLC is a great addition and worth its price. If you are a bit short on money i suggest you wait for a special offer. Its a must have for everyone who loves this genre.			"

												Amazing looks for a game, with fun puzzles and a fun atmosphere. It is also very enjoyable with friends, so co-op is definitely recommended. The mechanics work very well between the three characters which makes for interesting methods of playing and solving puzzles.I have only one downside for the game, in which combat for Pontius is very easy (maybe that's the point idk) and the enemies could be buffed for more complex attacks.In conclusion, one of the best co-op games I have played.13/15 - ""Co op genius""			"

												Kill my boyfriend and refuse to respawn him. 11/10.This game has beautiful visual effects, a trio of unique characters who each possess different abilities to help get you through the levels, and a co-op system so enjoyable that you can intentionally get your friends killed and troll around with them. (read above)The controls are extremely easy for both controller and keyboard, the music is addictively enjoyable and it'll have you (and friends) working together to get through the many puzzles and stages in each level. If you enjoy fantasy platformer games then this is an ideal game for you.Want this game during a steam sale? This is definitely worth it. But, I'd only recommend it for an on sale price as I wouldn't pay $20 for the full pack.			"

The graphic effects and ambientstyle, the physics and all these small little details wrapped in a 3-man  online co-op are really a great experience.

I like the easy respec system, just click reset and you can do another set up if your in any trouble of going ahead, or simply bored with the current playstyle. My favorite characters was all 3. Nice mix up and very different skillsets, you could not complete the game with neglecting one, you need all 3.You can rush thru the game in 10 hours, I did it in 14 but I was very slacking with getting every bonus item on each level.Pros:- Beautiful colours- Very nice music- Good game mechanics- Very few bugsCons:- Well none that I can think of			"

												I adore this game.  In addition to brilliant illustration (I particularly loved bouncing on giant starfish and pumpkins), it has two levels of puzzles: the basic puzzles for each level, which vary in composition over the course of the game (unlike many games where they start to feel stale very quickly); and collecting all the experience ampules, which can be quite challenging, especially in the expansion.  There are also multiple combat difficulty levels.One note for Linux users: it doesn't play entirely nicely with the Ubuntu desktop (Unity).  Consider running it in a plain X session, or running it under Windows.			"

												This is a type of game that actualy deserves more credit. It' a game with wonderfull artwork and imaginative surroundings. It is sometimes hard for a game to have both amazing graphics AND a great storyline at the same time. The combat in the game is allso very smooth in a challenging way. You even sometimes get to switch caracters in the middle of a boss fight to be able to complete it. Afterall the amizing thing is the puzzles that challenges you creative mind to float in to the fantasy world and figure your path forth. The puzzles could be a little bit harder, but thats just a matter of taste ;) I recomend the game for someone who likes puzzle imaginary games and above all have a strong computer. I'ts not needed, but you will get the full experience of it. Me likes ;D			"

												The second game in this series brings a great deal of graphical improvements with environments that look and feel more interesting and intense than the previous game. Combat is pretty straightforward and the game foregoes the treasure system for a more simplified approach, with 6 of the skills unusable until the game has been completed. This time through I decided to play it with a friend and that made the overall experience much more enjoyable.			"

												I've now finished but not perfect cleared both Trine and Trine 2 with the expansions. I like them both. The humour works, the graphics are amazing, the puzzles are the right difficulty level for me (although admittedly I suck at games like this) and the game feels a good length. It is short but it doesn't feel like it needs to be longer. Unlike the first Trine, this game works well with the controller.			"

												When I played Trine 1, I was in love with that game. Moving on to Trine 2, I feel I am sickly obsessed with this game. It made improvements in almost every imaginable way to an already perfect game. Characters have more diverse and interesting skills, there're a lot more secrets to uncover and the levels are ever more expansive and intriguing. And combat in general is a lot better because each character has more ways to deal with enemies.What I love Trine 2 the most is how each level feels very different from another, you have jungles, caves, deserts, snowy mountains, beaches, etc, essentially any imaginable environment you want to visit exists in this game, that great diversity combined with the game's amazingly charming visual shall guarantee one of the most pleasant experiences ever!

												This game is fantastic. It's even better than the first game, and the first one was pretty great. Go see my review of that game as a starting point, then come back here. Trine 2 has pretty much all of the cool mechanics of its predecessor, but adds some really neat new ones. The visuals are even better than the first, if that's possible. There are new enemies and obstacles to overcome and some pretty cool boss fights. Almost anything that made the first game great is here plus more. The only thing I can think of missing from the first game is the items that you could find and distribute among the 3 characters to improve them. But I never felt they were that impactful anyway, so it was probably a wise choice to leave them out.  With the goblin story DLC this games has more levels than the first and has a ton of achievements to boot. You really should give this game a try.			"

												I bought this because it was on sale (2.99) at the time, and was looking for another puzzle co-op game to feed in to my Portal 2 co-op mode obsession. This was totally different, but fun, some replayability due to different ways of solving puzzles, flexible enough to work as both single and multiplayer, and definitely worth the 3 bucks when on sale, I'd even say probably worth the full prize. This is the first I've played of the series and may pick up the 1st and 3rd soon.			"

It is $3 now so why not????!!!Puzzle platformer with great co-op design and beautiful graphics. Gameplay: pretty standard puzzle platformer with some element of action, so if you are interested in this genre you will probably get exactly what you expected. No surprises, but still fun.Plot: Personally I don't think plot is that great. It is acceptable, but doesn't add much value to the gaming experience in general. Art: Graphics is fantastic - I have tons of screenshot just because it is a genuinely beautiful game. Co-op: I finished my first playthru alone and played with friends for several more. Playing alone is perfectly fine (and fun) but the co-op mode just makes it better- casual, funny, and no one feels left out.Difficulty: Platforming is not challenging at all. Some puzzle might take a while for the first time if you play alone but in general very managable (and having a few challenging puzzles is not a bad thing)Replay value: Acceptable, for collectables, achievements and new possible solutions from different skills. Also just fun to see how your friends play the game for the first time.Price: Slightly overpriced, but absolutely worth it when on sale (and it's on sale fairly often) "

												This must be the first game I've played(that I remember) that I've also finished on the same day I started it on(according to Steam, it took me 8 hrs to finish so that would have meant I sat next to my computer playing this game from beginning to finish for 8 hrs straight), story wise I think that might be a credits bugged becauyse it kept rolling or this game has a really long set of credits to go through...? Or it was suppose to happen and it's just a matter of how long it takes you to get bored by reading the repeated credits? hahahaha I was expecting for something at the end, like a reward for watching through the entire credits, maybe a bonus cut scene or something. All done on medium difficulty.So the story continues from Trine 1 if you've played that, with the same three characters. I didn't really dwell too much into the story, more at having fun and trying to solve them puzzles....hahahaaa At least the puzzles here aren't as fustrating as the ones in Trine 1, or maybe it was because at times I had a coop random help me out rather me trying to solo it alone...? I don't know, I might try solo this to see if there was a difference in puzzle difficulty and length...when I can be bothered of ccourse...hahaha XPGameplay wise, is pretty similar to its prequel, though you have a slightly different system to upgrade your character's abilities from the first. For some reason, Trine 2 felt more fun to play than Trine 1, maybe I started off with mutliplayer coop(instead of soloing the campaign myself) and expected/hoped randoms to come drop by - which they did at times.Graphics, yeash definitely an improvement over Trine 1 original, though there's an Enchanted version that pretty much puts it on par with this game. My settings are as follows: 1920x1080 @ 144Hz, Anti-Aliasing @ Extremem so that apparently is FXAA + 4xSSAA and I also had V-sync on, so I don't have to worry about screen tearing. Graphics detail level is on Very High and I don't have anything to play this game on stereoscopic 3D mode so I leave it on default which is Automatic.Whilst ingame, I've notice I've never actually got to 144fps mark which was a shame because it didn't make good use of my 144Hz monitor... it seems to be hovering around 60-ish(sometimes up to 70 and up to 100 duringthe non-ingame cut scenes; I believe it hasn't ever dipped below 60, ok maybe 58 or so, but it hasn't gone down any further than that), which is still good. Though, since one of my GTX 770s is practically offline(as nvidia disabled SLi for windows XP on geforce cards 600 and up - which I later found out AFTER I bought two of these bad boys for the purpose of SLi; but don't worry, my windows 7 boot will make up for it - yes it's a dual boot system, so it wasn't all for nothing! :P Actually, I believe, since this game uses PhysX, my 2nd 770 might be the dedicated PhysX card for this system so that means less load for the first card which is offloaded to the 2nd card and since the 2nds card is also the exact same 770, it should be a *perfect* match up)But yeah, they look pretty.Sound, I believe this game appears to be running surround sound(I was able to get sound from my rear right and left, my my side left and right don't appear to be working or I didn't hear anything from them because they're so soft, so this could be a 5.0 channel game or 4.0 channel game...), though I'm not sure if there's an LFE channel or if the center speaker is in use(I didn't actually test this, I just wanted to enjoy the game for what it is and not try to find something to criticize about).Yeah, I had fun, so I guess I recommend this - definitely got my money's worth from this however much I paid for this - I don't actually remember how much I bought this for, apparently got it two years ago...or at least that's what it said before I launched the game today). I did play some multiplayer coop and yes it does work, but there's like hardly any one hosting, so best bet is to start your own and hope randoms come by and play.===========================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												A fun game that interlases a magical storyline with a ""puzzle-map."" If you've played either game in the Shank series, this is very similar but focuses more on the puzzle platforming. The visuals are very, very nice and the backgrounds sometimes mix into the foreground so you do not always expect something to happen. The story, unfortunately, is skippable and doesn't stick; I just played the levels and skipped most of the cutscenes. With that said, the game is fairly short especially if you're doing coop. Preferably played with a controller.Obligatory score: 8/10			"

Short version: 92% (73% for the DLC)Trine 2 takes a bold step and turns into a more puzzle-oriented game with a reworked and upgraded balance and ability system. Completed with larger, more detailed and even more charming levels, the game is superior to the predecessor in almost every way. Too bad the DLC couldn’t hold this level of quality.Long version:Like all sequels, Trine 2 tries to give you more of the things that made the first installment good while trying to re-balance or redo all the parts where it lacked.This of course means that the game looks even better than Trine. The levels offer more variety, they are more detailed than ever, and they are also are more challenging, forcing you to use all three characters for real this time.This also takes us to the more criticised part: whereas Trine was a traditional platformer, Trine 2 is more of a puzzle game with platforming elements. There are several parts on every level where you may need to stop and try to figure out how to proceed, and it usually involves the abilities of at least two characters. On one hand, it’s a major improvement, but on the other hand it does feel like a setback compared to the first game’s fluidity.Whereas Trine used the simplest of stories, Trine 2 tries to give you a little more complex narrative on why are you visiting the various levels. Don’t expect anything groundbreaking, though. The three main heroes also receive a makeover, giving them truly unique character traits and personalities, and their banter has improved a lot too.Sadly the game is not without faults, and these faults even have a name: the Goblin Menace DLC. Even though it gives you even more levels, all of them rely on one new gimmick: the anti-gravity arrow. You won’t find many puzzles where proceeding isn’t tied to this one ability, turning the new levels into a never-ending series of tedious trial-and-error jumps into thin air, which will wear very thin by the time you reach the floating islands. At least these new levels look even better than before, so it’s a small consolation.			"

												This game has one of the most beautiful graphics.But the gameplay itself... It's just fine. There are some elements from Portal 2 in it, only less fun and challenging.What I particularly didn't like about this game, is that the puzzles require not that much of a brain as reaction speed.Often it's about how fast can you press the buttons or how precisely can you place objects. The game does not give you that much opportunities to enjoy your ability to solve puzzles.Compared to Trine, Trine 2 is better: both in big things like the story, the graphics and the mechanics, and in small things likethe ability to reset skill points (though, they also should have kept the floating platform skill from the first game);and the option to save the game at any point (in the first game you had to continue from the beginning of the level).Note: the DLC ""Goblin Menace"" is annoyingly hard, as the level design is wrapped around tight opportunity windows and precise reaction, which is quite problematic due to controls and mouse sensitivity issues.Despite all the flaws, the game is worth the money, specially with a discount. Better played in CoOp than single player mode, as some areas are insanely hard for a single player.I give it 6/10 "

												After playing this for a while I love it. Not the best story line in the world but its worth listening too. The graphics are amazingly amazing, and I decided to write this review after blowing up an army of goblins with an explosive arrow. I definitely reccomend it, as well as being one of the few games on steam being perfect for steam big picture. It also has a level editor that I am having fun messing with and I can't wait to make a mod for it. Overall I highly suggest it and the only con I have is it is a little hard to figure out the puzzles sometimes but there is even hints for it. Thanks for reading.			"

												The concept has a potential but the game design has some flaws.Pros:+ Pretty graphics.+ Kids friendly.+ Has some puzzles in it that involve phyiscs.+ Production valuesOn the edge:? Combat is pretty simple? Thief character is limited to arrows and ropes.Cons- Reptitive puzzles solutions.- Puzzles are always about ""how do I get there"".- Co-Op is weak. You rarely feel that you have to work together and when you do, it just look weird and very awkward.Final recommendation:The game is not bad by all means. It looks and sounds wonderful. It might be fun for younger ages demographics. However, if you were a hardcore 2d gamer who emphasis on gameplay over production value, I'd say to give this a pass or buy it on discount.			"

												Ahhhh, returning to the world of Trine. I was very much looking forward to this sequel as, I enjoyed the first game quite a bit. The magic/melee/platform hopping game with all the classic puzzle elements are present, along with some new tricks here and there.If you've played the first Trine, you'll know what to expect. So, a bit samey. But a more colourful world along with some new upgrades, enemies, locations, puzzles and a nice littly story, certainly keeps things interesting.So, a nice engaging romp with our three favourite characters. And there's a good amount of gameplay to be had along the way as well! "

												Trine 2 is perhaps one of the most visually stunning 2D platforming games. Either playing co-op or on your own this really is a fantasy-themed 2D platformer with a difference. The game sets a new standard for puzzle driven adventures and the relatively short-length campaign has a wealth of overlaying puzzles and secrets and is an overall entertaining experience and a joy to play.Instead of the usual jump and grind gameplay of the generic platformers, Trine 2 offers a more intricate puzzles with the freedom to find various solutions. Even more interesting is when you’re playing with two or more players the game becomes a colourful array of opportunities to help each other along in an almost sandbox like environment.Switching from character to character is the only way to make any progress when playing alone in single player but invite some friends along and Trine 2 really shines through. Trine 2 features three heroes – a knight, wizard, and a thief – whom you can switch between at any point through the levels. All have their own individual strengths that they can bring to the table at any given time; this keeps the entertainment of gameplay going so you don't end up rage-quitting when getting stuck on one bit for far too long.THE GOOD- Clever platform/puzzle gameplay- Wonderful graphics with physics effects.- Brilliant sounds and speech- Excellent online co-operative playTHE BAD- Sometimes the puzzles are a bit repetitive.- No combat mode for the WizardDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												This game is awesome. The most fun I've had playing a co-op game with friends. I highly recommend this game to play with friends. It's also one of the few co-op games that you can play through the main story with friends. The gameplay overall is fun and polished. Not to mention this game looks gorgeous. Get this game. This game is a solid 10/10. "

												The game is breathtaking. The visuals are amazing, the original game was pretty, but Frozenbyte took it to another level in the sequel. Not to mention Ari Pulkkinen worked some magic on the soundtrack, the lighthearted high fantasy inspired tunes do a great job setting the mood, and just being great to listen to. The voice work is quirky and well done, and the co-op is an extremely welcome feature that allows you and your buddies to either chew threw the game, or screw off. An absolutely amazing experience, an improvement in every way over Trine. [9.5/10]			"

												I personally prefer the first game simply because this one was a little over done compared to the first one. Overally this game is about a 7/10, its decent and worth your time, but nothing really special. The game is gorgeous, though, and has a lot of really solid mechanics, but I think there was a lot of lost potential.			"

												Trine 2 is an excellent platformer, the difficulty settings accurately reflect what you sign up for, the soundtrack is again excellent, the visuals are breathtaking - and some of the puzzles clever and fights challenging. My only gripe is the ability to refund and re-spend ability points at will. It is great for experimentation, but honestly removes any sense of figuring a clever way around some of the puzzles. For example, you often run into a puzzle that you know you could have easily solved had you spent your points on platforms instead of new arrows. Rather than work out some ingenious solution around it - you reshuffle your points into platforms - pass the puzzle, and put them back where they were.It's a small mechanical decision but it dramatically effects my investment in play. There may be a mod to fix it, but this is a review of the base game and that's my only complaint. Other than that, worth the money if you like platformers. Check out the gameplay if you're unsure - it is exactly as fun and whimsical as it looks.Only people who may NOT like this are people looking for a fun co-op experience. With the full 3 players you can not switch, so if the crucial character dies - you basically have to respawn or backtrack. It seems like a system designed to make 3 friends hate each other.Other than that - worth every penny.			"

												I already know enough to give this game a review. It is such a treat to play it. I am only about 1/4 through and am loving every minute of it. This si what playing games is supposed to feel like, yet so often doesn't. It is a magical game. It improves upon everything not done properly  in the first game. You can play multiplayer co-op, although idiots will ruin it my running through and not letting you enjoy the charm. You can pick up where u left off in multiplayer and vice versa with single player. It saves your last checkpoint so no more having to finish the level. The music is phonomenal and soothing. The art, backgrounds, lighting, and ambience are all well done. All reviews have praised the beauty of a game. The thief is now more useful with a better working grappling hook and the mage can be somewhat offensive.			"

It's an awesome game, with such a wonderful plot. GET IT, and let you be amazed!			"

												Quick Summary: 2 dimensional side scrolling platformer with some combat and puzzle solving. There’s more danger than in the first Trine game, both from traps and from enemies. Co-op campaign play is available.Once again you take on the role of 3 heroes bound by the mystical Trine artifact. Instead of skeletons as enemies, this time most of the baddies are goblins, and the enemies are actually tougher in this game. Not only because they seem to have more life, but they also seem to attack unpredictably at times. Your quest for Trine 2 is defeating the Goblin Menace (and a witch) and restoring peace to the kingdom.Amadeus the wizard can conjure up boxes and planks for solving puzzles, Pontius the knight can kick goblin♥♥♥♥♥with his weapons, and Zoya the thief can shoot arrows or grapple onto wooden objects for platforming. Just like in the first Trine you only control one of the characters at any time, but you are free to instantly switch to one of the other two as the situation requires.  For example you enter a room and grapple up a ledge as the thief, then switch to the knight to kill all the critters, and finally switch to the wizard to telekinetically stack boxes on switches to exit the room. The game is pretty fast paced so this whole scenario could happen in 30 seconds.Pros:+Like the first Trine, the game as amazing graphics and art design, from the monsters to the background and particle effects. Even though the game is 2 dimensional, the incredible detail makes it feel like the background is part of the experience.+Most of the puzzles are easy enough that casual players won’t be put off. I know I get frustrated playing puzzle games, but in Trine 2 you can run past most of the game if you don’t want to be bothered collecting experience bonuses.+Unlike Trine 1, you can now reset your skill loadout at any time for free. This means you can easily change your character builds to confront specific challenges or complete specific Steam achievements. Cons: No real drawbacks.Trine 2, like the first game is something that every gamer should enjoy. If you’re looking for something to play with a casual gamer or family member, the Trine series is great for this. You’ll probably have the Complete Story edition too that includes the Goblin Menace DLC (with more difficult missions than the base game). Multiplayer coop gameplay is available and you can play with friends or strangers on Steam. "

												  Primeiramente: é sensacional!  Jogando pela primeira vez você percebe o gráfico bem construido e muito bonito, uma jogabilidade simples mas que atende todas as necessidades no decorrer do jogo e personagens super legais de se jogar. Um mago, um guerreiro e uma ladra.  Mas nem tudo são flores e magia. Apesar da trama bem elaborada e piadas bem feitas o jogo é bem curto. Ao longo dele temos prêmio bem bacanas como poemas (que fazem sentido apenas em inglês) e pinturas colecionáveis muito bem desenhadas. Apesar dos tesouros, o jogo é realmente curto.  Eis que surge a surpresa do dia: COMPREM A COMPLETE STORY. Ela fará você feliz e você se divertirá com mais horas de jogo e cenários mais bonitos. Fases bem elaboradas e assim que consegue-se todas as magias dos personagens o jogo fica 100% melhor.   Resultado final: é um jogo MUITO bom e realmente vale a pena.			"

""What is Trine 2?""Was the very first question someone asked me about Trine 2 was:And I kid you not folks, I looked at the person and tried desperately to not shout out loud ""YOU DON'T KNOW TRINE 2!???"" To be frank, I just calmly(I'm serious) told the person it's a 3 player co-op action/adventure/small rpg/ side scrolling platformer game in a 2.5D environment with gorgeous graphics and puzzling puzzles to test your mettle on.The sequel to Frozenbyte's earlier title Trine, Trine 2 builds upon it's predecessor foundations and game-play by flushing it all out. By means of adding even more graphical options and making the game stand out aesthetic wise to fit the side scrolling theme. The rpg skills you earn have been expanded so you can learn more than the limited amount you can spend points on in the first game. The puzzles you thought were easy in Trine 1 are perhaps significantly harder(just a little wee bit hard, depending if you can handle the mental strain) Granted it's not intensive as puzzles as the Portal franchise from Valve. Rather the puzzles are just there to halt your progress and think about in a minute or two on how to solve it. Story wise our three unfortunate(Or fortunate in finding trouble along the way) main protagonists find themselves entangled with a princess to save her kingdom from evil... BORING! Would've been your first impression of it, but it's far from a simple adventure to save a kingdom. Far from it indeed. There are documents hidden in chests scattered throughout the levels to provide further back story on the game itself. Which is invaluably precious in providing insight onto the simple task assigned above by a princess. I'll leave the rest to your imagination to see how the story will unfold... 3 Heads are better than 2? or 1?I played Trine 2 with 2 other friends of mine and had an absolute blast of a time enjoying the co-op aspect and coordinating with each other to advance to the next level. With the occasional friendly fire I accidently(sometimes) hit them with. Unintentional though! I by no means am a sadistic friend who enjoys the torment of my friends dying before me... Moving on, the options to play in co-op are a lot. you can choose to turn off friendly fire(don't turn this mode off when playing with friends to enjoy their suffering), turning off the option to lift your comrades with boxes,  or put on classic mode and stick with one character, or cheat and have the ability to choose on the fly a different character. 3 Shield-Bro's!? No problem. Let's shield our way!3 Thieves!? Lots of swinging vines here and there...3 Wizards!? Oh, the Box and Plank madness ensues!!!^ Or perhaps you young adventurers want to dabble and mix and match.2 Knights and 1 mage2 Thieves and 1 knight2 Mages and 1thief Go play with the combinations and pick whichever one suit your needs. Honestly, the game has much more appeal and replay ability if you play with a friend locally or in multiplayer, or if you're a gamer who likes playing it solo by all means do so! It depends on your play style of course. Just remember to get the most enjoyment of the experience my friend! An arrow passes through the air at deadly speed nearly nicking off her companion shield-bro's ear. Undeterred by the onslaught of arrows from the shield-bro's companion he continues on, while in passing says to the thief; ""And watch where you aim those arrow!"" The thief only shrugs. Shaking his head softly, he continued onwards on the path, bravely with naught a hint of fear. He charges straight into a path of goblins barring their path. Knowing such large army impedes their way the shield bro merely tells him companions...""I shall clear the way!""Sprinting his large body with a big beer belly under his armor he continues to charge straight towards the goblins......Only to find them in cages?Befuddled, the shield-bro looks in wonder at how such goblins had become entrapped in such wooden cages.""Too slow, my friend,"" says the wizard. His ever grin plastered on his face like a devil.the ensuing cry of an angered knight echoed loudly in the valley that day...-An excerpt from the adventures of 3 friends in the world of Trine 2... Sometimes all you need are friends by your side against a perilous journey of the ages.Total Times Beaten:1Legit: 1(Played 1 full play through with 2 of my friends)Score: 9.5 /10(Score is based off how much I enjoyed the game)(Legit is based off no cheating whatsoever, no guides, walkthroughs, video’s advice, etc.)Date reviewed: 4/15/15			"

												Gorgeous game. Trine 2 is gorgeous game. GORGEOUS! The world is beautifully built, enemies are beautiful, environment is beautiful, lightning effects are beautiful, everything is beautiful!Other than that, it's a great game. The puzzle mechanics are engaging and fun, but most of the time not hard at all. Combat mechanics are really simple, but it doesn't matter, it's fun and it looks great. Three very different characters offer very different play styles.The game generally isn't hard, but getting all of the collectibles and all experience points is really challenging. The one minor problem this game has is the amount of bugs. There is still quite few of them. Overall it's fantastic game, I can recommend it with all my heart. And did I mention it's gorgeous?			"

												Back in the early 90's almost every game was a platformer, so I had quite enough of them. Nowadays, I tend to avoid platformers for that very reason.Surprisingly, Trine 2 is an exception to the rule. If you remember The Lost Vikings, then you'll see a lot of similarities between that and the Trine series. In Trine, you also get 3 different characters good for their own abilities that help you solve puzzles and progress.The knight is for fighting the goblins and breaking things. The thief is about shooting arrows and climbing places with her rope (sometimes pushing goblins into pits in the process). The wizard is about conjuring boxes and planks, building from them and levitating everything that he can get ahold of.Unlike the retro platformers, this one is heavily based on physics. This applies to rocks, conjured items and monsters. It also makes the wizard a really fun character to play as.Another distinct feature of the Trine series is the graphics. The living backgrounds are beautiful and the colors are vivid, which can make Trine look better than many AAA titles.Compared to the original Trine game, the most obvious new feature of Trine 2 is its multiplayer mode that allows up to 3 players to play simultaneously. It makes it more fun and helps solving the in-game puzzles as well as finding all the experience and secrets on every map.On top of the above, and going away from the gameplay itself, Trine 2 is packed with little bonuses here and there. It's one of the very few games that support all kinds of 3D glasses out of the box (anaglyph, passive, active). It's also properly configured to be played with a gamepad. There's full Linux and Mac OS support too. And of course it's tightly integrated with Steam, having almost 100 achievements, trading cards and storing your saved games to the cloud.			"

												Bom, eu nao curto nem um pouco esse estilo de game, jamais compraria esse game mesmo com recomendaçao de alguem que o jogue. Ai um amigo me presenteou com esse game. Começei a joga-lo e ai percebi a grandeza do jogo. Foi ai que mudei tos os meus conceitos sobre o Trine. Otima jogabilidade, graficos bons e uma historia fantastica. E um game que a gente começa a jogar e nao da vontade de parar. Nota 9.

												If you like adventure games you'll love this.  First and foremost, the visuals, artwork and graphics of this game is astounding!  The use of colors mixed with great graphics just make this game eye candy.  The narrator is really good.  He has a nice storybook adventure sounding voice.  In this side scroller game you get to play three heroes and they all have special abilities.  During the game you can switch characters at will.  The game has a mix of obstacles, goblins, bosses and lots of adventure.  I love adventure games especially when they make you feel like playing a story.  I definitely recommend this adventure game!

												This game is pure beauty and very enjoyable to play. You can switch between 3 different characters with their own abilities anytime while playing and use these skills to solve the situation you're currently facing. There's plenty of riddling involved, as well as challenging fights and movement cooridination, requiring some practice and dexterity. The music adds a nice atmosphere and the possibility to play all levels in coop mode with 2 additional friends is a really nice feature. I highly recommend buying this game!			"

												Very nice game. The logical puzzles are fun, but sometimes repetitive. The levels are fairly easy, and navigation can sometimes be buggy.Despite all that the game features a wonderful scenery mixed with a wonderful narration. I would have liked if it was a bit more challenging, but as it is and for the price it is a wonderful game and I recommend it, especially if it's for younger audiences.			"

												Um jogo lindo,o jogo mais bonito entre os títulos exclusivos para download, ""Trine 2"" é uma aventura de plataforma cheia de puzzles simples e personagens divertidos. O modo cooperativo amplia a diversão, mas também torna ainda mais fáceis os desafios do game. A Frozenbyte conseguiu melhorar diversos aspectos do ""Trine"" original e caprichou no acabamento do jogo, tanto nos gráficos quanto na física e na dublagem, mas faltou desenvolver quebra-cabeças mais complicados.

												It's beautiful, and somewhat fun with a friend for all of ... an hour before gameplay becomes a tad gimmicky and repetitive, bordering on annoying. The games puzzles and graphics are not enough for it to survive alone as a full product and anything less than on a cheapo sale and you can do much more for your money. IMO this game is very over-hyped, I regret persuading my friend to buy it in the sale...as we both got bored in less than 2 hours.Perhaps it's good for a father and young daughter or son to play coop? I don't know, but the painfully childlike story is...more suited to children I think. Peace out.			"

A bit of a disappointment.The game looks really neat, and the concept is great. So are the puzzles and I imagine multiplayer would be really good also. I don't have much of a review on this because as you can see I haven't played very much, and that's for one reason entirely. The controls are absolutely terrible. I'm playing with a ps3 controller which works perfectly fine with other games and while I can see that being intrusive for some elements like the wizard's gravity spell, stuff like jumping should be improved by this and it's just NOT. I stopped playing and deleted the files because there's a certain place I just can't jump up to. Some of the ramp based puzzles are made so much harder than they need to be. Why can I make Mario in 1986 jump onto a simple platform but in 2016 it's so ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating it makes me want to tear my hair out?			"

												Rating 9.5/10Overview: 2d PlatformerThe Good:+ An absolutely gorgeous game both artistically and technically. Every level feels alive yet without being overly distracting towards the player. + Every level has its own unique environment. In addition the level design is equally impressive, the game does a great job of slowly introducing harder and harder platforming/puzzle sections. The physics based platforming means you can find solutions that were not intended by the developers. + Good blend between puzzles, platforming and combat+ The gameplay has remained relatively the same since Trine 1. You have 3 characters that you can change at any time to utilize their skills to progress through the level. + Killing enemies or finding experience allows you to upgrade any of the three characters. + A lot of options to customize the game + Soundtrack+ The DLC is fantastic and in some regards does an even better job of changing the environments every level than the main game. The Average:Hard to find an online game, not that big of a deal since the game is probably more enjoyable single player.Some of the experience in the levels are hard to see given the lighting and backdrop of the levels.The combat is a bit dull and not as fun. Most combat can be avoided however.  Conclusion:This is one of my favorite 2d platformers on Steam and should be played by anybody who is a fan of the genre. "

												Trine 2 is both a game and a piece of art that is fun to play with friends or in on your own. Firstly the three characters are unique, with both extremely different interesting abilities that range from the ability to create magical objects to the use of explosive arrows and flaming swords. Then the gameplay itself, the game is a mixture of physics based puzzles that can be solved in a multitude of ways and intermittent with onslaughts of goblins and more stranger creatures. In summery, I recommend Trine 2 as an blend of a range of traditional concepts coming together in a great way, but during longer playthroughs the game can become slighlty repetitative, this however is only after extensive time and can be fixed by simply leaving the game for half an hour and then coming back with a fresh mind.

												Trine 2 is one of the most beautiful and fun games I have ever played and has the best co-operative elements out of any game I have ever played and is some of the best and most fun and creative gameplay. The game has fantastic atmosphere, great level design with high amounts of detail and a fun use of physics. It's storyline is simple and a tad cliché but does have a lot of humour within it. A lot of humour also comes from co-op gameplay due to the puzzle solving required; the puzzles might I add are very fun and creative. The game has 3 characters witch the player alternates between with or without friends to get through the puzzles within the gameplay which is a great element to have, these characters are also very funny and have great story attached to them (background). Finally the game has artistic cutscenes to break up the levels which complement the game brilliantly. There aren’t really any downfalls to this game; it was a joy to play.13/15 - ""Fun and creative; brilliant co-op""			"

												One of the best co-op games I have ever played. Good pussels, great visuals and great music. A little repetitive with the bosses though and really anyone who knows what they are doing can beat them without dying, the harder part is getting there though. I would like to mention the story a bit but when I played this with my friends we were laughing too much to bother with the story because of how much we ♥♥♥♥ed up before the cutscenes. (and just in general)I would denfenetly recommend this game to anyone. Unfortunatly I think that 8 hours of gameplay (not 100% completed and DLC included) is not worth 16,99€ so purchase this during a sale or something, also get a couple of friends and make them buy this game and play together. It's made for co-op and it knows that.			"

												Trine 2 is a delightful change from the FPS stereotype of video games. The game is beautifully made with gorgeous lighting, and very detailed enviornments. Movements are smooth and fluid even on aging computers. There is a hint of humor here and there, along with a very simple and straight forward story. As an added plus, the online scrypt is very well written and remains smooth and glossy even on a slow internet connection. Over all, Trine 2 is a beautiful, relaxing physics platformer that is the perfectly executed and will provide about ten hours of gameplay for you and two friends (Three player co-op: Local or Online).

												Graphics/Design - 9 Sound - 7Gameplay - 6Value - 7Single Player Play Time - 7-9 hoursOverall 7.1This is easily the best looking 2D game I've seen.  It has decent sound that fits the game but nothing special otherwise.  Gameplay is the weakest facet of the game as it's very simplistic with puzzles and fighting that provide little challenge.  They should have focused more on the gameplay over graphics.  There's three main characters that each have special abilities you'll need once in awhile.  The only interesting character of the three is the wizard that allows you to build ways to manipulate the environment.  The focus of this game definitely seems to be graphics as the fighting and puzzles in the game practically seem like an after thought.  There's not much replay value other than to use the game as a graphical showpiece to friends.  It's a decent experience that makes you hope for a fully realized sequel.			"

Trine 2 is a little more balanced than the first installment and has a better storyline. If you have ever enjoyed a platformer in your life you owe it to yourself to buy Trine & Trine 2. They're that good.Вторая часть трайн — это жутко красивый платформер. Световые эффекты и замечательные задники хочется разглядывать бесконечно. Геймплей остался примерно таким же, как и в первой игре, но его немного более сбалансировали и убрали некоторые раздражающие элементы.

												Trine 2 has picturesque and bright visuals, not-quite-elaborate plot and simple but enjoyable gameplay. It's a traditional platformer full of jumping, fighting enemies, grabbing pickups, looking for carefully hidden treasures and evading various traps. Nice fairytale for kids, good time-spending and some eye relaxation for olders and elders.You have three heroes here, the commonplace set of warrior, mage, and thief; they have their own special skills, and game levels are intentionally designed to make use of all those talents. This puzzle can only be solved with mage's help, and that one is almost impossible to come through without a thief.Still, the game often allows several ways to handle an obstacle. You might choose one strategy, and it will pay out; you might choose another, and it will work for you either. It is especially evident when you compare singleplayer to multiplayer experience: a puzzle that you and your friend solved in cooperation turns out to be just as easy to crack when you are on your own.It also has some physics. This means that you can manipulate objects in different ways, making them move, jump, collide, fly, stick, slide, push, support, block, and on and on and on. This adds quite an amount of variability to the ways that you might choose to deal with a certain problem.Last words to say, Steam has acquired a good habit of providing 90% discounts for this game. Catch a good bargain, and you'll certainly have some money well spent.			"

												Trine was one of my favourite games released in 2009. Trine 2 follows in its footsteps, having everything that made the first one great, plus full online and cross-platform co-op modes, more diverse environments & puzzles, better (more challenging) enemies/bosses and ridiculously beautiful graphics. It's a 2.5D action puzzle-platformer. In Singleplayer you can switch between 3 distinct characters and use their abilities in order to overcome enemies, traps and other environmental hazards. In multiplayer everyone controls one of the characters, which gets interesting really quick as you now need to think of a way to not only get one character across traps but 2 or even 3. Tons of secret stuff & collectibles to find, New Game+ and an optional unique game mode for MP all add to the replayability. A Collector's edition is also available and comes with the official soundtrack as well as the artbook, if you are into that kind of stuff. Highly reccommend getting this game!			"

												One of the best co-op games I have ever played. Good pussels, great visuals and great music. A little repetitive with the bosses though and really anyone who knows what they are doing can beat them without dying, the harder part is getting there though. I would like to mention the story a bit but when I played this with my friends we were laughing too much to bother with the story because of how much we ♥♥♥♥ed up before the cutscenes. (and just in general)I would denfenetly recommend this game to anyone. Unfortunatly I think that 8 hours of gameplay (not 100% completed and DLC included) is not worth 16,99€ so purchase this during a sale or something, also get a couple of friends and make them buy this game and play together. It's made for co-op and it knows that.			"

												A great game to play through in a day with two friends.  There isn't much to say about this game, other than you can make new friends, or ruin old ones, depending on what they do, going into this game you can play singleplayer, but don't, the only way to play this game is with two friends, and the most compitant playing the wizard.  The wizard is the most broken character, and you can basicly fly across the entire map, assuming the mediocre AI doesn't shoot you down.  The other two characters are good, but the rogue is my personal favourite, being able to swing up high then shoot then enemys below you feels great.  This game is riddled with small bugs, but if you look past the graphical glitches it's a fun game.			"

Which is good in today's standart. I'm not superplayer and I finished the game in about a bit more than 10 hours.And it came with the DLC on sale.I really like that game :)			"

												I think it's totally worth it. I was considering Trine (2) for a while now and I finally got into buying it by buying the Frozenbyte Collection at 80% off for just 5,99€. After 2 days, I spent 10.1 hours playing it together with my sister. Graphics/VisualsI love the graphics. They run totally fine on my rather low end machine and look amazing in my opinion. I don't think I'll need to go into detail about them since that's what the screenshots are for.ControlsMy sister was playing the game on the keyboard while I was playing it with a very old controller. The controller needed a little bit of tweaking since at first the x/y-axis of the right joystick were reversed, however this was an easy fix. Another complaint is, that using the grappling hook with a controler is a little hard, but that's about it. It played wonderfully other than that. StoryThe story was easy to follow, nothing special, though. It does what it's supposed to do, yet the story is not what the game focuses at the most. (It worth noting that I have not beaten the game, yet.)MusicThe music was amazing! Not only did it fit what you were doing perfectly, but it was also very fun to listen to. It was infact, so good that I had to go to YouTube to listen to it after I played the game. I love it. GameplayThe controls were easy to pick up (except for the few minor complaints listed above) and getting into the game was very simple. While you are playing it you need to solve puzzles in order to progress, which varied between being very easy to being hard enough to keep us thinking for tens of minutes, which I find really well done. I have to say, though, that playing together with a friend really makes some of a lot easier than playing it on your own, so they would definitely be harder when I did so. However puzzles aren't the only thing the game is made of. Often enough you'll need to fight a horde of goblins or something and combat is actually pretty neat, especially thanks to the awesome music. A gameplay element that is worth noting are the upgrades, which make solving some puzzles easier and make some boni accessible. They are not overpowered (meaning that they won't make the game too easy), yet they also don't feel like there's no difference. The only complaint I got is that I once got a bug that made me unable to buy explosive arrows because they game told me I couldn't afford them, even though I could. This wasn't game breaking in any way though, as we just went for another upgrade instead, which was worth it in the end. AtmosphereThis is where the game shines even more than in the gameplay. Thanks to the atmospheric graphics, the really well done music and well made voice acting, the game scores a high score on this one. Combat feels really nice thanks to good looking effects/animations and really nice combat music and so do the puzzles. ConclusionTotally worth it, even at full price. 9.9/10			"

												Trine was one of my favourite games released in 2009. Trine 2 follows in its footsteps, having everything that made the first one great, plus full online and cross-platform co-op modes, more diverse environments & puzzles, better (more challenging) enemies/bosses and ridiculously beautiful graphics. It's a 2.5D action puzzle-platformer. In Singleplayer you can switch between 3 distinct characters and use their abilities in order to overcome enemies, traps and other environmental hazards. In multiplayer everyone controls one of the characters, which gets interesting really quick as you now need to think of a way to not only get one character across traps but 2 or even 3. Tons of secret stuff & collectibles to find, New Game+ and an optional unique game mode for MP all add to the replayability. A Collector's edition is also available and comes with the official soundtrack as well as the artbook, if you are into that kind of stuff. Highly reccommend getting this game!			"

												Trine 2 has picturesque and bright visuals, not-quite-elaborate plot and simple but enjoyable gameplay. It's a traditional platformer full of jumping, fighting enemies, grabbing pickups, looking for carefully hidden treasures and evading various traps. Nice fairytale for kids, good time-spending and some eye relaxation for olders and elders.You have three heroes here, the commonplace set of warrior, mage, and thief; they have their own special skills, and game levels are intentionally designed to make use of all those talents. This puzzle can only be solved with mage's help, and that one is almost impossible to come through without a thief.Still, the game often allows several ways to handle an obstacle. You might choose one strategy, and it will pay out; you might choose another, and it will work for you either. It is especially evident when you compare singleplayer to multiplayer experience: a puzzle that you and your friend solved in cooperation turns out to be just as easy to crack when you are on your own.It also has some physics. This means that you can manipulate objects in different ways, making them move, jump, collide, fly, stick, slide, push, support, block, and on and on and on. This adds quite an amount of variability to the ways that you might choose to deal with a certain problem.Last words to say, Steam has acquired a good habit of providing 90% discounts for this game. Catch a good bargain, and you'll certainly have some money well spent.			"

												Frozenbyte gives us a second helping of the trifecta in Trine 2. Same as last time you play as a the wizard, the knight and the thief but this time you have to restore balance to the land from an evil witch.The story is fairly thin and only serves as a mean to stitch the 13 levels together. You could breeze through them but you would be missing most of Trine 2's puzzles. As it's predecessor, they remain at the heart of the game. There is a fair bit of combat but it is repetitive and shallow, the fun resides in solving the puzzles. They range from the obvious to the rage inducing but the vast majority stand between the two. All feel rewarding once solved and thanks to video walkthroughs littered over the web you won't get stuck for long.The main star of Trine is it's visual and art direction. Quite frankly, this is one of the most beautiful game I have ever seen. Every sub-section of every sections of every levels is filled to to the brim with gorgeous detail. The amount of visual elements present in every screen is stupyfiyng. You could close your eyes, move the left stick forward for 3 seconds, open you eyes and see a brand new scene.The music, with it's assortment of medieval themes is right on par. Character animation on the other end is superb. For instance I loved how the wizard would bend and hold his hat when standing close to a venting shaft. I was surprised how new animation would show up even late into the game.I do have a couple of gripes with the game. First, the knight feels completely superflous, one could easily beat the game without ever using him. Boss fights repeat themselves and finally, some powers cannot be unlocked until you've played through the entire game. Pros :-Perfect visuals-Character animation is rich and varied-Solving puzzles is satisfyingCons :-Lack of balance between the characters-Combat seems like an aftertought-Achievements and completion needs a second playthroughFinal note :If you love to look at beautiful things then buy this game, it is a feast for the eyes. Solid puzzles, endearing animation and art style makes this game a joy to play.9/10 "

I'm only playing because I'm a completionist. The mini puzzles to get xp are the worst. The DLC xp, omg, you have use the gravity arrow all the time and build things to get high up. Some xp is SO well hidden you have to play the same level 3-4 times. Then you start to feel disgusted and write a bad review.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful! If you are into co-op singleplayer and like playing with a gamepad in combination with puzzle's, funny moments and some fighting, buy this game!Graphics are very nice and give you the impression as if you are in a dreamworld. The music gives another beautiful touch and delivers well. Game design is very nice and beating the bosses together with a friends is cool.			"

												The game is good, not sure about the enhanced edition not checked what it includes. In any case, if you like 2d stuff and good puzzles, you will love this. I think this is worth the money! If you check my playing time, ok I did stop at some point, but that does not mean I will not continue. I buy many games so it does not mean that I would not come back to this game later. Good graphics, very nice music, all is and at this price, you cannot go wrong! That is, in my opinion. If you want 3d, dont go with this game, but if you like good graphics and music and a bit of mystery and stuff like that... you might like this.Cheers... "

												Beat this game in one night. And I mean that in the best way possible. I'm hit or miss with indie games, especially side scrollers. But I had a good 5 hours or so of epic, colorful, creative and brilliant gameplay. So it's not the longest game, but if you have the money it's easily worth it at full price....but if it's on sale, you're just plain insane to not get this. It's only $2 at this writing. Best $2 you'll ever spend for the rest of your life, guaranteed (unless Trine 3 outdoes this one then goes on sale).			"

												Beautiful visuals and gameplay is very solid. I played through the game solo, but there are some areas I think require another human player. Another bonus is monster variety is better in Trine 2 and at least the goblins have personality and pleasing to look at than those skeletons in Trine 1.I have yet to play online or play with another human being, so I can't tell what the experience will be like. One thing is for sure is this game is very fun to look at and play!			"

												ProsFor kids... Graphic-wise Trine 2 has beautiful crafted environments with 3D animations and the gameplay is fairly easy... Child-friendly content...Cons:The game is fairly easy to complete. Trine 2 lacks a fair use of all the heroes as the wizard is far more useful than any of the other characters...			"

												Trine 2 is a vibrant, imaginative and entertaining puzzle-platformer. It is also one of the most visually stunning games I've ever played. Just have a quick look at the screenshots up there - this game is beautiful. The puzzles are entertaining without being too tedious or frustrating. The game rewards lateral thinking, and there are often multiple ways to complete the same area. The game has a very Fable-ike feel in terms of the music, the environments and the characterisations of the player characters (as well as the enemies). The controls are responsive and the character abilities are fun. I look forward to playing the co-op mode and exploring the DLC. 9/10 - worth every cent, especially at the discounted price.			"

												A seriously impressive game with all old-school side scrolling elements we used to love but also comes with a huge amount of added love, quality and detail shoved in ...all for under £1 through Humble Bundle.If you have access to 3D glasses (we use LG's Passive3D because it's better than the rest), this game truly out does it self and looks droolingly gorgeous ...reminds me of that feeling I got from watching Avatar at the iMAX (Waterloo, London) where you really feel your surrounds, the movement of all things organic and with so much depth, it really makes you wonder why this amazing feature isn't a standard in ALL games!So called 'AAA game' designers, developers and publishers should be ashamed of themselves, 'Trine 2' (The Complete Story) is above so many games I've played lately and far more challenging too.*3/3* - My only moan would the sound, as it only supports 2Ch (Two Channel Audio output) which personally drops the immersive feeling you should get from something like this, but it's certainly not terrible and could be updated if they 'wanted too'?

												This game is perfect to relieve those childhood imaginations of adventure. This game offered a bright colorful world with a fary tale story line that brings you back and makes you feel like a kid again. If the story doesn't interest you there is plenty of entertainment with the 3 player co-op. Me and my friends spent hours playing through these puzzles and having fun. Often taking longer than needed because we found ourselves killing each other just for sh*ts and giggles. This games offers loads of fun for friends and has good replayability when ever you're looking to play a fun puzzle game with friends as there are many different ways to go about solving some of the puzzles.

												Trine 2 is a beautiful game. Like, this game came out at around the same time as Skyrim, and just look at the difference (Billy Mays here). The visuals are amazing, and at almost any point in the game you could take a screenshot of wherever you're at and it would be fit to serve as a background. Unlike Trine, Trine 2 has quite a bit more puzzles, and is less reliant on combat than Trine. There's also a huge difficulty spike near the end of the game, that seemingly comes out of nowhere... also, the expansion ""Goblin Menace"" adds some really difficult levels on top of that. All in all it took me 14 hours to beat the game and the DLC. I don't like Trine 2 as much as the original Trine though, because Trine kind of had an interested plot idea of this vibrant high-fantasy world that had been abandoned due to some evil yet unknown until the end of the game, which was something I thought Frozenbyte did a great job with and I wish they would've kept that feeling in Trine 2, but they went in a ""save the damsel in distress (because she was being held captive by her sister)"". Anyways, Trine was 9.5/10, Trine 2 is 8/10. If you like puzzles moreso than combat in these types of things, you'll probably like Trine 2 more.			"

												Buy it when its on sale. This game seems to get high praises, but i think its only alright. I got the game for 2 dollars so it was definitely worth a buy for me. Pros-The art is great and the controls are slick too. -There are many ways to explore and get past a level ( not sure if this was intended, ex. creating a platform and jumping on it in mid air using the wizard) -4 hrs into the game, just when you think its about to get repetitive, the scenery and mechanics of the game varies giving a refreshing feel to the game. Cons-if you're playing coop and you're stuck being the wizard, there's no way to fend off the monsters other than defensively jumping away and/or trapping the monsters in boxes-gets slow after first few hours of gameplay-puzzles are not rewarding to solve			"

												I don't really have the words to describe just how great of an experience i had playing this game, playing it with two very good friends that i've known for years let me get the most out of what Trine 2 has to offer, i must reccomend that you talk to some good friends and see who has considered buy but not played this game yet, thats truly one of the best ways to experience trine 2 for all its worth, of which i am sure will give you an adventure you will remember for years.Also, it isnt specificly clear anywere but you can have two players locally and the third player can still join over the internet.

												Bought this game in 2012 during a sale and shelved it to play at another time. Just recently got around to playing it after forgetting about it entirely. So apparently in 2013 they merged the game with the DLC and anyone who owned the game already had the games name changed as well to ""Complete Story"" despite not having the Complete Story resulting in some confusion. Adding more to the confusion is that I purchased the Collector's Edition in 2012, however there's no obvious mention of what that actually gave me after they merged Trine 2 with the DLC. After digging around I found out that the Collector's Edition gave me both the OST's and the Artbooks. Sounds great right? Except that if I go and click the Add to Cart for the Artbooks and OST it doesn't tell me that I already had them.This entire thing is confusing as hell.But enough about that, lets talk about the game. The gameplay itself is fun and moreso when you have friends to play with you. I really enjoyed my time playing... HOWEVER... the base game itself is only about 5-7 hours (depending on how quick you go). I put in about 7 hours while partially goofing off before the game ended. 7 Hours of gameplay. This is like NES level of gametime in a game. Actually less, because those games actually had some replay value. This is a puzzle game, which means once you know how to beat the puzzle there's no point in redoing it.Overall pretty damn disappointing. The whole thing was confusing with what my purchase actually gave me from listing the game as being Complete Story in my library when it actually isnt to not making it obvious what Collector's Edition actually gave me. Feels almost like the devs are trying to trick me into forking over more money had I not actually done any digging around on the forums.Story was also pretty cliche.			"

Oyun esansında karakterler arasında geçiş yapabiliyoruz. 3 oyuncuya kadar da co-op a imkan sunan oyun, bazen düşündürücü bazen de gerçekten zorlayan bulmacalarıyla Steam market'te bulabileceğiniz en iyi platform oyunlarından biri.

												Trine is 2d platformer, mostly puzzles and platformers, with occasional action. And I don't think it does any of these things particularly well. Action/combat is bland and just seems like it is randomly tacked into the game to make the knight character relevant, who is otherwise not very useful. The platforming doesn't ask for very much skill and, as a result, isn't that meaningful. The puzzles are okay, but once you figure out how to use the wizard character's conjuring with a little creativity, all of the puzzles become pretty easy. However, the puzzles often didn't feel that rewarding to me in the first place.The story and charm is nothing memorable, but I suppose the game looks pretty.I played through on the default difficulty, but I wasn't hooked enough to try the harder difficulties or to explore for every collectable (though I found a reasonably high percentage of the collectables anyway). I did not play Trine 2 with multiplayer, but this is a reflection of the single player experience I had.I don't think Trine 2 is a bad game, but I'm surprised Trine 2 had such a high approval rating on Steam. I don't find it to be unique or good enough to recommend to a friend over other similar games.			"

												First thing you have to know, this game looks like it has been Inspired by the Lost Vikings series made by blizzard so this is one good reason to not skip it.A very good and challenging game, but not enough difficulty curves to select.(Normal mode) You either never die since you can return in your last checkpoint's spot to heal your dead partners-OR-(hardest) You die and you must restart the whole stage coz you can't get far without the archer and the mage. This mean the first time, you must advance to take all the bubble. Second time, you must focus on not getting killed and killing the boss that you don't know yet how to kill; not to mention that each stages are very long, but i still embrace this challenge, i just don't rush the game as a result. On that difficulty setting, i suggest to not even focus on picking up bubbles once you have enough to unlock (Ice Arrows) And (Ice shield). You won't get burned-out that way.Gameplay: great combat system, great physics that you can exploit very well with tools sush as the batman's hook and summoning magical boxes along with your surrounding and everything you must do to exploit them. The movement and everything couldnt have been better. Puzzle: It's a puzzle game as well and a pretty hard one. Not anyone, even at hard mode can figure what to do in the longrun.  Each puzzles are fun to do; it's not one of those puzzle games where you want to rush to the next thing just to get over it.AI: I only play hardest mode so my opinion is based on that difficulty only.The enemies are very hard, no delays between their attacks, they move pretty fast, they can climb on almost anything so they will follow you platforms after platforms and 1 of your hero gets killed in 3 hits. With this game, you will be scared of goblins for the first time and they're not even small; they're as tall as your heroes. 1 Goblin is hard enough to beat you down 1on1, but you will still get outnumbered and trust me, you will rage quit.Story:First stuff, good voice actors and the storyline while you shoudln't take it too seriously, it's still good enough for the ride.10/10: Good and accessible for everyone. You can even play it with 3 friends local or online.  "

												Really boring gameplay.  Other than graphical changes there isn't much variety between the different levels and it's too easy as well.  Most of the puzzles require no thinking, the platforming isn't challenging, and if you're just trying to beat the story without caring about collectibles there would basically be no game.  Even if you are trying to get collectibles, if you're in co-op ""draw boxes and have another player jump on them"" is the solution to getting 90% of them.  Finished the game as well as the DLC and it never becomes harder or more interesting.The one good thing is that the art is amazing, and it's enjoyable to play just to look at the neat backgrounds.

												While this game has charming narration and beautiful visuals, good gameplay is required for a good game.  And sadly, that is where this game is lacking.  Slippery platforming makes it difficult to stay on top of the ever-present bubbles required to get from one point to the next. Combat is dull, requiring button-mashing over skill/strategy.

It is intensely beautiful, intuitive and flawless to play, smart and puzzling all over and switching between the characters was suprisingly fun.Yet, I cannot recommend it cause after playing it couple times I wouldn't buy it again, not even for the ridiculously cheap price that I grabbed it from a sale. Don't get me wrong it is a great game on so many perspectives, and if this type of game is your thing; get it!! Seriously, get it. But me, personally, I cannot stay interested in it. It's just.. meh. There is no catch for me, I have no urge to go back to it and keep on playing, I have absolutely no need to progress in this strangely enticing game and I started to get quickly bored. So I would be happy giving it a neutral review cause I couldn't find a specific thing to be wrong in it, alas I cannot recommend a game I just don't think is interesting even for 10 hours. It is very conflicting. To give a good review cause it is a good game, or not cause I cannot personally recommend it? Maybe I would have found it interesting if I just kept playing? Who knows, but this is the reality right now. It is still sitting on my desktop after like 2 months, cause maybe, maybe some day I feel like giving it another go, but so far that day has not come.

												Trine 1 is the best and most thought game. Trine 2 is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad mechanic, ugly long and stupid puzzle computer graphics hog. Did not had any fun in it like in Trine 1.			"

												Sadly not as good as the first, considerably more obtuse puzzles, less tight mechanics. It's a shame, because the original Trine really was incredibly awesome.			"

												Well, the Tank class seems totally useless. I was just following my team, sometimes waiting for them to follow, or whatever. Mechanics seem abuseable like hell, 80% of solutions seem unintended by using some weird combos, and if one dude sneaks somehow threw to the next checkpoint, the other two can just kill themselves. I have not a single idea why this game is so popular.			"

												It's mind boggling how a great idea worked with great visuals and still ended up as one of the most boring side scrollers I've ever played. The first half of Trine 1 had some good levels, but Trine 2 is just senseless. Level design consists of copy-pasted obstacles that end up being tedious rather than rewarding to solve. There's very little cleverness to the puzzles.Play this as a cooperative game or not at all.			"

												Games like Trine are my least favorite kinds of games. They're not bad enough to drop, but not good enough to enjoy that well. It just sort of trudges along, inoffensive in its design, but never doing much to engage me as a player. The puzzles are a lot harder this time around, true, but I don't feel very smart figuring them out, it feels like a deliberate waste of my time. Maybe it would have been more interesting if there was a story I was invested in, but the plot isn't even revealed to you until halfway through the game, it just starts with ""Follow the Trine!""Both games just end up being plain. Not bad, but never that good. Merely not♥♥♥♥♥♥ and never better.Two out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( ) ( )			"

												I said I enjoyed the first game to a degree and when presented with the second, honestly I wasnt really up for it. Sure it looks great still and it probably promises so much but Puzzle Platform for me gets tedious and boring pretty quick. That is why I said no to this game, only because I am personally pretty bored of playing this story line. I never purchased 3 for obvious reasons.			"

												Trine 2 is an absolutely beautiful game. If you enjoy puzzle games and platformers, you'll probably love it.Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of platform games in general and I thought Trine 2 was just an endless source of frustration and repetition. The puzzles are fairly easy but as a platformer, the controls are a bit wonky and the movement is flawed.I have to recommend you pass on this one.			"

												More of the same. While the skill unlocks add new depth there's little new here. Controls feel sluggish and heavy as before, puzzles rarely challenge, and some skill unlocks are super overpowered... Which I was thankful for when I just wanted to run through and be done with it.... And that voiceover...I get that this is a kid-friendly game, but between eviscerating goblins he pipes up sounding like pre-school story-time.I'd gotta give credit to the art team though, the game is gorgeous. An awful lot of time went into the scenery, but they should divert some of that into making the game more fluid, balanced and... well... fun. [4.5]			"

												Lemme explain why I'm negatively rating this game:Pros- cool artwork;- cool chars;- funny dialogues;- some good puzzles;- good environment details;- co-opCons- many easy as f*** puzzles;- unbalanced chars (you can easily do the level without either Pontius or Amadeo but Zoya is too good);- unscrollable (with mouse wheel) level choice which can lead to (as it happened to me before I rage quit) mis-level-selection or worse;- UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES!!!- some minor bugsBut really, the unskippable cutscenes are too much to bare, specially if you choose to play in hardcore mode			"

												Some neat game potential here for thoes who like problem solving games. Sadly, this one loses it's appeal REALLY quickly. The ""solutions"" are either silly redundant, the same thing over and over...or they become impossible to get through. Seriously, I shouldn't have to look for walkthroughs to figure out what insanely random solution they've conjured up or know before I get there that it's going to be the same thing all over again. Bottom line...it's fun for a few hours. After that you'll be making up new swear words and the ""fun"" dwindles away in hours you'll never get back...			"

												I think I liked the first one (I don't remember well) but this one was quite boring and I was eager to finish it so I could move on. The graphics are very nice and the physics works well, but the story was boring as for the gameplay, I am really sorry for the developper since it shows effort but it lacks something that prevented me from enjoying it.
