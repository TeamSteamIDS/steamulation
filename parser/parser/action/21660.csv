												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whist I recommend the gameplay it's self, I do not recommend buying this title, as it's broken.I have made a ticket asking Steam to Put a warning up so people do not buy this version...like me...and waste good money that could be spent on a working Beat Em Up.The game it's self is marvelous! It's pure greatness, as you'd expect from SF!....But....1) The game doesn't work unless you rename a file in the game directory (The fix is at the end of my review)2 ) Once you've sorted that and launch the game...you can play fine....but.you are unable to save any progress, because Games for Windows Live is dead. So any characters you unlock are lost...I am so dissapointed by this purchase. I really was looking forward to spending a few nights unlocking content, but not like this... One can only hope Steam do something to fix this fiasco =(Personal rating: Great game, crappy services embedded into it ruining itPercent Rating: 95% if it worked properly, but as it stands 5%....---------------------------The fix to make the game launch below...1) Go to the game folder  C:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\Street Fighter IV 2) Find the file in that folder StreetFighterIV.exe.cfg   3) Change it's name toStreetFighterIV.exe.cfg.BAK4) Then try to launch as normal, it should work.5) If that doesn't work, install GFWL from the exe in that same folder and try again.6) Enjoy your game till you realise you can't save progress7) OPTIONAL STEP: Curse profusely at the fact you spent good money on a broken game...:			"

												If you're looking for a top quality 2D fighting game, you've found one with SFIV. An excellent addition to the most famous fighting game series. Welcome appearances of the major characters of old and some new ones aswell. Superb graphics and sound. Still, it is difficult to master even just one of the game's characters and you may be put off fighting the high level of online opposition.			"

												If you're a fan of the Street Fighter franchise it is mandatory for you to pick this one up. At this point it might be better to purchase Super Street Fighter IV as it offers a bigger rooster. Also, Ultra Street Fighter IV is scheduled to be released this year around the summertime.There are not many old-school fighter games on PC these days. You have the remade Mortal Kombat, too, so there isn't really anything else out there for us PC gamers. Just make sure you have a controller as with the keyboard it is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to play the game.Interestingly, the story takes place right after Street Fighter II ended. Chronologically, the game can be put between the 2nd and 3rd episode. Bison's Shadaloo organisation still exists and organises another tournament to gather the best fighters in the world - this time, however, instead of Bison you have Seth as the final boss. Seth combines the best moves of all the players out there - he has a lot of counter special attacks, very agile and overall a pain on harder difficulty settings.Gradually, you can learn to fight with each SF character and can continue to play online. You need a lot of time and effort to master these fighters. You can unlock many more as you progress through the game.Overall, this is a really good game. When I was young my parents bought me Street Fighter II for the Super NES so for me this game was instantly captivating.			"

												It was fun when it first came out. Recommend a gamepad controller. However, the game is no longer sold/supported, so recommending is not really useful. They put out a new edition that includes all the DLC. Would be nice if they offered a discount for those of us that own the old version. I'm not saying give us the game for free. But if they aren't going to make the DLC compatible with this older version, then Whiskey Tango Foxtrot you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I'd buy the DLC if I could, but no, the publishers decided, oh old version, let's break that and force users to pay for something they already have so they can buy more stuff they don't have.

												One of the best fighting games since a long time. The graphics are beautiful, just beau-ti-ful and the fighting is fluid. I HATE the pop song that plays in the main menu and I HATE Seth. That cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I've only been able to defeat him using Zangief so far. With my amazing, god-like skills mind you. One thing I hate as well is, in case of Zangief, that I never seem to be able to pull off his Ultra combo. He ALWAYS performs his Super. What's up with that ? Like I can't press the same button 3 times in a row really fast. No, I'm not physically challenged. Dear SFIV, I spit on you ! ... ... No, I didn't mean that ! Come back, please ! Fine, fine, I'll be playing Super Street Fighter IV then. Let's see how that works out...[Rating: 80/100]			"

												Street Figher IV is an upgraded version of the Classic Street Fighter.There is many powerful, characters in the game. You have to know what ""kind of character"" they are in ordered to beat any opponent in the game, including Seth/Akuma/Gouken. Many characters are flat like Abel, C.Viper and El Fuerte. Trying to master the concepts and moves of these 3 characters in specific, is probably one of the hardest things to do.Many other characters are easy to use and have poweful moves per hit. For example, Akuma and Gouken. These 2 characters are yet the most powerful chracter in the game besides Seth. Knowing when to use what move, and performing these moves easily, can gain you a HUGE advantage over your opponent.Finally, this game is only great to a certain extend. After unlocking Seth (which by that you have to beat arcade mode with all the characters once), the game gets boring. Beating arcade mode with all the characters including the ones you need to unlock.*SPOILER ALERT* Gouken is the hardest character to unlocked out of all of them (Fei Long, Cammy, Rose, Sakura, Dan, Gen). You have to beat arcade mode using Akuma once, then use any character you have previously beat arcade mode with, and must acheive 1 perfect round, which means you cannot take any damage from your opponent, 3 super/ultra combo finish (these add up), and 5 First-Attack rounds. Oh, most importantly, you cant use ANY continues (including Seth). After beating Seth (for the first time), Gouken will appear. He will use the cheapest moves against you, so be aware. I've unlocked Gouken on the first try after unlocking Akuma.Easiests way to unlock Gouken, is to use Akuma.*SPOILER ALERT* To unlock Akuma, you must unlock all the other characters besides Gouken (Fei Long, Cammy, Rose, Sakura, Gen, Dan). This is yet the second to the cheapest character in the entire game. His moves are powerful, easy to accomplish. His ultra and Special Combo is ONLY one button different (moving left and right). In the end, this game shows many great style of martial arts from many different countries, some even made up (M. Bison, Seth, Akuma). Great game to learn/understand the different kinds of martial arts from different countries.			"

												This is the title that jumped the franchise again. Although it's only the vanilla version and you'll be better off with the Arcade one or just waiting for the Ultra Street Fighter 4 that's coming out next year, it's still a gem of fighting games. Brings back old memories spamming Hadokens and Dragon Punches! I'm not going to say I'm a good player at this, but it is fun in the end. Get it if you don't want to pay so much for the Arcade version or the Ultra that's coming out next year. Ultimately, though, get it when it's on sale. It makes it worth it. $20 for a fighting game that's having so many other versions isn't that much of a deal.8/10 when it's on sale. (:5.5/10 if not. /: happy new year guys :D			"

People have moved on to Super Street Fighter 4 Champion Platinum's Turbo X2 Alpha Strike Collector's Limited Special Edition Gold.  Or whatever the ♥♥♥♥.  All that's left here is GFWL achievements to single player.  I managed to get like 10/48, the rest of them are challenge mode.  You have to be autistic or something to pull off the combos.

 It. Occured to me a METSU-HADUKEN was not informative enough. I completely forgot the review. Huh. Funny. Anyway, I enjoyed the game, except it's biggest flaw is that it's really not all that enjoyable without some controller. A.K.A. playing on a keyboard sucks. Plus they keep spitting out new versions, so that kinda goes against it too. I would just wait for the next one. ULTRA SUPER ULTRA ULTIMATE STREET FIGHTER ULTRA IV			"

												{Overt sarcasm} Just what the world needs...yet another overpriced Street Fighter game. Yay...Plus: The fight mechanics are a lot like the other SF games. Very familiar.        The graphics are great.Cons: This is the same game it was 20 years ago. Why does it still cost so much?          DLC from Street Fighter should be free. Yet, they charge for extras that should've been included from the start.It's a great game but buy it during a special sale. You be glad you waited for all the extras to come out. As usual, there will always be various ""Edtions"" of SF that you'll have to pay the FULL price for.			"

												Here's a classic case of buyer's remorse.  First of all, I can't play this ♥♥♥♥ because it lags like hell on my computer.  This was a common problem for this game for LOADS of people.  It's unplayable.Second problem: they released a sequel shortly after that had everything that Street Fighter IV had plus loads of other stuff.  ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic.I don't know why I bought this piece of ♥♥♥♥ anyway.  I don't even like fighting games.Pwninator score: 2/10			"

Played SF 3rd Strike like mad and some of the Alpha Titles. I actually love Beat 'em Ups... but damn, Sagat and especially Seth are way too strong. I had my Problems beating the ♥♥♥♥ outta Seth (the last boss) even at the lowest difficulty setting. I've lost like countless Times on my First try with each Char. Felt always like they were Cheating. Anyways, the Game isn't as unfair when you play Online. If you play against People with your Skilllevel that is. :DAwesome Game :3			"

												I, for some reason have this in my Steam and it's not that bad. I was expecting it to be utter rubbish because fighting games on PC just seem like too crazy of an idea to work but it does. ...Once you get the hang of it. Because button mashing was designed for either classic arcade controls or controllers. It's really hard to do that on a PC keyboard despite the mashings we've all pretty much done when we are trying to communicate via text or frustration or anger.  You really have to know the buttons that make the combos if you ever want to make progress. Anyway, I'll spare the mechanics of gameplay because even if you've never picked up a fighting title before, it's clear what to do and how to do it. This is a decent game. If you want to drop cash and play it on the PC for some reason, go right on ahead.			"

												This one brings back memories of sitting in the basement on my SNES schooling my friends with E Honda. Very well done and true to the originals. I would spring for the Xbox style joypad to make gameplay as smooth as possible OR the uber fight stick are really into fighting games.			"

												Street Fighter (insert pointless sequel suffix here) is the same game it has been since 1991. After rereleasing the same game for twenty years there isnt anything new added worth mentioning.This isn't neccessarily a bad game, but if you own any street fighter aside from the 1987 original, you may as well pass on this one as it's the exact same game with a new coat of paint and online matchmaking.

												I spent years and years at the arcade playing this game.  If you love the series or fighting games in general I can not gurantee this game enough.  Great single player stories for each fighter, and the best fighting multi player game to date.  A Must Have if you love the series.			"
