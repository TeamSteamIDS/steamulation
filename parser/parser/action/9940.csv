												After being taken down from Steam due to the previous publisher Atari's rights to the game expiring, Blade Kitten is back and self-published by Krome Studios themselves!As well as being available for a lower price, the latest update improves the responsiveness of the controls, adds two new costumes, and prepares the game for the long-overdue Episode 2 DLC. Oh, and there's trading cards now! 


Announcement: Blade Kitten is back! 
Blade Kitten, May 22, 2014

			Krome Studios is pleased to announce that Blade Kitten is back in our control! YAY! So we’ve updated the game and celebrating the re-release on Steam with a new price of just $5.99.		


As for the game itself, I'd say it's very easy to recommend at the current sale price of $3. It's not very long, ends abruptly and it's not the best platformer out there, but it's charming and fun to play. And hey, there's a demo if you want to try it out anyway, so don't just take my word for it. Give it a look.			"

												Warning: Game ends abruptly and development on second half was canceled. I read about the game on Reddit so I knew both of these facts full well when buying the game.  I really enjoyed this game. Has great humor. Has impressive levels! I was playing and I would be going a direct I thought was wrong on purpose to explore but it kept getting bigger and bigger so I Thought I was going the right way by mistake so I back tracked and went the other way which also kept expanding. I was super impressed there seemed to be many ways to get to the same place which left lots to be explored. Oh and the levels transitioned very well it was fluid and non stop.  Kit (the hero) is very agile she jumps and climbs well with the controls. Combat is mostly simple.  It was a few hours of fun!			"

												This game went from zero to HERO!  Blade kitten on PC used to be pretty bad when it first came to PC, with some kind of stuttery frame rate limiter which made me feel nauseous playing it.  The dev though NEVER GAVE UP!  Just like Blade kitten the dev not only stayed active on the forums, but kept updating the game for PC to resolve these issues.  The voice acting in the game is really awesome with lots of costumes to unlock and powerups to buy.  A simple platformer game, probably one of the few ever made where the controls WORK!  Crawling up walls, makes exploring the levels pretty fun, like any platformer its not the combat that makes the game its the controls, the feel, and the exploration.  From having a little pet to the animations in the game, all of them are awesome!  Replay value is high since the controls are simple, even if you forget them like I did there isnt any move that complex like other games, this game you can pick it up play it, quit anytime, then go back and BOOM right back at the checkpoint.Rating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99			"

												It is a good game, but not remarkable.This game is a linear action-platformer in a 2D plane with 3D graphics. Your character can walk, run, slide, jump, double-jump, wall-jump, climb walls and even hang and move on ceilings. This variety of movements opens up to a lot of exploration in the levels, and such exploration is rewarded with lots of in-game money and hidden collectibles. The in-game money can be used to buy upgrades and costumes.The levels are huge, with plenty of side-corridors or side-paths where you can find items. Since I wanted to explore every inch of each level, I often got tired before reaching the end. Slightly shorter levels (i.e. splitting each level into two) would be good.The combat has a fast short-range attack (which you will end up using almost all the time) and a long-range attack, as well as a couple of gimmicks (left-trigger + short attack, or right-trigger on top of an enemy) that are a harder to pull off, and slow down the action as the camera freezes in a bullet-time fashion. This kind of effect gets old very quickly and breaks the flow of action.The character has a stamina meter (for stuff such as running) and a health meter. The health regenerates when not taking damage.Due to the amount of buttons used (4 buttons and the 2 triggers used as digital input), it might be a bit cumbersome to play on keyboard. I can't say about it, because I used a controller.Although each level is huge, the game is a bit short, as this was meant to be the first episode in a multi-episode saga. And the storytelling in this game is not very good, I had the impression the levels did not follow any logical order, I haven't seen connection between most levels. (For comparison, ""Sonic 3"" storytelling is perfect!)Overall, this game is okay. Between ""Yes!"" and ""No!"" I give this game a ""Meh"".			"

												Blade Kitten is a charming game when you first start it up. The main character, Kit Ballard, is a spunky cat-girl who happens to be a bounty hunter with a new rival in town. The look of the game is cheery and bright, and the promise of a fun rivalry-based adventure sets the scene nicely. Although they say first impressions are generally the most important, this rule doesn't really apply to Blade Kitten. The game starts strong, but fizzles quickly due to some awkward mechanics, technical issues, and a paper-thin story.Kit Ballard, as a main character, is interesting enough, and certainly fills the cat-girl ""moe"" archetype satisfactorily. However, the story, which starts off strong, falls into the ""chase"" trope fairly quickly, and becomes no more than snippy remarks and chase scenes during cutscenes. Although the lead and her rival certainly have their personalities, they just aren't enough to keep you engaged in the story.However, since this is a relatively cheap game, a lax story might be forgivable. What isn't, however, is bad gameplay mechanics. The game's world is futuristic, and characters seem to hover around on a lessened gravity planet, which sounds cool in theory, but in practice proves to be quite frustrating. The game's levels feature platform-based gameplay, which means precision-based running and jumping is a must. However, the low-gravity properties of the game mean that there is a lot of skidding around, and you can't stop on a dime or take off at full speed. Though this isn't much of an issue in the beginning, you'll find the sliding mechanic increasingly annoying as the game progresses and you encounter ""trap"" levels that require precision button pressing and obstacle avoidance.Another aspect of the game's mechanics that gets agitating quickly is the swordplay. Blade Kitten’s weapon of choice is a big, floating sword that can attack enemies near and far with quick or ranged attacks. However, the problem with the sword is that it only works half of the time. For instance, sometimes I would target an enemy from a distance, and when my ranged attack was unleashed, the enemy would still be standing there. Even the quick attack was flawed, and hammering on the swift attack button when encountering several enemies at once never yielded the results that I hoped. The floating sword mechanic could have really been cool, but with the lack of precise targeting, the sliding controls, and the lack of consistency in battle make this weapon more of a chore to deal with rather than an exciting gameplay component.The game's mechanics really handicap this title and cause it to fall short of its potential. And the real tragedy of this is that the level design is actually quite good. Though the game takes a traditional approach to the side-scrolling aspect, there are multiple paths you can take through each level, and there are tons of bonus areas with treasure chests to explore. However, these areas are normally hidden behind puzzles and switches, which can be difficult to hit because of the wonky controls. On more than one occasion, I passed by treasure-filled bonus areas because I simply wanted to finish the level instead of trying to suffer sliding around trying to hit switches in a precise manner.Blade Kitten's level design is also a missed opportunity in the visual area. Though there are plenty of hidden areas and things to explore, none of it looks particularly interesting. Levels generally find a comfortable color scheme, insert a few new elements, and stretch these few elements into an overarching world. This type of visual scheme is not only boring to look at, but can also be disorienting, as backtracking to similar areas can get you seriously lost if you are trying to find a certain area that looks like another part of the stage.The only aspect of Blade Kitten that is consistently good is the animated cutscenes. Although most of these are brief with forgettable dialogue, the cutscenes are animated in a very high-quality cel-shaded style. All the animations are fluid, and the game really hits all the right notes for the anime style they wanted. The main characters feature some fun facial expressions and lightning-fast movement. However, even the cutscenes are hampered by poor voicework, which often comes across as wooden and completely unemotional.As far as replay value is concerned, Blade Kitten definitely doesn't have much going for it. Although the game has several unlockable items, including new weapons, costumes, and battle-enhancing consumables, the game's currency is dispersed a little too liberally, and it is very possible to unlock all of this content before you've even reached the halfway point. This might be a good thing if you are just trying to run through the game, but if you are looking for a game you can play and then explore, Blade Kitten doesn't have much for you.Blade Kitten certainly could have been a good game. It started out promising, and I was excited to experience an old-school platforming title with fun characters that played off the anime/manga tropes we've all seen over the years. However, what I got was a game with bad mechanics, repetitive level design, and little incentive to keep playing past the first few levels. Overall 6/10.			"

												It seems it's finally time. After 5 years Blade kitten has gotten it's episode 2 and conclusion. Was it worth the finish though? One way to find out, isn't there?Blade kitten is a Platformer developed by Krome studios and released by Atari in 2010. If you're familiar with either, you'd know that Krome Studio's made a previous platformer game on the Gamecube and other consoles called ""TY: The Tasmanian Tiger."" which is a game that personally I've had a lot of good experiences with when I was younger. Sure, the voice acting was cheesy and some game mechanics were irritating as sin. But it was a fun game. And if you know about Atari, you know they went bankrupt some time ago, but I'll get to that later.In Blade Kitten, you play as Kit Ballard. Essentially a catgirl with an interesting hair genetic, but realistically she is part of a rare(?) alien race called the Felion's. It looks like ""Felines"" but is pronounced differently, get it? Anyways, her job is to be a breaker; which is the game's essential equivalent of a Bounty hunter. Hunts targets, get paid. Usual stuff. First person she runs into is her soon to be rival but not main antagonist; Justice. Blonde woman working for an evil-ish military group known as the Sollers.Gameplay is simple stuff. The game runs entirely on a 2.5D plane. 3D models but the game always sticks to it's camera angle; and the game's entire system runs as a platformer. Kit's attacks focus on a hovering ""Breaker Blade"" which can be swung at melee range, or sent out at a distance. You can hold RMB to spear people's armor or shields, or just to yank them in. There's also special attacks, like a Q to mount and throw soldiers by the head.There are a few kinks to work out though, that's unusure if they'll ever get fixed up. First off, Episode 1 was originally designed for consoles. It shows when the ""how to play"" is just a bunch of symbols with no real display on what you're /supposed/ to press. The only one that does show this is the loading screens, and if you have even remotely decent of a computer it wont be around long enough to read. The Enemy AI can also be seen as unfair at times, countering hits from you are most of the basic enemies 90% of the time.With Atari closing down in a later year and stopping development of Blade kitten Ep2, there was a pretty long hiatus. But now we have it. Episode 2 has nicer animations, a more consistent 60 FPS and a rather shiny level design! Plus, all the original characters voice actors and new content to boot. It's fun stuff, and was a nice wrap-up for the series.Pro's------------+Decent Level design+Lovely world-building+Slipped in references of older games+Level keeps up with you, allowing the player to go pretty damn fast at times.+Slippery, almost wild yet usable controls.Con's-------------Some enemies are downright irritating-Climb command registration can be sometimes odd-Some map bugs-Enemy's can be expoited using Wild controls, making bosses rather easy.Verdict: Buy it if it interests you. There /is/ a demo, so try that first.Thanks for the efforts Krome Studios, I'm glad you didn't leave the game for dead.			"

												I think girls dressed up as cats are hot... There. I said it.(Bonus points for the additional gothic dress for our cat girl heroine. Me-ow!)Blade Kitten is a 2.5D, action-platforming game starring Kit Ballard, a cat girl (in an optional gothic dress) who controls a levitating AI sword and is followed around by some weird flying pet... thing, as she does battle against various factions out to get her while she tries to reclaim a data stick stolen from her and get payback for her destroyed ship. Or something. The whole story is a bit of a mess. There's very little real explanation for who anyone is or how they're all connected or ultimately what's going on. The story and apparent goal seems to shift dramatically from one level to the next with little real sense of focus for anything, just a vague over-arcing narrative that's sporadically dropped then brought up again at whim.I presumed there was more to this than meets the eye and, indeed, found the game to be based on a web comic of the same name. It looks like it's been going for quite a while, but despite an intensive Google search for what must have been at least a good minute and a half, if not two whole minutes, I still couldn't really find out much about the material it's based on. The lack of explanation (aside from a brief in-game glossary) would suggest it's aimed at established fans, but if it's as obscure as it appears to be then that's a huge misstep and is essentially shooting itself in the foot from the start. The story elements aren't offensively bad or anything, and I guess you'll get the basic gist, but I just wish it would've kept its attention on one thing rather than feeling like it was cramming in every feature of its universe to appease fans who the developers probably thought would be annoyed if their favourite parts weren't included. The mostly useless pet, Skiffy, being a pretty glaringly obvious example of something from the lore being shoehorned into some kind of role in the game.But despite the way it was presented, I did still really like the universe that we're shown (and the gorgeous art style in particular) and would be happy to learn more about it. I want to know more about this flying, AI sword, dammit! The lead is very well written and acted, and I never felt like the game was talking down to the player and treating us like idiots. In fact, the game, and Kit herself, come across as somewhat self-aware without ever breaking the fourth wall, and as a result feels far more inclusive and engaging. But as for the supporting cast? Mmm, not quite so much. They're more standard, video game fare.The actual gameplay is far more successful, though. You'll run, leap and hack your way through 13 stages, searching for secrets, unlocking costumes and buying new swords and upgrades. But the main appeal of the game comes from Kit's agility and dexterity, as she sticks to just about every surface to climb along walls and ceilings, opening up huge potential for exploration. That's something that might actually throw some players, in fact. Most platformers are about running a gauntlet as you overcome obstacles of one kind or another to reach the finish. But in this one you'll spend far more time roaming the occasionally labyrinthine stages, sometimes wondering whether the path you've taken is where you're supposed to be going, or if you're unwittingly making your way towards the dead end with the collectibles. But once you know your way around and how to best deal with enemies (jump over them, innit), most of the stages can be speed run in around about five minutes.When you are engaging in combat, you'll probably have a little less fun than when you're running around. There aren't a great deal of enemy types, and the majority of them will be dealt with in largely the same manner; either rush up to them with a flurry of light, but fast slashes, or send your floating sword off to deal heavy, ranged strikes. You can also jump on some enemies and toss them around, or do a jumping ground stomp attack for crowd control, but from moment to moment, you'll mostly just be cutting up the waves of fodder then running along. It's pretty trivial stuff for most of the game, thanks largely to your regenerating health as well. But, to be honest, I'd rather them be easy than have them kill the pace and become tedious roadblocks every time they're encountered. Also, the controls aren't quite tight enough for anything too challenging, either. Most of the time they're fine (I played it entirely with a game pad), but every so often it felt unresponsive and I'd suffer because of it. Was never too major, but enough to be a noticeable annoyance.So, it's not perfect. The story is muddled, the combat and enemies are kinda uninspired and some more moves or combos would've been nice, the levels can sometimes confound, and the controls could be improved. But even so, I did still really enjoy this one and felt the fun and easy-going positives far outweighed the negatives. Especially the price. It's kind of a steal how much game you're getting for so little. So if you like platforming, exploring and cat girls in gothic dresses, then this has your name writing all over it. Well... at least if your name is Blade Kitten. Though I'm guessing it probably isn't, is it?			"

												While I'm a fan of platforming hack'n'slash games, I can't recommend this one. Some of the puzzles are okay, the rest of the game is not. Even with a gamepad, platforming basics like double-jumping or long running jumps are hampered by the game thinking it knows better than you and auto-aiming jumps. Combat is clunky and it is easy to get stun-locked to death by enemies. But by that same token, there's no challenge, as you respawn with no penalty and checkpoints are incredibly common. The sword selection is passable, but the only other upgrades are HP and Stamina ups, and nothing really unique. You CAN dress your character in a selection of very stylized japanese costumes if you like, but once you realize you're playing in pajamas and bunny slippers, it loses its appeal. The worst part is the voice acting, however. The protagonist never misses a chance to spout squeaky cutsesy dialogue in a voice that grates on the ears. I stopped hunting down treasure chests because I couldn't stand to hear another ""Win Get!"" or ""Awwwwwlright!"" It even does it when auto-aiming your jumps for you. I could not finish this game, and recommend other, better titles in the genre like ""Dust"" instead.			"

												Strongly recommended as worth the price, especially when it's on sale.  Don't expect this to be equivalent of a $50 game and you'll quite enjoy it.  The video gives an excellent example of what gameplay will be like, including cutscenes.  It does end suddenly and there is/was some difficulty in making the sequel, however the developer IS working on it after all so there's hope!The main character is snarky and sarcastic and a catgirl.  If you didn't really get that from the trailer or the name of the game itself, then you don't get much sympathy from me.The levels are HUGE, the animations are smooth, the plot is mildly interesting and a little bit of a page-turner (which is why it sucks that it suddenly cuts off and we've been without the next part of the story for so long.)If you like side-scrolling platformers and can stand (or even like) the protagonist, this game is worth picking up.

												Well, well, well. Am I Surprised? Hell Yes!I choose to play Blade Kitten based on name of the title. Yes, that was the reason I installed it and dive right into the game - name Blade Kitten and you will get what it say kitten with badass blade (set of blades).And my thoughts on this game?This pink hair kitten won my heart, I am pleasantly surprised, I didn't expect amount of fun I will have in six hours of gameplay (only ep.1).So what is here to like?Main character for sure. Kit Ballard is funny, smart, cute and badass kitten with really sad past; and when I play fun-to-play character with actual character, game is always better for me.Hollow Wish is world we play in and is lovely to look at, but dangerous to explore because of various enemies that makes your life harder. Some of them are really easy to get rid off, but you will find some tough and annoying mothereffers here as well.Eliminating single targets, or smashing thru hordes of enemies is fun and enjoyable; but sometimes it is really far from it, because when you find yourself in siege of enemies from left and right and they are upon you, closer then you wish, and it is really difficult to get out of their deadly grasp. And besides few glitches events, this is probably my only complain for this game.As story goes. Yeah, there could be improvements, story could have been more rich, deeper, and all other things you could describe great story. But storytelling was good, story was easy to follow and good enough for me to care what is going to happen next, where is this leading me, and i really want to know how all things from part one transcend to second part, so i most definitely pick up episode two when i can.I had a lot of fun and this matters most for me.Grade: A- "

IntroductionBlade Kitten is a colorful platformer with a cute female lead character. It’s a game that’s easy to pick up, with short or long play sessions. I saw some people call it a good “girlfriend game” and as a female, I guess this isn’t too far off. The game isn’t very difficult so someone who is either new to video games or not the best with platformers, like myself, will probably enjoy themselves. However, on the downside, the game play is also a bit shallow and might disappoint more avid fans of the genre.StoryThe story follows a bounty hunter named Kit Ballard, a pink-haired catgirl with a lot of sass and witty lines to share. Her bounty identification has been stolen and she’s on a mission to catch her rival who has it while getting into misadventures along the way. I didn’t find this part of the game too memorable. It is nice that there are Blade Kitten comics to expand upon the universe and main characters. In game you’re given cutscenes that tell what’s happening but most of the time you’re jumping around in-world.GameplayI personally enjoyed the gameplay mechanics here. They’re not perfect and many games do it better, but it’s simple and easy to pick up and play. You can use your keyboard and mouse or a controller, which I used and recommend. You control Kit and have her jump around and defeat enemies with hack and slash type action via her giant floating sword. While the level designs aren’t bad, they can be repetitive. The enemies are usually all the same and your attack moves don’t upgrade or change, neither do theirs. With a bit of button mashing you can kill most easily. What the game excels in is being able to explore the levels, there are collectable items like treasure chests and CDs hidden throughout the levels and you have to jump around, climb walls and break floors to find a lot of them. Other than finding more in game money, most of these are useless though.You use said in game money to upgrade Kit, like her health bar and such. You can also upgrade her sword to have better stats and spend said money for costumes, which do nothing. I do like the costumes and enjoyed them, however, some of them actually make Kit look like other characters in the game. But her gameplay, voice and everything else doesn’t change so it’s purely cosmetic.Graphics/AudioThe graphics are colorful and bright, and the main character’s pink hair really pops. While things usually look smooth and polished it’s not much to write home about, it looks about what you’d get on a PlayStation 2. On the bright side, this also means most computers can handle running this game. The game has full voice acting, which isn’t half bad. Kit sounds very much like a valley girl, which was a little annoying at times but overall not a huge issue. The generic villains you fight all sound the same, however. The music is ok but I personally wouldn’t pay an extra ten dollars to have the soundtrack, I found it worked in the game but also very forgettable. Pros+ Easy to pick up and play for any length of time.+ Easy for people not familiar with video games to understand and enjoy.+ Good graphics and audio.+ Very cheap.+ Steam achievements and trading cards.+ Decent replay value if you want to collect all of the achievements.Cons- While I liked the graphics, they may seem a little dated.- Story is bland and unimportant.- Enemies and levels can get repetitive. - More hardcore platformer fans may find this title too simple.Final ThoughtsThis game is a simple platformer, not many bells and whistles. While I enjoyed it aesthetically and got a kick out of being a catgirl who can climb walls and ceilings it also isn’t breaking any molds. The price is great and for only three dollars you will have fun. Despite being released in 2010, I wrote this review because I still like the game and still play it to kill time. I think it’s a good addition to any gamer’s libraryRating: 7/10This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.			"

												Kit Ballard is a pink haired cat girl bounty hunter from space. What's not to love?I love the music, graphics, characters, story and even the platforming!Everything about the game I JUST LOVE!It even has it's own COMIC BOOK!!!That's why game is one of my guilty pleasures...99% of the time I consider everything other than the game-play to be icing on the cake.Sadly that's the reason why the game has such a low score.The combat isn't top notch.Fighting in the game feels very ""floaty"".While there are several ways to skin a cat...you're just going to be mashing buttons...BUT I can say that everything else is fantastic!Pro's -Lovable characters! - What an awesome cast and professionally voice acted!Cel-Shaded Graphics! You are playing a comic book heroine!!!Bumpin Tunes! - A very versatile and interesting soundtrack!Platforming! - Kit Ballard is strong enough to climb walls AND across ceilings!Secrets! - Each level is large and filled with places to explore!Costumes! - So much to unlock! Dozens of costumes in Kit's wardrobe!Blades! - Mind controlled flying swords... Nuff' said. Con's - Weak combat - it's more than easy to plow through enemies but there are a few ways to mix it up.The advantages and the low price make this a must own!Support the fine people at Krome Studios and say hi to Space Captain Steve on deviantart.com!

												Cool and terribly cute platformer. If you want to play something not so serious and hard this is surely on of things you should consider. Gameplay is as simple as it's also relaxing - the game is divided to over 10 different maps each of them having many secret stashes to explore and while the fighting isn't the most complex or entertaining the game still remains its addictiveness providing better weapons and costumes for credits which are collected during maps like in any other popular platformer titles.I also highly respect that develeopers decided not to quit with the series but provided us a second and long time missing part of the series. Blade Kitten is a nice perky game which might not be the hottest title on the market but still the very best enjoyment you can get for the price. I do recommend to any gamers from the age of six.

												Blade Kitten is a platformer based on a web comic about the adventures of Kit Ballard, a bounty hunter. You will run, jump and attack through the 14 levels in this game in your quest to hunt down your current target. StoryWhile this game is based on a series of web comics, knowledge of them isn't required, as the game is set three years before the events in the comics. Good for me, since I've never read the series myself.The game has several in game cut scenes within most of the levels to bring the story to you, but it isn't anything that interesting. Come to a planet to receive information on your current target, get attacked by a rival bounty hunter, and start chasing after her. Other events happen later after you have caught her, including missions to help random people which just happen to be connected to your target. Rather poor in my opinion, and not likely to get me to read the comic at this point. PresentationWhile not to the level of a professional development company, the graphics of this game are beautiful. The levels have plenty of detail in the background and the characters themselves all look great. The style is well suited for the characters, looking like what you would hope for from 3D versions of comic characters. Certainly a high point of the game. The music itself is less impressive. At best, it is forgettable. Fortunately, it never got so bad that I wanted to mute it. Regular sound effects are better. You have attacks, grunts, breaking items, jumping and even some calls from wildlife.  Certainly some hard work was put into these. Lastly, we have the voice acting. More good work here. The voice actors actually used emotion while doing their lines, and the voices were well suited for their characters. ControlsThis game is most certainly made for a gamepad. Don't even think about trying it with a keyboard. Assuming you own a gamepad, the controls works fine. You have movement on the left analog, some camera control with the right, a jump key, both melee and ranged weapon attacks, defend, dash and interact. Everything you need for this adventure. GameplayNow, this will have a fair bit to chat about. As a 2D platformer collect-a-thon, this really is an enjoyable game, with plenty of secrets to hunt down, earning you the dosh to unlock extra content like weapons, costumes and health / stamina boosters. Getting into the combat, it's not quite so great, but it does the job. The levels are mostly linear, with a range of hazards to traverse and plenty of coins lying around for you to grab. But if you are willing to go out of your way by climbing on every surface like this catgirl is capable of, you will find a number of chests, discs and animals around the levels to be added to your inventory. This game tugs at the strings that had us old timers spending hours in titles like Mario or Sonic, and doesn't disappoint here. Now for the fighting. The basics of this are simple button mashing. Most enemies will present little challenge. However, there will be a few tricky opponents that will require you to use other techniques like blocking or ripping their equipment from them. Those are used so little though, you might just forget you have those skills at the times you do need them. LifespanAs you can guess from a collect-a-thon type game, there is plenty to do after you have beaten the story. Trying to find every item to unlock 100% will take a good while, and completing this task will unlock the remaining costumes that money alone can't purchase. As well as that, there are several achievements to work on, like completing a level without a scratch, taking out 5000 enemies or  having the best time for the levels total 90 minutes or less. Getting all of those should help boost the playtime if you are a completionist. ClosingWhile I felt the story and music were near failures, the rest of the game pulls this up to being a title I would recommend to a platformer fan. Unfortunately, sales for the title seem to be uncommon, so you might be looking at full price if you wish to pick it up on Steam.---Update timeThe devs recently got this series back from Atari, so after some new work, this game has returned to the Steam store. Now featuring some new costumes, cleaned up controls, more challenging AI opponents and even the bonus feature that is Steam trading cards. Even better, Episode 2 is on the way, and the game is now much cheaper. I will heavily recommend people give this a purchase.			"

												Well is this game real hidden gem or what! I put off buying it for a long time despite very low price because of a few negative reviews on game mechanics. Turns out those reviews dont know what they are talking about. Yes this game has a few kinks that you should know about combat. There for instance is a kickback during which time you are stunned. This kickback+stun can be stacked on you by multiple enemies resulting in unexpected beatdowns and deaths. We are not talking about La-Mulana type of kickback here that defines the whole combat system but it's significant enough that it should be taken into account. Melee enemies dont let you go once they connect with their blows resulting in half your health going away. You regenerate fast but sometimes its not enough. And what about your weapons and moves? Standard sword slash works well on 1-2 enemies but a group of enemies all at once? your DPS is not fast enough and you dont hit them all so the enemy will retaliate so adjust your tactics accordinly. You CAN take them out most of the time. but not always. Enemies deliver their blows once they have progressed on their move and some of them are non-interruptible even if they die. The long range sword throw does not connect every time as it works bad in close range. In addition it consumes stamina which is important when you jump around trying to do your moves so it's better to be used when skirmishing or as an opener. Use your head - your character can easily in normal situations just spam on the normal attack and win. But sometimes even the basic grunt can kick you down from a ledge if they have the height advantage or form a tag-team with another one to beat you up if you fool around too much. Use that shield of yours.  Jump on top of enemies and throw them. Their bodies trigger doors, switches and even crumbling walls. And what about platforming and levels? Well it sure is overdone. Just the start screens of levels, you can basically just spend 5-15minutes clearing the opening screen. See a ledge? there is a secret there - there always is. Every. single. time. at least money if not a chest or a teleporter to some other area.  Arrows tells you to move forward? nope. go back, there is still a ton of secrets or there is a alternative way forward with loot on the way.  I dont recall any other game overdoing secrets the way this game does. A typical level has the arrows pointing where to go but you must do the traditional 'uh-oh, game wants me to go here - i need to go back' -routine as much as possible and instead look for walls and ledges where to jump. or just hang from walls and make your way to seemingly impossible places - where there is a huge section of the level and here you will spend the next 5minutes. In another game called Limbo you got an achievement for 'going left'. this game takes 'go everywhere, there are so many secrets it will take time'  to a whole new level. On average levels last for a very long time so there is plenty to do. To sum up the good this game has weapons, upgrades, costumes, nice artwork. good responsive platforming controls and easily learnable combat with small details that you can learn if you like but it's not mandatory. To get ahead in the game you dont need to learn all the details but it sure helps a lot. I am very entertained this far. Unique game for me. Good looks and interesting stuff to do. 9/10.			"

												A fun hack-n-slash platformer, most definitely. It has creative and fun gameplay, and a good and extensive backstory. Plus, now that it is once again under Krome Studios' control, it is no longer a dead title, and is once again actively maintained, with a sequel that is now actually on the way.Sometimes, the characters can be pretty annoying. The story within the game is also rather jumbled. On my first playthrough, I could hardly follow the story.Still, I do recommend the game, on account of it's fun gameplay, plethora of secrets and goals, and wide and interesting backstory.			"

												I first knew about this game when I saw an friend playing it for one of his LP videos few years ago (2012 or '13). What got my attention was that the character was a feline/human mix (instead of fully human like most action games), the world it took place on, and the overall combat.I gotten the game few years after watching his videos and enjoyed it myself. However I was having a few tehnical issues but that's due to hardware limitations on my end (shadows hurt my FPS greatly, and have to keep turning them off whenever I start the game).Sometimes the controls would get a bit sticky or respond oddly, and sometimes the collision detection bugs out or has Kit perform a different animation. The combat was overall okay, was difficult to trigger some of the criticals on some blades along with the head-swing attack but takes practice and precise timing and aiming.The story is... there but doesn't always transition smoothly as you progress through the game. Not a bad story, but has a few plot holes that may go unnoticed in the first playthrough. The Episode 2 DLC wraps up the story very well, though.Apparently, Blade Kitten was a comic before this game was made. Some parts are mentioned in this game regarding Kit's past but give little detail. I'm not sure what they're like though. I've read some of it after playing the game... seems to be alright.I'd get this and the ep. 2 DLC in a bundle than separately, save you some money.Also, some of the outfits are so darn cute! ^_^-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												This is a very awesome, cute, and super fun to play anime platformer game, which is also based on the Blade Kitten webcomic series. It's about the adventures of the female half human, half cat bounty hunter named Kit Ballard and her sidekick Skiffy as they uncover the dark mysteries of the shell planetoid known as Hollow Wish. It has plenty of content and gameplay replaybility, plus there are lots of outfits for Kit Ballard to try on. Blade Kitten is also one of the most enjoyed platformer games I've ever played. 10\10 Super fun, cute, and highly enjoyble anime platformer game. ^_^			"

												The pros outweigh the cons by far here. The game's fallen on hard times but it's finally getting back up on its feet. It was originally supposed to be an episodic game, which explains why it's so short but problems arose with the crew and budget and the rest of the game was put on hiatus for a few years with only a skeleton crew to slowly move things along. Well, the wait is finally over and soon we'll be getting the next episode in just under a month.Based on the dev's very own webcomic series, Blade Kitten stars a quirky young intergalactic bounty hunter catgirl named Kit Ballard. The game itself is pretty great if not short and sweet, with classic platforming elements akin to games like Crash Bandicoot. You can also get alternate costumes for your kitty throughout the game without any need for DLC. The game is set in a pretty, alien landscape and the cel-shaded 2.5D artstyle itself is pretty charming and somewhat anime inspired and it all blends together very beautifully.If you love platforming/hack 'n' slash games with cute girls, then I definitely recommend this game. I mean, it has a catgirl. What more can you ask for?			"

												I'm a little torn about Blade Kitten.  It has the feel of a triple-A Dreamcast title, the production values accordingly, but the controls and it's ability to keep my attention are...  off...  It would be so much better if the collision detection was loosened up, because it feels more jarring like a 2D Sanic Hegehog game in that you can perform all these incredible moves but get stopped up every few seconds and it takes longer than I appreciate to recover.  Not Megaman recovery, it's Sonic with 99 rings trips over a tiny crab and you're stuck for half a minute trying to recover-recovery.  This isn't to say the game isn't worth it.  I have had a lot of fun with it and the graphics are amazing for this genre.  There is a beta branch that seems to be addressing a lot of things, and a rabid fanbase that is kind and entertaining.  Buy this game, it will give your library a giant boost of awesomeness.			"

												It's like Metroid but with anime characters.You can expect a solid level design, a lot of hidden areas and secrets to explore, theres always another way to go on the map, constantly.Decent combat with lots of moves, I just wish the animations were more smooth and had more ""punch"", that can be acomplished with more intense impact sounds and a little screen shake. Traditional anime art (mostly western) with charismatic npcs, and a pretty lovable protagonist, who doesn't like a pretty humorous girl dressed as a cat?Voice acting is nice too, from a male standpoint, their voices trigger something, they are pretty charming. :)Definitely a unique game, theres so much garbage around, this game is actually something creative and worth of your time.

												The game surprise me. The story has no wonders but its really good with a few changes. The main character is charmant. Sure there could be more story parts, more about the history, more mysterious dungeon parts with special creatures, but its fine. The graphics are good (level design is good espacally the secrets, but i wished more treature with unique prices then only money, that you can sell for really good prices or new items or upgrades, helpful or interesting things from the history of the game, the living beeings has all special design and all looks like a living world), sound is fine, the game length is good for 2.99 or 7.98 for Episode 1/2 even if Episode 1 has more levels, sure Episode 2 (isnt 6 years old). So the main game is really good, Episode 2 a bit short maybe you buy it with discount, but if you love jumping, running, fighting its good (even most enemies need no tactic and there could be a few more, buts a INDIE LOW BUDGET GAME, so what you want more? A few secrets are really well hidden and challenging. The achievements are not to hard, but i wished there would be more step by step achievement like killing 1000 , 2500 enemies or for defeat 100 of that type of enemy or get 100 red crystals, 10 fishes or for beating every level in a special time under 5-710 min. Trading Cards and Steam Cloud are great support (the support at facebook is friendly & helpful too). I personally give this game 87% and for Episode 1 for 2,99 a 95 %. if you dont like this Adventure Genre, Animes or only AAA+ games, dont buy it. Thx for reading and hopefully enjoy.			"

												I've a mixed feeling about this game. Graphically it's very well done, flashy and all. It's like a sonic 4 game in the graphical aspect. Personnally I don't like the personnality of the heroin (too snotty and showing off for me) but that doesn't really bother me. The main problem I have with this game is the catastrophic maniability. Sure it feels like a unity game, but the collision bugs are as ridiculous as they are in large number. It feels like the developers tried to do their best until the release date and that's it. No more fix after that date. And too bad for you if the cat girl seems to be stuck in the middle of the air for 5 seconds because she almost missed to reach a wall. And the idea about stunning the player for a few seconds when he's hit by an enemy but without giving him temporary invincibility like we usually expect, that's so evil, punishing and frustrating that I could call it genius. Quite simple, if there are a few enemies and one of them hits you once, you'll lose all you life while being gangbanged and unable to move the whole time. So much for a flying blade completely useless when you really need it. Eventually you'll use only one technique to kill a whole group at once, which makes the fights very repetitive. About the music, nothing memorable but still okay.Really, if the gameplay wasn't so horrible, Blade Kitten would have been a nice little game. That's why I won't recommand it. Play Sonic 4 instead, which has at least a decent gameplay.			"

												This game harkens back to the era of platforming collect'em ups.  As someone that grew up with the likes of Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and Ty, it took me back to my PS2 days in terms of gameplay.  It's a fun hack n' slash that takes you to Hollow Wish as a bounty hunter Felion (cat person-y...thing)  Since its re-release, the controls have gotten tighter and the AI responds better.  One on one, most enemies will pose no major threat.  In fact, many are susceptible to one certain type of attack or another. But when you are swarmed with Darques, trying to get that last fragging item you need and you keep dying to sludge projectiles and you break two keyboards in a blind rage because THEY ARE EVERYWHERE...you'll understand the difficulty isn't in just completion.  It's in the 100% completion.The story itself may be lost on those that haven't read the comic by the same name, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying it any less.  (If anything, I went to the Blade Kitten site and read what Space Captain Steve had up there.)  For fans of the comic, there are plenty of costumes to giggle over, and enough cameos to make a fun episode.  Sadly, there was no Alamo or Gatty in this one, but you can unlock Justice, Lucy, Sun Dae costumes.  Through the game, you avoid deathly lasers, noinks in red suits, and the occasional visit from Cthu--FALDERDAN, RUN!  The goal is to wander through this planet, beat up the crook, and make a nice profit while you are at it.  But our protaganist, Kit Ballard, finds that she's taking jobs and not asking enough questions.  The world is bright and colourful, with a lot of fast paced action and some precise jumping.  It's cartoony, which I like and is rare to find in a market over-saturated with hyper-realistic FPSers, Racers, and Sports titles.  The background/foreground interplay give the platformer a sense of added depth and deception, as many of the goodies are stashed in places you'd overlook or not even notice.The sound quality is pretty crisp and clear.  The music is upbeat, which I like, and lends to the overall cartoony world.  Every so often, you'll hear someone screaming, ""Situation: Oscar Mama Golf"" and get a cheap giggle.  They also have some sound queues, hinting at certain items being in the area.  The voice acting was okay, but a lot of the voices were re-used, making the few NPCs you get to talk to sound flat and dull.The game is by no means the best of its genre.  At times, you can glitch through certain walls and fall into puddles of toxic waste causing insta-death.  Other times, you may get annoyed at the sudden white distortion splashed against your screen.  And some of the cutscenes (in my experience, the final cutscene) begin playing the audio before you even complete the fight, so you had two sets of audio playing when the scene actually starts.  I had a few crashes after hours of gameplay.  And in one cutscene, Kit glitched out looking something akin to the Ben Drowned statue.  But you aren't spending $60 dollars on this title.  For the price, I would definitely recommend this game.With the return of control of this title back to Krome Studios, there are plans to release the second episode of this bright story.  Do not be fooled.  The game is -not- dead.  It was just sleeping for a long time in AtariLand.TLDR:  The game is fun, hack'n'slash goodness.  A little glitchy in unimportant places.  For $6 bucks, it's worth it.  Even moreso if you can snag it for $3.  7.5/10			"

												Blade Kitten is a very interesting game. Side-scrolling platformer with blade fighting. Nice graphics that don't try to be too realistic keeping it's own colorful, animeish charm, a few characters, lots of different items to collect, 5-8 hours to play (takes a lot more if you are trying to find and buy everything) and the best; a bounty hunter Kit Ballard, the nekomimi and main character of the game. After the game got back to Steam, many things changed from the first release. Controlling Kit is better and the game got a little bit harder. Especially at the beginning you notice that if you aren't prepared, you find yourself dying many times in a row. But, after you get to know the controls, know what attacks work best for different enemies and buy yourself new blades and extend your HP and stamina, you will beat the game pretty easily. The soundtrack and levels were nice and I loved the hints of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger.The shortness of the game made me pretty sad and the ending just wasn't right (Episode 2 is seriously needed). Also the story... Okay, it was something that you couldn't understand that well if you hadn't read the comic (wink wink, you can read a little bit of it in BK's official site). Sometimes there weren't actual story going on, you just killed enemies and tried to proceed (and find stuff maybe). But that didn't really matter. I just kept playing.Otherwise I enjoyed the game. I loved how Kit could climb almost everywhere and the humour of the game was something that got me. Even after beating the game I'm still playing it trying to find and buy all the stuff. While the game may not be the best platformer and especially not the best game of Krome Studios (I've been always a huge fan of Krome's games). It still has it's own charm and fun. If you are a too serious gamer with picky and hardcore taste, this isn't for you. Nekomimi girls can be pretty cruel 'ya know, but if you really don't like cute-looking catgirls, stay away if you aren't into the platforming part of the game. My score for the game would be 7/10.

												I really want to like the game. I dig the quasi-JRPG style and a lot of the game design is actually rock solid. It has good platforming elements, good exploration, secrets to find, weapon upgrades, costume unlocks. The combat seems a little sketchy at first, but it makes more sense once you realize that the game expects you to take a more leap-and-dodge, hit-and-run approach to combat (especially don't forget about that slide kick!) instead of  running in with blade swinging like a berserker.Unfortunately, I don't feel like I can recommend the game because the controls are just way too sketchy. Controlling the character does not feel as responsive as it should, which really detracts from the fun of playing an ultra-agile type character. There are also a lot of buggy behaviors with walls and floor when you move the character eratically. For example, Kit is supposed to automatically cling to walls and climb them as easily as walking, which she normally does. But sometimes you'll attach to a wall and kit will automatically start climbing down and will keep climbing down even though you're not pressing the controls, and will keep climbing down even when you press up to get her to go the other way. I also experienced a situation several times where, if you throw up her shield/hold move where she stabs her blade into the ground, but you do it around an edge coming out of a fall, she will sometimes fall halfway through the floor, so only her head is sticking up out of the ground. Also, within the first ten minutes of playing, I somehow managed to get kit stuck in the shield/hold position where she would default back to shield/hold every time I stopped walking, and I had to leap around like a crazy monkey for a minute to get her to stop doing it. These are but a few of the ""buggy but passable"" behaviors you may experience.The aesthetic is great, the attitude is great, the game design principles are rock solid. Really the only thing that truly hurts this game is that the character controls do not feel very tight. They are aaalllmost there. It's so close that some people will consider the other positives enough to overlook the loose and shaky controls, and if that's you then buy it up. But I think for a game that is supposed to be an action platformer with hit-and-run combat and ninja-agile character, the controls should be super tight, and they very simply are not.			"

												As the game went on, I found myself increasingly disinterested in it. In fact, a few of the hours I've logged in this game have been spent on the pause menu as I got so bored I started doing other things instead.The music is pretty good, and level design isn't half bad. At times it feels like a (good) Crash Bandicoot game, even to the point I'd call it fun! However, that's about all this game does well.The game has a currency/upgrade system, which is fine until you realize there's only one weapon worth getting. Most of your money goes into stamina upgrades, as the alternate costumes are bland and uninteresting. Health upgrades should normally be as effective as stamina boosts, but the only times your health hits zero are instant-death situations.Most of the combat in this game revolves around hitting the attack button until something happens. If you don't have the (very inexpensive, you can get it during the first level) final sword, almost every attack will bounce off and you have to use 'special' attacks which consist of swinging your sword out a bit further and sliding. There's also a ground-pound attack that takes far too much stamina to use.Platforming in this game relies mostly on physics. That's not a good thing. You often find yourself stuck on a wall, pushed through the level, or outright unable to run and jump. The game has an aspect of velocity to it that doesn't make much sense in an action platformer. The entire game feels like a poorly programmed ice level with a stamina bar.Nitpicking time? Nitpicking time. There's a section at the end of the game where you're forced to climb long sections of walls while flying bugs attack you. Being attacked while climbing makes you fall. There are enemies with shields that can deal minor damage while stunlocking you, and if there are two surrounding you then you'd better hope you didn't buy any health upgrades. It's best just to run past them as you need to use a special grab attack to take away their shield. Special attacks take stamina, also known as the make-the-game-go-by-faster meter.The final boss is well designed. Brings together a culmination of the game's essentials: climbing, running, jumping, and attacking. However it's heavily dampened by the horribly annoying four or so lines of dialogue being constantly spewed and the fact that all of the things I just mentioned are broken. I ended up exiting the game and watching the ending on youtube for a sense of finality. The plot's not even that great, considering you have to read the (not so good by any means) comic series that the game neglects to tell you about.Overall it's a good port in terms of additional content and playability, but you can't just paint a brick wall red and call it art.

												Blade Kitten is a pretty tough recommendation at full price, and a cautious recommendation at a sale price. If you're not invested in the Blade Kitten webcomic, then the story is going to make almost no sense to you whatsoever, as it assumes almost full knowledge of who its characters are and what exactly is going on on the part of the player. That said, at least most of the dialog is snappy and Kit is definitely a fun character to see interacting with everyone. The game itself is sort of a Strider-lite, padded out with ""COLLECT EVERY SINGLE THING EVER"" elements. Attention was paid to making sure Kit was as agile and zippy as the game's title might imply, and stages are huge enough for you to explore around in for quite some time.  Combat however, is largely unsatisfying and the simple weapon upgrades are hardly distinguishable from one another other than attack power and their various special attacks, which all do the same thing anyway (one-hit kill normal enemies). The real bummer is Blade Kitten has a ton of technical issues including terrible framerates, dodgy input detection, and Kit getting stuck inside geometry, forcing checkpoint and stage restarts. The technical issues are common enough to become a hindrance, and there's not really anything you can do on your end to fix them. It's just a game that didn't get to spend enough time in the oven.

												A fantastic platformer with huge levels, quick gameplay, and secrets galore. Combat's got some tricks to it, and as of this updated review (5/21/14) it's back in the developers' control and the second half of the game is coming. Some people dislike the voice acting, but it can be silenced.It's an excellent action-platformer with plenty to do. Seriously. I sincerely love this title. The new patch tightening controls up so that you're now able to do more with Kit is even better.			"

												It's better than you think. One of the best platform games i have played, with cute characters, funny cutscenes that makes you smile. The platforming is good and the combat system is also satisfying. You can explore a lot to collect more currency to buy new costumes, weapons and more. Definitely worth the money

												so this is my first game review, so dont blame me if i make mistakes.  First, if you like jak and daxter series you will love this, playstyle and characters in story are similar.  Now while this is a 2d platformer and not a 3d one, it feels like i am in the jak and daxter universe(1-3, not the psp or racing stuff with their horrid controls and dumbed down graphics). Game feels fresh and i dont know why I never heard of it before.  Combat is somewhat reminicent of an old snes cartrige platformer in that its simple but combat with the enimeis is (how to explain this? cumbersome,clunky? nah) unruly at time's but nothing you cant handle.  Lots of hidden stuff to find and interesting but simple platforming keeps you entertained.  Haven't found myself saying ""seen this before"" in the level design, so some actual thought was put into how the levels were designed.  All in all, if you like the Megaman X style of platforming and the art, story, and characters of the jak and daxter series, you will love this game. only ting i would say thatsbad about this game is the marketing should have been better, would have helped the sales tremendously, but hey how many game that were awesome but had ♥♥♥♥ marketing have we found in times past(cough,cough, ICO, Tiny Tank, Project X Zone, and Super Robot Taisen)			"

My playtime: 23h (based on steam, 100% achievement, both episode 1 and 2).Grindy Achievement: Yes (2 achievements (can be more based on your money after you beat the game)).Optional Achievement: Yes (10 achievements).Difficult Achievement: No.Developer Response: No (last response is in Mar 2015, i think).* You need to buy Blade Kitten: Episode 2 DLC to 100% the achievement.IntroBlade Kitten is an action platformer game which consists of 13 levels. Each levels can be completed in less than 10 minutes, which can be prolonged to 1 hour if you try to collect everything. You'll play as Kit Ballard, a breaker catgirl, which is trying to do some bounty hunting in Hollow Wish which ends up doing something greater. GraphicsBoth cutscenes and the game is using 3D models, which is decent for the game price. The animation and rigging is also decent although there are some weird animation styles, which is a minor thing. The menu looks very pretty with the purple background on it. However, i have to admit that all Kit images look different from each other.MusicAll the musics sound pleasant in my ear. The main menu shows a casual music while the music in each levels varies with the environment. I am amazed with the voice acting, especially the machines, which are executed greatly. However, some machines' static make it hard for me to listen what are they saying and the mouth expression doesn't match. Luckily, there is a subtitle for people like me who's having trouble in listening in English. It's turned off by default though and i have no idea that there is a subtitle until i almost finished the game.StoryThe story starts with the introduction of the planet that our main character, Kit Ballard, comes to and her comings to find a bounty in the planet. The first few seconds of the intro is executed perfectly. However, after a girl, which is supposed to be the main character's rival comes, the intro is ruined. The intro becomes weird with no atmosphere at all, and it's getting worse with the main character which is trying to show off with her cool pose.After the intro, the story seems scattered with no story progression, although it fixes itself after you finish a few levels. It might be because of the ""tutorial levels"" though.Because this game is a comic adaptation, you might want to know the comic first in order to understand the story well. I don't even know that the white haired girl is our protagonist's rival before i read it on blade kitten's website. Their acts doesn't even pictures the ""rivalry"" image pretty well either.The gameThe game has too many controls to remember and the dev is trying to cram all those in your head in the first level. I only ended up remembering a few thing, like right key for attack (which turns out to be ranged attack) and space for jump. This gives me some troubles on late levels, because ranged attack consumes stamina and i can't hit enemies close to me with it. I ended up knowing that left key is used for close attack when i almost finished episode 1. The same thing is also happening with the ""grabbing shield"" technique, which i thought can only work at close range.Even though the game crammed a lot of controls in the first level, it missed some controls, such as the special attack. I ended up casting it repeatedly without knowing what's happening. Although the special attack looks cool, it's useless and waste too much time, especially when you are trying to speed run the level.You can climb the wall. However, the game automates the ""climbing"" state as soon as you hit a wall. This gives me some trouble whenever i want to really hug the wall and doesn't want to climb up because you need to jump to get out of the climbing state. Funnily, the game doesn't automate the climbing state when you are in the air. You have to assign it manually by pressing up button. This makes it hard to ""climb down"" the wall because not only it is automated, but the up button is also used to get back on the platform. You can't really ""climb down"" the wall unless you fall.The game automates the direction of your jump based on your angle. You'll have to position yourself (or redoing the jump) a lot of times whenever you are standing on a tilted angle just to reach the right position.The boss physic is also weird, especially in the last boss. Because i thought that you can only hit the boss at close range, i ended up jumping on the boss a lot of times, and most of the times, i can't ""land"" on the boss' big frame because i didn't climb high enough and i also tend to fall down after i ""land"" on the boss' frame after inflicting damage on it.Aside from the controls, the game has 2 bosses in total. Each levels can be finished in around 1 hour if you are looking for everything. Some levels have an unlimited amount of enemies which might give you some trouble. Although that not all levels has an unlimited amount of enemies, some enemies can stunlock you until death. I ended up raging a lot in my first few hours because of that.Pros:- 13 levels- 2 boss- Weapon and clothes shopCons:- Automated controlsShould you buy this game?Yes.You might be having a hard time in the first few hours because of the controls and the stunlocks, but once you get past that, you'll enjoy the game. The game is cheap enough for the long gameplay and it can be even cheaper when it's on sale. "

												A hack & slash platformer, Blade Kitten suffers from sluggish, unresponsive controls, problematic hit detection, unchallenging enemies who only frustrate the player with their cheapness, problematic animations, and generally being downright tedious. While it has a good look and sound, the gameplay itself doesn't measure up to the visuals and ambiance, and at the full price of 5.99, the game isn't particularly worth it, as it will frustrate players; if it had better execution, the game could at least be mediocre, but as it stands, it's slightly less than.4/10			"

So yeah, that should prove to you enough that I played the game quite a bit. I don't know if later it will say I have more time or whatever, but yeah.So Blade Kitten. This game costs around 6 bucks on steam I think. The game is about a teen catgirl in between cute and sexy who uses a floating blade thing to beat the crap out of enemies. The game has some charm and I'm going to come out and admit that I'll be a little biased in it's favor since I adore catgirls <3. With that said the game is pretty average. It doesn't stand out a lot and it has a somewhat generic plot. The game is actually based on a comic or something (which I couldn't get into).There are a lot of 'quirky' lines in the game that border on beng the kind of memes I dislike with the soldiers saying things like 'lima oscar lima' which translates to 'LOL' . For some this is comedy. For me it is another reason to not be immersed. Also the phrase 'falterdan' is essentially the ef word for anyone curious.The game is pretty silly and mildly comedical, but tries to pull a little balony out of it's butt with a sudden 'seriousness' which wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't find myself sympathizing with the soldiers more than the main character. The soldiers also could make cool characters because they are silly. I guess what i'm saying is that they make bad bad guys and the main bad guy is...lame and generic. Also the final boss is a little bit of an 'i don't care, why am i helping' sort of moment.The music is ok, but there isn't a lot of variance. The environment is actually pretty nice and the side scrolling is done pretty well. Platforming isn't really frustrating and the controls work well for what it is. I like the concept of the game and would love to see more catgirls, but I think this game either needs to go full wacky or take a step back and reconsider having the enemies shout 'get her you noinks!' (it means noob for those who don't know).Overall the game is just a little above average. I like the main character's design and her personality has at least a little depth to it. The game itself is complete and fairly polished. The game runs well, just fails to stand out. Worth 6 or 7 bucks? Debatable. I'd say grab it somewhere beneath 5 bucks though, but it really isn't all that bad.			"

												sorta placeholder review cos i have card idled this game before, i have 4 hours~ on record and 50% of those are now real nonstop played hours. review might get updated once i finish the game. ANYWAY.you know what? it's summer, and this may not be on flash sale but the base game is 75% off right now and if you're looking for a really really fun and fluid intuitive platformer to play and your specs can handle it, then gettit. gettit now. especially recommend it if you liked the 'flow' of games like TRINE and you like awesome hyped up game BGM, very easy to learn controls that work with whatever you like to control Kit with best (gamepad, mouse and keyboard, keyboard only...) and a n00b-friendly but clearly rapidly escalating difficulty that actually teaches you how to do everything it expects you to do (!) while leaving plenty of room open for exploration and .... pretty much just wow i just spent 2 hours killing goons so i could smash through floors, ceilings, walls and/or climb them, float up them, sprint up them, jump up and down off them, for shiny trinkets and treasure chests so that i could buy Kit a new fashion outfit, knife and a jug of questionable milk, instead of like, i don't know... completing more than a few levels because i was having too much fun exploring AND treasure hunting at the same time.TL;DR if you only have $1.49 and you want a HUEG game that is super addictive and you don't have some secret hatred of catgirls in your platformers, recommended.

												Don't judge Blade Kitten. Just don't. The protagonist may be a catgirl and the story definitely sounds like some 14 year old's favorite fanfic, but somewhere beneath the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting and the vainness behind buying costumes for Kit that do nothing but reveal slightly more of her unmentionables lies one of the best platformers to come out for the PC. Although some of the physics can get wonky, especially when climbing up walls, the controls never feel like that big of a burden. The soundtrack is surprisingly great, fusing traditional East Asian rythms and instraments with Electronic music. Graphically, the game is above average for an indie game, but the animations are some of the best I've ever seen; AAA title or otherwise (eat it, Bethesda.) The combat does have a steep learning curve, but where this game really shines is in the exploration. Kit can climb almost any surface making finding that last Skiff as addicting as crack.I SWEAR THIS GAME IS GOOD. STOP JUDGING ME.			"

												I feel very mixed on this. Pros: -You play as a cat girl-The graphics are fairly well done-Skif is adorable-There are some funny dialogues (if you can stand the acting)Cons:-The 'combat' is god awful-You can run through just about everything without fighting, but god help you if you get stunned, you will be swarmed.-The 'story' is scattered-The voice acting is horrendousOverall- If you are looking for a hack and slash game, go for it.If you are looking for a game with substance, a followable storyline, and decent combat, don't get this.I'm giving it a thumbs up for Catgirl, Adorable companion, and lots of colors.

												Edit: finished episode 1An older game that feels like it's on the early stages of more modern mid-animation canceling and complex platforming.With that in mind the game can feel a little clunky every now and then, but for the most part it's still VERY functional and fun.I.E. tight controls that are a little too tight in some situations.gameplay out of the way, the protagonist is actually pretty likeable, which is saying a lot because she really is kind of obnoxious. If you ended up liking her like I did, great! if you didn't end up liking her character, I can 100% understand why you wouldn't. I love the world, it's so fun and interesting (although to some people, myself included, the game can feel a little like ""baby's first ratchet and clank clone"")Glitch wise I've actually been able to consistantly produce several glitches, on my first playthrough. Which I find very odd and I wish the developers would update the game with a more updated, less glitchy control set up. hell, I feel through the level at one point, and I have no idea how I even did that.Overall, I've been really enjoying this game, but maybe not for the reasons most people enjoy games. yes, it's fun, and that's the main reason I like it, but it also is kinda buggy and I find that oddly endearing. 8/10 IT'S TOO SHORT THOUGH			"

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
For what it is,
THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@===========================================        First off, I was not expecting the character animations 
        or facial movements to be 
                    SO AMAZINGLY EXQUISITE!!!!        
                Blew. Me. Away.

        Totally adorable, captures the anime cuteness 
        w/o falling into the uncanny valley.

        + Kit is *such* a fun and enjoyable character.

                         =^_^=
===========================================You want your protagonist character to be nice to look at,
because you're going to spend a lot of time looking at them
(regardless of gender).


But something I didn't expect:

     This game never gets fan-service-y
     or tries to sell out with sexualizing. 


Really appreciate this.

     Sexualizing is a commercially tempting 
     quick and gaudy sell,

     but cute and fun don't get old.
Definitely family friendly.
===========================================Which brings me to my next + favourite point.
         [<3][<3][<3][<3][<3][<3][<3]                  THIS GAME IS SO REMINISCENT
                   OF THE HEART OF THE 90s 
                     3D PLATFORMER GAMES
         [:3][:3][:3][:3][:3][:3][:3] 
          only combined with the gaming world's 
            own unique take on the anime style
 
        A beautiful, beautiful fuzion. 
       Quippy, rich environments, pure,
       villians who aren't evil so much as 
          they're school-yard bully types,
       Lots of shiny things and gems.
 
        And incredibly fun, relaxingly fluid (but engaging)
        flashy, and smooth combat and climbing mechanics.
===========================================
  You can climb most walls (and the mechanics / animations are sooo good),
  You can direct the angle of the sword, even when you take a sprinting 
      running leap you can direct it down and bop the baddies below you 
       as you soar over them.

  You get charged attacks, you get a nice arial ground slam,
  you can hold the longrange button to hold your sword out and run around
  grabbing the first enemy you come across if you want to play defensively
  (but it takes stamina to use the longrange grab or longrange hit,
     so there's a balanced tradeoff between using stamina for:
     longrange, or the shield, or sprinting)

  (but stamina recharges comfrotably fast, no worries)

  You get a shield. You get stamina. 
  Stamina and health recharge. 
  Upgradable swords give you faster stamina recharge.
  You can buy stamina + health upgrades.

  The game feels incredibly well balanced.
  And enemies are only easy if you go through all the breakable walls 
  to uncover enough loot to get the beefier swords, 
    so when you can finally one hit them, you've literally earned it.

=============================================

  Oh also, you can preview every costume in the game,
  then purchase them to use in the levels (+cutscenes!)
  I spent my first big treasure roll 
  on the pajama outfit

        and suddenly Kit was twice as cute
        and the game twice as enjoyable.
  (Next level was slightly more of a challenge 
  having bought the outfit instead of a new sword,
  but Kit looked sooo adorable, it really didn't matter)
=============================================             I was expecting a mindless platformer.
             But found a surprisingly heartfelt gem I almost missed out on. 

             Like I said, you have to accept it for its genre
             & for what it offers (which is amazing fun).

             But total disclosure:
                  After mastering all the mechanics, it is pretty easy 
                          (using the upgraded blades at least, but that's your choice),
                          (going to play through it again with the default sword
                           for what will definitely be more of a challenge)

             Maybe I should say fluid instead of easy. It is incredibly engaging.             Because when it got ""easy"", I also became more free.

             Kit's a fun, easygoing, upbeat, shiny-seeking, twirling blad wielding, 
              adorable cat treasure hunter.

             This free fluidity fits her character (&) makes it more immersive.
              
             But out of all the treasure I've found in this game,   Kit is truly the most glowing (+) adorable gem. 
  ==================================This game is TRULY an accomplishment of 
style, atmosphere, animation, control, & heart   <3  ==================================

												I love some of Krome Studios work, which is why it is so dissapointing to say that I just can't bring myself to do the same for one of their more modern games: Blade Kitten. The concept of mixing the elements of a 3D collectathon with a 2D platformer seems like a novel idea. But the game just needed a few more months of development to fully flesh them out. The level design is far too open, bland and repeditive to incentivize collecting. No challenge or obstacle ever escalates after the first 3 levels.Occasionally platforms and enemies will have slightly different placements. Boss fights are slow and the controls just aren't fluid and borderline between precise and wonky. There are times where Kit's sword feels great to control away from her body as a free flowing object. But at specific parts of the game you can see this was used to avoid extra animation and streamline wall-climbing, which is an issue in of itself. Sometimes Kit will just let go for fail to grab a wall properly. This happens on rare occasions but when it does it is certainly noticeable.This is also not to mention the various bugs which hold the game back. On several occasions i found myself missing a slightly awkward jump only to fall through the level or grab an invisible ledge and get stuck. Blade kitten has a great charm, you can feel the passion devs had during cutscenes and dialogue which are so upbeat and match the style perfectly. To put it bluntly, this game had massive potential but really lacked in focused level design, gameplay and basic bug/play testing. The games faults aren't bad enough to become offensive, glitches happen rarely. Gameplay mostly functions properly. But sometimes there is nothing worse for a game than to end up exceedingly average, and sadly those are the best words for describing Blade Kitten.			"

												I had originally planned to get this game shortly after it's initial release back in 2010, but after hearing news that Episode 1 ended on a cliffhanger and the publisher (Atari) was holding back the release of Episode 2, I decided against it.However, now that Atari's license/publishing rights to the game has expired, Blade Kitten is back on track in the hands of the developer, Episode 2 is in development, and Episode 1 is better than ever with full Xbox 360 Controller support, an option to unlock the framerate from 30 to 60fps, and support for higher resolutions. Oh, and did I mention that the price has been reduced to roughly 1/3 of its original cost with Episode 2 planned to be released at around the same price?Gameplay-wise, Blade Kitten is a solid 2D Action Platformer with tight controls, good physics, decent combat, fun level design, and enough optional exploration/collectibles to appeal to folks who are into that sort of thing.Graphics-wise, Blade Kitten looks good. The graphics are by no means ground-breaking or cutting-edge, (this is a game from 2010 by a rather small developer, after all) but they serve their purpose by illustrating a colorful and interesting world.Sound-wise, the game is average but adequate. The voice acting is decent and the music (while somewhat forgettable) is by no means unpleasant to listen to. Story-wise, Blade Kitten is fun and interesting. Kit is an amusing and likeable protagonist, and most of the other characters are amusing and likeable as well. The story so far is incomplete as Episode 1 ends on a cliffhanger, but it left me wanting more and I eagerly await the release of Episode 2.Overall, Blade Kitten is a solid buy for the price. It's a fun game that will keep fans of the genre entertained and leave them wanting more. If you enjoy 2D Action Platformers with solid gameplay, colorful graphics, and an amusing cast of characters, then I highly recommend checking out Blade Kitten.			"

												* meow * me likes ... The main character is not just a cute costume, she is a strong good fighter, jumps far, climbs well and gives a smooth feeling of being a cat. The cel shaded graphic looks amazing and with the voice acting this game just gets better with that :) I will mention that this is a decent platformer, but sometimes lacks the action fight scenes, which I expected would scale to a higher level through the game. All in all, a fun game to relax with.			"

												Blade Kitten (episode1) is a decent platforming game with a cheesy story and snappy protagonist. There are some issues which I would describe as a minor nuisance but overall game is not as bad as some reviews may suggest. Please note that you have to buy episode 2 separately so you don't get burned like me . Technical Problems I was experiencing some stuttering but unlocking framerate in video settings fixed it. Honestly, my biggest problem with the game is the camera that constantly changes position. There are no settings to just lock it in place which would make the game a lot better for me. Other than that I just run into few glitches that did not impact the game in any big way . Story and Dialogue The story seems to be the focal point of bad reviews so I want to give my feedback on it. It is a very cheesy game with somewhat cringy dialogue but a lot of my favorite platformers were the same way. I guess the character is all about girlpower but she sounds forcefully stereotypical (which is fine for a game like BladeKitten). Voice acting is good so you just have to accept the game for what it is. I did not care for the plot that much but I do like the way episode 1 ended.  Controls  I can only speak for myself but I had no problems with controls whatsoever. There are some mechanics with combat that may take time getting use so don't skip tips. To shield brake enemy just hold B (on controler) or equivalent on keyboard next to enemy but not too close. Platforming is actually very easy because the game assists you with grabbing objects. You can climb all over the place even around the corners which done by just touching walls. Out of all the wall climbing games I played BladeKitten by far has the easiest way to do it. I played on a controller and had no problems.Note* To do a critical move look at her face in the bottom-left corner. When it is red during combat you have to to attack enemy while running. Platforming and Combat I thought the platforming elements were done very well . Unlike most games BladeKitten takes full advantage of the mechanics like wall climbing and combat in the mid-air. Your sword flies around so even if you jumping or upside down you can still fight enemies. There is a nice mix of moves including slide attack, air-stump,grab, critical move and basic close/long range attacks. There are a lot of complex platforming sections where you may need to climb upside down on moving platforms which gives the game nice dynamics. Unlockable items and Collection Ther are a lot of road forks and many of them lead to hidden items or currency. This game does a good job rewarding the player for curiosity. You can enter a store where you can unlock skins, upgrades, and weapons. There is a nice selection of skins which this game should be praised for. Unfortunately, it does seem like those skins have any special powers. I kind of expect each skin to have a unique perk or ability which is a missed opportunity. Aesthetic Value In my humble opinion, the game is rather pretty and soundtrack is fantastic. Backgrounds and detail in some of the levels is gorgeous (maybe except the first level). In general, the animation is high quality. Not too much variety when it comes to stages though. Overall I really like the way main character moves and she even has animations that have no purpose like moving the head when sticking to a wall (always a nice touch) Other design Problems Navigation can be a bit confusing. The first quarter of the game has literally 1 enemy type (it does get better after that) Boss battles are either too easy or can be abused . In general the game offers next to no challenge because there are checkpoints like every 30 seconds. Verdict 7/10 BladeKitten is somewhat mistreated with bad reviews that come from people who obviously did not beat level 1. I mean people focus on few things that game does badly and nobody mentions what it does well. There is nothing seriously wrong with the game but it feels unpolished .It looks very nice and there are a lot of good platforming sections. Dialogue can be eye-rolling but I don't judge platformers on a story.  For $3 at full price I don't think there is any reason not to try it . I liked the game enough to put Episode 2 on my wishlist and I will buy it on sale.			"

												I think that this game is a lot underrated. I'm not any kind of platformer games specialist or whatever, but for me I foudn the game really enjoyable! I haven't finished it in one sitting, so it's definitely not short + there are lots of unlockables on each level I haven't found yet, the controls don't seem 100% intuitive at start, but while you get used to them, there's absolutely no problem in navigating at all (just wsad, shift and e to use an action). Voice acting is 100% fine for me, the story isn't FF7-like, but it's fun to follow. The only drawback I have is that the game runs on 30FPS, and it makes my eyes tired since it's quite dynamic ;X. Dunno why they set the limit so low, even in window. I must admit that I bought this game mostly due to a sweet catgirl in here, but aside that, it's really worth the price, especially when it's 50% off :P. And costumes appearing different on each cutscene makes it even better (the exclusive steam one is SWEET :D).100% Faalagorn recommend!			"

												Superb artwork, well executed movements, this is a really a nicely produced platformer. Blade Kitten is beautifully drawn and her animations have been executed with artistic flair, not so much the other characters though, which can be really primitive by comparison. It’s not a thinking person’s game, and it certainly is repetitive, but it's also a lot of fun to pass a few idle moments. I wouldn't pay top money for this, but at it's current price it’s a real bargain and a great deal of fun.My only real complaint with the game was that I was very disappointed to discover that when you start a new game, you lose all the items you purchased previously. In particular, you lose all the costumes. Despite that, it still comes recommended!			"

												Short version for people who just want to know, yes or no?Yes, good game. Worth 100% of the price.Long versionThe game is a little funky with the controls but its still fun. It has a nice story with a lot of BAM moments, like BAM now this, BAM now that, BAM boss time. Its cute and funny too, more jokes that make me laugh from a character that is easily loveable and very adorable instead of trying so hard for some over the top meta crap. My play time at the time of this review was 4.2 hours, I only ran to the end of the levels and did not try to collect or replay parts. Not because it was bad but because I like to do things fast, so depending on your play style, thats about how long the game is. It was my own personal preference though. I like to speed run, there was a lot to look at though and now that I beat it on my little speed run I think I'll play it again and take my time .The game isnt perfect, no game really is but it gets a 10/10 from me. Because it is worth 100% of its price.			"

												It's a great concept, and the theming is superb. You've got a catgirl acrobatic mercenary type and a girl named Justice, HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG?With really messed up mechanics of course. It's throwing a cat on ice and the acrobatics of it trying to figure out where to go are really not a ""feature"" and more like really annoying.  The commands create an effect where you can't tell if they're working or even in action, the instructions are confusing, and although the animation for the double jump is sweet, it doesn't make up for low gravity physics to the point where you can literally run on air without touching the ground.Not bad for the price, the characterization and voicing aren't great, but unless you ever thought to yourself ""You know what would be great? A catgirl slip'n'slide platformer!"" you can probably skip this one.			"

												For a platformer, this game is really fun. Kit is absolutely ADORABLE, her sassy and cute attitude just makes you want to hang out with her more. All the characters are lively and you feel like you're actually in the story with her. The combat is fun; it's a little more complicated than your usual platformer. Some of the missions are a little confusing but theres always a nice puzzle in there now and then. You also get to unlock soem cute outfits for Kit and change them at any time! I hope they manage to make the second one. <3			"

												Don't freak out at the Metascore for this game, some problems having been ironed out since the release, and apparently episode 2 is in the works, so the series is not at a dead end. Mind you, this is far from the best platformer ever either, but for that price it's really fun, especially if you fancy the universe (it's based on a webcomics) and sidescroller games overall.			"

												Really liking the new controls!I was a little surprised to find out that it was being re-released on Steam because I didn't even know it had been removed at some point. I had originally tried the demo, I would guess years ago. Apparently the Developer and Publisher were having issues which resulted in the developer not being able to continue developing the game (Episode 2). Now the Developer has full control of their IP again, they have improved the controls and it sounds like EP2 is back on.The levels are quite large, there is a lot to explore and tons of secrets to find. The combat can be a little simple but was enjoyable. The story is shaping up to be interesting. I'm definitely looking forward to the second Episode.			"

												Blade Kitten is a solid platformer with simple combat, I think many miss the point of the game when jumping in. The game really feels more akin to a old DOS platfomer like Commander Keen where you're collecting items and enemies are just part of it.It's a fun romp with character to it. This games focus is NOT combat where you're set on executing a ton of moves like Blood Rayne: Betrayal. It's a difficult thing to describe annoyingly...The game looks nice because of it's style (nice to see a game with some color for a change), the character isn't annoying and if the outfit isn't your thing, there's a ton of unlockable  costumes. Let me just restate this...unlockable, as in NOT DLC, not a company charging 3 bucks a pop for an a single alternate costume at a time, there's a bunch to pick. Some outright totally different characters. So yes, looks nice, sounds nice and back on steam.			"

												Received a error '86' when trying to run the demo so couldn't start the demo at all, after reading the original game works fine, went ahead and bought it. It's fun to play, being a experienced player, the game got me on 'epic fails' several times. 6 hours to beat the first part, but need to find all secrets still.It ends weird, since episode 2 isn't released yet. However it's confirmed this will become available after testing and bug fixing the second part.For a full list they're working on, including making the second part available (as a paid downloadeable content):

												Short, easy, fun. Fairly good considering the budget. Really liked the art design. Dub was acceptable, music acceptable. Gameplay fairly simplicistic, hopefully it will be expanded a little in Episode 2.Played episode 2 as well, and it's boring. It adds a few more costumes and a few more weapons, but overall nothing really changes, the story is not particularly engrossing, the enemies are boring (except for the final boss) and the characters themselves are fairly boring as well. Pity.			"

												Blade Kitten is a sort of prequel or retelling of the comic of the same name and follows Kit Ballard, Intergalactic Breaker (a type of bounty hunter.)  The tale of Blade Kitten feels a bit rushed and although the story devices are overly clichéd and the level themes are often reused and limited, the gameplay is fun.  Blade Kitten blends eighties nostalgia with solid gameplay.			"

												Blade Kitten is a decent game for a (Currently) very cheap price of $5.99It is a game based upon a rather popular Webcomic that (Unfortunately) hasn't updated since 2012.The story is not too hard to understand, yet has a few twists here and there to keep you entertained. But, it most likely will not entertain you if you aren't a fan of the webcomic. The gameplay really depends upon what controller you are using..This is one of those games in which i can barely play it with a mouse and keyboard. You NEED a controller. Without a controller, i kept getting stuck to walls, slashing in the wrong direction, and i had a lot of trouble just getting through some of the very easy puzzles because of how bad the keyboard/mouse controls are. With a controller, it is MUCH easier to control and works quite well. The only issues i had is that the combat is somewhat imprecise.The graphics are Cel-shaded..But in a style that doesn't compliment it too well. It seems extremely cartoonish and silly and appears very ""Meh"". Had they focused more on making it like the comic style (emphasising the lines and details of the characters), it would have worked better.Considering the current price, i give it a recommendation to buy.As for the game itself, i give it a 6.5/10			"

												I never thought about actually liking ever a stupid Terraformer/Platformer game. I changed my mind with this one!I never had that much fun since some weeks, its cute, lovely and also the companion´s of her are nice made.I´ve been through a lot of games like this but never had i ever a smooth gameplay, a lovely made characters or Story like this. Proably also liking Cat´s doesnt were a reason for liking it, since my first impression was ""Huh... another stupid Platformer game who thinks just a cute character makes it good""What i mostly miss in other games is the smoothness of being able to control them just as this game! My Combo´s works fawless and always is like i want. The Story is beside nothing outstanding as you just follow some Girl (another headhunter) as yourself you were being forced to lose your headhunter key and ship to that *****!The gameplay is easy the combo´s need to be used to same for defending and attacking emeny´s. OH and dont forget to get fishs, treasure chests and money you can collect all you´re way alone through the Maps.Also activating keypoints with sword and friends is a must have you need to be able to do as you need them here and there sometimes (or for treasures/money/fishs)Would love to having such a kitty here @ home as we own 2 Cats yourself 83UPDATE 1-2:--------------------I noticed serveral Bugs and AI loses when going through the Episode 1 of this game.One time it was so big that i did hangs like 7 dayz just to notice the Emeny could be killed while being stucked into a wall he needed to smash (you know what i mean with that) Another Bug i noticed was the guys with shileds coudln´t be harmed after even 30-40 hits some all directions (weird!?) not even stunning them with the jump slash they could be harmed..And now today...suddenly the game did let me go through all those bugs that´s why i could finally finishing it as i it seems i was already very near the end (2 Levels, maybe 30 minutes later it asked to buy Episode 2)@Developer-------------------You should play your game and see the various Bugs i had been delivered! Make those weirdo bugs away and this game is really fawless!!! GJ so far done by you guys!UPDATE 2-2:--------------------I will Update again later on, when i bought and finished the 2nd Episode of this amazing game!			"

I personally enjoy this 2.5d platformer and I like the Blade Kitten series, yes its cheesy but I think this game is really fun, I swear to god I played this game for 8 hours at a time on PS3 because I wanted to collect all of the Hex and max out Kit. The visuals are simple but the shading on the skins at time is quite nice. 9/10-Great game...just some inconsistancy and minor level bugs, I fell through the world twice due to a wandering box that knocked me off of the Z axis.

												As much of an interesting concept this game puts forth (catgirls in space with giant swords) for my perverted mind, my eyes can't take it.  Ten minutes in I was hung over with massive gaming sickness.  Five hours later, I'm only just starting to come around...  The gameplay is rather standard, using a similar movement system to the space ninja shooter WARFRAME for acrobatic commands, for a platformer: climb, run, jump, and look for secret areas while following a breadcrumb trail of currency.   Honestly, Mario Bros. for the Gameboy did it better.  Despite the flashier graphics and 2.5D scenery, Blade Kitten fell into my gaming litter box.			"

												There are already quite a few comprehensive positive reviews out there, so I'll just add a few thoughts: 1) People have compared it to Sonic, Megaman and Prince of Persia. Gameplay wise it also reminds me a bit of 2014's remake of ""Strider"" - if you liked that one, ""Blade Kitten"" might appeal to you too. It's like a ""Strider light"" in every way (including the much lighter tone) - a fast paced metroidvanian jump'n hack&slash. I really wish there were more games like that out there.   2) Since episode 2 is out, the game is finally complete. If episode 2 is installed, it gets merged seamlessly into the main game to bring it to a conclusion - nice! I like that they took the difficulty up a notch here, too. The game is still rather easy, though, and I wish the bosses were a little bit more challenging. Anyway ""Blade Kitten"" is a cute time waster that is easily worth its very moderate ""full price"". Yay team! :-)			"

												This is not a good game. like at all. I couldn't even make it past the first stage without wanting to snap my controler in half. the platforming is awful, the voice acting is embarassing and the hit detection is so off that it will frustrate you to no end. you go to hit a target infront of you, in stead you tage damamge because even though your attack struck him, their attack blocks it and hits through to you. The game tries to explain this parry system it has, but the system is horribly flawed. supposedly you can deflect an incoming attack by tapping the attack button right when they attack but it never seems to work and i can't figure it out. most of the time my character just flinches if an enemy just looks at them funny and it's just a really bad exprience all around. If you think this is an interesting platformer to pick up on sale, I'd advise you to look for something else. I cannot recommend this game even to a casual gamer.			"

												Blade Kitten is a competent side-scroller--but not a particularly phenomenal one. While it plays amazingly smoothly, controlling protagonist Kit Ballard feels completely iffy; it never really feels like she's going where you want her to, but where it's most *convenient* for her. Jumping puzzles and combat really suffer as a result; you never really feel like you're doing more than mashing buttons.Progress also greatly suffers when your upgrades are all unlocked from a menu. In-game cash is earned and spent in your Pause menu for health bonuses, new weapons, and even new costumes. It never feels like they matter much, however. In spite of all the doodads you can find in each level, it'll never really feel like it comes together.And yet... this game still feels oddly pleasant. Climbing the walls and ceilings feels effortless--this alone makes exploration tons of fun. The strange alien locales also feel oddly inviting. The awkwardness does bring this game down heavily, but Blade Kitten is totally worth picking up if and when it's on sale.			"

												Some will see this as a positive, but the levels are too big. I got super bored doing nothing but just climbing every wall and breaking open yet another divergent path over an utterly massive area just to get money to buy items that you really don't need to beat the whole game. There is also no clarity as to which direction is the ""right"" one so you can't really skip the collectathon, and it feels all about collecting money. It could have really benefitted from more levels that are smaller and more interestingly designed. The gameplay is also very slow and floaty, no satisfying snappiness to the controls, and the combat could have been so much more. The bad asian stereotype shopkeeper was offensive. All that said, they have at least come a long way with the title over the years. It used to run waaaaay worse.If you like annoyingly huge open levels where you slowly do almost nothing but collect money for pointless things between fairly boring cutscenes, get this.

												I can't recommend this mediocre game.  The controls are sketchy, the enemies sometimes go down and sometimes not, seemingly at random, and the overall experience had me yawning 5 minutes in.  I honestly couldn't bear to play this for longer than half an hour.  It's just so bland and... nothing.  There's *nothing* here that you can't find somewhere else, done better.  I got this in a bundle, and it looked fun, but it's an honest disappointment.  I was hoping the character would at least have some charisma, and she does, but only in a Bubsy ""aren't I cool and edgy"" kind of way.    Final verdict:  don't waste your time on this.			"

												Some will see this as a positive, but the levels are too big. I got super bored doing nothing but just climbing every wall and breaking open yet another divergent path over an utterly massive area just to get money to buy items that you really don't need to beat the whole game. There is also no clarity as to which direction is the ""right"" one so you can't really skip the collectathon, and it feels all about collecting money. It could have really benefitted from more levels that are smaller and more interestingly designed. The gameplay is also very slow and floaty, no satisfying snappiness to the controls, and the combat could have been so much more. The bad asian stereotype shopkeeper was offensive. All that said, they have at least come a long way with the title over the years. It used to run waaaaay worse.If you like annoyingly huge open levels where you slowly do almost nothing but collect money for pointless things between fairly boring cutscenes, get this. If you like satisfying platforming, fun action, tight and engaging controls, and requiring skill, you may want to go for something like Shantae or Freedom Planet instead.			"

												I can deal with ugly, western-anime graphics and bad cell-shading. I can deal with very poorly written Japanese-wannabe teen dialogue (""Win Get!"" ""Situation Oscar Mike Golf!"" (yes, the enemies say OMG) ""Do want!"" and more) and the awful voice-acting. I can deal with the weird implications of a cat-girl collecting bagged goldfish and the button-mashy fighting.What I can't deal with is broken mechanics and lazy development. Melee enemies that can attack you from a different plane than you, so you can't hit them back. The player being pushed off the correct plane, dropping you through the world. No dead-zone on the control stick, so you are forced to move in a direction if you want to do a slide (which is mainly a combat move). No indication when the overhead grab will and won't work, and using the same button as the wall-grab, sticking you to a ceiling if you're too close during combat, which you can't attack from. Enemies continuing to attack you while you're in an attack animation against them. Being stun-locked by constant staggering attacks (and sometimes map hazards) for 20+ seconds, until death.Annoyances include: Fast stamina usage and slow regen. Run-jumping becomes a long-lump and you lose the ability to double-jump, meaning if you're running and want to do a jump up to a higher level, you will instead shoot off the side. No benefits to collecting collectables besides completionism.Now, the gameplay itself is fine. Bland, but it works, for the most part. But this is no Strider, and the plot will send you to sleep, only to be woken up by the occasional cringe when the protagonist speaks.			"

												Blade Kitten is alright, I guess.You play as Kit Ballard, a pink haired cat girl who is unfortunately not my girlfriend. Kit is a breaker, which is a bounty hunter, I don't know why they didn't just call her a bounty hunter, maybe due to her close resemblance to Dog the bounty hunter, they wanted to avoid a lawsuit. Kit is also apparently a comic book character, I have not read the comics, but they are probably a treat But they're not as good as MarmadukeLook at you sitting at the table, Marmaduke. Who are you to do that? You're just a dog. In Blade Kitten, Kit arrives on the planet Hollow Wish in search of a bounty, go figure. But unfortunately, her bounty chip (card?) is stolen by a rival who is, sadly, also not my girlfriend, and Kit has to get it back. What happens after is a journey across Hollow Wish to both get your stuff back, stop the Sols (I think they're called the Sols), and track down your bounty. The game uses a typical side scrolling jump and fight collectathon style. Kit, being a cat girl, is very nimble and can move around the terrain easily, and probably do that think where cats lick their legs and it sticks out all weird and stuff. The animations themselves are rather basic and stiff, though they're not offensive enough to ruin the experience. Kit also has what you call a hover blade, which she can use to fight enemies up close or at a distance. This is the part where I talk about the environment.The game, althought colorful, has rather generic set pieces for you to prowl along through. See what I did there? Cause she's a cat. It almost looks like a cartoon movie from the 90's actually. You have a city made out of some sort of stone substance that isn't brick, you have a sewer level, some cat walk levels (haha), and an open plain level where you can ride around on a weird raptor horse thing. Speaking of 90's cartoon movie, the voice actors themselves don't seem all that into it. Kit's manages to get her personality across, but other than that, a bunch of her lines seem ham fisted or half heartily delivered. Much like the gameplay, it is stiff like the whiskey I fix myself every morning to help me forget. Why did I let them die? And further mo- Wait, that's it? It's over? That was like... Two hours. Oh, there's an episode two coming soon, when did this game come out?2010? Get out of here. I guess you can say this game is short of purrfect. It's nothing to write home about, but it's also nothing to hate. If you can get this game for...Three dollars or so, you'll probably be good to go.Blade Kitten: waifu wars: the reckoning: HD Edition: Third Strike, only on PS2, gets two kitty claws out of a possible four.

												Cute, if a bit weird.  It's a side-scrolling, platform game with RPG elements (think Simon's Quest or Symphony of the Night, but more linear), which is cool.  I like these.  The game fails utterly at something very important, however: the controls.  The controls straight up suck.  There's a half-second or so of input lag that I can't seem to overcome.  Wasn't able to find anything on Google about it, nor in the first hundred or so results in Steam discussions.  This is especially sucktacular for a game that is so action-oriented.  I can't recommend it until that part is fixed.			"

												Hmmm... Controls are sticky and laggy, combat is made tedious because enemies can randomly guard against your attacks, and Kit's voice acting is just... bad. Like, every one-liner she tries to pull seems awkward. Not that the rest of the voice acting is anything special, but y'know, she's the main character. The MOST effort in all of the VA should be put into the main character, in my opinion.Anyway, my point is that the game simply didn't feel fun to me.

												I only played this game for a little while, and it has some problems, but the reason I stopped playing is that I was getting motion sickness from the camera zooming in and out, which is my problem rather than a problem with the game.I was on the border about how to rate this. The controls are 'iffy', and I really hate that I can't map movement to the d-pad instead of the gorram analog stick, especially since the game requires quick turns during combat and analog sticks can 'whiplash' and make you end up facing the wrong direction (this happened to me A LOT during play). Most of the control issues are really because the character just has too much going on and the controls aren't really locked down to any single mechanic, so even walking around feels floaty, and jumping is pretty ridiculous in some cases. You can stick to walls and cielings and climb around on them, you can also do Metroid-style wall jumps in cases where you can't stick to the wall. There's also these weird glowy things that try to make you land on them while jumping if you're anywhere near them. The tip sign says they're only supposed to draw you in if you hold the L-trigger, but it seems that they're always on instead. In any case, the controls are functional but need work before they can feel natural and repsonsive.Combat is sort of bad. I mean I was only in the first stage, but the problems were immediately evident, and I expect them to get worse as the game progresses. The main problem is that your stun animation is extremely slow, and you're not invulnerable during it, so it's incredibly easy to get stunlocked just by standing too close to an enemy, let alone between two. To add to the frustration, the enemies seem to be invulnerable during their close-range attacks, so you can get into some really crappy situations that aren't fun or challenging, but simply frustrating.The character dialog isn't childish, but simply corny. I had though that we had advanced as a society since the early 90's, but clearly I was wrong: We've simply added memes into the vocabulary of ""things that kids say"".Despite all that, this is a workable platformer, and some of the moves are cool when you pull them off. I got the game on sale, and I don't really feel bad about it, despite not being able to play because of my motion sickness, which - again - is not the game's fault; I'm just overly sensitive to certain camera movements.In the end I decided to vote up because when I was originally considering the purchase I saw a number of very concerning issues being raised in the negative reviews. They almost all turned out to be bunk, or at least far less of a problem than was being indicated. For instance, a couple reviewers said that there's no way to block. There are - in fact - two ways to block. You can simply hold the attack button for half a second, or you can use the L-Trigger to activate your shield and grab onto the ground. There doesn't appear to be any limitation on this either. You can sit there for days and the shield soaks up all the damage, so I'm not sure what that was all about. Additionally, some reviews rightfully cited control issues, but wrongfully exaggerated them to apocalyptic proportions. The controls feel floaty and sometimes wall-gymnastics don't go how you planned them, but they are entirely workable, and I've certainly seen a lot worse on more expensive games. Finally, the stunlock issue was presented by some as game-breaking. It's annoying and frustrating, but it's also very easy to deal with if you just activate the shield for a moment and then jump out of the crossfire between attacks.Anyway, that's my 2 bits.			"

												While this may sound strange coming from me, Blade Kitten, a platforming side scroller about a pink haired neko catgirl named Kit who is a bounty hunter, is actually a really decent game. The enviornments are pretty creative in a sense and the platforming works quite well. Solid gameplay and decent fighting mechanics makes this game worth it's demanding price tag: Just $15. The only really annoying negative is the voice acting by some of the characters, especially by the protagonist, is horrendously laughable. But it's $15 bucks for a decent side scrolling platformer that you can waste some boredom time on.			"

												Blade Kitten is a platformer with climbing mechanics as well as combat mixed in.You play as a Cat Girl and you go around...helping I guess? The story is pretty disjointed, it seems like you just go on random favors for people as you go along. I'm not usually big into story in games so I didn't get much out of it anyhow, but even watching the cutscenes didn't give me much idea of what was going on.The gameplay is a lot of 2D platforming. There is a ton of Hex (the currency) to collect in levels, so much so that you can probably find hundreds of different secret paths that can lead you to more. This is a nice touch as you can use the hex to upgrade your character and get more costumes. It encourages exploration, and can lead to spending a lot of time in levels just messing around and finding hex. The platforming itself is generally solid, and climbing allows you to get to a lot of areas without much trouble.The combat is one area of the game I didn't much care for. It seems that more often then not the best way to fight is to just abuse overpowered energy skills rather then fight normally. Because of this, fighting becomes quite boring, and it's mostly optional anyhow, which lead me to skip most enemies in the game (of which there are a lot). The amount of enemy spawns which seem endless in some areas seems to encourage that run away playstyle. The combat itself just doesn't have much depth, you can shield, spam attack, or spam energy skills. The boss fights are also prettyuninteresting.I really like the art style of the game, which seems cel-shaded. The character are animated well and I feel like I'm playing an older style console game seeing them interact.The game lasted me about 3 hours but it would take much more time to collect everything in the levels, so if you're a completionist you can definitely get your moneys worth. I guess the game is somewhat episodic because it ends without any type of real finish to the story, and there is a Part 2 DLC. This might be something to keep in mind if you want the complete story.I did enjoy the game, but it could do with some improvements. I'm not sure if I'll go for the DLC at this point, but I might consider it in the future.7.2/10 "

												Blade Kitten is one of those series that harkens back to the time of fun platforming games. It has a great story (you can view more in Space Captain Steve's comics, including fun ""steampunk"" versions of the characters), cute graphics, and wonderful voice acting. Think Strider but with a Catgirl (a win/win combo if you ask me).The controls are a little loose and the camera moves too quick sometimes. It does not detract from the game much, and you will get used to the controls after a level or two. I recommend playing it with a controller if you have one.I have played through this game on the Xbox 360, PS3, and now on Steam. It is a great game and I highly recommend it (as well as it's Episode 2 DLC).Oscar Mike Golf! ^_^			"

												It says that I don't recommend this game but I would still recommend it if it is on sale. 5€ for 1 episode which lasts about 3 hours isn't worth it but both episodes for maybe 5€ should be worth it.The soundtrack and drawing style are pretty good but that's about it.The fighting system sucks ♥♥♥. Pressing both attack keys sums it up. You can also run through the level since the difficulty is pretty much non existent. Enemies and level design repeat themselves every 2min. Bossfights are boring because they repeat the same pattern 24/7.Besides this the characters are poorly written if they are written at all. Dialogs are so bad and ""jokes"" are cringey af.They tried to make the main character sexy and flirty but it's just so bad that it makes you laugh.Furthermore there is no story at all. The game tries to tell you a story but ♥♥♥♥s it up. You don't understand ♥♥♥♥ because nothing is explained. You get 1 mission which says ""get the food back"" - 10 min later you fight your ""rival"" - Another 10 min later you get ♥♥♥♥ed by some big ♥♥♥ godzilla without any explanations. 3/10			"

												Just a cheap prequel made for their web comic. Buggy, short, and unless you just love 2d platformers, there's nothing really interesting about this game. The story is a confusing mess where you have almost zero understanding of why you're doing anything. Your actions don't seem to have any connectivity between each chapter. Combat is basically a button masher. The graphics are atrocious with horrible clipping issues. Even the collectibles which only exist to lengthen gameplay are buggy and sometimes don't even spawn.Also -100 points for trying to charge $10 for a soundtrack that I could just find on youtube.

												Wow ! This game is great i thought a platforming hack and slash game with a strong exploration focus i can dig it. But as i played it my enthusiasm drained out of me and into a disapointing puddle on the floor. Lets start with the platforming which it a bit easy and a lot repetitive. First off you can climb 99% of the walls so theres no challenging jumps to pull of just climb up the wall and along the ceiling to get were you need to go. Now, about that hack and slash gameplay i mentioned. At first i liked it do flips and flail your sword about, sweet i wonder what cool combos and special skills ill unlock? None? This is it? All you do is jump from side to side over an enemy and flail your sword. Im not kidding all the enemies are susceptible to this, it wins everytime. So the challenge of the combat fell out with an audible, THUMP! Now the exploration is ok if you like finding collectibles in games there a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of crap to find. Having said that they serve no purpose but to give you money to buy upgrades you never need and cosmetics. This game started off great but the lack of pregression or a structured difficulty curve makes this game pretty stale. After a pretty short boring story with pretty cringeworthy voice acting. I was done, I only played through episode one i was so paralyzed with boredom I wont pay for more. Cannot reccomend.			"

												Technical execution of this game is good but not great - it's clearly a console port and has irritating prompts for the player to use a game controller.Graphics are fine, the game runs smoothly, but for some unknown reason they used all the engineering and artwork to make a 2D platformer.Gameplay itself is where the game lets you down - 2D platformer with limited ""fighting"" (button mashing like a console gamer does).   Bonus thumbs down for prompting you to give them even more money for their DLC on the front screen of the game. If you really love console ports, 2D platformers, or games for children, this would be a good choice.  But it's most certainly not aimed at PC gamers.			"

												Really mediocre platformer with low cellshading and a mass of bugs that hinders gameplay - even to the point where you have to restart a level. It's also very easy, as it's enough to run forward and just mash attack button to cut through all opponents. What's more it's difficult to die from environmental traps. There's no much instant death spikes and stuff like that and if you stop for a second, you will automatically regain health to max. I had trouble to make achievement for dying 9 times on the same level. Game is very short (3-4 hours) and it's plot is random gibberish with really badly written dialogues. Where it was supposed to be funny, it makes you cringe. Even if you are a furfag, you won't find anything interesting in here. Overall very, very uinteresting title.			"

												Iffy controls and movements, a difficulty curve so gentle it's basically a plateau, gameplay and story both simple as dishwater. And the game can only be played in the same language as your OS, which is really annoying. The usual problem with licensed games, perhaps?Still it has a nice atmosphere, reminiscent of the PSX era of action games like Rockman Dash, and bright colorful visuals with some cute interface gimmicks. If that much is worth $10 to you (or you're a fan of the original webcomic) go right ahead. There are better games available for that much though, believe it or not.EDIT: Since last I checked this game got a big price markdown, which is far more reasonable now.

												I didn't beat this game yet, so take this with a grain of salt (or not, if you're hypertense)This is a cool platformer. In it, you control this cat girl with a giant floating blade and slash the enemies with combos that involve pressing the slash button very fast. The levels are gigantic and there's lots of hidden stuff. You can see the developers put some good effort into this game. The gameplay is decent. Not awesomely spetacular, but it's quite playable.The characters are, like, ugh, sooooooooooo obnoxious. I mean, c'mon! The way they all speak is sooooooooo annoying. Their quips are irritating and it feels like the characters are trying hard to sound like teenagers (which isn't even a good thing to aim for, if you ask me). You'll feel cringe at some parts of the game that aren't gameplay related.Still, it's a good game. It's still receiving updates from the developers and all, so it's not an abandoned project.

												Hmm. Blade Kitten looked interesting at first glance, but it wasn't able to keep up with that first impression. The story as far as I played was non-existent other than chasing a blonde girl just to exchange insults when you catch up so she can run off again. That's it. No reason, no explanation, no world-building whatsoever. It's a catgirl with a sword chopping up lots of generic guards. I wasn't expecting a literary marvel but come on I at least want some kind of plot thread that's not out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon.The combat did not gel with me either. Combat for the most part consists of swinging the sword, and having it blocked, or trying to swing the sword and getting stunlocked by two enemies kicking you repeatedly. I looked at the Blade menu and found out the swords had stats, but they don't seem to do anything. I bought the Grengis which had near max stats in all categories except Recharge, while boasting that it would break through any defense. Hah, no. No change at all in combat. I still get blocked and kicked and stabbed. It also doesn't help that everything is extremely floaty, so there's no feeling of solid control. More like I'm sliding around and slashing haphazardly.All in all I don't recommend Blade Kitten. There's nothing worth playing here unless you really happen to like pink-haired catgirls that the game tries to tell you is a top-tier bounty hunter with a serious face.			"

												I think this game is missunderstood as I did when I bought it with high anticipation. No it doesn't provide a solid experience like EWJ, Rayman or Spyro.But it is a good platform game, with it's own unique style and approach.+ Grahics are good so are effects+ Nice music and very good sound effects+ Nice voice acting+ Funny, light mooded and fun+ Adorable character+ Item management is simple and just WORKS. No 100 items or weapons to choose from, but enough to make you consider a weapon or upgrade.- Story does not always convince, jumping from here to their and some choices feel out of place.- Misses some emotion.Some of the serious events are taken up to light heartidly while I would find it more then acceptable either for a human or a half cat lady to be completely enraged or even heartbroken. And that doesn't happen at any point. Yes she gets a bit angry, but that to me is not approriate enough when someone blows up your ship worth a whole bunch of money and stranding you on a planet. Or even introducing a homocidal alien race that whiped out her people and will not stop till they have consumed all, and then being a bit angry but determined. But maybe I'm just not understanding the art style here and is Kitt Balard just more of a badass then I can understand.Let me finish saying this game to does more then enough well for me to have played through it multiple times; first in linear story mode, then to try and get all the bonusses (time trials, items and costumes).And that says something about a 'mere' platformer.

												I catch hell from people who say I bought the game because of the furry anime catgirl thing.  I can't totally deny that, but I will say that I was pretty surpised at how much fun I had with the game.  It harks back to the 80s Nintendo platformers, like Bionic Commando and Contra, but with an updated cell-shaded look.  The levels are large enough and have a little bit of non-linearity that adds a surprising amount of replay value.  I only caution that, like the Nintendo Platformers, you can't play this with a keyboard.  You MUST play this with a gamepad. "

												First thing you gotta understand: This is a manly game for manly men. If you want to get lost in some (mostly)technical gameplay while feasting your eyes on pretty colors;  You should buy Blade Kitten. It is entirely possible to just breeze on through the levels, but you would be missing all of the precision platforming that comes with exploration(and secrets).  While seemingly marketed to girls(her one-liners cause a cringe here and there), this is clearly a collector's game with charming animations for the patient individual.			"

Not rage inducing, fun game physics, cool  likeable characters, tons of secrets, uplifting cheery music and brightly lit but yet calming colored environments.

												Updated: Surprisingly good game, I didn’t think it was this good, considering the little attention this game gets. Not too long but it’s a bit more than twice as long as Trine 1. Awesome gameplay, it mixes a somewhat 360º platform gameplay (you can climb walls and ceilings), Trinity (Matrix)-like and cat movements (the jumps are awesome). The story and soundtrack are good, the levels are huge, and the voice acting is very good.			"

												It's a pretty standard action platformer in which you get to climb walls and ceilings. The control options on computer all do not feel that great / consistent when playing. Furthermore it happens a lot that 2.5d terrain obstructs vision and it's not always instantly clear what belongs to the actual level and what doesn't. Also, the control options for keyboard are not explained in the out-of-game tutorial section, so it's definitely a port lacking there. The music is boring and gets a little annoying. I didn't like this one too much.			"

												Whether your a fan of classic sidescrollers or just love cute japanese anime cat girls, this is the game for you. This game is one of the best sidescrollers I've played in years. Very nice change of pace from the usual bloody First Person Shooters I normally play. The game  has a fun, lighthearted storyline. Gameplay is action packed with a lot of hidden stuff to look for and very well designed levels. The graphics are great(as long as your into cell shaded animation.) I do reccommend playing this with a gamepad instead of keyboard/mouse if you have the option, ithe controls came a lot more natural to me that way despite the fact I use mouse/KB for almost every other game I play on PC.

												Ok, quick rough and dirty explanation for how this plays using examples:Imagine Megaman Zero, Donkey Kong, Contra Hard Corps. , Metal Gear Rising if it were 2D, and Prince of Persia.I plan on coming back to give a more elaborate review when I play episode 2 (it's got like a Half-Life thing going on). Now for what I was able to type up after playing:Whatever you consider it a mix of, it's a pretty fun game. I did not intend to sink 4 hours in one sitting playing it. Combat is fast paced, level design is really interesting and rewards exploring. Some levels have multiple routes, or just multiple ways to traverse a route. Plenty of secrets (in the form of chests), a handful of unlockable upgrades and weapons (but nothing too deep), and even unlockable costumes, some of which look really neat.However, despite me really enjoying it and reccomending it, the list of flaws is bigger than the list of benefits, but they're very minor flaws.The game isn't the most polished. For instance, cutscenes and scripted segments act strange when just coming from certain gameplay moments (enemies will move and attack but wont hurt you), and the way it restarts cutscenes if you died shortly after is a bit annoying. There's also some design hiccups in some parts. The game doesn't tell you about all the mechanics in the already unhelpful tutorial. In fact, the game will instruct you about shield breaking (hold down B against enemies with sheilds) while you're fighting the last boss (of episode 1). There are other mechanics you will have to find out on your own because the game doesn't even allude to them, such as jumping from a wall while sticking to it with your sword, to name one. I reccomend just trying to experiement with the controls and then move on from the first level. About more superficial complaints, let me start by saying the story leaves much to be desired. We're given no background about the main character, her rival, the world, what a ""breaker"" is, and the general lore. However, there is a comic that goes along with it, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Though it's not a big deal because of what story there is, it's really only on par with, say, Sonic Adventure 1 (at least this doesn't have plot holes out the ♥♥♥). About the main character, there are things likable about her: She's cute, she has personality,her character is established fairly, and her voice acting is decent. Everything else isn't that great. She can be annoying, has the charisma of a teenage girl, has a vocabulary that contains the words ""Epic Fail"", and often times says other stupid things. As for the game's graphics, just pretend this is a port of a PS2 game with upscaled graphics and you'll have no complaints. In fact, the game was made by the same devs as ""T.Y. Tasmanian Tiger"", a 'we too' attempt at making an animal mascot on the PS2. Though let's just say this game redeems them.Like I said, all of those complaints are very minor compared to this game's stengths, and you should check it out if you like action platformers. Not only does Episode 1 go for less than 2 dollars during any holiday sale, theres a demo. It's just this game might be a turn off at first, but if you keep with it, you will like it for sure.Another thing worth mentioning is that it's fairly short, about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay, depending. This is because this game was going to be released in parts, but part 2 never came for the longest time untill some time in 2015, 5 years after the initial release. Aparantly there was some legal dispute. Either way, the amount of gameplay for 2 bucks during a sale is a good buy, and there is some replay value. As of writing this, I don't know what episode 2 brings to the table, but I'm sure it's more or less the same thing, just more of it.			"

												5/10While I'm giving this game a negative review I wanted it to be known that I do like the game and I really didn't notice these issues as glaringly until I when acheivement hunting. There are two main complains I have, the controls and the level design. I'll start with the controls even tho they are rather small issues.I played with a gamepad and it worked rather smoothly other than a few occasions where I couldn't jump for some reason in a platformer this is a rather large issue but as quickly as the came they pass I could honestly blame the controller as much as the game for this but it happened enough that I began to notice it. Other than that the controls worked like a charm on a controller. Level Design 1:This is my biggest complain, upon speed running the game (90 minutes or under) I noticed that everything in the game seemed more likely to be placed there simply to slow you down rather than for a functional reason. Example being on a level where you ride a mount across roughly open fields with some ruins you have to jump or break through you come to a area where you have to dismount and turn off a set of pipes dropping sludge down into a mesh covered hole then get back on the mount and continue on. On my first play through I gave it little though but upon replaying it I found myself asking why it was even there. the pipes seemed to just come fromm the sky and pour into a hole in the ground, even accepting sky pipes pumping down to the empty field why did I have to entire this waystation turn it off (not even a minute spent in the area mind you) other than to get by it which I could easily have just stepped 2 feet infront of it and bypassed it completely. After this I noticed it more and more in other levels where they did the same thing at one point later in the same level you get off your mount to clear a obstacles and the mount literally enters the foreground and runs off so once you finish the little minute long section its waiting for you on the other side. Being that you have no pactical reason to not just skip that entire area like your mount just did. Level Design 2:There is a level where you have to jump across a sludge river (lack of a better term) by jumping from one pole to the next, the area warns you it has instadeath. Upon falling in the sludge I found myself taking damage but not insta death Which lead me to question why I'm running from the pipe dropping it that is progressing after me. Out of curiousity I jumped into it and insta died. My only real problem when this is why is it that only the falling sludge insta deaths me, its the same sludge on the ground as falling but the ground sludge is just a damage over time effect. Shouldn't both have either instadeath or dot damage?Level Design 3:As with complain number 1 tasks seem forced at more than one point you have to time laser crossings but they are along major paths that every day works and soldiers would be using which leads me to ask why they practically exist there? I know I'm probably thing too much into it but at one point there is a laser cannon on a workers path way aimed at a guard station so that if you trip a alarm you can activate it to have it cut down the gaurds exitting the guard station. Why would  the guards allow them to set that up there?Level Design 4:There are very few of these but they are annoying, megaman wall jump sections. The couple I found gave me trouble which is probably why I disliked them but once again why are they needed? You can climb on almost everything in the game stucking to extremes in some cases. In all these areas they are ""metal pipes"" yet earlier and later in the same level you can climb other metal pipes just fine. I'm not seeing why these few (probably under 5) even exist other than to slow you down. Level Design 5:This is a akward one because I liked it at first. The games combat can be daunting even difficult until you release its pointless. On my first play through of stage 1 I fought every enemy I explored every nook and cranny it took me almost as long to beat this first level as it did for the entire speed run (55 minutes of 90) Did I enjoy it yes and found that it seemed like it was either a super long stage or there it didn't have stages and the ""check points"" (nicely placed I might add) were its way of saving. Upon speed running it I found if I just leaped over the enemies and didn't take too many wrong turns I could complete the level in 6-9 minutes (almost all the levels except the 2 that can be beaten in under 3 minutes) Which leads me back to level design 1 above. The enemies and combat system and nice, although they are basically red ranged soldier, red melee soldier, white ranged soldier, and white melee soldier (with a couple exceptions). Once I realised you didn't have any real need to fight them I questioned there existance, but they do actually pertain to the plot and seem to fit the world nicely. Which leads me to ask why then didn't they just make the force fights? That you couldn't progress until you fought atleast some of the enemies. I ran into only 3-5 of these which can mostly be skipped by not setting off a alarm. The 3 bosses where fun to fight and made me appericate the work the put into them to make them so different and have special ways to beat them. tl:dr I know people will say i'm over thinking it or what fun is a game without obstacles in your path, things to make you go out of your way to do. I understand this and accept it its just in this game every time one of these is placed there it seems almost glaringly so just to hinder the player rather than to fuctionally exist in there world as well. After I started to notice all of this I started looking at the game completely differently. I still enjoy the game and will buy episode 2. So i'm not saying Run away and don't play this game. I actually like it.			"

Some of you might say ""Oh she just a Neko Girl for weeaboos"" Guys seriously? i heard more hateful things than that, And by the way Haters use something else that isn't boring to hear.100/10 Very Awesome Game			"

												Well, finally beat Blade Kitten, gotta say the wait for episode 2 was worth it. I played this game back on the console, sadly without episode 2 it feels incomplete. But anyway, the story is you play as Kit Ballard, a Felion Breaker (Bounty Hunter(tress)) who gets her breaker key (basically like an ID card) stolen by ehr rival, Justice Kreel. What follows starts from a simple search for the key to an all out conspiracy with factions and an ancient alien force Kit is familiar with.The game is a 2.5 D platformer, and it's pretty enjoyable, when you get past a few bugs it's got with platforming. Besides that the game is fun. After a long wait, we got our episode 2, and boy did it wrap it up, it felt a bit rushed, but given the fact they never got the chance to release the complete game due to legal reasons and the team shrank as a result, I can kinda understand the reason.But the game is done, and it has a lot of colelctables for me to still get, guess i won't be done with Hollow Wish just yet. If you want a fun platformer, i say get this and episode 2 of the game to finish it off. Plus the more people who buy it, one day we'll get the complete game on consoles, so please, get it if you want a fun game.			"

												The controls are not solid, the game is buggy, the Kit is a one-dimensional, and the story of the first doesn't make any sense.That said, I still enjoyed this game. Perhaps in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. The sword fighting mechanic is unique from my knowledge. And it's totally worth it at this price.			"

												I bought both the basic game and the Episode 2 DLC at a discount, and I find that the game overall is worth it. I like the art style very much. The characters seem interesting, though the main character is a little annoying at times, but unfortunately they're not explored much in the game storyline. As for the game itself, I like the variety of actions offered by the game mechanics. The level design also includes some decisions that reduces potential frustrations in this type of game. For example, in most places there's no ""instant death"" due to a jump miscalculation, and there's aiming aid for jumping in some of the narrower platforms. I feel that this, combined with some aspects of the game mechanics (e.g. ability to climb walls, health that regenerates after a while) encourage exploration.There are some parts of the game that can be improved though. For starter, movement constantly feel as if the player character is on the verge of sliding. Enemies and early levels feel repetitive, and towards the end of Episode 2 there's a sudden increase of instant death possibilities, which is IMHO an annoying change. I also don't really like the way boss fights are implemented, with only one ""correct"" way to cause damage. I hope these aspects can be improved in future games in this series.			"

												Are you a furry fan? Do you want to run in 2d and slash through generic enemies DMC style all the way through the game? And with CoD like health regen and unlimited* energy? And more importantly are you a cat person? If all of your answers are yes then I don't know what to make of you. But I do know this: THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. Run through a meticulously designed map and fight against generic enemies. Thoug hyou might get tired of the endless troops that looks the same the maps offer a dellicious brain food that requires you to keep your brains on throughout the game ensures that you will remain engage in an intellectual battle agains the puzzles this game can offer to you gamers (though a fast reflex and reaction time maybe necessary). Other than a generic but endurable gameplay it gives a light plot (story) that is easy to digest but entertaining enough that you won't get bored of the story. Well what are you waiting for grab this game now! Or wait for it to go on sale up to you.			"

												I got the main game free, but I paid for Episode 2 and the other bits. Well, here goes...To start, it's not a very complicated game, but it isn't too simplistic either. It has a really nice balance that works for the world, allowing you to appreciate everything. It really seems to draw on older sidescrolling games, which is a lot of great fun if you enjoy those like I do!  Sadly it's only recently I've truly been able to appreciate the game and really play it, as I finally have a computer that isn't total crap.The characters are funny, quirky, and just overall really good. There's more to them than meets the eye when you first see them. I've got a bit of a crush on Kit, I must admit. It's not often I see a female lead, and less so one that really captures my interest for being just a really good character. Flirtatious, sarcastic, but also sympathetic, she really does come across as human (or Felion, rather? Haha) and not just a robot or there to show off 80 percent of her skin. But don't let that fool you, she's still sexy and she knows it! (worth noting: I am also very happy because unlike some games where I find the voice acting to be very wooden, this has a lot of ""character"" in it.)The only thing that makes me sad is that the game overall is a bit shorter than I hoped. But that just means I really enjoyed it and I want more of it, so don't take that as a complaint, per se.To conclude: It's a REALLY fun game, with some pretty great replay value, in my own humble opinion. Though I got this for free, if I could pay for it I would! It's worth the price, it really is.			"

												this game is a lot of fun but has its bugs and plain irritating game mechanics. I finished it in 14 hours but I have quite a lot left to go back and find.I love the characters (have not read the comics but I now intend to), the light-hearted humor that doesn't destroy the parts that were more dramatic, the music, the vaguely nostalgic feel of a late 90's style platformer. I liked being able to  jump and wall-climb pretty much anywhere, making the levels a nice open map. it sort of reminded me of Strider but with cute catgirls, and *everything* is better with cute catgirls! making the collectables a currency for upgrades and vanity items was a good choice.I did encounter a couple of bugs: a cut scene failed to trigger for me, making me have to restart a section, and I also managed to fall through the world. the controls could be awkward at times, a sequence of buttons refusing to activate because I got the timing a split second off, or me not being able to tell the difference between traversable and non-traversable territory.  the final boss with its incredibly fiddly mechanic that didn't trigger half the time was a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially as it kept suddenly refusing to attack me, making it hard to bait. these bugs don't make it unplayable, just a bit irritating at times, and I think the good parts make up for it, especially as the game is cheap and constantly in sales.

												5/10While I'm giving this game a negative review I wanted it to be known that I do like the game and I really didn't notice these issues as glaringly until I when acheivement hunting. There are two main complains I have, the controls and the level design. I'll start with the controls even tho they are rather small issues.I played with a gamepad and it worked rather smoothly other than a few occasions where I couldn't jump for some reason in a platformer this is a rather large issue but as quickly as the came they pass I could honestly blame the controller as much as the game for this but it happened enough that I began to notice it. Other than that the controls worked like a charm on a controller. Level Design 1:This is my biggest complain, upon speed running the game (90 minutes or under) I noticed that everything in the game seemed more likely to be placed there simply to slow you down rather than for a functional reason. Example being on a level where you ride a mount across roughly open fields with some ruins you have to jump or break through you come to a area where you have to dismount and turn off a set of pipes dropping sludge down into a mesh covered hole then get back on the mount and continue on. On my first play through I gave it little though but upon replaying it I found myself asking why it was even there. the pipes seemed to just come fromm the sky and pour into a hole in the ground, even accepting sky pipes pumping down to the empty field why did I have to entire this waystation turn it off (not even a minute spent in the area mind you) other than to get by it which I could easily have just stepped 2 feet infront of it and bypassed it completely. After this I noticed it more and more in other levels where they did the same thing at one point later in the same level you get off your mount to clear a obstacles and the mount literally enters the foreground and runs off so once you finish the little minute long section its waiting for you on the other side. Being that you have no pactical reason to not just skip that entire area like your mount just did. Level Design 2:There is a level where you have to jump across a sludge river (lack of a better term) by jumping from one pole to the next, the area warns you it has instadeath. Upon falling in the sludge I found myself taking damage but not insta death Which lead me to question why I'm running from the pipe dropping it that is progressing after me. Out of curiousity I jumped into it and insta died. My only real problem when this is why is it that only the falling sludge insta deaths me, its the same sludge on the ground as falling but the ground sludge is just a damage over time effect. Shouldn't both have either instadeath or dot damage?Level Design 3:As with complain number 1 tasks seem forced at more than one point you have to time laser crossings but they are along major paths that every day works and soldiers would be using which leads me to ask why they practically exist there? I know I'm probably thing too much into it but at one point there is a laser cannon on a workers path way aimed at a guard station so that if you trip a alarm you can activate it to have it cut down the gaurds exitting the guard station. Why would  the guards allow them to set that up there?Level Design 4:There are very few of these but they are annoying, megaman wall jump sections. The couple I found gave me trouble which is probably why I disliked them but once again why are they needed? You can climb on almost everything in the game stucking to extremes in some cases. In all these areas they are ""metal pipes"" yet earlier and later in the same level you can climb other metal pipes just fine. I'm not seeing why these few (probably under 5) even exist other than to slow you down. Level Design 5:This is a akward one because I liked it at first. The games combat can be daunting even difficult until you release its pointless. On my first play through of stage 1 I fought every enemy I explored every nook and cranny it took me almost as long to beat this first level as it did for the entire speed run (55 minutes of 90) Did I enjoy it yes and found that it seemed like it was either a super long stage or there it didn't have stages and the ""check points"" (nicely placed I might add) were its way of saving. Upon speed running it I found if I just leaped over the enemies and didn't take too many wrong turns I could complete the level in 6-9 minutes (almost all the levels except the 2 that can be beaten in under 3 minutes) Which leads me back to level design 1 above. The enemies and combat system and nice, although they are basically red ranged soldier, red melee soldier, white ranged soldier, and white melee soldier (with a couple exceptions). Once I realised you didn't have any real need to fight them I questioned there existance, but they do actually pertain to the plot and seem to fit the world nicely. Which leads me to ask why then didn't they just make the force fights? That you couldn't progress until you fought atleast some of the enemies. I ran into only 3-5 of these which can mostly be skipped by not setting off a alarm. The 3 bosses where fun to fight and made me appericate the work the put into them to make them so different and have special ways to beat them. tl:dr I know people will say i'm over thinking it or what fun is a game without obstacles in your path, things to make you go out of your way to do. I understand this and accept it its just in this game every time one of these is placed there it seems almost glaringly so just to hinder the player rather than to fuctionally exist in there world as well. After I started to notice all of this I started looking at the game completely differently. I still enjoy the game and will buy episode 2. So i'm not saying Run away and don't play this game. I actually like it.			"

												Amazing gameplay!(though a story that's a little hard to follow).The combat is decent, and the level design gives you a lot of freedom to explore(and there's a lot of treasures to find).It's also really fun to be able to climb on most of the ceilings and walls(and it helps add a lot of depth to exploration and puzzles).The final boss can be a little finicky, and the final level has a few tricky to navigate areas, but other than those the game is a good medium difficulty.

												So, the game consists of two episodes. The first episode is great, because they let you explore the levels without hurry and find all the secrets (which are plenty). But the second one has two problems: infinite enemies and too many instances where you have to just run forward non-stop, because something is chasing you. This leaves no time for exploration, which is sad, because there are things to collect, but you just can't do it properly being constantly under attack by groups of enemies.So I suggest playing the first episode and skipping the second one unless you want to know how the story concludes.

												A charming platformer with a nice presentation, although the gameplay can get tiresome. Great game for some mindless platforming every now and again.Not quite the next MegaMan in platforming. It does offer some nonlinear level design, not quite to the extent of Metroid or Castlevania, but you don't feel forced to constantly head right (unless you want to).Some bits can be frustrating and the story's not noteworthy (in fact, it can be a bit uninspired and leaves on an abrupt cliffhanger). It's planned to be released episodically, this being the first episode.Worth the fifteen bucks for me, but some may want to wait for a price drop before buying. Especially if they're planning on getting into all the episodes.			"

												The game looks fun and has a cool name like ""Blade Kitten."" But don't let it fool you, the controls are floaty and hard to use, voice-acting does not match with mouth movements and is generally very badly done. The combat in most cases doesn't work since you're blade GOES THROUGH the enemies. I found myself spamming the attack button just to see that no damage was administered and they had no shields up which some enemies have. The antagonist seems to have no other purpose to be a bad guy and does not have any other redeeming qualities. As a platforming fan who loves almost any action platformer in the world, this one truly goes on my very small sh*t list.			"

												No a bad game, if you like this type of game. I found it to be very entertaining and really enjoyed playing it. The only thing I didn't like was the ""flat screen"" feel the game has. I like third person games and especailly those that are 360 in scope. It allows you character to explorer the enviroment a bit more and, if the game maker is smart, he will enable some ways to do this. Don't get me wrong, this game as really great to play, but I found myself more than one time trying to get to objects in the rear of the screen or the front of it, off plane from where the character was. It appears that you should be able to and maybe I've not played enough yet, but I found it disappointing. I also ran into trouble at times trying to figure out how to get off one section to another as I'd forget that I couldn't just walk to the background or foreground and find a way around.  All that said, it's a lot of fun to figure out how to move around in an enviroment where you must go left or right or up or down but not forward or backward! Some of he puzzles are very well done and require a good bit of figuring out to solve. I also like the character you must control as she fun to watch. Overall, this isn't a bad game and provides a good bit of fun playing!			"

												(Sorry If my english is bad, I'm not a native speaker :))So what do I think about this game ?I think this game is so underrated, and I've seen people that call themselves ""critics"" writing disgusting reviews To begin with, yes this game isn't perfect, it is sometimes buggy (talking about the physics) ,the camera sometimes is a little ... ""strange"" and the music isn't in my opinion the best .But why do I recommend this game ?Because I love the combat system in this game even if it takes a while to get used to. There are many different ways to attack (including a ""slam attack"" kinda like the one in rayman legends) , shielding etc...The story is good, not great but not bad, and the characters you encounter during your journey are charming.But what actually retain my attention are the graphics (character design, environment ,ambiance etc...) which remembers me old sf comics (thinking about Valerian and Laureline if you want to know :3) and even for today's standards seems pretty good. The characters are pretty stylish, colorful and got their own voice acting, and the levels got a pretty good atmoshpere.As for the platforming, basically Kit Ballard, the main character, can climb pretty much every thing, you can wall jump, run ,double jump, you have to resolve some puzzle etc ... nothing new, a little bit to easy, but still effective and fast paced.So , to recap, Blade kitten isn't the best 2D platformer I've ever seen, but it's not the worst and definitely worth the price.PS : oh and did I forget to say that Kit is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cute :3			"

												First thing you gotta understand: This is a manly game for manly men. If you want to get lost in some (mostly)technical gameplay while feasting your eyes on pretty colors;  You should buy Blade Kitten. It is entirely possible to just breeze on through the levels, but you would be missing all of the precision platforming that comes with exploration(and secrets).  While seemingly marketed to girls(her one-liners cause a cringe here and there), this is clearly a collector's game with charming animations for the patient individual.			"

												This is only part 1 of the blade kitten series. It is worth purchasing especially since it has an awsome story-line, Cell Shaded graphics that add to this epic game. It is also in third-person. There are hidden items that you can go find to get unlocks, more credits, or special outfits to have your feline character to wear!I personally recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something new!

												Great game, I like it because there's a lot of intricate secrets that you can explore. I also like how the levels are really complex, sometimes to the point where I wish I had a map to refer to. There’s fun in the intricate moves you do with the blade along with getting to places. The graphics aren’t that great. Kinda seems like it's for girls. I’d give it an 8/10.			"

												Catgirl Game! Catgirl Game!!Having said that, why should one play this game: The title music is great, full Voice Over, have only found 2 bugs so far (one minor, one made me die, again), and because the game mechanics are quite fun. (I like how Kit can climb up walls, hang on the ceiling etc and the resulting freedom of movement)And did I mention she's a cat girl?EDIT: Episode 2 is out.And I still think that Blade Kitten is a good game. Admittedly if you are searching for a game where absolute precision jumping and complex combos are on the menue, well, not here (or I haven't found it yet). So, Episode 2: Played 1/2h, as expected some new game mechanics, more content (duh) and the plot starting to thicken (things get storywise more interesting). And I got a comic to read!			"

												A mostly good game.Sure, it is somewhat floaty, and I've encountered a glitch or two, the combat generally isn't great, but I love this game.The graphics are a nice faux anime mixed with their own distinct style. All in what I think is cel-shading, though I could be wrong about the that. The battles tend to come down to button mashing, but that doesn't get in the way of fun as it's mostly a platformer, and a pretty great one, focusing highly on treasure collection, and if you want, you can jump over and ignore quite a few of the enemies. There are 19 levels, many of which are huge, but if you don't want to explore the first time around, you can get through them pretty quickly and go back later for secrets and treasure.  One thing I haven't seen before in a platformer  is the ability to climb walls, for you see, our protagonist is a catgirl.Of course, treasure collection is pointless without a way to spend treasure, so there's an ingame store that allows you to buy health and stamina upgrades, blades(get the strongest one for the least button mashing) and costumes, all with ingame money of course. This store can be accessed at any time once you've met the owner for the first time. There are a lot of costumes, and I do mean a LOT.The writing is pretty good, even if it does tend to suffer a bit from mood whiplash. The whole thing has a nice, witty sense of humor, especially when the protagonist, Kit Ballard, has to deal with Kreel, except when it's suddenly serious time.I very much reccommend this game. See if you can spot the Ty the Tasmanian Tiger references for extra fun.			"

												Let me start by saying I was wary of this game because I was afraid it was just going to be a ""Oh look an anime girl with cat ears and a tail bouncing around doing vaguely action-y things and saying stuff like ""nyan"" every time she gets hit!!! How cute!!!"". I was so happy to be wrong!I love this game, the acrobatic platforming is so addictive. I love that Kit (the protag) is taken seriously as a character and is still cute and tough while not being turned into a fan-service joke. Some of the problems I had with this game however is that this game has a LOT of controls to keep track of and almost no tutorial. I was playing on keybroad and almost all of the default controls were useless when I first started. I had to manually set all of them, which isn't that big of a deal. (I do strongly recommend playing with a controller though.)Secondly the pacing of the story felt a bit rushed, in the beginning it was hard to keep track of what exactly was happening due to the fact that you're on to the next thing so quickly, the pervious thing was barely explained at all. But such is the life of a galatic bounty hunter I guess.I only experienced one glitch in this game, and it was when you're blowing up the floor to get to a lower level of a temple (level 6 I believe). There was a pillar I couldn't move past, and I thought I had to do something to get it to move, but when I couldn't figure out what that something was (after about 20 minutes of screwing around) I decided to take a break and exitd the game. When I re-entered the game I found I could simply walk past that pillar that I was blocked by before. Turns out it was suppose to be part of the background, but like I said simply restarting the game fixed the problem and it was right after a save point anyway so no loss.Overall:Pro's: fun and addictive platforming, cute cartoony style while still taking the story line seriously and being respectful of all the characters.Con's: pacing felt a bit rushed, default controls are wonky if you're using a keybroad.

												Highly advised to play this game with a controller, as it makes the lousy keyboard/mouse control issues bearable. Control problems aside, it's a solid platformer that should keep you busy for a little while as the levels are massive and take time to explore. VA is surprisingly well done and the environments are full detailed and lively.If you grew up playing Spyro or Crash Bandicoot, then you'll most likely enjoy this game. It's light hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously, so it's fun experience. A wee bit short of a game, but for $9.99, it's hard to complain.			"

												An example of high quality production. The writing for the game is witty and with great humor and care, with great graphics and music. The game has a bunch of interesting traits such exploration for collectibles to increase a completion percentage and a simple, yet functional combat system with moves like controllable angle short range slashes, middle range slashes, low, sliding kick attacks, a jump and dive slash and others that let you adapt to changing circumstances and enemies. it's not slash, slash, slash, jump, slash again. The story presentation is done through animated cutscenes instead of stills or simply the in-game character models. The voice acting is also excellent, which makes for watching them a much more enjoyable experience.The game can feel a bit short, but the amount of unlockables and exploration greatly make this game worthy of revisits and its replayability makes it much more inviting.Give it a good shot. Play the demo or jump straight into the game. This is a game that has much more heart in every piece that comprises it than many other rehashed game entries we see year after year.The second episode has been released in the form of DLC. This adds a few more stages and more achievements, with a final boss that is the right amounts of tricky, difficult and requiring of a proper strategy to defeat. And for the price the game is at, it's almost absurd not to, considering the amount of work that has gone into it. Amply recommended.			"

That's only a problem during cutscenes though.I really don't care about the quality of either and the gameplay physics seemed okay from the vid. And it was cheap.The gameplay physics seem fine, but it's one of those games that don't allow you to use your arrow keys on your controller, thus I cannot play because of my controller having broken joysticks.Alas keyboard works.

												No a bad game, if you like this type of game. I found it to be very entertaining and really enjoyed playing it. The only thing I didn't like was the ""flat screen"" feel the game has. I like third person games and especailly those that are 360 in scope. It allows you character to explorer the enviroment a bit more and, if the game maker is smart, he will enable some ways to do this. Don't get me wrong, this game as really great to play, but I found myself more than one time trying to get to objects in the rear of the screen or the front of it, off plane from where the character was. It appears that you should be able to and maybe I've not played enough yet, but I found it disappointing. I also ran into trouble at times trying to figure out how to get off one section to another as I'd forget that I couldn't just walk to the background or foreground and find a way around.  All that said, it's a lot of fun to figure out how to move around in an enviroment where you must go left or right or up or down but not forward or backward! Some of he puzzles are very well done and require a good bit of figuring out to solve. I also like the character you must control as she fun to watch. Overall, this isn't a bad game and provides a good bit of fun playing!			"

												If you love platformers, yes this is OK game. Not great. Story is somewhat flat and forgettable and this is insanely easy game. For the first hour or two I searched every hole and corner and so on in this game but it gets boring _fast_ so for the rest of the game I just ran it through as fast as I could and kind of hoped that the end was near. There really is not ""real"" bossfights in this game as all of them feel like minibosses at the best and are actually quite boring. So if you're looking for epic fights, skip this.Definitely worth the buy if in sale but 6 euros if almost too much.			"

This game does have some platforming elements in it that will make you lost for a few minutes but you at least have full reign exploration of the area that you are playing in at the time. Some of the enemies have strong defenses, but you can just hop right over them and continue on your journey. Can't wait for Episode 2 to come out.			"

												For the most part I liked this game. The graphics were nice, it was fun, and had good maneuverablility. There was a bunch of stuff to collect and secrets to find. The plot felt odd and jumpy at places. Its a tad buggy. When you're climbing down angled surfaces you'll sometimes slide and that animation will keep playing which sometimes gets you stuck. My only real problem is the difficulty hike on bosses. The rest of the game will be fine but then bosses are just in your face wrecking your sh*t.

It's a colorful, whimsical platformer that shovels throws various various curriences and strange loot in plentiful and accessible 'secret' areas (and with more and more games demanding you to be more skillful in general, I dig this conspicuous change in skill-reward ratio.) For what it's worth, it's not a bad way to spend $5, and while I don't speak for the developers or Steam, this title will likely go on sale eventually			"

												I originally played Blade Kitten Episode 1 on the Playstation and I bought it again here on Steam, along with Episode 2. As a rule I do not play platform games, yet in this case I made and exception as, I have to admit, I'm a fan of giant sword wielding catgirls...The game is simplistic and easy to get into. They make the gameplay more exciting by giving you the ability to scale walls and ceilings, opening up the possibility for more hidden treasures and motivating you to explore every nook and cranny of every level.Combat is a bit limited, as 99% of all your fights will be to keep your head down and charge into your enemies wildly mashing the one button. Then you also have long attack, drop attack and slide attack.The story may seem a bit convoluted as if the writers tried to make up the for lack of depth with complexity.Because it's a simple game your expectations will not be high. But then the game seems so much better. My only criticism will be the last two levels... I HATE instant death traps!! Here I feel the writers were feeling vindictive for some reason and decided to take it out on the players. Yes, the boss fight should be challenging, but the annoyance level should never overshoot the challenge level because of cheap deaths.Otherwise I can heartily recommend this game for a feel good game experience.

												I got the main game free, but I paid for Episode 2 and the other bits. Well, here goes...To start, it's not a very complicated game, but it isn't too simplistic either. It has a really nice balance that works for the world, allowing you to appreciate everything. It really seems to draw on older sidescrolling games, which is a lot of great fun if you enjoy those like I do!  Sadly it's only recently I've truly been able to appreciate the game and really play it, as I finally have a computer that isn't total crap.The characters are funny, quirky, and just overall really good. There's more to them than meets the eye when you first see them. I've got a bit of a crush on Kit, I must admit. It's not often I see a female lead, and less so one that really captures my interest for being just a really good character. Flirtatious, sarcastic, but also sympathetic, she really does come across as human (or Felion, rather? Haha) and not just a robot or there to show off 80 percent of her skin. But don't let that fool you, she's still sexy and she knows it! (worth noting: I am also very happy because unlike some games where I find the voice acting to be very wooden, this has a lot of ""character"" in it.)The only thing that makes me sad is that the game overall is a bit shorter than I hoped. But that just means I really enjoyed it and I want more of it, so don't take that as a complaint, per se.To conclude: It's a REALLY fun game, with some pretty great replay value, in my own humble opinion. Though I got this for free, if I could pay for it I would! It's worth the price, it really is.			"

												Well, finally beat Blade Kitten, gotta say the wait for episode 2 was worth it. I played this game back on the console, sadly without episode 2 it feels incomplete. But anyway, the story is you play as Kit Ballard, a Felion Breaker (Bounty Hunter(tress)) who gets her breaker key (basically like an ID card) stolen by ehr rival, Justice Kreel. What follows starts from a simple search for the key to an all out conspiracy with factions and an ancient alien force Kit is familiar with.The game is a 2.5 D platformer, and it's pretty enjoyable, when you get past a few bugs it's got with platforming. Besides that the game is fun. After a long wait, we got our episode 2, and boy did it wrap it up, it felt a bit rushed, but given the fact they never got the chance to release the complete game due to legal reasons and the team shrank as a result, I can kinda understand the reason.But the game is done, and it has a lot of colelctables for me to still get, guess i won't be done with Hollow Wish just yet. If you want a fun platformer, i say get this and episode 2 of the game to finish it off. Plus the more people who buy it, one day we'll get the complete game on consoles, so please, get it if you want a fun game.			"

												I bought both the basic game and the Episode 2 DLC at a discount, and I find that the game overall is worth it. I like the art style very much. The characters seem interesting, though the main character is a little annoying at times, but unfortunately they're not explored much in the game storyline. As for the game itself, I like the variety of actions offered by the game mechanics. The level design also includes some decisions that reduces potential frustrations in this type of game. For example, in most places there's no ""instant death"" due to a jump miscalculation, and there's aiming aid for jumping in some of the narrower platforms. I feel that this, combined with some aspects of the game mechanics (e.g. ability to climb walls, health that regenerates after a while) encourage exploration.There are some parts of the game that can be improved though. For starter, movement constantly feel as if the player character is on the verge of sliding. Enemies and early levels feel repetitive, and towards the end of Episode 2 there's a sudden increase of instant death possibilities, which is IMHO an annoying change. I also don't really like the way boss fights are implemented, with only one ""correct"" way to cause damage. I hope these aspects can be improved in future games in this series.			"

												Based on the popular webcomic of the same name, Blade Kitten is a rare gem that is completely under-appreciated by the gaming community... Spactacular graphics, awesome sound, an addictive storyline and brilliant gameplay make this one of most favorite games, Blade Kitten is most certainly worth every last cent and my only complaint is that at the time of writing, Blade Kitten is not yet available for Linux-based operating systems (such as SteamOS and Ubuntu) - for this reason alone, I cannot recommend this game at this time.Should Blade Kitten become available to Linux-based operating systems however, I will surely update my review accordingly...

												No a bad game, if you like this type of game. I found it to be very entertaining and really enjoyed playing it. The only thing I didn't like was the ""flat screen"" feel the game has. I like third person games and especailly those that are 360 in scope. It allows you character to explorer the enviroment a bit more and, if the game maker is smart, he will enable some ways to do this. Don't get me wrong, this game as really great to play, but I found myself more than one time trying to get to objects in the rear of the screen or the front of it, off plane from where the character was. It appears that you should be able to and maybe I've not played enough yet, but I found it disappointing. I also ran into trouble at times trying to figure out how to get off one section to another as I'd forget that I couldn't just walk to the background or foreground and find a way around.  All that said, it's a lot of fun to figure out how to move around in an enviroment where you must go left or right or up or down but not forward or backward! Some of he puzzles are very well done and require a good bit of figuring out to solve. I also like the character you must control as she fun to watch. Overall, this isn't a bad game and provides a good bit of fun playing!			"

												(Sorry If my english is bad, I'm not a native speaker :))So what do I think about this game ?I think this game is so underrated, and I've seen people that call themselves ""critics"" writing disgusting reviews To begin with, yes this game isn't perfect, it is sometimes buggy (talking about the physics) ,the camera sometimes is a little ... ""strange"" and the music isn't in my opinion the best .But why do I recommend this game ?Because I love the combat system in this game even if it takes a while to get used to. There are many different ways to attack (including a ""slam attack"" kinda like the one in rayman legends) , shielding etc...The story is good, not great but not bad, and the characters you encounter during your journey are charming.But what actually retain my attention are the graphics (character design, environment ,ambiance etc...) which remembers me old sf comics (thinking about Valerian and Laureline if you want to know :3) and even for today's standards seems pretty good. The characters are pretty stylish, colorful and got their own voice acting, and the levels got a pretty good atmoshpere.As for the platforming, basically Kit Ballard, the main character, can climb pretty much every thing, you can wall jump, run ,double jump, you have to resolve some puzzle etc ... nothing new, a little bit to easy, but still effective and fast paced.So , to recap, Blade kitten isn't the best 2D platformer I've ever seen, but it's not the worst and definitely worth the price.PS : oh and did I forget to say that Kit is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cute :3			"

												this game is a lot of fun but has its bugs and plain irritating game mechanics. I finished it in 14 hours but I have quite a lot left to go back and find.I love the characters (have not read the comics but I now intend to), the light-hearted humor that doesn't destroy the parts that were more dramatic, the music, the vaguely nostalgic feel of a late 90's style platformer. I liked being able to  jump and wall-climb pretty much anywhere, making the levels a nice open map. it sort of reminded me of Strider but with cute catgirls, and *everything* is better with cute catgirls! making the collectables a currency for upgrades and vanity items was a good choice.I did encounter a couple of bugs: a cut scene failed to trigger for me, making me have to restart a section, and I also managed to fall through the world. the controls could be awkward at times, a sequence of buttons refusing to activate because I got the timing a split second off, or me not being able to tell the difference between traversable and non-traversable territory.  the final boss with its incredibly fiddly mechanic that didn't trigger half the time was a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially as it kept suddenly refusing to attack me, making it hard to bait. these bugs don't make it unplayable, just a bit irritating at times, and I think the good parts make up for it, especially as the game is cheap and constantly in sales.

												For the most part I liked this game. The graphics were nice, it was fun, and had good maneuverablility. There was a bunch of stuff to collect and secrets to find. The plot felt odd and jumpy at places. Its a tad buggy. When you're climbing down angled surfaces you'll sometimes slide and that animation will keep playing which sometimes gets you stuck. My only real problem is the difficulty hike on bosses. The rest of the game will be fine but then bosses are just in your face wrecking your sh*t.

												PROS: Astoundingly well done for the price point. Fully voice acted, fairly good platformer controls. Give you flexibility to play it old school on a controller or do several keyboard+mouse  styles. Plot is... kinda disjointed, but evocative enough, especially with the voice acting.   CONS: It's a little wonky getting used to having your weapon float and learning how to time your attacks so your blade is actually available to launch another attack. Wall climbing is somewhat touchy and more than once I got stuck in a slide or to a wall.  Never permanent, but it happened enough that it makes some of the rapid movement and combat sections somewhat annoying.  Short. Two hours in I had completed more than half of the game. MIXED FEELINGS: Some replayablility to find all the hidden collectibles, but it's no Metroid-vania. You don't revisit areas with new options, you just revisit them to find what you missed.  Despite the tooltips scattered around through the first few levels, They still leave some things out. Go into the options menu and read the manual first, as it also gives you some important context.Overall, I definitely recomend it. It's low cost and it's a fun platformer for the price.  I picked it up on sale for under a dollar, but I'd definitely recommend it, even at the full $3 price tag.			"

												I haven't played much of Blade Kitten so far since I just got it last night but I'm enjoying what I have played. The voice acting is... Well... The voie actors tried at least. And the dialogue is on par with the original Resident Evil game for it's cringe worthy chessiness. The gameplay is pretty good and I like the animation evn if it sometimes looks like the characters don't know how to actually smile. It reminds me of MMD. I got this on sale for $00.98 and was waiting for it to get cheaper before my dad told me it was already a really good deal and I should get it before it went back up in price, so I did. I'd say if you want a decent time killer for cheap, get Blade Kitten.Also, you're a pink haired catgirl bounty hunter who's decent at her job, that should explain the game.			"

The music is on loop, the fighting system is very slow paced (eg. you're stunned whenever you get little damage, with no invincible episode, so if you have 3 enemies around you it's bye bye) and the levels seem unnecessary long and complex.Really would've liked this game :c			"

												I don't quite remember how I got Blade Kitten. Was it in one of the bundles I bought? Or did I buy it specifically because of the name (yes, I am that easy)? I have no idea. But no matter how I got the game, I'm glad I did.While the story is quite simple (and not all that interesting, to be honest), the game has a lot of charm. The quirky protagonist can be funny at times, the levels are visually interesting and just plain pretty and the movement, ooh the movement.I really like when a protagonist can move easily through levels and doesn't get stumped by the smallest walls or drops. (""Oh no, a hedge, I can't possibly LIFT MY LEG OVER IT, can I?"") Blade Kitten is right up my alley. Kitty moves swiftly and with ease, climbing sheer clifs and overhangs like it's just a stretching excercise. The movement feels really fluid and pleasant. It's a joy to play.I have noticed that some reviewers found it difficult to do precise platform-to-platform jumps and complained that the movement is perhaps ""too fluid"". I think that missing some jumps in a platformer game is to be expected ;) I guess it comes down to personal preferences, but it needs to be said that even when you do miss a jump for whatever reason, it's never fatal. You can easily climb back up and try again. This happened to me a few times but it never felt like a chore.On the contrary, I felt such joy playing this game. It's just well-designed and well-made game. It throws new things and toys your way very often, so it always stays fresh. Even Kitty herself can be ""customised"" by buying new costumes. The pacing reminds me of the good old Prehistoric 2. When you got bored with running around and smacking dinosaurs, the game gave you a kite to fly for a whole level or so, which completely changed the dynamic. Blade Kitten's design works similarly and as a consequence never feels dull.One small beef I have with the game is that in later levels it's very easy to get stun-locked between multiple enemies. Kitty, attacked from both sides, sometimes can't escape the onslaught, as there's no one-second-immortality-after-being-hit as in other platformers.One larger beef I have with the game is that it essentially ends nowhere and prompts you to buy Episode 2. I had no idea that what I have is a story-wise incomplete game. It was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to find out just when the story got a bit more interesting. I don't know the reasoning behind the episodic format. Usually, tactics like these make me feel ripped off as a customer. Still, the game on the whole was a joy to play (and both episodes are quite cheap, anyways), so this time, there are no hard feelings.This is the only platformer game I have played end-to-end in just about fifteen years. Because it's just good.			"

												This game is seriously fun and feels very high quality and intelligently made. Polished and fun - keeps me coming back!The combat feels a bit... cheap at first... like, it lacks impact, I guess would be the best way to explain it. Almost like your attacks are going through each other and have no real punch. However, you get used to it quite fast and it kinda works well with the overall fluidity of the game. Not perfect but still definitely enjoyable.The acrobatics are really great and the game handles very well.Definitely recommended! :D			"

												this game is a lot of fun but has its bugs and plain irritating game mechanics. I finished it in 14 hours but I have quite a lot left to go back and find.I love the characters (have not read the comics but I now intend to), the light-hearted humor that doesn't destroy the parts that were more dramatic, the music, the vaguely nostalgic feel of a late 90's style platformer. I liked being able to  jump and wall-climb pretty much anywhere, making the levels a nice open map. it sort of reminded me of Strider but with cute catgirls, and *everything* is better with cute catgirls! making the collectables a currency for upgrades and vanity items was a good choice.I did encounter a couple of bugs: a cut scene failed to trigger for me, making me have to restart a section, and I also managed to fall through the world. the controls could be awkward at times, a sequence of buttons refusing to activate because I got the timing a split second off, or me not being able to tell the difference between traversable and non-traversable territory.  the final boss with its incredibly fiddly mechanic that didn't trigger half the time was a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially as it kept suddenly refusing to attack me, making it hard to bait. these bugs don't make it unplayable, just a bit irritating at times, and I think the good parts make up for it, especially as the game is cheap and constantly in sales.

												Are you a furry fan? Do you want to run in 2d and slash through generic enemies DMC style all the way through the game? And with CoD like health regen and unlimited* energy? And more importantly are you a cat person? If all of your answers are yes then I don't know what to make of you. But I do know this: THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. Run through a meticulously designed map and fight against generic enemies. Thoug hyou might get tired of the endless troops that looks the same the maps offer a dellicious brain food that requires you to keep your brains on throughout the game ensures that you will remain engage in an intellectual battle agains the puzzles this game can offer to you gamers (though a fast reflex and reaction time maybe necessary). Other than a generic but endurable gameplay it gives a light plot (story) that is easy to digest but entertaining enough that you won't get bored of the story. Well what are you waiting for grab this game now! Or wait for it to go on sale up to you.			"

												I really love this type of gameplay and Kit are soooo cute kitten. I wish that it existed a anime about this game. Go Kit Ballard, GO. ; )  I have only one complain and it doesnt exist a map option to see like Metroid games where to go because sometimes i have been lost but i guess i will use my ""kitty sense"" to get back on track.

												I've never really played games like this, but I must say I enjoy it...Yes the controls are clunky at first but, hey. Got used to it 30mins into the game. (Using keyboard only option)For it's price not a bad game at all. The more you play it, the more you'll love it.I love the funny merchant sales thingy guy. I'm 1 hour into the game and I still have no clue whats going on and/or what the blonde lady is on on about though....I'm trying to not make sense of it or believe that there is a story.Got it on steam sale though, so, for it's price...Why not? :scCatgirl:			"

												I love this game, from the first moment I tried the demo it caught me and little by little made me fell in love with it's lore and the characters. Discovering more of the story thru the episodes, buying new costumes and weapons.And then after the years, a long awaited reward from heavens: Blade Kitten 2In general, is cute. Wil make you smirk, will make you find yourself smiling at the intended silly humor.Another thing I love from this game that is not frequently found, is the sensation of power. The main character is suposed to be badass, and it translates in the way she meets (and defeats) the foes, regular ones, that makes you feel powerful, except when you face a boss where you require an strategy to win.If you like comic, anime (it not being hentai, or VN or a rpg game), platforms, give this a try, without big expectations, just for fun.

												Gotta say this game is amazing it reminds me of the Xbox Days, when i was younger. Some of you might say ""Oh she just a Neko Girl for weeaboos"" Guys seriously? i heard more hateful things than that, And by the way Haters use something else that isn't boring to hear.100/10 Very Awesome Game			"

												Well, finally beat Blade Kitten, gotta say the wait for episode 2 was worth it. I played this game back on the console, sadly without episode 2 it feels incomplete. But anyway, the story is you play as Kit Ballard, a Felion Breaker (Bounty Hunter(tress)) who gets her breaker key (basically like an ID card) stolen by ehr rival, Justice Kreel. What follows starts from a simple search for the key to an all out conspiracy with factions and an ancient alien force Kit is familiar with.The game is a 2.5 D platformer, and it's pretty enjoyable, when you get past a few bugs it's got with platforming. Besides that the game is fun. After a long wait, we got our episode 2, and boy did it wrap it up, it felt a bit rushed, but given the fact they never got the chance to release the complete game due to legal reasons and the team shrank as a result, I can kinda understand the reason.But the game is done, and it has a lot of colelctables for me to still get, guess i won't be done with Hollow Wish just yet. If you want a fun platformer, i say get this and episode 2 of the game to finish it off. Plus the more people who buy it, one day we'll get the complete game on consoles, so please, get it if you want a fun game.			"

												You play as the kitties, but IN HUMAN FORM.Fighting metal steel guard, you dont know what to do, and end up getting killed by a laser or squashed by a wall.An epic platformer game with epic (kinda to me) journey. Searching for some ""things"" you probably don't know and end up confuse about your mission. Because you're to lazy to read the text screen or to lazy to listen the conversation.But, hey, you're playing as a.... Kitties?Its a nice platformer game btw, i like the game style. "

												honestly this is not my kind of game, which makes my praise for it that much higher. I had a blast. it really feels truly fluid and smooth when you're jumping sliding running slashing.... it all flows so well and you feel really accomplished. plus, the acting is top notch, the art style is wonderfully odd and beautiful, great game. enjoy!
