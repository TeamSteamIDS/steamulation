												The game is fast first person platformer. A fresh new adaptation of true and tried platforming. Rather than moving slowly and timing the jump from the edge. Speed is what counts here. You need to be moving at a constant speed to kick open doors, catch a drop wire etc. etc. Every thing is setup for constant nonstop movement. The level designs are so perfect; once you get hang of controls there is no need to stop. The game takes you through roof tops, A/C vents, malls, office walk ways and lots of other varied setups. At every stage there are multiple paths to move forward. There is a lot of freedom and it is tied well with risks.A critical thing to understand here is that the start-up period of the game is ROUGH. You are expected to be able to wall-jump, balance on thin rails, jump over chasms, and do other challenging things. The controls are going to be hard to get used to. Don't give up. It could be frustrating. Stick at it, and give yourself time to get used to those controls. Keep working through the initial levels. The reward is well worth it.Once you become used to the controls, the game really becomes captivating. You're expected to race top speed through a variety of obstacle courses. You have to think on the fly, react instantly, and pay attention to clues. It draws your mind in to focus on the moment.You can replay levels to try different paths, to try to get a better speed, and simply to have fun. So even if you ""solve"" a level in one way, there are reasons to go back and replay them multiple times.This game has been agony and ecstasy for me, and when I beat it I felt exhilarated. If you are a high-energy gamer who has the patience to try and try again, you will find yourself rewarded. If not, you should know ahead of time that there's no cathartic blasting your way out of trouble in this game.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a video game that definitely deserves a try.Its short length is the only complain I can mention about the campaign, because it's an incredible innovative title with a very powerful graphical side and an addictive gameplay proposal. A nice launching for this new saga that replaces the word 'brief' with the word 'intensity'.There's depth here that you'll only discover hours into time trialling a single stage and no other game in recent memory comes close to being as cool. I can't wait to see what Faith gets up to next. Console ports are usually a waste of time, but that's certainly not the case with Mirror's Edge. In fact, the PC version of the game offers even more than its console counterparts. Mirror’s Edge works like a charm with keyboard and mouse, too. Parkour above a shining beautiful city is a nice change of pace after normal shooters. Hopefully we get to see more games like this in the future.Mirrors Edge is an intense and intensely enjoyable experience from top to bottom that manages to capture a very interesting gameplay element and perfect it.

Mirrors EdgeThe Great Game That Nobody BoughtBefore I start, ignore how long I have played this game. I mainly played this offline.Mirrors Edge is a first person parkour game with some shooting elements. All combined highlights Faith's (the main character) trip through this beautiful city. The small details in the graphics, such as motion blur and even the dust particles when you land after a massive jump make this experience feel real at times. Highly recommended for fans of parkour based gameplay with the occasional fast paced, reflex combat.Also this is one of the very few first person games where you can acually see your feet as well as your arms.  Mirrors Edge is also a fantastic game because it still looks good even if you don't have a gaming PC to run it. Futhermore it doesn't take up that much space on your computer. (around 7 gigs or so)The only downside to this game is that it is a bit too short (around 6 hours). Keep in mind this is pretty much the only downside to this game.Verdict      9/10""Parkour + Amazing Graphics + A Little Bit Of Shooting = A Game Worth Your Money"" "

												Beautiful work of art, cleanly inspiring us for the better. Now I do wish to say more about this game, I played it years ago on my neighbors xbox 360 but now I am looking forward to Catalyst! It reminds me of hitman which is funny. So the point I wish to bring up now is about the settings, I have a GTX 980 Ti (Very high graphics card) But I had problems running this game, at certain points. This is entirely because of PhysX. There are two files which are in the game when you install here on Steam, and if you remove them then the problem is fixed, because this game came out half a decade ago, those files are outdated, and removing them will allow proper updated ones that you already should have to take their place, the files you need to find are called: PhysXCore.dll & PhysXDevice.dll. To find them go to Where Steam is on your computer, usually under program files x86, then steamapps, common, mirrors edge of course, then the first file maybe, called binaries, just find and delete those two I mentioned before hand and you should be completley done if you are up to date otherwise. Now this works as of now for me, maybe it will not in the future but I think it is worth doing this right now to try to help others. I found this fix on a fourm here: http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=335486 posted in 2010 apparently. It is 2015 now. Hope that helps you enjoy.			"

The only concern i had with this game was that the story was WAY to short, i was expecting that DICE could have gave alot more but oh well, Ethier way It's very innovational and cheap.100% Recommended.

												Mirror's Edge was an interesting experience. The first playthrough will always be rough, but this game has excellent replayability.  The theme of this game is that you are evading/rebelling against the government while trying to carry out tasks for an organization. The thing I disliked most about this game was the forced combat against heavily armored police. Some areas of the game can be very frustrating and may take multiple attempts to complete, but the feeling of accomplishment afterwards is present. This game takes a whole new approach on gaming. With very fast paced gameplay that sends you soaring through the skies across rooftops and construction sites. It really makes you feel like a badass ninja. Like I said, after your first playthrough, you will have a better understanding of how the game works and the level design which will make later playthroughs more enjoyable and smooth. If you have the money and are interested in a new exhilarating experience, I would highly recommend.			"

Posted: January 4, 2015
												Mirror's Edge is a game I've wanted to play for a while, and this past week I've completed it over once. Is it worth playing? Yes.From creators DICE (known for work on the Battlefield series and the 2015 Star Wars Battlefront), Mirror's Edge is a first-person platformer which involves parkour in all its glory, leaping across buildings, scaling walls, and traversing up factories. Parkour functions very smoothly, and the first-person view adds a layer of immersion which helps to sell the games atmosphere. Say what you want about the plot and characters (I found both to be good enough), this game's setting is a unique piece of art. Taking place sometime in the future in an unidentified utopian city controlled by a totalitarian government, Mirror's Edge conveys this by its very simplistic and pleasant art style: White everywhere, with bold colours such as brick red, lime green, or saphiere blue alongside. Cutscenses are also presented in a unqiue ""drawing animation"" (search up the first cutscene, I can't really explain it well), with a charm of their own. The soundtrack is also quite amazing, all the way from the main theme ""Still Alive"" to more atmospheric tracks used in the levels.As for gameplay, this game is centered around parkour as I said before. Your moveset includes jumping (no duh), sliding, wall running, climbing, and clambering to name a few. The feeling of successfully pulling of multiple moves at a fast pace is incredibly rewarding, and the game is entirely hard to master. Difficultly (for parkour) progression is smooth throughout the entire game, and (at least for me) the game never felt cheap at any times. However, combat also is an important part of this game. In some sections enemy soldiers will attack you, and you'll have to use kicks and punches to either kill or unarm them, in order to use their weapons. Gunplay in this game is very basic (kind of surprising as this game comes from DICE), and only serves as a way to kill baddies faster. Weapons include SMG's, shotguns, and snipers, however you wont find yourself using them too often as the bulk of the game is parkour, and some sections with enemies do involve chases, which are awesome and tense.That's pretty much this game! Sound a bit basic for you? Well, the main campaign/story mode is only 5 hours (it might take you shorter), and besides that there's a time trial mode, but that's pretty much the game. While a piece of art IMO, the game could have used a few more levels for the story mode, and perhaps a race mode for multiplayer, or at least something related to that. Gunplay/combat could also be expanded, and the parkour moveset could always be refined and expanded upon. Overall, it's an awesome concept and an original idea for a game, and I would give it a 7.5/10. For $19.99 it's a good price if you are absolutely sold on this game, but either than that I would either be cautious or wait for a price drop due to the lack of much content. Also, Mirror's Edge 2 for 2016!			"

												Yes, I have 20 hours in this game. But first, some background.Like with Final Fantasy XIII and Remember Me, I avoided this game because people complained about it when it came out despite me being hyped for it. I bought it when it was on sale for a dollar and regret not buying it day-of.I can see where people can find significant flaws, especially playing now just before the new game comes out, but there's so much good in this game that I think it's okay to overlook. The story's a little undercooked, Merc annoys the hell out of me (the white guy who's talking in your ear for 90% of the game), and for such an important character, you see Faith's sister three times and she does nothing significant. The borderless cartoon animation comic-wannabe cutscenes between levels are tragic and make my heart hurt. The biggest complaint I've seen is also slightly true: yes, some jumps and parkour tricks can be difficult to pull off because of finicky controls and poor item interaction (like not being in the correct centimeter length from a pipe so you fall to your death despite staring right at the bloody thing).But, honestly, the only parts of the game I got truly and genuinely frustrated at were the fights (particularly one boss fight with a ninja person *spoiler spoiler*). Thank god Catalyst ditched the guns because wow, I didn't get this game to play a shooter.Despite all of this, which I guess some is enough to ruin this game for people, I cannot recommend this game enough. It is quite possibly one of my favorite games of all time, and I play a lot of games. I spent $200 on Catalyst and got the prequel graphic novel. I own the soundtrack to the first game and will probably get the next. I seriously love this game. So what's good?It's art, pure and simple. And there's nothing else like it. Maybe some indie stuff popped up in hopes of scratching that virtual parkour itch, but nothing really compares to this full game of jumps and swings. It's like making Assassin's Creed first person and giving you complete control of every wall dash, every jump, every lunge, all those little tricky grabs and spins, and turning travel into the puzzle rather than combat or hacking minigames. Every tiny detail is carefully created and placed to challenge you and force you to think creatively, using the tools you learn in the tutorial on increasingly difficult puzzles. Even the fights can sometimes be enjoyable when you treat it as a marathon instead of an fps shooting gallery.The game is gorgeous, even for today's standards (though Faith's model is a little choppy). The color contrast and choice in neon vibrance and bright white have been lauded for years now. And it always stands our, no matter how many times you play the game. In a world of greys and browns, this game is quite the visual gem and that can't be understated. Traveling over skyscrapers really shows all these contrasts, then busting into office buildings and cunstruction sites, subways and malls, put those big blues, oranges, and greens right in your face.I'm a huge cyberpunk fan and there's not a lot of it. People want to think it died in the '80s, but I say ♥♥♥♥ that. Even if we don't have AIs or cyberspace, this is cyberpunk. A small group of rebels try to circumnavigate the system that the ruling totalitatarian government has created in this near-future dystopia. It's guilded, with high-rises and men in swanky suits, but crime and death in the cracks. This point's more about my personal interests, but anything cyberpunk is a win in my book.The music perfectly frames everything going on. It's fast, it's calm, and it's creepy. People complain about ""Still Alive"" but I'm one of the nerds who loves that ♥♥♥♥ing song. When i heard the composer for the main soundtrack was coming back, I immediately got the collector's for Catalyst. He's good. It's soft, kinda futuristic (as we'd like to imagine it) and is the perfect audial counterpart to the colorful visuals.Then there's time trials and doing speedruns of actual levels from the game, which is always fun. There's hackers on the pc, so don't bother trying to be number one on the leaderboards, but it can be very fun to push yourself to beat your own best times. Some of the most fun I had in this game was discovering new and faster ways of completing levels, like trick jumps I missed on my initial run or near-glitches that let you skip whle sections. I suppose these types of things exist in all sorts of games, but it truly feels different in a game with the parkour gameplay like this. I also thought the voice-acting was well done, particularly on faith and Jacknife, even Merc (despite me loathing his voice).I am a very big fan of this game, now franchise, and will likely love it forever. No, it's not perfect. If it was, would we need a sequel? But it's unique, fun, and stays in your brain. Granted, the folks around here bashing on it aren't likely to think about it again, but how are you to know you won't love it until you try it?One scene will always stick with me. Faith's sister's first appearance is in a cutscene, and not one with that horrible cartoon animation, but a realtime in-game cutscene in first person. There aren't a lot of these (in fact, off the top of my head, I can only remember two). This one is a good length, the vast city is visible in the background, you don't have control over Faith's actions, and it's emotional. It sets up the plot for the game (which isn't dreadful, they just could've done al ot more with it) and the relationship between Faith and her sister. Faith's personality is on full display here, her drive to run and escape problems rather than face them, and we never see her face. Many fps games don't have cutscenes from first person where the first-person character actually does stuff that the player doesn't do. But it's not awkward, it doesn't feel weird, even when the two sisters embrace and you see Kate's head go over Faith's shoulder. It's fluid and makes me wish there were more of these throughout the game. Even outside of the parkour, the music, and the visuals, this style of cutscene will always stick with me.TLDR- I love it, you might, there's problems, what game doesn't? You won't know if you're a hater or a lover until you try it. There's running, jumping, music, some iffy storytelling, and an overall unique experience. I've also heard it's good with VR. Give it a shot, it may just be your next obsession.			"

												Pretty late for a review, but OH WELL.This game has been one of my favourites for long years now and it hasn't changed. I still love it as I loved it after my first playthrough. Even with all its flaws, Mirror's Edge has some amazing moments, like Faith, her character overall. Music made by Solar Fields. Soundtrack is simply beautiful and one of the best I've heard in video games.Even after all those years game looks pretty good, especially city itself. Design is pretty original, sterile, trying to show ""the perfect society"" Kruger wants to create after The November Riots.Story... story is a little bit short, but blame EA for cutting like 60% of it without the writers knowledge, but even so... story about Faith and her sister, Kate, caught my heart. This isn't about saving the city or the world, no. It's just about Faith and her sister and this is why I loved it.Anyway, give it a try.

												kind of a puzzle platformer, you try to find the way through levels. the right method is always easy once you find it but the game forces you to figure it out while being shot at which is great fun as it turns out. There is combat and it's annoying. Running is the fun part. There is a fun way to do the combat while using your running moves but it is really difficult, Usually I just shot the enemies so that I could go back to running.Sometimes though running and fighting combine and it's BRILLIANT,  Like Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes: Slide... Kick!... incapacitate... wall run.. Kick...  disarm....  result? three cops knocked out, one broken nose, one stolen donut, capacity to shoot at main character greatly diminished. "

												I'm a great fan of this game. I love this and I can't wait to Mirror's Edge 2.The graphics are wonderful and I can't believe this game is from 2009. And you don't need a mega-graphics card for run it, i have a Nvidia GT630, and I have the maximum quality on textures, graphics and resolution. With 50 FPS!It's very innovational and cheap.The only thing It's bad for me, is the story's duration. It's very, very short. But it compenses because when you play it once, you can't stop playing it.Completly recomended.			"

												1.You play the game, the graphics are nice, colour design awesome, the story is ""okay"", you die a lot in this game. There are cases where Faith doesn't grab a ledge and falls to her death, it is completly the games fault.2.You start to look at the areas with another view - it is more like a puzzle. Not eveything that is suggested (with runner vision) is really that fast. Fighting is slow, you start to avoid it.You discover that the cases where Faith falls to her death.... are completly your fault. It is just really precise timing and positioning. (There are some invisible things you can get stuck on, but at least they feel consistent.)3.You practice certain areas of a map over and over again. It becomes a puzzle-skill-choreography game. 4.You discover kickglitches.  You start to practice more and die a lot, lot, lot more in this game. Sometimes you ragequit. You get a dictionary and search for the word ""consistent"". You cannot find it.But: if combos work you feel like the greatest player who ever walked on this planet earth.5.You start to practice out of bounds skips. They look really cool. No progress. You see some speedruns and you think you are the worst player who ever walked on this planet earth.6.Irl you look at pipes and vents with disgust. In a potential run they slow you down. You look at your living room and mumble ""maybe I can avoid them by wallclimb-to-wallrun jump wallclimb-turnjump?"" Your mother looks at you with concern.7.Irl the missing runner vision annoys you. At the dinner table you want the fork to glow red. Even if you choose to ignore that and eat the food with your hands, because it is faster.8.Your psychologist suggests to write a review.tl;drUnique concept, awesome graphics, difficulty depends on how you play it rather than the difficulty set in game.I rate this game awesome/10.

-Quick Review-Mirror's Edge is a first person Parkour game developed by DICE in 2009. I don't know if this is “the first Parkour game ever developed”, but it is the first I've ever played, and I suspect it can earn its place as one of the first and one of the good ones.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as the Protagonist named “Faith”... I see what you did there DICE, touché. Faith is part of a rebel group that has risen up against the oppressive ruling government which monitors all communication within this city,  sound familiar? Hmmm...Faith is a “runner”, runners are individuals who act as couriers that carries messages around the city. Runners see the world in a different way; where one person might see a dead end, a runner see's opportunities to climb, jump, and vault to get to their objective.Gameplay: Mirror's Edge has one extremely strong selling point: First person Parkour. Have you ever wanted to jump off a building and not break your kneecaps? Have you ever wanted to travel a zip line from a skyscaper? Mirror's Edge is for you!There are various types of obstacles that you'll face throughout the game, the game teaches you how to deal with each one by going through a “training” session before you start the game. This training is skip-able but I suggest you get through it... but I'll be honest, I probably spent more time on the training then the first level. I could not master the “turn-around-wall-jump”, every time I missed the game would force-ably restart my attempt.Achievements: At this time there are no steam achievements for Mirror's Edge, however on the Xbox there are 50 Achievements, so it's possible sometime in the future Mirror's Edge might have achievements, but at this time (08/03/15) there are no achievements.There might not be achievements for Mirror's Edge, but there are time trials that you can complete against your friends on, unfortunately they're not sync-ed with steam leaderboards, so you would need to add your friends in game via Origin account.Price: Mirror's Edge is priced at $19.99, I completed this game on Normal difficulty in 7 hours. I want my games to go an hour for every dollar spent... If you go by that standard you should wait for this game to go on sale.However if you have the money, this is an excellent Parkour game that you definitely should give a try at some point, regardless of cost.Conclusion: To recap... Story: Okay, Gameplay: Excellent + Parkour, Achievements: Not available at this time, Price: a bit high.I recommend this game to anyone who likes jumping puzzles in first or third person video games. You can fight your way through the game (that's what I did) however it's not designed to cater to the fighting crowd (but it's so fun to punch out one guy, grab his gun and rata-tata-tata!), the game is designed to be like a Parkour or Free running simulator. And many times feels quite realistic on what you can and cannot survive... well almost, I did some pretty messed up stunts.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a unique and wonderful experience. There are some rough edges, but it's a beautiful and memorable game.The closest gameplay comparison I can make is Portal. If you enjoyed the challenges in Portal 2, you will likely enjoy Mirror's Edge, too. The puzzles of both these games are about figuring out how to master a complex open 3D arena through trial and error, and the sense of fulfillment when you figure out the solutions in both games is similar.Mirror's Edge is set in a beautiful near-future city, with abstract gleaming white towers and stunning vistas. Outside, you engage in parkour-style running, navigating high ledges and leaping from tower to tower, in a fluid manner. It’s similar to the more familiar Assassin's Creed games, but faster. Indoor sequences are more puzzley, usually about getting from Point A to Point B efficiently. The free running is exhilarating, both outdoors and indoors. Missing a jump by a faction of an inch and falling to your death will make your fingers tingle as you catch your breath! And there was a memorable close encounter with a subway train that made me jump out of my seat from the adrenaline surge. Unfortunately, Mirror's Edge also features awkward combat sequences. The early training missions teach complicated combo moves for executing martial arts maneuvers. For example: blocking a punch while taking a weapon off an enemy. Honestly, these moves were way too complicated for me to execute confidently, but I quickly learned one easy combo that served me well in every situation: the slide-tackle. Turns out that if you take people out at the knees, everything else goes pretty smoothly!These combat events are generally unwelcome in an otherwise excellent game. Disabling a cop as you round a corner, then dash away? That's fun. Disabling a cop, taking his weapon, and then having a shootout with his partners for 5 minutes, moving from cover to cover? This does not match the overall theme of the game, and it's a distraction. Fortunately, these combat events are few and far between, and not difficult enough to frustrate you, or dissuade you from completing the game. Think of them as a different kind of puzzle.Last word: The trailer that Steam offers in the Store page is a poor choice. It features the cartoony animation from some of the between-levels cutscenes.  The actual gameplay is more like this trailer:

												It's one of the most original FPS that came out, won awards for its originality but it didn't sell that good.The game consist on parkour and you will die a couple of times but the view and adreneline it's just awesome.I know you wont like the next bit, but I love playing this game more than Skyrim. I may have more hours on Skyrim but the game feels to big, yes that's the point, but, this game when you are mid-air it's just beautiful and vivid.PS: Skyrim it's also realy realy good but EA did something good, and we should appriciate this due to the things they are doing to us (The Sims 4 is worst than the 3 and we have to buy the stuff that was for free). Wait for the one thats comming up with a open world.			"

												I have just finished the story mode and I gotta say I enjoyed my time. It's my first game of this kind so let me make a quick review.  Pros	+  graphics	For an older game, the graphics was just amazing and I caught myself just standing for a while admiring it, graphics is 10/10 in this game. +  story Even though on the beginning it doesn't ""pull you in"", gradually the story gets better and by the end of the game I was truly invested into the story, wasn't too original, just normal stuff. +  music Doesn't matter if you're fighting, exploring around or trying to figure out how to get on that ledge, the music is always amazing and fits the situation, it makes the experience better. +  gameplay Everything seems so fluid, your reactions have to be quick and when you're trying to escape ""Blues"" your heart starts racing, I wasn't able to put this game down until it was finished. +  content After you finish the story, you can go complete timed runs and work on your skills, compare yourself to others.  Cons -  shortness of game Despite not having watched any kind of guides and spending long time figuring things out, this game took me 7 hours to complete, which is fairly shot in my opinion. -  enemies AI I think a blindfolded monkey would hit me more often than enemies in this game, except for maybe last 2 chapters, I could run around in circles and not a single bullet landed, fun stuff (normal mode). -  combat It just didn't feel right for me, not being able to see health nor ammo, making it just hit'n'run at times, I loved my time when I could just run around, not escaping bullets. All in all, this game is still worth playing, as the pros outweigh the cons by a lot, I'd surely recommend this game to anyone, 7/10.			"

												Mirror’s Edge consistently feels like the point of impact for two diverging strains of game design.There is, first, the game Mirror’s Edge would propose itself to be, a first-person parkour escapade through a city overrun by corporate interest. It’s a crunchy, mechanics focused affair sold on the adrenaline rush that is leaping off a rooftop and hitting the ground in an effortlessly smooth, lifesaving roll. Where games such as Assassin’s Creed and Prince of Persia employ parkour as a flashy means to a navigational end, Mirror’s Edge obsesses over the act of putting one foot in front of the other; a roll here, a leap there, each action a purposeful and considered exertion meant to carry you forward as fast as possible with as little surface friction as can be managed.The precision Mirror’s Edge demands of you in controlling your character’s body is at once overwhelming and exhilarating. I routinely felt as if the game demanded more of me than its simple over/under controls allowed for, but then I would flawlessly string together a series of moves and everything would snap into place. There is a delicate balance struck between contextual automation and player driven navigation in how you traverse the industrial playgrounds that make up Mirror’s Edge’s levels, and more often than not the choice to keep the actual controls simple pays off and helps make for a game that feels both smooth and tactile.Problems arise though when Mirror’s Edge’s level designs fail to match the intuitive nature of its controls. There is a distinct visual vocabulary at work in Mirror’s Edge that seeks to clue you in on what can and can’t be climbed, jumped, and run on, familiar objects and situations giving way to habitual movements that streamline the planning phase and keep you moving. But despite what attempts Mirror’s Edge makes to help teach you how to read levels, by and large they remain entirely opaque. I might recognize a piece of geometry, but rarely did that translate into me knowing how to actually use it to move forward, and again and again I would find myself having to slow down and deconstruct a level before I could move forward.This stop-and-go workaround is certainly functional, but it goes entirely against the way Mirror’s Edge seems designed to be, and how it wants you to play. For a game built with speed and flow as top priorities, Mirror’s Edge does a poor job ensuring you ever make it through a level without needing to first memorize its layout and the sequence of moves needed to successfully navigate it. It’s not impossible to get good at Mirror’s Edge and capitalize on its promises, but doing so requires such an investment of time and energy spent beating yourself against its inscrutable exterior, that it hardly feels worth it. I never expected to reach speedrun level proficiency without putting in the effort, but Mirror’s Edge fails to accommodate for players who fall anywhere outside the hyper dedicated and skilled, without feeling as if that exclusion is an intentional choice. I don’t believe developer DICE wanted Mirror’s Edge to be as hard and frustrating as it ultimately became, but perhaps that is just what happens to games that move as fast and are as demanding as this.But I feel as if most of Mirror’s Edge’s failings are less the result of design oversights than they are the splintering of priorities. I said earlier that Mirror’s Edge feels like two strains of game design, and that second side comes into play in all the ways Mirror’s Edge either fails to flesh out the parts one would believe to be most important, or the things it chooses to include for no discernible reason. The much maligned combat is likely the biggest offender in this regard. You are rarely forced to engage with enemies, but not doing can often make the game more challenging than it is worth. Often I ran into situations where I would die dozens of times without making it through, only to reluctantly pick up a gun and be out in a matter of moments.The reason combat is so annoying then is the same reason much of the game becomes a frustrating slog the further you progress: it keeps slowing you down. There is also the added fact that combat, while technically functional, is horrifically clunky and unsatisfying, with kicks and punches being by far the least controlled actions you perform in the game, and the gunplay feeling loose and awkward (which is especially strange given DICE’s shooter roots). It all feels like a last second inclusion, as if someone high up at EA saw the game running and became worried that no one would buy a game without combat. One can only speculate as to the various hierarchies at play in Mirror’s Edge’s development, but that doesn’t change how wholly alien the combat feels to the rest of the game, and its inclusion means that at some point development time was being allocated to it over the rest of the game (the end result being the game we received).That isn’t to say that if DICE had opted-out of combat they would have been able to fix all of Mirror’s Edge’s problems, but when so much of the game feels rushed it seems hard to imagine that time couldn’t have been better spent elsewhere. The campaign itself is brief even by shooter standards at anywhere from 4-6 hours, and is made to feel more insubstantial due to being married to a narrative that is structurally akin to a show billed for 24 episodes that got cut down to 12. There is a framework here setting up a fascinating near future, where the control of information is paramount, and the only way to get messages relayed outside the government’s prying eyes is to use runners who carry them by hand. Our lead, Faith, is a quintessential sentimental rebel, enacting what eventually becomes an outright war between the city higher-ups and the runners in order to rescue her sister after being framed for a crime.There is a lot to work with in Mirror’s Edge’s setting and premise, but events are strung together with so little continuity and character development that the result is something of a mess. Much of Mirror’s Edge’s plot seems to hint at a history that is never explained, with character relationships never getting much attention even as they switch sides at the drop of a hat without any legitimate justification. Eventually things boil down to a blur of small-scale politics with big ramifications, plot holes that make for easy conclusions, and an overarching storyline that by the end seems to have gone nowhere despite everything that unfolds. I am a sucker for Marxist dystopia and would have loved to learn more about Faith’s world and how she fits into it. It is incredibly rare we get a female lead in games, which makes it perhaps more frustrating than it would otherwise be that Mirror’s Edge does nothing much to develop Faith as a person. I appreciate her being here and DICE avoiding most of the pitfalls that developers fall into in creating female characters, but that only serves to illustrate just how dire things are in games even so many years after Mirror’s Edge’s release, that even being a lousy character in her own right Faith still constitutes one of the better leading ladies in a major release.Mirror’s Edge is an experience that few games have come anywhere near replicating. Its blend of high-contrast visuals and a visceral sense of movement and impact can be incredibly exhilarating once you learn how to make use of what you’re given. However compelling a concept Mirror’s Edge might be though, its execution is so flawed as to make playing it often far less enjoyable than the idea of doing so. With a sequel on the horizon it will be interesting to see if DICE learned anything from Mirror’s Edge relative failure, but until then it exists more as a curiosity than a classic.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I finally decided to play this. What a rush! This is the sort of game that can be played ten years from now and it will still play great and look great. It's one of those timeless games.Positives: Simple and refined gameplay, check. The free running is so very enjoyable. The sense of speed as you rush across rooftops is exhilirating. For someone like me who loves the thrill of heights, it puts a grin on my face. (You'll probably want to raise the game's FOV, it's pretty easy, look it up.)  I want to live in that city. Maybe without the dystopia but, it looks so nice. The art direction in the game is gorgeous. Indoors also. I want to work in those offices. I would desk jockey the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of those office environments. You can take a screenshot at any time and hang it on your wall. My F12 key is wearing out. I liked the world they created. The runner culture. The story keeps it simple, with just enough to provide you with incentive. Character designs are great too, from Faith to the runners and villains. Check out the unlockable art in the main menu. I was sad to hear Rhianna Pratchett wasn't invited to write Mirror's Edge 2 because  I liked her take on this. A girl on the wrong side of the law who's doing everything to save her her sister, the framed cop. Interesting backstory to the city and the characters. I'd love an animated series with the same setting and aesthetics. The negatives: Combat is definitely the weak point of the game. Most of the time it's frustrating. Lots of people wish it didn't have combat at all. I think they could have made it work. You can disarm most enemies via quicktime events that suck, even if you use the slowmo button. For a game about free running, it's pretty damn linear. I've seen corridor shooters that offered more varied paths. At least I played it without ""runner vision"" which literally paints your path in red. I didn't mind these but it seems a lot of people did: the cutscene cartoons are not as well made as the rest of the game. Not a big deal for me.Mirror's Edge 2 is supposed to address these issues, if it ever releases. DICE are a hostage to developing Battlefield after Battlefield, sadly. Unique and fresh games like Mirror's Edge are an exception and a rarity.Definitely worth playing.			"

												Definitely one of EA's more unique titles, and probably the best parkour-focused game you can find right now. If you're new to the series, play this and skip the largely disappointing Mirror's Edge Catalyst.Gameplay-wise, the game feels pretty good to play once you get a handle on the controls. It can easily be played via a controller or keyboard+mouse; the latter option will give you a slight edge in gun battles, but since the game can be completed without touching a gun (except for one part where you have to shoot a police van) it doesn't matter what you use. The controls are awkward either way at first, but the more you play the more natural it'll start to feel. And once you get used to it, you'll probably wish that more games had similar mechanics. While Mirror's Edge might look like a FPS at some times, it's a platforming game above all else. Levels are presented in a linear fashion and you progress through like you would in any platforming game; using the enviornment to vault, swing, and crawl your way past obstacles. With only 9 levels, the game is on the short side...but it definitely has some replayability if you're looking to speedrun it. Gunplay may leave a little more to be desired; it feels clunky, and Faith can't carry ammo so when she disarms an enemy she can only use the rounds that are already in the gun. Apart from pistols and SMGs, guns will also considerably slow Faith down, no doubt an intentional move by DICE to emphasize that you sacrafice speed for power by picking up a weapon. Again, this doesn't matter much since guns are an entirely optional feature.Graphically, it's a very pretty game. The game can be a little too bright sometimes, with it's pre-baked lighting and strong bloom effects, but overall it uses Unreal Engine 3 pretty well. The artstyle is fantastic; set in a near-futuristic dystopian city, the colorful city skylines make for a great view as you dance along the rooftops. Combined with a fantastic minimalistic HUD, the game presents many opportunities for gorgeous screenshots if you like to toy around with video game photography.Moving on to presentation, Mirror's Edge has the same appeal that a cult movie would. The story is far from perfect with average voice acting, poor pacing, and a somewhat anticlimactic ending. That being said, it was still done effectively. If the story does anything good, it's world building. I found myself wanting to know more about the events leading up to the game's story, about the city, about Faith herself. The cutscenes will probably remind you of those old Esurance commercials, but they eventually grow on you. The soundtrack is pretty well done too, with the music from the final level being exceptionally good. Overall, the game is very obviously far from perfect and yet still charming in it's own unique way.TL;DRMirror's Edge has a small but dedicated and enthusiastic fanbase for a reason. It's not for everybody and it's certainly not the best game in the world. In spite of that, it's aged well for an almost 10 year old game. It's got some of the best platforming mechanics I've seen in a first person game, although there's still a few frustrating trial-and-error segments. All in all, I think it's worth at least one playthrough...certainly more for a budding speedrunner. $20 might be asking a little much, but when it goes on sale it's a must buy in my opinion.			"

												This is the best parkour game out there. It's only downside that I can see is that it's single player is very short, and if you get really good at it, then it can take less than and hour to beat the whole game. I think that's what makes this game so fun is the fact that the creators make it so that you want to go back and beat your previous record. 10/10.			"

												First off I will start by saying that I am the worse parkour gamer in the history of parkour gaming. It only took Dying Light and Mirror's Edge to make me realize this and yet I still play them. Once in awhile I will fall off the buildings and die, and by once in awhile, I mean every 30 seconds or so. I just wipe the blood off myself, reset my broken limbs and continue lol.This seems to be one of those games that everyone passes up and I don't know why. The story is very good, along with the graphics and the voice acting. This is definitely a hidden gem in the Steam games list that everyone should play at least once, even if you keep dying.			"

English Version: I don't know how to define this game. A First-person action where your main purpose is to run. That's right, run! One of this game's strenghts is, among all and in my opinion, its freshness! But let's talk more in details about the game...The plot is based on a city (which apparently hasn't got a name) where information is constantly controlled and supervised (reminded me of ""1984"", for those who know the book!). This kind of society brought to the birth of the so-called ""runners"", who are rebels who do stunts taking advantage of the environment between buildings, pipes and platforms; are deliver information even at the cost of their lives. Our protagonist is the runner Faith Connor. The story begins when Faith's sister, Kate, is trapped and subsequently indicted for the murder of a politician. This will push Faith, to break the boundary of the city in which the rebels are ''crossing in the mirror's edge'' (reference needed). From here we will investigate to try to exonerate her sister.The gameplay is very hectic, which makes everything much more exciting and unfortunately short-lived given that, I finished it in a few hours. First of all I'd advice EVERYONE, even the expert players, to complete the tutorial in order to understand the game mechanics, because as I said it's a different game compared to the others! However a lot of It is about observing the landscape in order to notice any path you can take to move forward (it isn't always easy to identify them, even though they are highlighted in red, especially if you are running). In case there are policemen nearby, you can use the attack to beat 'em up, to steal their guns and to quickly shoot the rest of 'em (we still available a few bullets, also if we had taken the charge weapon). Still you'd better avoid all of that, 'cause it slows down the run and makes you more vulnerable (if they shoot you even just three or four times you can easly die).The characters are poorly characterized, little is told about Faith. The graphics are very pretty and fits in the context in my opinion!In conclusion I think it's a game that everyone should try. After that you can like It or dislike It, but as It's a different kind of game-experience that still allows the player having fun!Italian Version: Non so bene come definirlo questo gioco. Un gioco d'azione, in prima persona, dove lo scopo principale è di correre. Esatto, correre! Uno dei punti di forza di questo gioco è proprio questo, a parer mio, la novità! Ma parliamo più nello specifico del gioco..La trama parla di una città (senza un apparente nome) dove le informazioni sono costantemente controllate e vigilate (mi ha ricordato molto 1984, per chi conoscesse il libro!). A questa legge si ribellano i cosiddetti ''runners'', ragazzi che correndo e facendo acrobazione tra palazzi, tubi e pedane trasportano informazioni anche a costo della loro vita. La nostra protagonista è la runner Faith Connor. La storia inizia quando la sorella di Faith, Kate, viene incastrata e successivamente incriminata per un omicidio di un politico. Questo spingerà Faith, ad infrangere il confine della città a cui tanto si ribella ''varcando il bordo dello specchio'' (citazione necessaria) in inglese appunto Mirror's Edge. Da qui la vedremo indagare per cercare di scagionare la sorella.Il gameplay è molto frenetico, il che rende tutto molto più eccitante e purtroppo poco longevo dato che, almeno io, l'ho finito in poche ore. Inizialmente consiglio a TUTTI, anche ai più esperti, di fare il tutorial, per capire bene le meccaniche di gioco, perché come ho già detto è un gioco diverso dagli altri! Comunque il tutto sta nell'osservare bene il paesaggio per notare eventuali percorsi da poter fare per andare avanti (non è sempre facile individuarli, nonostante siano evidenziati in rosso, specie se si sta correndo). Nel caso ci siano poliziotti vicini, inoltre, è possibile usare l'attacco riavvicinato sia per stenderli sia per rubare la pistola e far fuori velocemente il resto della polizia (abbiamo comunque disponibili pochi proiettili, anche l'avessimo presa carica l'arma). L'arma comunque è meglio evitarla, dato che rallenta la corsa e ci rende più vulnerabili (non abbiamo molta vita, se ci sparano anche 3-4 colpi in pochi secondi siamo morti).I personaggi sono poco caratterizzati, viene dopo poco anche di Faith. La grafica è molto carina ed adatta al contesto a parer mio!Concludendo secondo me è un gioco che tutti dovrebbero provare, poi può piacere e non piacere, ma è un gioco diverso che comunque può divertire, quindi lo consiglio!

												Mirror's Edge was developed by DICE and released in 2010. Unlike other DICE games, Mirror's Edge wasn't using the Frostbite engine, instead they went with Unreal Engine 3.There is no game like it. The parkour is simply amazing here. There is no run button in this game - instead your character simply builds up speed as she runs. To complete an obstacle, you have to do it all in an instant, without stopping. It's not really about planning or puzzles, but more about instinct. You really have to give it to the level design in this game. Without right level design none of it would really feel right. All of that really make it feel very natural and epic. DICE really managed to combine cinematic feel (and i don't mean 30 fps) and gameplay together. I wouldn't mind for a open world though.There is also a bit of FPS in this game. You can never hold on to a gun or reload it. You have  to attack the enemy to get the gun, but it's easier said than done though. The game wants you to be tactical, even if you attack an enemy that only had a pistol, he will still gun you down if you just run out in the open to him like that. You have to use cover, pick the ones that are separated from the rest etc.The gameplay component of the game, whether it's parkour or shootouts, is simply amazing.The game also has nice use of aesthetics. They use primary colors mixed with white for the most part. It's so simplistic, yet so gorgeous. Musical department wasn't lacking either. Main theme by Lisa Miskovsky is superb.Unfortunately this game suffers from one big problem - the length. It will take you about 4 hrs to complete it. I guess EA thought of it as an experiment project?Additionally, there are also those terrible cutscenes in between the levels. Clearly shows the limited budget EA has given.Usually i dismiss these 4 hrs long games. Most of them offer no originality and are overpriced. But due to unique nature of Mirror's Edge i will have to recommend it. There is really no game like it.			"

												I finished the game just under 9 hours, and among frustration, experimentation and the thrill of adrenaline, I recommend this game.It’s a sad, dystopian future, where mega corporations control the world. Among conformity and corruption, the main character (Faith) lives life as a Runner. It’s sort of a rebel/delivery mail, highly skilled individual. It’s interesting, and without spoiling any further, her journey becomes personal, with a touch of vendetta to it. Nothing original, but it worked for me.The gameplay can be frustrating, and I bet most negative reviewers didn’t have patience to get familiar with the controls, but once you overcome that (and it can take some time), it becomes exciting and even scary to do the crazy parkour required to progress. Quick note: the visuals are beautiful, rendered in Unreal Engine with great colors.The enemies with guns killed me so many times, until I finally realized I was no match for an armed opponent, finally deciding to avoid them at all costs and find cover. If you knock one of them out and grab the gun, the game changes and it becomes easy to murder everyone, but I didn’t find that as appealing as escaping. Now, when the enemy runners started appearing and chasing me, I don’t know why, but that freaked me out. A lot. Maybe it’s because the sense of mobility and acrobatics was something unique to my character. I felt safe, knowing that the cops couldn’t reach me once I climbed out of their reach, but the enemy runner could. Their masks also added a tone of creepiness I enjoyed.  I’ll also be honest and say that I wish the characters had more depth and that the story was longer. I wanted to explore the whole city and walk among the pedestrians unnoticed. Still, it’s a good game.Buy it, but expect some practice and time to get used to the controls. Persevere and you’ll be rewarded with awesome parkour and amazing views.			"

I am not used to run away so it really gives that thrill of fast thinking and trying not to get hit.New experience, great game.			"

												I can not express the love I have for this game with words. Though one thing needs to be said: the game IS flawed.The universe and art direction is breathtaking, it takes risks, it's gorgeous... but they didn't really expand on the backstory enough. The gameplay is awesome: you run from rooftop to rooftop, you climb stuff, you make dangerous jumps while the police chases you, etc. but sometimes the flow of the game is completely broken by mandatory gunfights (which are thankfully few and far between).That said, Mirror's Edge is everything good that can come out of a big studio & publisher. I'm repeating myself, but the design of the city is just THAT good. The character design is pretty good; and hey! For once, we finally have an AAA game where a woman is the lead character! And last but not least, the sound design & soundtrack is the cherry on top of the cake: psychic ambient & downtempo electronica by Solar Fields, in a style that mixes two of his best albums: Leaving Home (2005) and EarthShine (2007).One of my favorite games ever, and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel...

												Disregard the 1 hour of playtime as I played this game while being offline. (which by the by, this game is fantastic to play offline.)What to say about a game that is centred around parkour and finesse... oh wait I said it.This game is about those two things mainly. and you know I have to say I like it. All the white trees and red pipes in the world make for an interesting style. (which is there because the devs wanted the player to have focus on the important objects)Umm yeah. takes a little getting used to. Story is great, the sounds are fitting. The game is rewarding, I mean I personally feel really cool jumping from building to building grabbing on to the pipes from the sides and then doing a few kicks off a wall to get up higher. so yeah. 10/10 gameplay. Honestly unique.Really wish there was a sequel.Story: 10/10 (Unique)Gameplay: 10/10 (Challenging, speed runs, etc.)Presentation: 10/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 (Not amazing, but great.)Replayability: 8/10 (Yeah, I played it again.)

If you haven't played it - don't hesitate and try it, it will look as cool in 2016.+Soundwork - only one but really cool single as the main theme - Still alive - fits the game just right.+Gameplay - it was one of the 1st games where parkour was 99% of the gameplay. And it was really good, easy difficulties colored all usable obstacles, hard difficulty allowed free run without coloring, and that was pretty good feeling. Good replayability over the years.-???

												Mirror's Edge. You climb walls and shizzlePros- -: Parkour is nice, despite that sometimes Faith never grabs the ♥♥♥♥ing ledge I want her to, it's fluid and smooth. - -: The soundtrack is one of my favourite parts about it, Solar Fields did an Excellent job on it. Props to him.- -: Visuals looks pretty damn good for a 2008 game.- -: Quite atmospheric and Immersive- -: Cartoon animations for some cutscenes. Despite the animation being a bit shoddy at times, it's a nice feat.Doesn'tbotherme's- -: The story honestly tries, but fails. I kind of liked the characters, I kind of didnt.- -: Combat is a cool addition, specially the disarming feature, but it's a bit tricky to master, and easily avoidable- -: There are some glitches, but not too many.Cons- -: A.I is garbage, the only way they'll truly kill you is when they get bigger guns later on in the game- -: Why do my enemies go completely stiff/ gmod like when I kill them? I dont understand why DICE couldn't just put animations for when enemies get shot at. Sure, you dont have to use guns, but some people like to. - -: When the soundtrack just stops playing.9/10 - Don't play the sequel, it unfortunately doesn't have much charm as this one.			"

Mirror's Edge, developed by DICE and published by EA Games, is an astonishing game that, I believe, still holds strong till this very day.This is a perfect game for freerunning/parkour and never actually gets dull for a single moment. The art style works well with the game and the graphics are still great for a late 2008-early 2009 title. The story is rather short but since the game is meant to be fast I guess it translates into the story as well.Besides the gameplay and freerunning elements, another highlight is the soundtrack by Solar Fields. Playing this game I cannot imagine another OST that would fit as well as this one did. Everything binds together in an harmonic way that relaxes you and pumps you with adrenaline when needed.What I liked:- Graphics are still good- Decent story- Great gameplay/freerunning- Amazing soundtrack- Great title for speedrunningNeutral about it:- Short game but I suppose it was meant to be for a title such as this- Ending is rather rushed What I disliked: - Combat is nothing great.- Sometimes clunky controls and you want to do something and end up doing the exact oppositeIn the end I feel this game is still great to play even for today's standards and I recommend it wholeheartedly.  Final Rating 8.5/10  "

												Mirror’s Edge is a game in its own league because there aren’t many – if any – like it. The gameplay consists of running, jumping, sliding, kicking, etc. You’re in (almost) constant motion. The learning curve is steep and you’re required to have a lot of patience. You might not even get full enjoyment out of it if you’ve just played through the game once, unless you get the hang of it straight away. Now, at first I thought that the game’s just unfair and unnecessarily difficult... until I stopped making things too complicated for myself.  Unfortunately, that happened about an hour and a half before the end of the main campaign. I expected all the routes to be very linear and complicated but the truth is that there are many ways to get from one place to another. I just had to open my eyes, learn how to notice things and think simply. Pros:•	The game is at its best during chase sequences and, fortunately, there’s a lot of them. You can actually feel the thrill of being chased while you’re running away from enemies.•	The graphics are gorgeous and the visual style is quite fascinating. I saw some wonderful greens, oranges and blues. A real sight for sore eyes.•	You can run through timed race tracks that are fun to complete. A good way to hone your skills.•	Running feels very smooth once you get a hang of the controls. •	There are some really exciting moments, like running towards a fast approaching train. •	The soundtrack is really cool and fits the world and atmosphere perfectly.•	Standing on the edge of tall buildings gives vertigo.Cons:•	Early on in the game the routes might seem confusing or not obvious. Often it’s not clear where you’re supposed to go, the indicators are misleading and so on. What I learned is that the routes that make you think, ""There’s no way in hell I’m supposed to go that way"", turn out to be the right ones.•	The game’s very bright, so it may be straining on people with sensitive eyes. The brightness can always be turned down but I found that this makes the game lose some of its visual appeal. •	Reloading autosaves may place you slightly ahead of where you just were and that might create some confusion. •	The main campaign is short. I believe it can be completed in under 5-6 hours.•	Trying to grab onto ledges and jump off things can sometimes be very frustrating to the point of ragequitting. •	If you’re afraid of heights like I am, then the possibility of falling to your death from tall buildings might create some actual anxiety (or it may be exciting, in which case this point belongs with the pros, not the cons). I must admit that I felt a bit anxious because, whenever you fall, you watch Faith fall until she hits the ground. In conclusion, I'd say that I recommend Mirror's Edge to people who: a) want to play something completely different because this game truly is like no other, b) are looking for a thrill and c) aren't put off by minor gameplay related annoyances.

												Mirror's Edge is one of the few games to get parkour feeling right, you may tussle with the controls at first although you'll quickly adjust. Visually Mirror's Edge is striking and clean, paired with the stellar soundtrack it leads to some unforgettable moments. Conversely, the weakest part of Mirror's Edge by far, the story is bland, uninspired, and sadly forgettable. Despite some flaws, Mirror's Edge is worth playing for the experience alone.			"

												In general terms it is a good game, you don't need to master the movements to enjoy it, but the fluency will be better if you do. Good: It gives the feeling of alternative routes, I never feel like one-track. Bad: Sometimes is not possible to avoid figth. Things to improve: I will include some ""messenger"" missions before the action starts, it will increase how much you go into the plot. The figth is terrible, sometimes your only chance is to run and try to get a weapom, and once you have it... it is extremely easy to kill everybody, a little bit unvalance on this side.			"

A solid concept lacking polish breaks down into tedium and frustrationThere is something to this game that really speaks to people, the free-running first person parkour, when it works, is absolutely amazing.Unfortunately, there's a whole lot of stuff getting in the way of your fun.It's not the plot, the plot is perfectly serviceable. Sure, it starts with your sister being framed for a murder and returns to that big bag of clichés for every new twist and development, but it wasn't bad and the little animated cutscenes did their job (...of masking loading screens, but they're neat too).No, what breaks this game is the lack of polish that was applied to it. The finishing touches. There are many small gripes to be had here (lack of non-hostile characters within levels, level design not making sense from a functional perspective, big bulkhead doors that take half a minute to open, no subtitles for ambient speech like overheard conversations and announcements, shoddy and partially missing directions) but the two main ones are:Bad checkpoints: In a game that is ALL about flow, making your way through complex environments and a certain amount of trial and error in how to approach things it is absolutely critical that messing up does not frustrate too much. The checkpoints as they are now are far too few and far between to accomplish this, and some of them are spaced very weirdly.There's a segment where you're climbing out of a large vertical shaft (it's in the Store page screenshots as well) and one of the checkpoints is right before a valve you need to turn to shut off a stream of water directly behind it. After that comes some tricky platforming, and I had to do that section several times. The problem here is that the game does not remember that you turned off the water, so you're stuck watching Faith perform the same ~8 second animation of turning off the water every single time, on top of the loading screen and unskippable bit where you're falling to your death that is far, far too much time to spend waiting and redoing things. This is only one of many places where I felt the game was far too sparing with the checkpoints, and to add insult to injury the in-chapter progress isn't even saved when you quit the game. You always start back at the beginning of the chapter.The enemies:In Faith's world the worst thing anybody can do is run across rooftops, it is immediate reason to send armed SWAT teams and attack helicopters after them. They shoot first, then shoot some more, and maybe ask questions later but that's not in the game. The justification for that is that you're supposedly carrying top-secret information and messages without the government surveillance catching it... except you don't do that in the game even once.You're able to disarm these enemies when you get close or punch them out, and then pick up their guns and use them but I didn't bother with that and the game very much feels like it doesn't want you to (there's even an achievement for it... you know, on consoles. Because Steam integration is too much to ask from EA).Regardless of whether you choose to engage or avoid these soldiers (they're hardly police forces any more) they will be in your way. Shooting for you as you duck and weave trying to make it to the next too-far-away checkpoint. I get why they're there, they are adding tension to the game.Or parts of the game anyway, their appearance and disappearance is very jarring. Open up an inconspicuous door that is marked as your next target to find a dozen soldiers just lazing around a parking lot in case a Runner (that's you, because you run) decides to come through there. Run your way past them into the elevator, go up a floor (or however many floors, the insides aren't marked with a number) and you're completely in the clear again. The game seems divided into platforming segments and engagement segments, and the transitions are almost always immersion breaking.In the late game the attempts at adding challenge become almost laughably silly, with every door you walk past popping open, revealing a tiny dark room with no other exits and one to three fully armed enemies that were sure you'd be coming this way. Add to that the new agile enemies, which should make the game more interesting since they can follow you around, but who end up doing pretty much the same thing anyway (and are as easily befuddled by you running through a door).For DICE, a studio that was at that point best known for its Battlefield series, this was a huge and impressive step towards something more creative. A first person game built around avoiding fights, with a kick♥♥♥♥♥female protagonist.For Electronic Arts, a publisher known at that point for buying up smaller development studios and turning them into faceless drones that will never make another fun game in their life this was a great moment to show the world they could do something special, something different. Unfortunately, they did not.With an extra 6 months of development and a whole lot more play-testing and polishing this could have been an absolute gem and must-play.As it stands it is a 5-hour eulogy for what could have been.Do not get this game, and be careful with the upcoming sequel, it might have similar problems.

												We saw many games having parkour mechanics such as Assassin's Creed,etc. But when it comes to FPS we dont have any, basically I love FPS having interaction just like as in real life, for example small things like seeing your own legs when you look down, shadow casted by your body, etc. these things are neglected in many games and devs still neglect it, it just feels unrealistic and most of the time you feel like controlling a ghost in the game. However this game pushed the standard boundaries of how an FPS should be, by implementing parkour and various other FPS mechanics. You can chain up your own moves by building up momentum using the environment around you giving a devastating blow to your enemies, this I didnt expect in a game and that too in an FPS!!. The speed run challenges are quite challenging no matter how many times you try there are multiple ways to do it and the most obvious path isnt always the right path... It also features a leaderboard where you can compete your stats with your friends but to do that you need to sign in via origin, the game and your friends should do the same for comparing stats, which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and confusing for some. The soundtracks are awesome! for me its #1 in video games its always relaxing seamlessly free running here and there whilst listening to them, I would listen to it whenever I'am depressed.Yeah its that good and only people who are fond of FPS love it a lot but for others it might be difficult to play or uninteresting. Can't wait for Mirror's Edge 2!!9/10 "

												Hi ... Mirror's tells the story of Faith, a runner in an unnamed city almost completely devoid of personality thanks to the overbearing totalitarian government that rules the region. Faith's job is to deliver important pieces of information to an underground network who still live with a modicum of freedom. She uses her considerable acrobatic abilities to outrun, out-leap, and out-swing ""Blues"" (cops). Throughout the game players learn that Faith's sister, Kate, has been wrongly accused of murder. Faith must clear her name.Have fun ...+ Graphic+ Sound+ Story+ Sympathetic Faith - BugsI recommend !			"

This review is written from the perspective of someone who likes the game a lot, beware of bias and take it with a grain of salt.TL:DR - It’s twenty dollars, so damn cheap for what you get. Unless you are broke, BUY IT.Full Review:Let's start out with what I expected after watching the trailers and pictures:ParkourPretty mapsHand to hand and combatI got my parkour, pretty maps, and hand to hand combat. I also got a short story and very simple but annoying and unforgiving controls.Oh the controls... Given that one of the very important parts of this game is parkour, you would think it would be the most fleshed out and well done part of the game right? Wrong, unless you are on point with your movement every time, the game will punish you with the same old falling animation. Fighting or running away from enemies is a whole other deal. The game has a very simple movement base which can be fun when you fight enemies. Sometimes enemies get weird advantages and knock you down/do a lot of damage that nearly kills you; Some enemies are not meant to be fought so when you do fight them, you know why they are able to nearly instantly kill you. Even though one of the core elements of the game was designed poorly it won’t dock it points for this. Mirror's Edge came out in 2008 and I am willing to bet that not much was done to study how good its combat/movement system was since back then not many games could be used to compare it and see what it lacked/boasted. The art and modeling is so good. Without a doubt in my mind this game has absolutely beautiful looking maps, just visually at least, and even better looking models for props in the game. The maps however don’t feel like they were meant to be used for parkour. With all the clutter everywhere(yes clutter, even though it looks very clean), it is hard to really enjoy the game. I think the mappers did a lazy job of planning the maps which ended up making most maps feel slow, unintuitive, and clunky. A little bit more effort in the development of player movement through the maps would have gone a long way. On Top of all this the maps are relatively small making it very apparent they are linear. But like I said in my previous paragraph this game was made without much to go off of so this feels more like it was an experiment that went pretty well rather than a real game franchise.The sounds/music are just ounces of amazing. This game had extremely good and worked out tracks for different times during each map. The attention in detail to the sound as well as the physical location of the player made this special and memorable. I really is a shame that thanks to its initial unpopularity more people didn’t try this out and get to hear the games music. The sounds for the player and VA for the characters are on point and very good. You can tell what you are doing pretty easily by the sound and it doesn’t get in the way or rip out of the immersion. Certainly no argument here at all.The story in this game was interesting and relevant, but that doesn't really matter as those two descriptions are assigned subjectively. The story is short and lacks implementation. Yes implementation, I don’t mind cut scenes but you could literally play the entire game without ever knowing about the story. It is that loosely attached! Not like it matters since the story itself leaves a few things unanswered but not on purpose. It becomes extremely forced once you get into the later levels. Overall the story is a good idea and concept but it was poorly created and implemented making it feel cheap or unappreciated. This does to me count as a tick against them because it isn’t much effort for a game studio to make a decent story, and Mirror’s Edge story is not even close to being passable.Overall the game is 7.9/10 Not really mediocre just small and unpolished. The ideas behind it are great and a lot of what carries this game is actually the visuals, music, and maybe sometimes the movement. It’s certainly not a triple-a game, at least it wasn’t on its release, expecting a triple-a game is silly. If someone asked me if Mirror’s Edge is a good game for them to buy, I would ask them if what they were looking for was something quick to pick up or a new thing they can invest a few hours in. If you seek a quick game you don’t really want to get into then don’t bother getting this. But if you want something new and interesting you can really sink your teeth into then Mirror's Edge is the game for you.Extra:One of the things I liked the most about this game besides the art, music and gameplay is the fact that this was never even a triple-a game yet it felt like the game had been given access to the kind of resources a triple-a game gets when being developed. It wasn’t pandering and it had its own style instead of a bland mundane repetitive feeling you get from modern triple-a’s but with the quality of one. That’s what made is special to me. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! (hopefully its newfound popularity and hype won’t bog it's prequal(Mirror's Edge: Catalyst) down into another triple-a let down).			"

												We step into the running shoes of Faith, a runner in this fast paced, acrobatic game, which is one of a kind. There aren't many games that combine the action adventure platforming with the first-person genre. The concept is well executed, too bad the game falls short in other areas.In the unknown dystopian city, where crime virtually doesn't exists the Runners are the only ones that disturb the peace achieved by the totalitarian regime. It's a small group of anti-government individuals who can do one thing very well: run... and climb pipes and do acrobatic jumps, but that's (and committing crimes) part of the life style. Our protagonist is one of them, whose sister (a cop on top of that) is caught in political crossfire and arrested for the murder of the mayor candidate. From now on it's on Faith to discover the secrets that lie below the surface.Unfortunately there are no hearth stopping, breath taking moments in the story. It's pretty plain and simple, nothing we haven't seen somewhere else (1984 - Orwell). Likewise the length and scope of the game doesn't allow the story to get to deeper levels. The game can be finished in a mere 4-5 hours. On the other hand the cartoony cut-scenes are a nice touch and the characters are believable thanks to the great voice acting. Mirror's Edge consists of 9 chapters. In every chapter you have to get from point A to point B to complete an objective. It doesn't get any deeper than that, but at least the time spent between the start and finish is fun. The controls are reactive and you can take alternate routes to get an advantage over the riot police or just to be quicker and more efficient. In almost every level there is at least 1 point where you'll find yourself dying in 10-15 seconds after the checkpoint loads. Over and over again until you find the correct route or you can execute your jumps perfectly. These parts are pains, but the most frustrating thing in the gameplay are the gunfights. It's simply not meant to be there. Disarming guards and policemen, then shooting others feels off balanced, weak, and frustrating over all.Faith's story has its flaws, but the game is at its best when you have to do what it's created for: platforming, wall running, jumping from pipe to pipe, rolling, sliding and so on. When you learn the levels and you become more proficient in spotting out the best routes it feels like you are a panther capable of anything. Unfortunately if you aren't in for the challenge of finding the best routes in each map there is not much else the in the game that could keep it installed on your computer for a long time. After finishing the story mode you can jump in and do some time trials, but as I said there isn't anything else beside that (if you don't count the bags which can be found in the story mode - 30 in total).Rating: 68/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 5 hours; Played on: normal.

Mirror's Edge ReviewIn my opinion, this is one of the few games that EA did not ruin. Mirror's Edge to me is a unique title that gave me a breath of fresh, clean air while being in the comfort of my room. I say this because this game's graphics and quality are amazing for the year it came out not to mention it could easily compete with some game graphics today.I've played through Mirror's Edge three times and always find it equally challanging and exciting. Parkour games like Mirror's Edge can definitely have replay value as the game has difficulty settings that will make your Parkour experience much more difficult and a lot more real.I do recommend this game to anyone who is considering to purchase this title.9/10.

The mechanics are for the morepart solid, but I felt that they were abit unpredictable a few times.Overall this game holds up, but I recommend tweaking (sweetFX, FOV-fix and the other basics), to improove the looks/feel of it.I had massiv framedrops when PhysX was enabled, disabling the feature completely fixed the problem (first scene where they shoot at you and the glass breaks is a good bench if you want to test it out).

Mirror's Edge ReviewGame InfoMirror's Edge is an action-adventure platformer developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. The game was announced on July 10, 2007, and was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on January 13, 2009. Mirror's Edge is powered by the Unreal Engine 3, with the addition of a new lighting solution, developed by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE.

Mirror's Edge is set in a quasi-futuristic dystopian society, in which a network of 'runners', including the main character, Faith, act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, through ventilation shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour. The game has a brightly colored style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment, allowing for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.Positives- Nice looking graphics and art style
- Fun parkour movement system
- Nice hand-to-hand combat
- Interesting story that keeps you immersed
- Nice looking cutscenes
Negatives- Gun combat is kinda bad
- Trial and error gameplay can get boring
Score 8/10 "

												Mirror's Edge is, without a doubt, one of my favourite games, ever. I'll glady recommend it to anyone looking for a new, visually spectacular, experience. I keep telling my friends this is one of the few games that they should've played at least once in their life. Unfortunately, no one ever listens. I don't mind though, because let's face it - it's their loss. And while there's definitely room for improvement, what's there is already very solid and lays the groundwork for a possible sequel, minus the story.About the story: Mirror's Edge puts you in the shoes of Faith, who has to clear the name of her sister after being wrongfully accused of murdering someone. Doesn't sound all that exciting ? Well, I might agree with you there. However, it's the way the game is played that makes it fresh and interesting. You see, the game is played from a first person perspective. But instead of shooting your way out (which is optional, but not recommended, for maximum enjoyment) you'll be running. Parkour style. In other words: free running.You'll be running through offices, on rooftops and many other places in order to get to where you want to go, all the while fighting off the police. This is all shown in one of the most beautifully realized environments I've ever laid eyes on (those office interiors ! *drool*). It's truly stunning.Like I mentioned before, the game does have some flaws. First of all, it's short. Many people will complete it in a hour or 4-5. Not terribly long, but not terribly short also. It keeps the experience fun. I personally would've liked it if it was at least twice as long, but it's nothing a sequel can't fix. Besides, the time trials will keep you occupied for days, maybe even weeks. One other thing that can definitely be improved for a possible sequel is the number of routes you can take to get to your destination. Mirror's Edge gives you the illusion of an open world, but in fact there's only one way to get to your objective. Agreed, this way it keeps you focused on the story, but it certainly would've been nice.Not much else I can say, really. This game is the reason why I play games. Play it yourself, and you just might agree with me. Maybe not today, but one day, I'm sure of it.[Rating: 92/100)			"

Pros;-Excellent parkour-Amazing graphics-Beautiful atmosphere-Good musicCons;-Combat feels dull sometimes-Sometimes annoying because you don't have any idea where to go next-Ending was a bit dullOverall a 9,5 game.I recommend it!

												Bought the game at $5, beat it in 5 hours. One of the most amazing experiences I've ever had playing a video game. Granted, there are some times where it gets super frustrating, but when you go back to those levels again (when speedrun mode gets unlocked) you feel like a total badass. Steep Learning CurveAbsolutely BeautifulWorth the $$$, unless it's full price (just too short to justify price)			"

""ONCE THE CITY USED TO PULSE WITH ENERGY. DIRTY AND DANGEROUS, BUT ALIVE AND WONDERFUL. NOW IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.""Digital Illusions CE also known as DICE also known as People That Know What They Are Doing?I won't lie, I didn't play Motorhead that they did in 1998, but it was racing game, and it was pretty good as I heard plenty of times. And so Rallisport from 2002.I won't lie about this one either, I didn't play Benefactor, but it was puzzle platform and it was pretty great too. And it was 1994.Now, why am I talking about these old games, and DICE but not Mirror's Edge? Well, I'm mentioning them, just so people could realise that DICE is more than just Battlefield, Need For Speed and Star Wars. They've been killing it since day one and not just since the 2002 alias Battlefield 1942. But yeah, they did unbelievable games throughout the time and so they did Frostbite too and we love it right?And then, in 2008, somebody had an idea, why don't we make action adventure game, why not some running, jumping, escaping, shooting and fighting game that won't be war related like Battlefield. And so the Mirror's Edge was born, and came out as the hell of a great game. Story is not that deep as you may think, and it's not even long, or medium, for me it was kinda short. I wish it was a little bit longer but it is what it is. Also, I believe that if the game was released like in 2014, EA would already managed to release 2 extra story related DLCs and 4 visual DLCs. But let ""what ifs"" be what ifs. Glass City is absolutely mad beautiful, sounds are fantastic, gameplay and level-design someplace else great, Running through the city is an enjoyable moment. Running thru the Six with my woes. Enemy AI is pretty low, meeting with them is not good at all. But I guess that was the point, and encountering them is not primary thing at all. You should either escape, run over, or defeat them one by one because you cannot win if you go open on more than 2 enemies. Shooting is garbage, I recommend you throwing away weapon once you get it except few levels when sniper is needed.To sum it up, this game is unique, and yes, the Catalyst has been released few months ago, but it does not change the fact that this is the Father, and this is truly awesome game. If you enjoy jumping between skyscrapers and running over everything like Usain Bolt with no fear of heights, there is no way that Mirror's Edge will be repetetive for you anytime soon.Bonus Point: Glass CityRating: 9/10 "

												I love this game - but I also hate it's guts.The game is so freakin' beautiful - but it's sorta a giant pile of bullsh!t.Great idea - kinda horrible execution.You're not really meant to use weapons - enemies have shotguns and are sorta, kinda really great at using them.so on and so forth...Regardless of my steam time played (1.3hrs as of writing this), I beat this game on PC before, and I played it more than half way through again on a friend's 360 a few years ago, so I think I can write a decent short review for it right now.So the pictures and videos don't lie, the graphics look insane for a 2009 game even 7 years later, if they were to replace the character models, and get rid of the ugly comic book/anime cutscenes, or at least animate them a whole lot better, they can easily call it a remaster/remake/redux/re...whatever, and sell it at full price (Origin, though! >_<).The gameplay is pretty decent and freerunning can be really fun when you get into the zone... til you get to a level where the world wants you to die, that is, and every citizen of, whatever this made up city is called, is blasting at you with a shotgun while you're struggling to find that piece of fence that doesn't have barbed wire on top. I mean, in those situations ""rabbit hunting simulator"" would be a better fitting title for the game, with the player being the scared wabbit.Story is there, it's alright I guess, voice acting and music are good, it's all AAA quality I'd say, no need to go into details, you're here to run, dammit!Ending song made a lot of nerdy boys and grils cry, I didn't like it very much, but maybe check out the Benassi remix, I don't know...Anywho, it's a game that can make you hate yourself, and the world, but it's worth a playthrough. I mean you own it already, and if you don't, wtf dude-bro?! it was like $2.5 on sales and in a $1 bundle, I mean c'mon... with the sequel coming out, now is the time to play this fantastic abomination.Final score 7.5/10			"

For one, these graphics are incredibel for the time especially, the game itself is so fun it is stupid, and the mechanics are flawless. Honestly, this is so, so worth your time, despite what negatives you have heard here. If you like parkour or shooters, this is your game, for sure.			"

												This game was one of those rare gems that flew under the radar of the mainstream audience.  A vast departure from what we've expected from DICE, this game featured some of the most unique visuals i've ever seen.  It may be, what, 5 years old, but still holds a place as one of the most unique looking games ever with it's trippy color scheme and the awesome Unreal Engine 3 powering it.  Parkour, featuring shooting elements, highlight Faith's trip through this beautiful city.  The small details in the graphics, such as motion blur and even the dust particles when you land after a massive jump make this experience feel real at times.  It's made me wish i had the ability to do stunts as this.  Engaging gameplay, cool puzzles, and oh, the Atrium.........neat game and cant wait for the sequel.9/10			"

												This game is pretty decent, but I would say is fairly niche. I'm gonna keep this review simple.Pros: Concept is seemingly uniqueThe art direction of the game makes look even good 7+ years later.Cons: Very short campaign. I beat it in less than 7 hours and there's not much of an incentive to go back and replay the levels since there's no achievements or to my knowledge, unlockables.The game crashed on me a couple of times. Keep in mind that you might not have this particular issue.There were a few times in the game I was completely stumped on where to go, which was weird because aside from those two or three instances, the game seems to do a pretty good job of giving you at least a faint idea of where to go. So... semi-con I guess?Overall, I'd say pick this game up. Just wait until it's on sale though as I think this game is more worth like, $15 nowadays.			"

												Best first person platformer I played. The parkour mechanics is somewhat realistic and not terribly over-exaggerated. Despite the game being over 5 years old, the graphics on this game is suprisingly good, even scales up to 4k resolution.Also this game is supposed to be great with VR so this game would still be relevant in the foreseeable future.The story was ok, but the presentation of it was unique with the anime-ish type of cutscene. Unfortunately, the main story was just 4 hour long not counting the speedruin challenges. IMO, this game is only worth it @ 50% so better get it now this winter sale			"

												I wanted so badly to like this game.  I love the idea, I love the graphics, I love the setting - but the gameplay is just godawful frustrating.  The controls are sluggish and finicky in places.  Some actions - climbing up ledges, swinging on horizontal bars - are  smooth as butter, but some parts - grabbing onto vertical pipes, certain jumps off a wall-run - just never seem to work right.  The melee combat is awful, especially the disarming mechanic.  Put all these things together with checkpoint saves and a lot of trial-and-error, try-die-repeat to figure out how to get past an area, and you get a really repetitive, frustrating game.  The fun bleeds away pretty quickly once you're having to repeat the same sequence of jumps twenty times over in order to retry the one jump you keep missing because the controls are so fussy.Got it on sale, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.  Maybe I'll come back to it and try to finish it at some point, but I've got better things to do with my time just now.			"

												I woke up to see this game in the steam store, I quickly downloaded it to see what the hype was all about, as soon as it was downloaded I was about to click the play button when all of a sudden I got a knock at the door, I was startled at first so I jumped up to check the peep hole, and whoever it was on the other side had their finger over it so I got suspicious an grabbed my gun, I yelled ""who's there!?"" No reply so I asked once more... I got the same silence so after contemplating for the next several minutes I decided to open the door.My initial reaction was to shoot....BANG...BANG...BANG... I stood in shock as I found out it was my american stepbrother.I was in tears, he was dead, all three of my rounds had entered his heart...but then I looked down he had his laptop in his hands...with this exact game running. He had come over to see if I had bought and downloaded it because this game is so awesome. So I played Mirror's Edge™ on his laptop for many hours, over his cold dead body...8/10 Would shoot again.

												Do you like parkour ? Do you like the colour white ? Do you like tattoos ? Do you like cartoons ? Do you like the sound of broken bones? If you like these key elemets , you will need to get the game :) Joke aside , this is one of the games you must play at least once in your life time ...  The story To be honest it's pretty OK , the problem here is the writers , they presented it in a pretty mediocre way , and most of the story is told in the form of animated cutscenes, which can break immersion to some folk, i myself enjoyed them. (The art style they used is fairly unique) The story goes like this , you are a Runner , which bassicly is a parkour ninja courier , one day your Lucy Liu look-alike sister gets in trouble and you need to help her. I was saying earlier that the writing is nothing to brag about , a good example of this is the few dramatic moments of the game are not dramatic at all due to the fact that the character development is pretty much nonexistent, this game is an action-puzzle solving game so treat it like an action movie you won't expect some top notch story , you will expect some action ! Which is exactly where the game shines , in the gameplay, It's a very fresh experience , you  parkour your way out of level to level , sometimes you shoot your way out , with a suprisingly varied and realistic arsenal or by punching or kicking . It's pretty linear and the puzzles aren't that complicated , but that ain't much of a problem, A suprisng thing is that even the gameplay is pretty linear , it's not repetitive at all. The replayability factor is also there , after you finished the game , you can play it again and try to speed run it in under an hour.  Talking about how long it is , if it's your first time around the game , it will take you in the vecinity of five hours.   Visuals Pretty bland , most of the time you're feeling like you're in a hospital with all that white , it's something along the lines of Sin City, graphicly speaking altough it's a fairly old game (2008), the textures and models are pretty OK.  Soundtrack The classic combo between repetitive and boring ambient music and then the drumy and annoying fight music , this game truly needed a better soundtrack for example some really melodic chillstep during the puzzle solving part and some hard core dubstep during the fights , i really think a good soundtrack would have tied this game alot better. A cool thing about this game is that technically it's pretty well made , very few glitches and a very stable engine, no crashes, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (all hail Unreal Engine). All in all , a pretty neat game , i highly reccomend buying it during a sale , you'll have a pleasant experience. I hear it's prequel is pretty nice too, so check that out too.			"

												This is an older game I already bought when it came out. I am having huge interest in Parkour so I thought this might be a cool game. And it is. It´s fun, challanging and has a pretty simple story to it. The main character has not much depth, but is still very likeable.The gameplay is good for someone who has patient. It´s like a raceing game with some action elements to it. The speedruns are fun, the ""combat"" has a nice twist to it (I love choosing to not kill anyone or taking a gun).I can´t wait for the new Mirror´s Edge to come out! :)			"

												Quite a unique gameplay experience, and the graphic style still holds up today despite being almost 10 years old.Mirror's Edge is a parkour game where you play as the main protagonist, Faith, a rooftop courrier known as a ''Runner''. The gameplay is pretty simple once you get the hang of it, but it sure feels rewarding to get to the end of certain levels. There's also a speedrunning aspect integrated into the game, where you can try to beat the best times for each level, and compete against other people's times.The campaign story is pretty linear, and isn't nearly as good as the gameplay itself (it's still a nice addition.) It's a about 6 hours long, a standard for the time and I feel like it's neither too short nor too long.I would recommend getting this, especially if you're a fan of parkour and well coded gameplay mechanics.

												I'm honestly not sure if recommended is the right term for this game. This game feels like a testbed for an entire sub-genre, the First Person Platformer, its so far is the only unique example of it and it shows. When the game is in its stride it feels exhilarating to play with an amazing sense of direction and unique style in graphics that really has stopped it looking dated several years later. Unfortunately the combat sequences can feel really out of place and can get frustrating very quickly and the game can quickly confuse the player about where exactly they need to be to the point where you have to look up videos on Youtube just to get an idea of where you are supposed to be. These two negatives can also get happen all at once which only serves to unduly stress the player. The story itself is also a letdown with no real talking points or standout characters excluding that of the protagonist Faith.So with two glaring flaws why do I give this the thumbs up? I feel simply the concept that this game shows is full of potential, if DICE can iron out these flaws in the upcoming sequel it could really fly. There is something about this game that I just can't put my finger on, but it none of the less makes me excited to see if DICE can properly bake the formula into something incredible in the sequel.

												The game consists of story segments followed by a dash from one place to the next, usually chased by the police.  I love the clean bright look of the game. It really enhances the feeling of space and freedom as you are leaping about. The main challenge is to discover  where you have to go, while being chased, which leads to repeated ""death by bullets"",  and you just having to replay the section again and again until you discover the exit. But the constant race to avoid death leads to the game being very rushed, which somewhat undermines it because you can't take in all that  freedom and space.  Personally, I think they would have done better not having the police chasing you everywhere. It really wasn't necessary. Having said that, it's still an enjoyable game and one I have no reservation in recommending.			"

												It's hard to believe Mirror Edge already is six years old but this game has been one of the greatest experiences for me ever since. Mirror Edge was original because it was the first game to introduce parkour into a first person game. For the most part of the game you're unarmed trying to escape from trigger happy police. You are able to slide kick or punch enemies and you are even able to take their weapons. Guns carry a few bullets so you won't kill that many opponents but that's alright since it's not what this game is about. Most of my favourite games have a great story but Mirror Edge is an exception. It's not like the story is bad but it's not great either. What makes Mirror Edge one of my favourites is simple: Atmosphere. It's just amazing to run around sky high buildings, escaping from the police. The buildings all look white and clean even the indoor industrial areas look clean which are just great to look at. Even falling down from tall buildings was something I enjoyed and made dying a lot easier.... in a way.The graphics are still great for a 2009 + Mirror Edge has a great OST. This game is not recommended to people who want to kill lots of enemies but everyone else who is open to new things should really try this game at least once in your life.			"

												Mirror's Edge is brilliant! It's a one of a kind game that combined first person and parkour remarkably well together. The graphics are stunning given that this game was released back in 2009. Besides that, the story is distinctively outstanding too. This game has a rather unique storyline that was carefully crafted for this game, but at the same time also allows you to realize how seemingly true it is and reflect on the fact that this is something that can one day happen to us as well. According to Wikipedia and I edited it a little, the story of Mirror’s Edge takes place in an unnamed 'utopian' city where life is seemingly comfortable and crime almost non-existent. But the city's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and totalitarian government that monitors all communication, controls the media, have policies which include the outright illegalisation of smoking and alcohol. The City also operates sham trials, and runs on a sham democracy. Eighteen years before the events of the game they had also opened fire on a major protest against their deceitful rule, killing many civilians. The story is actually rather similar to present-day situations in real life where in some parts of the world, democratic system is failing and corrupted governments are simply clinging onto their power through fake democracy or dictatorship where they exert extensive control on things like the media and internet and also prioritize monetary gain while neglecting human rights and the environment. So it shouldn't be surprising that the scenario in game can quite possibly happen to us one day if we continue progressing down the current path without making much effort to create positive changes. Well, rant over lol. Anyway, it’s definitely worth giving this awesome game a try especially if you are blessed with the capability of not feeling motion sickness when there's a lot of movements on screen. Also, looking forward to Mirror's Edge Catalyst! :D			"

												Mirror's Edge is one of a kind type of game.  Superb graphics that really utilizes color well to create a surreal world while also using color to help guide you through the levels.  You are running from the authoritarian government and must not be caught throughout the game.  This is where this game is unique.  This is not a first person game where weapons will save your life, though weapons are available if you steal one from the government goons.  This is a game about parcour.  You run, jump, slide and slam your way through doors.  If you do so fluidly, you will gain more momentum, more speed, and the game seems perfect and so organic when this happens.  However, it's difficult to attain this type of fluidity.  The game is challenging, but this is what makes the game so attractive to me.  The challenge, the uniqueness and the sheer beauty of the game makes this an easily recommended title for all to try at least once.  This is a must have game for all gamers.			"

												This game was a major breakthrough in the gaming world. Parkour hasn't been addressed much in any game until Mirrors Edge came out. There are a few ninja games (or splinter cell games) that had a bit of these abilities available but it wasn't until this game came out that parkour started exploding (besides the youtube videos). I beat this game on xbox 360 and here I am again for more. You are a girl named Faith running through a city that is poison for runners (as her kind is called). These runners are pursued by ""police"" relentlessly until a potential mayoral candidate is found assassinated at his desk with Faith's sister (who is a police officer) right besides him. The story starts lifting more questions than any wrestling sitcom ever would.The gameplay itself is fairly good, especially for it's age (released 2008). Controls include jump, slide, punch, kicking while sliding, disarming, time distortion (slow), turning 180 on a press of a button and another button for hint. Sprint happens gradually as you gain momentum and hold LS all the way up. RS will allow you to move your head as you'd like even when climbing a pipe or ladder. Some of the grab controls feel clunkier on PC than they did on xbox. By that I mean you have to be very direct in where you point and how you jump. If, for example, you are jumping ledge to ledge and decide to jump from a diagonal, you may encounter issues in Faith grabbing the ledge. Sometimes it will catch (depending on where you're facing). Other times, you will fall miserably to your death from hundreds of feet. Besides that little hiccup, most of the game feels right on. Besides zip lining and running and jumping on ledges, the player can jump from some insane heights, run along the wall to reach another ledge and even combine sliding (crouching) and jumping under and over obstacles. All these mechanics put together with the pressure of evading bullets really combines for a neat and exhilarating game.To help the player figure out where to go, pressing B will point you in the right direction. It can be a bit confusing at times as not knowing what to use to maximize your parkour skills can be difficult. Fortunately, the developers chose to go with a simplistic graphics scheme. This simplicity does not take away from the game. Rather, it accentuates what's really important about it. The graphics using a minimalist design not only helps the player recognize tools they may use, but also gives the game a unique personality. Concerning the animations, they aren't the best but certainly aren't the worst. Some disarming scenes may feel a bit funny to watch. Would have been nice if they gave you more control in this situation! You will see faiths hands or feet appear on the screen as you jump (which is a great addition). Sounds and effects are pretty good. You'll hear Faith pant when she gets tired or a clunk when she misses something (or a big thump when she falls to her death). I think they could have done a little bit more with the sound to incorporate more of an ambiance.Overall, this game is definitely recommended. I'm not sure how it's predecessor will live up, but this is the game that made parkour ""famous"". The physics in this game were definitely a break through and a lot of other games have attempted to emulate such movement. When it first came out, it was easily an 8.5. Due to it's age...RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay A- Story / Campaign A- Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  BScreenShots : Getting shot at?

												Pros:Completed this game in 5 hours, great action, a couple of jump scares when the enemies parkour chase you. Great graphics for a 2009 game, easily 60+fps while maxed out settings. Interesting storyline, kind of a mix of dystopian and utopian themes all at once. Near-futuristic buildings look awesome at first, then after a while they all start to look the same. The soundtrack was good also.Cons:Although, I wish there was more to this game as it's really easily completable. Cutscenes are really low quality, low framerate, compared to the actual game. "

Completed the game on PS3, and was surprised to find this game on PC looks beautiful still compared to recent games, at least on the highest settings. It definitely has aged well!9.5/10 imo; the story isn't as enriching as the environments and gameplay, but good enough to make playing the game worthwhile.			"

												Overall, this game was very well done, it was new for it's time and I still consider it revolutionary. Parts may frustrate you and seem glitchy, and the control scheme takes a while to get down pat as well as how Faith (main character) moves. But I'd still highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to try something new.			"

												Flow and rhythm, finesse and brute force. These factors mingle together with this game. The way it feels, plays, looks and sounds are all something beyond most games released at the time Mirror's Edge was. If it wasnt for the constant Kruger city police chasing the character through everything, I'd just camp out in this game and watch and listen to everything it has to offer. The DICE graphical texturing mixed with Solar Fields superfluous soundtrack create such a deep atmostphere that this is one of those games that grabbed me and made me finish the whole thing in one RUN. (hah get it).I can't even review this game properly like Transistor. I would just urge you at most to try it out and if not at least go listen to the sound track for bit. This is'nt the mess that Mirror's Edge Catalyst became.			"

												Bought this after all the hype about this game. I was utterly disappointed. Here is a breakdown of pros and cons:Pros:- Great graphics even 6 years after its release- Some of the pakour part is funCons:- Extremely frustrating control and game play, just plain annoying sometimes- The physics doesn't make any sense, certain short juimps are impossible to make, while some of the seemingly impossible jumps are part of requirement to finish the story- There is essentially no plot- I have no idea why they use the cheap 2D water colour style animation - they look terrible. For their super short lengths, do the designer really have to save more money by not doing 3D animation?- The fighting is just plain frustrating- There is one way to do everything, no alternatives whatsoever, if you aren't able to read designer's mind, you are SOL- The objective is never clear, you are spending the entire game figuring out where to go (most of which makes no sense). The designers must be too lazy to put any real puzzles to challenge the player.- The checkpoint system is utterly frustrating - sometimes failing one obstacle could cause you to have to redo 10 obstacles, why not just allow the player to save?After finishing the game, I had to ask myself, what's the point of this game? I basically spend 7 hours getting frustrated and annoyed most of the time, and there is minimal enjoyment. I'm deleting the game right away and will never touch it again. Too bad I wasted money on this.			"

												I finally got my hands on this game, after all these years. So many times have I heard how good this game is.First of all, the game looks stunning for such an ""old"" game.Also this whole fps parkour concept was really unique and it had really good potential.Well that was really most of the things I enjoyed in Mirror's Edge.Most of the times I just hoped for the game to end, which by the way was really short. It could easily be beaten in three hours if you play in normal difficulty and you don't easily get killed by the bad AI or fall to your death because of the clunky controls.The story was interesting in the start, but it didn't take long when it didn't interest me anymore by being so poor and short. Even the ending was odd and it just stopped way too early. Cutscenes between the chapters were really cheap looking. Like did EA stop funding DICE in the middle of the production?Combat was one of the worst things here. I can't name any other fps with combat bad as in Mirror's Edge. Fighting with fisticuffs almost made me cry. Disarming an opponent was made a bit too hard and clumsy. Sometimes it would have been nice to sneak and skip a fight, but somehow the AI knows exactly where I am, and then most of the times I cannot escape from their rain of fire.The clunky controls were one of the reason I wanted to quit the game numerous times. Mostly the game did not do what I wanted it to do. Sometimes it didn't want to grab a certain ledge, jump at the right time, nor did anything smoothly as excpected. For example sometimes I lost all of my speed when Faith did not want to run to a step, which was few inches high (so she stopped and I had to jump on it). Also it was really common that Faith got stuck in certain points and it made me fail my jump.Now I know people will say that I will get better with the clumsy controls if I play more. But the problem is, the game is so short and it has no replay value. Also there is a time trial gamemode, but I dont really want to touch it after the storymode.I bought it from the summer sale for a few euros, but sadly it wasn't really worth it. I really wanted to like this game...I give it 5/10.			"

												In 2008 DICE released a beautiful game: Mirror’s Edge!It’s a first-person action adventure game but movement and graphics are a unique, Mirror’s Edge was an innovation and is still a fantastic game. It’s one of the games I’ve played multiple times and one of that I played without a break. This game should be in every library on steam.StoryMirror’s Edge takes place in a unnamed, modern city where life is comfortable and crime almost non-existent. But the government is a totalitarianism regime which spies all communications and controls the media. People have to give up their personal freedom in this world. That’s the background story. I won’t tell more about the story because that would spoiler youGameplayAs I said above, the gameplay is unique and a real innovation, because you have a freedom of movement in the world you’ll have never seen in any game before. Faith is a runner, she has the ability to fight in melee [you can disarm enemies and use their weapons against them] and she’s a master in parkour running so you can use the complete environment to move forward. If you chain your movements you can build up a lot of speed. For example: You run a little bit, do a wall run, than you roll up on the floor and you continue to run with full speed. If you make any mistakes, you lose your speed. Faith is also able to knock out enemies with her body. For example she can use a wall run to build up speed and then jump to an enemy and kick him down or you disarm an enemy, knock him down and use the weapon against the others. But combat isn’t the focus, you can bypass the most situations, it’s better to run. The gameplay in Mirror’s Edge is so much fun unfortunately only the sequel Mirror’s Edge Catalyst has the same.A nice feature is that the camera is linked with the movement and that you see the body including arms and legs from Faith. Thanks to this you have a realistic feeling while playing this game.Graphic/SoundSurely you have already seen it, the graphics are very bright and have only a few colors, most of the time you see white. This is a special feature in Mirror’s Edge. It has its own art style which is very clean, almost clinically clean and minimalistic, it’s just beautiful. But it not only looks fantastic, it’s useful to retain the overview in the world. Also it matches to the city and the society, it accompanies the setting perfectly.The voice act is very nice like the complete soundscape. If you like ambient music, you’ll like the soundtrack here too. Solar Fields did a great job, the soundtrack is fantastic and Lisa Miskovsky created a masterpiece with Still Alive [not confuse with the Portal soundtrack].AtmosphereWith the unique graphic, the fascinating gameplay and the fantastic world Mirror’s Edge has its own very nice atmosphere. You are a lonely runner and most of the times you don’t see any allies, just hearing the voices and see enemies. You are against the world, a rebel refuses to be suppressed by the system that enslaves the people.Mirror’s Edge is one of the most unique games out there and a real masterpiece including many innovations. With a nice story, an impressive art style, a great soundtrack and an innovative and interesting gameplay you have more than one reason to buy this. I also recommend you Mirror’s Edge Catalyst, the sequel. It’s different because it has an open-world but it’s a nice game too. Unfortunately that you have to use Origin to play this.			"

												I remember when this game first came out in 2009. I didn't even know what it was, not the slightest idea. I picked it up on PS3 for roughly $80 AUD going from only the pictures that were on the back of the cover. When I got home of course I just had to boot it up straight away and at the time the first thing I remember was my eyes just lighting up, like I've just seen the best thing ever and nothing could top this. I was hooked and nothing stopped me from finishing the game in one sitting, the next day I had to tell everyone I loved it.The game itself has aged well, it's still the same old original game I played back then. It's still stunning to look at, it's bright and unique like nothing you have seen before. The soundtrack is beautiful and calming and the sense of speed gets your heart racing. The keyboard and mouse works great and so does a controller straight out of the box, there's plenty of options to set and the game overall is optimized pretty well if not great. Now the story is simple sometimes it's comic styled and other times it's in game cutscenes but it's as average as you'd get for a parkour game... still it does it's job well, the plot gets you by surprise and the ending has a nice tone to it.Now a few things that are not the best, the first thing is well clearly it's not a game for everyone and that's fine you might just go into it and think well this is stupid. The gun mechanics are underwhelming so most of the time you'll find yourself avoiding it altogether. For AMD users as always the NVIDIA physics will destroy your fps but you can just simply switch it off which is good.Overall I think the game is amazing it might be the nostalgia talking but if you see this on sale for cheap, give it a try I'm sure you'll end up liking it just as much as I did.

												""It's not for me"", is all I can say about this game. People say it's an awesome, enjoyable experience, but for me, it just boggled my mind.The overworld is huge and confusing, I had no idea what I was supposed to do, barely ever, and no idea where I was supposed to go, and I found it super hard to do anything as the controls were weird too.But, the game just made me feel kind of anxious and ill, with all the jumping around and movement, I felt kind of motion sick after a while, and the ""chase encounters"" from the baddies just made me feel genuinely scared because I felt so out of control of my character. So, I did not complete this game, nor do I think I'll revisit. Sadly, I just think it isn't for me. And that's okay! You're allowed to not like some games. And for me, this is one of mine.Nilesy			"

												Mirror’s Edge is a unique first person parkour game set in a stunning, beautiful futuristic world. I had a lot of fun playing this game! The music is phenomenal, the graphics are great, and its very original. My only beef with this game is that the combat system is terrible, you are constantly being chased while defenceless, and it has a lot of frame rate issues when other NPCs come out. I have a really nice computer so I know that the frame rate problem isn't due to my specs. I searched the web to see if any one else has frame rate issues while NPCs arrive and I found that TONS of people have the same issue. Overall, Mirror’s Edge is great game despite its irritating combat system and frame rate issues. I would recommend picking this game up while its on sale. I give Mirror’s Edge a 7.9/10.			"

												Parkour forms the base of this game. Jumping from one place to another running on railway tracks add the glossy primary colours forming the environment add to the X factor of the game, but slowly the game becomes repetitive.The story line is not that compelling and won't grip you for long, the environment starts to pinch your eyes. The game requires you to do the same things again and again.  I will still recommend this game for the unique design and one of a kind Parkour experience,  and though it does become repetitive, it still needs one shot to know that it's way better than most of the games out there.

I've played it around 2010 and lost the cd so after it was on sale on steam i bought it.There is nothing special to say about this game, it's a parcour game where you got control over a runner who is called Faith, im not going to spoiler more :)I finished the game in around 5 hours, good players are way faster.Good:-Different difficulty levels (they aren't that different imho)-The Enemy-KI is acceptable (cops are easy, pursuit cops are hard)-A lot of weapons (pistol, machine gun, shotgun, etc.)-Easy Control (easy to learn)-Good Graphic and Sound (it can contest many 2017 games)-The game is running fast, stable and the checkpoints are good setted-The Runners-Vision (doors, pipes, etc. are red, so you know where to go next) is a good help for new players-One fail (failed a jump in example) leads to death most of the time, first annoying, but very realistic-If the cops are shooting at you, you will run faster automatically, trust me :) -Most of the time you can avoid fights with cops and you are able to just run away or fight them, disarm them etc.-Extra stuff like artworks, music, video sequences and eastereggsNot so good:-New players will not be that fast, but if you are experienced you will beatthe game in around 3-5 hours, the 8 chapters aren't that big, could be more :)-It's always like go to this building, escape from the cops, a little bit boring-Roofs are most of the time looking the sameBugfix:If the game starts lagging really hard if the cops are shooting on you or glass shatters, you just have to disable ""Nvidia PhysX"" in the options ingame, you have to restart the game after and now it dosen't lag or freezes anymore (some graphic cards got problems with physx).What i can say:If the game is on sale (no idea why old games are always so expensive) and you want to give it a try, i can highly recommend it.

												I really can't say I know of any games quite like this one. It may be short, but it leaves one heck of an impact, and will easily draw you in for more. Having previously played it on the Xbox 360, I can attest that while you can finish the whole story in one sitting with relative ease, you'll likely be playing the bits you liked over and over again.The story is where the game really shines. You quickly learn that the primarily trigger-based controls are, while unique, pretty intuitive after a while. Everything in the game feels natural pretty quickly. Finding a path, stringing together acrobatic moves, and generally making your way around. Only the combat really feels stilted, with a same few punch animations. You're mostly encouraged simply to disarm opponents by tapping the Y button when their weapon is highlighted, which gives you their gun and instantly knocks them out. This can get tedious, but pacifist runs are possible.The cutscenes have an animated comic sort of look to them. This is decent enough for getting the point across. The plot exists, primarily to get you between things to run around. It does a well enough job, and has quite a few surprises for only ten levels. The actual story levels themselves are like a combined puzzle platformer, as you mull over how to get where you're going and pull off some intensely satisfying parkour once you get the hang of it. The color scheme and lighting keeps the areas distinct from each other and easy on the eyes. It's a very particular, stylized look that benefits the game well.As for replay value, as the main story is short and sweet (it does not overstay its welcome by any stretch, but you may be expecting a bit more at the end), the game banks on you enjoying time trials. Really, really enjoying time trials. Because that's all there is. No other challenges in any way, shape, or form, just be the fastest. To be fair, it's quite clear the game is designed for this exact purpose when you start shaving valuable seconds off and learning how to keep momentum going throughout your run, but if you don't like them, already got the three runner bags hidden in each level, and, for whatever reason, don't feel a little thrill at pulling an awesome time off, you've pretty much finished the game as soon as the credits roll.The music is excellently fitting. The game overall can put a fantastic feeling of adrenaline into you, and a feeling of success when you figure out a new way through a level. There's no faster way to give someone a fear of heights than having them fall to their death in this game. The loading times are almost gone in the PC version (only three ""Loading Level"" screens still appeared for me), but the lengthy elevator rides and various delays meant to mask them are still perfectly intact, leading to some rather pointless waiting in the middle of a good run. Finally, the time trial scores are not registered through Steam. They are tracked through an EA Online account, which basically means you will not be finding your friend's times and racing your ghosts without a lot of undue effort.In the end, though, this is quite the amazing game, and I must still recommend it, if only because it leaves an amazing impression and stands alone as an experience. There's just nothing quite like it.			"

												Having owned this game on PS3 I think this game really comes into it's own on PC. It is infinitely smoother and it feels like it was made for M/KB.Had to change the controls to make jump and crouch LMB and RMB, would recommend people struggling with the controls do the same.Can't wait for catalyst to come out.

												Really great game built on a really good engine. The graphics are superb even though they are somewhat simplistic. It keeps you focused on the game and finding a path through each level (there are many differrent paths in each level). The story line is great however I think that they should have given more background information at the start of the game with a short movie as there are several things that don't get explained till well into the game which would make more sense if the backstory was told properly at the beginning.Still I love this game and am looking forward to Mirror's Edge 2.10/10 from me!

												Although the campaign is easily 4 hours long on normal difficulty, I would still recommend this game to anybody of all tastes. This is a unique blend of first-person action and platformer style puzzle solving. Although the story isn't very engaging, it fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.

												A very good and intresting game. The game is unique in its own way. I really enjoy the parkour mechanics of the game, it is original and I have yet to experience anything like it in other titles. The world design is briliant, it is very clean and beautiful. Considering the game was realesed in 2009 makes it even more impressive. The graphics is really ""up to date"".There are also a few things I did not like. The story is not the best and the gun play (whitch does appear frequently) is terrible. You cannot aim, you can't see your current ammo and you can't reload. This can be really frustrating in clutch scenarios and it does not help that the crosshair is bad.However, I would recommend this game to all the people that are looking for a parkour/running game with cool ""jumps"" and different ways to reach the target. The game is good on what it does, but not really anything more.I would like to excuse for any grammar or spelling mistakes, english is not my main language :)			"

												1) Essential purchase2) Recommended purchase3) Recommended purchase during a sale4) Not recommended unless heavily discounted5) Not even recommended for Steam game collectorsThis is one of those rare games. It's not about parkour. It's not about killing the enemy. It's not about getting to the end. No, Mirror's Edge is much more. It's more about the place in which the atmosphere and music takes me. I can be standing on top of a rooftop looking out to the corrupt and broken city with its glimmering skyscrapers and effecient infrastructure. Or I can be hiding in out in a maintenance room listening to the whirling sounds of various pieces of machinery compliment the ambient soundtrack. No matter where I am in this game, I am always taken away, and it's that reason alone, that tiny reason, is why I love this game to death.			"

Product received for free
												Played this in 2016, it does look good! Count around 6 hours of playing if you're like me and don't care about all hidden secrets but prefer running & playing the story. 6 hours isn't much, but eh, I got the game for free, and I enjoyed those 6 hours, so :) The gameplay is very interesting, I played the entire thing with a xbox controller, and it's pleasant. The gunfights didn't exacly felt right (maybe it's the controller, go figure), but I still enjoyed to ""shotgun those ninja's faces"" (play it to understand!). I got about 3 or 4 good adrenaline rushes, but also felt like the game felt me 3 or 4 times (like: I swear I pushed the right button and I fell - and died - anyway. not kewl!). It's technical, but in general it goes quite smoothly, and the overall feeling is really good : run, run, (jump), run.The story itself isn't really interesting, the plot has some severe holes in it... but it does make sense to run like a crazy-person and jump from roof to roof if you can look past these inconsistencies, and I believe that's the main point of this game. I could somewhat compare it to Dying Light freerun on top of which you'd add new moves.Anyway, despite it being an ""old"" game in 2016, despite the story that could have been better and the lifespan double, I still recommend it to about anyone.

												I have extensively played this game through over and over.With the new game (and beta) on the horizon i thought i'd play through it again.When it's free-flowing, there's no game like it.However, gun play and sticky combat prevent it from being a completely free flowing design.There IS a story here, even if parts get lost in cartoon-like cutscenes and dodgy dialogue.I recommend this game to anyone to get an idea of what Mirrors Edge is all about before they buy Catalyst9the new game).

												Mirror's Edge is a First Person Parcour Shooter... thingy.. I guess?You're playing the role of Faith, a girl having lost her parents and having only her sister left. She meets Merc, the head of the gang or organisation called the ""Runners"". He trains her in the art of.. well.. running, and using the rooftops of the city to their advantage. Essentially they are what one could call delivery people (don't quote me on that, I played it early morning so I don't remember much of the beginning).After a short parcour and CQC tutorial you're being thrown right into the game, the only help you get is the so called ""Runner's Vision"" giving you hints on where to go. Even with this help I was sometimes struggling to find the correct pathway, even though the levels are mostly linear, only giving you no more than a few ways from one area to the next.Personally I really enjoyed the game. My only problem was incredible FPS drops in areas with shattered glas or when I've been shot at. To fix this you have to delete a folder and two files from the game files because those are outdated drivers which EA included for some ♥♥♥♥ing stupid reason.Anyway, you should really give this classic a try because even on the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers (my laptop is from 2011) you can play this game on maximum settings and it looks absolutely beautiful.

												TL; DR:Mirror's edge was okay.The game play was the best and most infuriating part of the game. The hand to hand combat was a bit clunky and the disarms had to be timed perfectly. However, the guns were powerful and very fun to use I found myself wishing the game allowed you to parkour with the machine guns instead of having to drop them to continue. The parkour was enjoyable, fast and fluid for 60% of the game the other 40% was frustrating, repetitive and boring.The visuals were nice and unique being a bit more memorable than the parkour. The soundtrack is forgettable for the most part but still not bad.The story is like a modern CoD game; there isn't much.The game is different but okay not amazing, not bad, but okay. I do recommend the game, however you should play any unplayed games in your library first before buying this game.It takes 8-12 hours to beat the game and I would rate it a 6/10.			"

												Mirror's Edge, when it ""works"", is a fun game.  The ability to run, slide, leap and climb feels wonderful when it comes together.  The story is pretty ""meh"" but you don't play ME for the story.Where it falls apart is the difficulty of executing some of the moves.  I'm not used to playing platformers so maybe this is on me, but there were lots of places where I jumped, died, jumped, died, jumped, died, .... etc.  Until somehow, thru what seemed like sheer luck, I happened to hit it right.   There were one or two jumps where I'm absolutely sure I was executing them right, but until I invoked ""bullet time"" (or whatever it's called) they didn't work.  Even worse, in some cases the game sends you back to an earlier checkpoint where you then get to execute a couple of other finicky moves.  Yes, I did get better at it, but a few things like wall running felt hit or miss the whole way thru.  That stuff turned what would have been a fun runthru into an exercise in exasperated persistence.All that being said, it is a fun game, just be prepared to get annoyed.			"

												I first played this game back in 2009 when it came out and I still play it to this very day from time to time.Gameplay is smooth with the perfect mix of realism and arcade elements to still make it a game. It really feels like you flow through the levels, quickly fight back (or escape) an enemy and get back on track running towards your goal. The game has also some of the greatests vistas of urban landscapes I have ever witnessed in a videogame. The level design is remarkably beautiful to date.Some negative aspects I could drag your attention to are its lenght and the way the story is presented. The game is short, no doubt. Although it offers a certain level or replayability because of its open level design, each time you play it you will finish it faster (but we can say that about just any game, can't we?). As for the story, it feels like it is just there; a filler that gives you a reason to run from point A to point B. But you do not really get into it and what you actually do in the game does not feel too much related to its further development.However, I do not think they are game breaking or that the experience suffers as a whole from these two elements, otherwise I would not have been playing it for the past 5 years, let alone recommend it.

												   Mirror's Edge brings a new style to gaming. It's futuristic vividly colored landscapes and parkour style adds a new depth to the game. Although the campaign is rather short and the multiplayer aspect seems limited, it was a breath taking game that I'd never tried before. The ending will want you grasping for the sequel.			"

												Good games never getting old. This is one of the not many projects which still manages to stand out from the crowd... as mysterious Faith. It is not about hardcore gameplay. It's all about master's mix of great music, colors and fascinating movements of parkour.If you want to feel that energy but can't jog right now - try this and I think you'll like.			"

												I first played this game back in 2009 when it came out and I still play it to this very day from time to time.Gameplay is smooth with the perfect mix of realism and arcade elements to still make it a game. It really feels like you flow through the levels, quickly fight back (or escape) an enemy and get back on track running towards your goal. The game has also some of the greatests vistas of urban landscapes I have ever witnessed in a videogame. The level design is remarkably beautiful to date.Some negative aspects I could drag your attention to are its lenght and the way the story is presented. The game is short, no doubt. Although it offers a certain level or replayability because of its open level design, each time you play it you will finish it faster (but we can say that about just any game, can't we?). As for the story, it feels like it is just there; a filler that gives you a reason to run from point A to point B. But you do not really get into it and what you actually do in the game does not feel too much related to its further development.However, I do not think they are game breaking or that the experience suffers as a whole from these two elements, otherwise I would not have been playing it for the past 5 years, let alone recommend it.

												This game is something that I would reccomend, because I personally enjoyed playing through it, but it definetly depends on who you are and what you care about in a game.If you're looking for a game with a good story, I don't reccomend it, the story is crap and the ending sucks.But, if you're looking for a game that has fun gameplay (Most of the time) than you should play this.The gameplay is fun and refreshing, the game does have red objects that guide you but theres enough freedom in how you find out how to get across, But, i have one huge problem with this game, which is that you, the player, doesn't have enough freedom in how you aproach things, you always do the same kinds of things and there are no alternate ways that you can reach the end in, theres more a straight line and no real other ways to do it.Like i mentioned earlier the story is crap, and the ending is just terrible.Can i talk about the ending real quick? If you don't wanna be spoiled then don't read this.What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the ending, its not a satisfying end, you don't have any motivation to stop Jack Nife, he just kinda shows up there and has for some reason kidnapped Kate, it doesn't pay off, you're just lead straight to him by the glowing red objects that lead you to the helicopter, and then he crashes you both magically survive, cue game song, the end.Now, it may seem like I dislike the game, but I don't, I reccomend that you play it because its fun, but just remember, if you're looking for a good story or a satisfying ending, this is NOT the game for you.

#1 Reason you should buy this game: you can look down and see your feet.Mirror's Edge (let's just call it Edge), was EA's bold idea to try something new. And it worked out really well (we are not talking about the slight failure Catalyst is). Edge tells us the story of Faith, definitely not a reference to the leap of faith, a runner in an unnamed city almost completely devoid of personality and full of order, absolute control and sparkly clean buildings, thanks to its totalitarian leaders. Faith as a runner, delivers special packages that contain information to an underground network that seek to undermine the authorities. And the best way to do that, is parkour.The story is pretty mediocre, at best. Characters are dull and not interesting, full of cliches and devoid of any emotional ties to the player. They simply are there to serve their role and that's it. The cutscenes are similar to really bad street sign commercials, trying to get in touch with ""modernism"", but they fail to do so, and personally, they simply deprived me of any enjoyment to watch. At least, the story doesn't last long, leaving you to enjoy your second playthrough.At least the world is interesting to explore. The art style and the minimalistic colors help to understand what over-bearing goverment means. You can almost feel the concrete blasting heat all over the place as you traverse pipes, fences and wall-run to your goal. It's beautiful, but the limited choice of colors can make you feel a bit frustrated after a while, thinking that the city is in fact, the same neighbourhood redone over and over again to fill in the maps with small tweaks. I can look past that though. They could allow the players to freely roam though, not simply constraint them to small parts of the city in each stage. Shame they didn't come up with this idea.The gameplay however, is the true star of the show. Faith will slam doors with her hand, her feet will kick during a long jump, the motion blur on the sides, they all come together to create an incredible level of immersion and momentum, making you gasp for breath as you leap through the gaps between skyscrapers, uncertain whether you survive the jump or not. At times, squads of policemen will chase you and you have the options to avoid them, or grab one of their guns and fight them. However, hand-to-hand and gunfights are your only options and they feel slightly clunky at times, since punches and kicks are very redundant and to perform a weapon steal you need to wait for the right moment when the weapon becomes red.After the campaign, there's not really much you can do. You can pop up the difficulty and try the challenges, but that's about it. There is no multiplayer, but there are leaderboards where you can test your skills against other people, but never in direct, straightforward competition.It's a nice game, it's worth giving a shot since it's something you don't see everyday. You won't regret it.RATING:Gameplay: 8/10Presentation: 8/10Story: 4/10Unique Factor: Detailed Animations: 8.5/10OVERALL:7.1/10 "

												Full of plot holes, bugs and not fun in general. Entertaining at most but a nice time killer.EDIT 1:But why, do you ask.ABOUT THE PLOT.-There are many points where story doesn't have a continuity (After getting your sister back in both cut scenes ""COME ON, YOU WERE JUST IN PERSIUT"")-Forgettable, unbuilt characters. (Seriously, I forgot all the names)-An ending so bland and a game length so short (Where most of the games I take double than this)-Nothing to do after you're doneABOUT THE GAMEPLAY-Great fluidity and simple controls-Terrible shooty shoot system.-So unawardiing and uncompelling gameplayABOUT THE BUGS-EA. Need I say more?-Alt + Tabbing is a gamble with the devil-Random game crashes and freezesPLEASE NOTE THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPPINION, WHICH IS SUBJECTIVE, SO PLEASE DON'T BE SALTY ABOUT IT.EDIT 2:Longest review for meEDIT 3:Apparently lowering the specs should help but this game is so painfully bland it falls flat on the hype. Sure, it was good for the price but I'd never play it again. The only people who play it is my family who wanted a 3D version of the mobile game ""VECTOR"" (Not good either, but more stable than Buggysoft's release).I mean, just look at the ending: You save your sister while waves of poliece officers come to the rooftop and after you crash a ♥♥♥♥ing helicopter at downtown you don't have to run anymore. BTW, if you think I have a biased opinion, then see my other reviews, they are 100% by the base game experience with no online functions unless required.			"

The level designs are absolutely breathtaking, from the skyscrapers to the underground levels.The combat is very fluid and for once in any sort of game, I feel that having a weapon is actually a detriment. You move so much slower, attack so much slower. Without one you feel very fluid, able to weave in and out of a battle and depending on how skilled you are.Overall the games fun as hell, the levels are beautifully designed.

												I never thought a Parkour style game would be this good. It didn't start off that strong with frame rate issues due to physx being on and of course, the seal of quality and money, the E.A. logo when you start it up. But overall this game is really good, It's art style is uniqe and isn't re-made of some game that already exists. It's faster/harder than I thought it would be when I first started keeping it nice and challenging. The only issue I have had with the game is screen/texture tearing. It is pretty bad when it comes to that, even with v-sync on it still tears a bit. But anyone reading this should definitely go buy it during a sale or now. Since it's on Steam instead of Origin and Steam has sales. *1 of many hint hints E.A.*			"

												Mirror's Edge is one of those games that you have to play. It's a classic and, while the story is far from being great, the game is a fresh concept set in a interesting near-future world.Controls are great, and easy, but you have to master them. You get to know Faith and everything that she can do. And when you know her, you can release all her power.Combat... I think Mirror's Edge Catalyst (the new Mirror's Edge game, which is a reboot) has a better combat system. Mirror's Edge combat is somehow clunky and weird, and it's kinda pointless to allow the player using weapons. Honestly, this game is way more fun if you don't use any weapons at all. Just run or combat with your hands!Parkour is awesome, and it feels so real.

												AWESOME GAME!I really liked the parkour style gameplay. Kickass game!I was surprised that the ending mission took less than 5 seconds on my first try, maybe because I followed my instincts as Faith and haven't done otherwise.What I don't like in this game is that I can't disarm opponents early in the game. I just learned it when I'm already at chapter 8 when I used my adrenaline first then was able to successfully disarm an opponent. Another thing I hate though, is that I had motion sickness in early levels...I don't know about the game's replay value since I just completed normal mode in 10 hours, and I don't think that I would play it on hard mode. Also, I got all the bags before I ended it with the help of a guide.But overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes action-type games, since I really enjoyed it. Thumbs up, yow!

												This game is great. I love it. It is super fun and even though its from 2008 its great in my opinion. It has tons of great features with a little bit of a puzzle aspect in the game. I recommend this game for people who like parkour and adventure but not to someone who likes intense violence or roleplaying games.			"

												This game is not one of the best, but one of the most FUN games I've ever played. The story is short and lacks a bit, but the awesome gameplay and gunfights make up for it. Yes, I said gunfights. Even though its not one of the well known strong points, the gunplay is actually pretty exciting just for the fact that it doesn't happen very often.Story - 6/10 just because its short, and not too strong.Gameplay - 10/10Overall - 8/10 just because there are not that many games out there that are just flat out FUN.

												Very unique and original concept, its also very visually appealing, it doesn't look like a 2009 game AT ALL.The soundtrack is great, the controls are tight, the parkour is enjoyable, the combat is a bit clunky, and the story isn't that great, but this game is criminally underrated, but its one of the best games EA ever published, i expect they won't cash out mirror's edge 2, but i think i shouldn't be too confident about that			"

												This is easily one of the best games EA/Dice has ever made. This is not only beacuse of the story which is easy to follow, or the amazing graphics (Especially since this game was released about 5 years ago), but it's beacuse it simply is a game you simply can grab, and easily get grabbed by it. The story though is a little short, but it is covered up by the different time trial courses which take part in some of the same places the story does. Even though there's no anti-cheat system for the game, which makes the world record impossible to beat, it's a very nice feature with stars being handed out in the time trial section as well. It promotes players to think, which is actually quite nice when you actually beat the level, since they're quite hard to get all the 3 stars in. Even though it's old, it for sure is gold!			"

Faith Connors and her sister Kate are then subsequently targeted by the City Protection Force. While Kate is arrested, Faith manages to escape. Now Faith must try to unravel the circumstances of Pope's murder and to relieve her sister.""What makes this game good?Unique game style and mechanics: action, parkour, various ways and paths to go from A to B, ... ;You have more stuff to do than story mode: you have challenges, like complete a path as fast as you can (going from A to B passing by the checkpoints, but you can choose the way to go);Good story and voice acting;Good art style on the cut scenes;Great graphics (maybe one of the best games of 2009, graphically);You don't need to use Origin;There's a new mirror's edge coming.Does this game has bad stuff too?Like everything, of course it has: the story mode is a bit short (I have the game on Origin too, so this was not my first time playing it. I finished the story mode in approximately 5 hours and 30 minutes).Joining all the points, I can give a veredict to this game, and I recommend it very much.

												Revolutionary back in the day and still pleasant to play. The main gameplay revolves around freerunning a futuristic and superb looking city, getting from Point A to Point B as efficient as possible, with a little martial arts and gunfights thrown in here and there. The game is set in a city, where the police is in control of everything and sharing free information has become almost impossible. The runners are the ones transporting them illegally for their customers high above the city. You play such a runner and it doesn't take long until you get in trouble with the law and may discover something bigger along the way.The gameplay is fast and is only slowed down by some combat sequences. You can either solve them with your fists or overwhelm an officer and use his gun, but most of the time you will be evading the cops with your freerunning skills. It is not an open world game, your path is linear with a few possible variations. Combat is the weakest part of the game, followed by the story, which basically only exists to give you a reason to run to a certain point and is fairly short. Afterwards you can play the levels in time trial mode or try and find all hidden collectibles throughout the levels.Sometimes you need to find the correct path and the game feels like a puzzler. If you are not surrounded by police and can take your time to figure things out, those parts are really enjoyable. If you're under heavy fire and have to act quickly and constantly chose dead ends or wrong jumps, because you don't have the time to study your surroundings, it can get a bit frustrating. If you are having trouble, you can enable the runner vision in the options menu (you can disable it too, of course). It highlights possible paths for you.All in all a game I would recommend, despite its flaws. Defenitly pick it up at a discount, at full price you might be a bit dissapointed. I bought it anyway for nostalgic reasons.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a very original game which became an instant classic because of its innovations and timeless charm.What makes the game original is the complete focus on running and navigating the environment without having to deal with puzzles, combat or other distractions.You play as ""Faith"", a runner, in a beautiful yet dystopic city, where the goverment constantly monitors its citizens and oppresses the freedom of information; your goal is to deliver sensitive data and uncover a conspiracy that revoles around the main character sister's framing. The whole game relies on a constant ""flow"" of movement; the more you run the faster you go and you're encouraged to link jumps, wallruns, slides and rolls like you would in a fighting game, in order to maintain some kind of a combo.As soon as you start it becomes incredibly addictive, and you'll soon challenge yourself at being faster, faster and faster.The thing that separates this game from the rest, other than the simple yet perfect gameplay, is the masterful level design; the city you play in has an incredible charm, with its candid roads and silver skyscrapers and the developers really put a lot of though into the design of the map. Whenever you are not runnin you'll spend countless minutes enjoying the scenary and daydreaming about how living in such a place must be like, and the specific use of primary colors for the interiors makes a nice contrast to the bright white outdoors; everything is clean, perfect, symmetric, simple.The path you have to follow is linear, but that allowed the developers to craft the most interesting way ever to navigate the environment, showing an insight into the life of the city, making the player visit its underground stations, offices, sewers, police headquarters, rooftops ecc...It's very hard to describe this with words and you really have to play it to witness it.One thing that's fair to admit it's the game's lenght; realistically you'll finish the campaign in about 5 hours or less, which for me never was a problem but i know for many others could.There's not much else to say about the game, because of its genius semplicity, other than it's a masterpiece; a game that every gamer worthy of this title should experience, to make its cult status grow even bigger.A game like this is only made every 10 years or so, it rightfully became a cult classic.

Oh, cool!Despite giving me serious bouts of rage-quitting, having issues with how linear the game is and a little cliched story, Mirror's Edge was a rewarding adrenaline rush. Beautiful music and art direction adds more to the atmosphere. The fact that I'm not given a gun and have to run to evade NPCs was fun (you can get involved in fights, which is more fun). Spectacular game with a simple but innovative gameplay. Hopefully the prequel will have a more open and dynamic world with multiple path options. A great game nonetheless.			"

It may be short, but the levels are hard sought and well built.

												I finally got around to beating this game after like two years. I got about 2/3 of the way done before, got stuck on an area, got salty, and quit. Picked it up again and finished it in 3 hours or so.It's usually not hard to see WHERE you're supposed to end up, it's just finding the path there and not falling to your death from a bad jump. I'd say there's replay value, because as soon as you finish the game you're just really getting the mechanics down and tend to make less mistakes.I see a lot of people complain about combat - I sort of get it, the combat isn't exactly fun but it's also not the point of the game in my opinion. You're a runner. You should be avoiding every enemy you can and taking the others out with acrobatic grace. Should be, anyway. I suck at disarming enemies so I just had to punch folks until they fell down. It was underwhelming, but I also think being chased and attacked was necessary to the feeling you get while running away. Glass crashing around you and bullets flying, Faith escapes again into the corners of the city.I adored the art style and selective use of colors. People saying it's all red and white are blind or didn't actually play the game. The colors do a lot of foreshadowing and kind of mentally prep you for upcoming events. I plan on doing some speed trials just to get pretty screenshots.PhysX is a turd and will blow your computer up, even if you have a PhysX optimized GPU. If you get huge FPS drops when windows break, it's PhysX. Disable it and enjoy the game.It's so easy to not notice the soundtrack. A lot of the time you're just being talked to via headset, or you hear the sounds of the city. But there are a couple areas where the song is inspiring, where it makes you feel like you're flying and the air is rushing past your ears and through your hair.The story is so-so. Think 90's action flick and you've got an idea of it. There are a couple plot holes but they're pretty easy to overlook and don't affect the enjoyment of the game for me personally. I just wanna jump off walls and do cool stuff.If you're into acrobatic gameplay and using speed rather than force, definitely give this game a shot. It's fun and the style is so memorable. "

												If you like running, then this game isn't for you.If you like jumping, nada, not for you.If you like being a badass chick who can dash and fly through rooftops whilst kicking some sexist ♥♥♥♥♥ in the balls, stealing thier guns and then popping one in thier mates head then meh, because that's just a tad of the vast and magnificent amount of endless fun you could have in this game. It may be short, but the levels are hard sought and well built. And once you've finished it, what's to stop you from playing again, beating high scores or even trying your hand at the multiplayer?I guarantee you will NOT get bored of this game, you may stop playing it for a while, but it's that one game that will be your filler, when nothing else reaches your standard, when it comes to feeling fast, free and most of all, like you're actually having fun.Buy this game, I don't care who you are. Just buy it.If you can't afford it, save upIf you can't save up, get a jobIf you can't get a job, get your parents to buy it,If your parents can't buy it, get your friends to buy itIf you have no friends, get a lifeIf you have no life, THEN BUY THIS GAME.

Mirror's Edge is a game built solely on free running/parkour and fleeing from a new government's regime.This includes reaching your destinations in unusual ways through roofs, obstacles and other wide or narrow spaces. All of this often leads to an encounter with armed forces which sometimes can be avoided or challenged through a combat.★ Movement has a good flow until you reach combat. However, it can be sloppy from time to time and because of that your character might miss objects that you're supposed to hang onto like poles. ★ Combat is one of the worst aspects of this game. The melee part is kind of fun until you take possession of a gun. Its mechanics are probably the worst that I've ever seen. It would've been better if there were less combat because you can't avoid everything and you'll be forced to engage in it at some point anyways.★ As for the story, it didn't seem to be interesting for me at all. I was really trying to get into it during my second and third playthrough and make it grow on me but I still found it dull. I knew that it isn't the strongest part about this game but it sure is a problem when you have no idea what's happening. ★ Music and graphics had a huge impact for this game's success. Soundtracks are relaxing and fits the theme. Moreover, colorful and minimalist graphic design added so much to this game visually that it distracted me from the gameplay just to enjoy the view.Therefore, this game stands on the verge between + and - but I'd still recommend it since I enjoyed it to some extent. If you only care about the story, don't even bother picking this game up as I guarantee that you will be unsatisfied and bored.6.5/10 "

												This is very good. The premise of a first-person Parkour game is really original, and the level design really has you believing you're clinging to the edge of a tall building. Some of the moves you can do in this game are just thrilling. The mouse and keyboard controls work well and don't feel like they came from a console port.There's about 6 hours of content here. The bad:- Contains quicktime events.- The gamepad controls aren't great (use the mouse).- The combat sections aren't much fun (but putting the game on easy mode makes them go by quicker)- The game locks up every time you switch tasks.- The online leaderboards are full of cheaters, making time trial mode less fun than it could be.

Since Mirror's Edge Catalyst isn't on steam, I'm going to put my review for both games down here.Mirror's EdgeMirror's Edge is a fun game to play when bored, and the options of free running are great, but there's a limit to them in the way of levels, so that you can never really free roam in the game. The story is not that great, but the parcour you can do in the game makes up for that matter. But...Mirror's Edge CatalystThe big sister of the two games is definitely better than the first game. The story is better, the free running has a few more options and is slightly better, but the option to be able to free roam gives us what Mirror's Edge lacked, the option to do whatever you want wherever you want in the city of Glass. And yeah, Faith looks even hotter in this game.			"

												A game for people who wish they could do the stunts they see on YouTube. Pros -Stunning graphics for a 2009 game, especially the models. Everything you look at is beautiful, especially the environments.-Very fun parkour system(with a learning curve), that makes you want to come back for more. By far the highlight of this game, you can do a variety of different parkour moves that tie together smoothly and fluidly.-Great soundtrack that perfectly captures the modern/sci-fi world of Mirror's Edge.-Interesting level design that captures the creativity to do parkour.-The mechanics itself feel realistic. There were few times that it felt as though I shouldn't have survived something or shouldn't have been able to jump that far. And in places where I don't survive, it makes sense. A young woman in nothing but a tanktop and sweatpants wouldn't be able to survive 3 point blank headshots from an automatic weapon. Cons -textures show flaw at times, but on very few objects-Campaign that falls flat. This is the biggest gripe with this game that I have. I didn't feel invested in many of the characters, and I only wanted to go through the story because the parkour itself was fun, and the ending was very disappointing. I particularly didn't enjoy the animated cutscenes, but that's simply personal preference.-The game fluctuates from rather simple to extremely difficult. I turned off ""runner vision"", which lets you see what objects to run/jump/climb onto next, and at times I didn't think it would've been possible to do WITH runner vision. -The combat felt extremely clunky, and in the late game, AI could kill you extremely fast. At least an hour of my 7-hour run through of the game was spent redoing combat sections because the AI killed me too damn fast and I didn't know how to go about the situation.-Fair share of bugs. Nothing much. TL;DR/Conclusion An experimental, revolutionary game that takes the art of parkour and implements it perfectly into a game's setting. It's innovations pay off with stunning visuals, fun mechanics, and an immersive, beautiful atmosphere. This game is a cult classic that should be played before you die. However, don't expect much from story, and prepare to be frustrated at various aspects of the game.7 out of 10. Great game			"

												Mirror's Edge was a breath of fresh air back in 2008, and it's still breathtaking to this day. The amazing sense of motion, the visceral sensation of speed and falling, the dazzling art direction... it's an amazing combination, let down only by the underdeveloped story and reliance on trial and error.  But don't let that and one too many air vents turn you away! This is the best first person parkour game ever made and is ♥♥♥♥ing sensational on PC with a deliciously decadent-sized effects budget.

												First of all, don't be fooled, even if it says that i only played 0.2 hours, it's not true. i can't use the steam client all the time, so i play offline, i actually played 2 hours and a half, give or take. Anyway, like most of other reviewers, i have to select NO, unfortunately, this game is a ""yes, but.."" kind of game. Don't get me wrong, the game looks stunning but it's basically ""portal meets super mario"". you are thrown into a level and you have to get to the other side by jumping and running on walls, but if you die (and you WILL die, more on that later) you'll respawn in a fixated spawn point (just like portal) the problem that this spawn point can be anywhere from a few feet away to three rooftops away, this will force you to re-jump previously jumped obstacles, re-punch enemies and re-listen to any conversation that might have happened (i swear to God, if i have to hear that ""the cops are closing in"" one more time i'm going to kill someone). now, about the dieing part, everything wants you dead and will shoot you on sight. there is no stealth option, no way to defend yourself besides the stupidly weak melee attack (i know, you can disarm cops but first you must get IN RANGE and wait for the gun to get flashy and even if you do that, you'll have only a couple of shots) and if you are even slightly misalligned you'll end up doing the wrong kind of jump, plummeting to your doom...and respawning...and hearing those same lines over and over and over again. the story for what i could grasp between the bullets, it's the classic distopian future with evil corporates that want to silence the good people (feel free to correct me on this one) but, again, it's hard to focus on the story when you are shot by literally the entire police force! and, apparently, there are subquests you should complete (picking up bags, i think) but i was only able to find 3 of them (again, hard to explore when trying to avoid bullets).i'm really disappointed, it's the first time i actually asked for a refundso, to recap:+good visuals+interesting setup +(probably) good story-anti-immersive game mechanics-you'll burn more miles in half an hour of this game than Shaggy and Scooby did in the whole Scooby-Doo universe-necessity to explore but inability to do so-annoying navi-like navigator (i know there are cops here, THEY ARE SHOOTING ME!)

												I would give positive, if it was indie game.But this game is pretty disappointing. It should give you ""joy and freedom of run"", but give nothing of it.Freedom is absent, because there is only one corridor way. And joy also, because far far majority of game you are under heavy fire, so good luck with looking for, where the corridor is, if you fail at first try, death. And even, when you know, where to run, still you are getting hitted the whole game, because, as I have mentioned, the heavy fire. So it is game about running Terminator.That was very frustrating and unenjoyable. I finished the game only to check ""finished"" in game list, And surely will not buy Catalyst.			"

												Incredible game! Mirror's Edge is unique in story, graphics, and gameplay and becomes addicting once you learn the mechanics. Breathtaking color palettes give this game an intense vibe and the multiple routes to take and tricks to learn keep the game interesting. Combat defies the usual ""gun 'em down"" strategy, forcing you to get creative with takedowns while the music helps set tones for different scenarios. Better get used to the splat of your body falling a zillion stories, though. My only gripe is that it's a fairly short game, but I'm already starting a second playthrough. It's definitely worth your money just for the experience of adrenaline fueled parkour!			"

												I very much enjoyed the game.I liked:* a very unusual concept, a great idea* nicely executed, both graphically, in sound and in gameplay* an interesting story* the thrilling feeling when flying in the air between two skyscrapers, a hundred meters of free space below you, and the other building is almost out of reaaaach... awesomeWhat could have been better:* a quite short game* not as fast (in terms of running) as I imagined. Usually I was looking for a way forward or fighting the cops, completely ruining the running experience. I would like to enjoy longer sequences of insane jumps, slides, wall jumps, etc, without having to constantly stop and look around to find the correct path forward. Yes, you can do the speed runs and time trials afterwards, but having that in the main story would be much better.* some cutscenes were unskippable and if you died shortly afterward, you saw them again and again. The same for game starting video sequences. Come on, developers.See the trailer and if you like the concept, definitely recommended.			"

Parkouring is one of the things I've always wanted to do, so this game made it happen. Soundtrack is amazing. Cutscenes are well animated. Graphics are eye candy and action sequences works fine. You can run, but you can also defend yourself by using weapons, for example I tried the shotgun and holy poop it felt good when the enemies flew through the air when I burst 'em with it. I think that this game looks a lot better than many other new games. Run. Jump. Feel the air below your feet. This will be an experience you'll remember the rest of your life.			"

You can enter a room one time and get shot and killed within a second, but then respawn and go into that room and fight and win like it was nothing. That is literally the only con in a beautiful game though. I cannot wait to play the sequel. Supposedly they are improving combat in that one as well. So I am expecting a perfect game in the future. I'll give this game an 8.75 out of 10. Super fun.			"

												I recommend this game. It has found its place among my top three most interesting games.The gameplay itself is very immersing and may be worded in a very simplyfied way as problem solving under timelimits.It is however very heavy in getting the right timing for performing the right action. Altough one may slow time down for a short while i rarely use it because it disrupts the gameflow (in my humble opinion). I could not play this game in full resolution (1920x1080) when there where multiple enemys appearing. Even so there are only barely visible differences when playing on 1360x768 pixels thanks to the way the levels are buildt.One fustrating thing is the setting of Savepoints, that force you (especially in the later chapters) to start some long passages over once you die/fail. On the other hand really being forced to get longer sequences  and timings right gives this game its charm and made me think back to the first Rayman i played on a Gameboy advance.All in all a fun first person parkour game/ 3D Platform jump and run, that gives you the freedom to either fight your way trough or run past all obstacles without harming anyone. Wheras the main point is to match your timing and finding your way.Ps.: Because I played offline my game time was not recorded. "

												Mirror's Edge's Narrative definitely lives up to the Hype.

												Mirror's Edge is a one-of-a-kind game with it's own expirience when you play it. Get involved into some action and fast-paced parcour on roofs, inside buildings and on the streets! All that comes in addition with a bright style of graphics and a handfull of other, very fitiing, colours.To begin with, the mechanics and the idea are a very neat thing, and it keeps you occupied for the time you play the story, as you get to use the variety of interactions, like wallrunning, pipe climbing, walljumping, disarming, sliding, etc. in a totally random order, depending on the levels.The con at that part is, that the level design forces you to take a passage, the game is rather linear when it comes to that. There sometimes are several possibilites to get around though, still they end with the same result/position to be in.The idea behind collecting secrets to unlock artwork/extras is a neat idea, still, I do believe that it does not really improve the fact, that the replayability is kind of low, as you barely get to see something new when you play for a second time.The multiplayer, if you can call it like that, is more like a racer. No cool disarming, no avoiding or dodging of gunfire. You race other people, with the hope to win. Nothing else to say at that point.In total, I can recommend Mirror's Edge at the price it is at. It is worth buying and enjoying, as it is a different expirience.			"

												Very short, (I beat the storyline in 5 hours) but very fun.  Picked it up for $5 on sale and it was absolutely worth it.The movement is amazing.  With about half a dozen techniques to use, you can approach most of the game from a variety of (literal) angles.  There's also a time trial mode to really test yourself.What little combat there is is intentionally clunky as you're a ""runner"" not a ""fighter.""  But if you master the movement, you can do some amazing combat techniques too.  I, however, settled on repeatedly doing a running slide and kicking every single opponent in the junk over and over.  Crude, yet effective.The platforming never felt ""cheap"" like in a lot of platformers, where you need nearly pixel-perfect precision.  In this game, if you're having trouble with a jump it's more than likely you're using the wrong techniques.There's not much to the story, so don't expect anything wonderful there.  Someone wronged you, you're trying to figure out who they are and why they did it.  Nothing epic or grandiose like saving the world, it's pretty much just personal revenge with a bit of a political background.I had a few minor issues, including one slowdown/crash that was remedied by simply turning off PhysX in the options.  Other issues were my character not grabbing ledges that I clearly thought she should, or at one point I must have ""stubbed my toe"" mid wall-run because I just stopped and fell off the wall.Due to the extremely short length of the game, I can only recommend picking it up on sale.  It has difficulty settings, time trials, and some collectible items, so there's a small bit of replay value to it.			"

												Incredible game! Mirror's Edge is unique in story, graphics, and gameplay and becomes addicting once you learn the mechanics. Breathtaking color palettes give this game an intense vibe and the multiple routes to take and tricks to learn keep the game interesting. Combat defies the usual ""gun 'em down"" strategy, forcing you to get creative with takedowns while the music helps set tones for different scenarios. Better get used to the splat of your body falling a zillion stories, though. My only gripe is that it's a fairly short game, but I'm already starting a second playthrough. It's definitely worth your money just for the experience of adrenaline fueled parkour!			"

												Mirror's Edge is a beautiful game. It's fast paced and doesn't have to ever slow down if you are a good enough free-runner. But, this game isn't perfect, and as a hug fan of this game I'm going to be completely honest.The good things about Mirror's Edge:The Look - The City is amazingly gorgeous and dynamic. Different color schemes for certain buildings really help piece the city together.The Feel - The controls are decent enough to get you where you need to go without looking like an idiot, but it's the animations and the lightweight feel of Faith that really make you feel like a runner. The way she vaults and slides across the floor look fantastic.The Soundtrack - One of my favorite videogame OST's, Mirror's Edge has a distinctive feel that's core comes from listening to it's music. The Bad things about Mirror's Edge:Wonky parkour controls - At times you'll find that what you want to pull off isn't achievable unless you're a skilled pro at the game. You want to wall run then coil over that fence? Until you're completely familarized with the controls you'll fail 90% of the time.No Achievements - You wanted to get achievements and cards for your amazing parkouring in this game? You would be better off buying it on console. That's right, Steam doesn't offer any achievements or trading cards for this game. Probably because the game is so old, the port to Steam is missing a lot of things that would make playing Mirror's Edge worth your while.The combat - Now, this is completely avoidable if you have the skill to evade the police, but the combat isn't all that great. Sure, when you have the chance to pull of wallrun-kicks and leap onto SWAT members it can be enjoyable. But the areas at which you face the police are so open and empty you'll end up walking up to them, waiting for them to hit you with a melee attack, and easily tapping a button and countering them. Then you'll drop their gun, rinse, and repeat this process until all of the police are taken down and you can get on your way.Short storyline - The story is pretty uninteresting in my opinion. It only picks up at certain parts, and it's easy to tell who the villain is going to be by the final chapters. The game is only 9 missions long, and these missions are usually 10 - 30 minutes long. In the end, Mirror's Edge is a great game that you will enjoy if you're into parkour and first person combat games. But if you want rewards, achievements, cards, or badges, steer clear of this title. By the end of the game, you'll feel one of two emotions. Satisfied with a great short-but-sweet experience, or you'll be left wanting more out of the game, since you can only now speed-run the same sections of the game or do time trials on certain parts of missions. Also, mentioning the no achievements you'll feel like you just sped-ran the whole game and all of the time trials for nothing, seeing how your scores on the leaderboard are only going to be buried beneath hackers of the game.6/10 - Good but could be a lot better if Steam supported the features that other titles have on it's store.

												The Good:1) Parkour: This is what makes the game so damn fun. DICE put a lot of work making it feel real and fun at the same time, and it pays off really well. The fact that its first person makes you feel like you're actually doing it. Despite the combat not being up to par, the parkour works so well that you almost forget about it2) Graphics: For a game that came out in 2008, this still looks great. Not only does the world feel real, but the art style is just so memorable. It makes me wish a city like this was real3) Soundtrack: For an electronic soundtrack, it creates a relaxing feeling. It fits the tone and world perfectly4) Level design: While the game is very linear, it makes up for it with well thought out levels that give you multiple paths to get to your destination. The Bad:1) Length: It's only 5-6 hours. Should've been at least 8-10 hours2) Combat: I wish you could chain your parkour with your fighting skills to take down enemies while still moving fast, instead of having to come to a complete stop every time you want to do a takedown. Also, the punching and kicking animations feel stiff. Using guns is even worse; I wish they would have improved the hand-to-hand combat and removed guns completely.Despite its flaws, this is my favourite game of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique action-adventure game.9/10			"

												10/10. One of the best games by graphically and soundwise. The Game runs well and the gameplay is really smooth. Parkouring is one of the things I've always wanted to do, so this game made it happen. Soundtrack is amazing. Cutscenes are well animated. Graphics are eye candy and action sequences works fine. You can run, but you can also defend yourself by using weapons, for example I tried the shotgun and holy poop it felt good when the enemies flew through the air when I burst 'em with it. I think that this game looks a lot better than many other new games. Run. Jump. Feel the air below your feet. This will be an experience you'll remember the rest of your life.			"

												If you havn't played this game already, GO ♥♥♥♥ING PLAY IT! I, as a gamer personally lean twards indie games and do not like Electronic Arts (EA) or many big name companies like them, but this game is something diferent. It's a movment based game that I personally find to be more apealing than any other game I've ever played..... ever. Mirror's edge is by far my favorite game and I really recomend it.Keep it up DICE. 10/10			"

												First of all, the lighting in this game is beautiful.  Everything is so bright, it really makes you feel like you're outside, unlike the dark/murky look of most games.  Combat is good, but not as good as the running.  You'll find yourself panting/breathing along with the runner.  The problem is there is not enough of it.  Instead you run into areas that bring you to a dead stop while you try to figure out how to get to the next area.  This can be frustrating when you fall time after time, then when you finally get past one obstacle, you'll fail at the next one and have to start over again.  Still, well worth playing.			"

												Very short, (I beat the storyline in 5 hours) but very fun.  Picked it up for $5 on sale and it was absolutely worth it.The movement is amazing.  With about half a dozen techniques to use, you can approach most of the game from a variety of (literal) angles.  There's also a time trial mode to really test yourself.What little combat there is is intentionally clunky as you're a ""runner"" not a ""fighter.""  But if you master the movement, you can do some amazing combat techniques too.  I, however, settled on repeatedly doing a running slide and kicking every single opponent in the junk over and over.  Crude, yet effective.The platforming never felt ""cheap"" like in a lot of platformers, where you need nearly pixel-perfect precision.  In this game, if you're having trouble with a jump it's more than likely you're using the wrong techniques.There's not much to the story, so don't expect anything wonderful there.  Someone wronged you, you're trying to figure out who they are and why they did it.  Nothing epic or grandiose like saving the world, it's pretty much just personal revenge with a bit of a political background.I had a few minor issues, including one slowdown/crash that was remedied by simply turning off PhysX in the options.  Other issues were my character not grabbing ledges that I clearly thought she should, or at one point I must have ""stubbed my toe"" mid wall-run because I just stopped and fell off the wall.Due to the extremely short length of the game, I can only recommend picking it up on sale.  It has difficulty settings, time trials, and some collectible items, so there's a small bit of replay value to it.			"

												Ever heard of a first person platformer? Not really, no. So that's a pretty wide gap to bridge. Mirror's Edge does a nice job to jump the gap, but it sure is no bridge.Mirror's Edge puts you in the bright red shoes of Faith, an inhabitant of an Orwellesque city who runs and jumps on rooftops to deliver secret packages to people who try to liberate the population from the regime. The premise is interesting, but the game refrains from giving you a clear motive or goal; it just drip-feeds it to you. It is not paced very well. You don't really understand what you're doing until the credits roll. Call it Chekov writing if you must, I call it demotivational. The controls are simple, yet effective. This isn't like platforming in Half Life where pressing the jump button launches you into space and pushing up to ladders makes you go up; this is about momentum and clever jumps and acrobatics. The freerunning is done fluently and intuitively. However, your runner's high tends to be tackled by the game's awkward and completely redundant combat system. It is a shame cause it would have been so much more fun if you could just...keep on running. You run through a weird city that is coloured white and then some other colours. It looks very stylish and makes it pleasant to look at while you jump from building to building. Mirror's Edge has an interesting concept going for it, but it seems to lack refinement and pacing. Still, it's worth a shot just for the experience of FPS running.			"

												This game is really fun when you are playing the missions, but the missions overall are fairly short. Once you finish the game there is just about nothing to do. There is this mode called ""race"" where all it is is the missions you already played, but timed. I really like this game, but I wouldn't get it for $19.99, I got it when it was 75% off. To sum it up, good, but fairly short game, and don't buy if it is at full price.			"

Ever since I jumped of a building and on to another I wanted more!And for the people who can't wait for the second (me included): Mirror's Edge 2 will be coming out as a prequel in 2016 or 2015, at the earliest. Faith is apparentley in ger late teens and it looks like it might have alot of stuff to do with her mother and family.			"

												Mirror's Edge is great if you like parktour and platforming games. If you are afraid of heights, falling, dying or getting vertigo, you might not like this game.Very challenging game even on easy mode. The MC is sorta like Neo in the Matrix.  Falling to your death is common. Dying from guards shooting you is common.  Autosave works offen but you will have to rerun some parts a lot.  Might get stuck in a deathtrap or two, till you figure out where and how to go.  I thought it was funny and exciting falling to my death often.  Just wish the cops would not be shooting at MC as much.  Not many hints of where to go, but there is one right way and many wrong ways. Trying to attack guards is difficult, better to run.  Tutorial helps but for me gets stuck teaching combat moves(the 2nd Disarm).  You will be shot at very often with no way to stop the shooting except to escape or hide behind something.  You heal up quickly, so it is a good idea to stop briefly or hide when hurt.  You will be hounded by the cops from air and surprised by ground cops on the rooftops.  The combat is ok but hard to do.  You can punch, kick, use your parktour, disarm, and pickup a gun and use it. The forum has a lot of people complaining this game has game stopping bugs. It might not run on some computers.  I had no problems sofar runnning game on a Quad Core computer with Win 8 (64bit) 8 Gig RAM.Great view of the city from the rooftops. Great graphics.  Good Story. Has a speedrun gamemode.This game does NOT have Steam Achievements and badge cards.Just get it on sale, maybe worth the price then. for more info:

												A fun, sometimes challenging first person parkour game. The only con that really bothers me is that the game feels short (seeing how I beat it in 4 hours) and the lack of Time Trial DLC on Steam sucks for extra challenge and additional gameplay hours to spend it on. Overall, a fairly decent game which I'd recommend buying on sale when it's cheaper due to the lack of content. Let's hope Mirror's Edge: Catalyst does better, bigger and longer.			"

												Definitely one of the best games ever made. I have never seen anything like this before or after this game's release. It's a bit on the short side, but has a lot of replayability to make up for it and a ""Speed Run"" mode, where you can compare your times with friends. The combat is for the most part foucsed on melee, however you can disarm your enemies if you wish to use a gun. Every movement you make feels fluid and satisfying. The $20 price tag may feel like a bit much at first, but I assure you that you will not regret buying this game.			"

												This game is one of the best and most unique games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It still holds up today as a great game. The gameplay is a first person parkour game at heart with moments of FPS in the later chapters (though they are not required). The game gives you a tutorial level to get used to all the different controls though once you learn them, playing the game is not difficult because of controls. Though not open world, the chapters are large areas that provide more than one way to progress, which can certaintly help in the time trials. In my personal opinion, the keyboard controls are clunky and using a controller is far superior. One downside is that this is a game that could potentially give you motion sickness, while I am fine playing this game, others have been unable to play this due the motion sickness.The visuals are beautiful, providing a minimalist view of the city that uses shades of white and grey mixed with some colour to create vibrant scenery that doesn't distract from the gameplay. The red colour ties in with Runner Vision, showing you the best routes or what you can interact with (this can be turned off).The music in this game is outstanding and numbers amongst my all time favourites. Solar Fields did a great job in creating music for this game as it adds to the atmosphere of the game and the tension and action at the right moments. The story is the weak part of this game but it's not terrible. It's a basic plot of Faith, the main character, trying to save her sister, Kate, after she is set up for a murder. Sprinkled in is the corruption and survelliance of the city and it's officials to create a dystopian type of city that is presented as a utopia to the masses. The characters are intresting enough to care about and help to save the story. You'll meet a bunch of characters throughout, friends, foes, or something in between. The cutscenes are surprisingly 2D animated ones that give a comic book feel to them.Overall this is still a great game, you should definetely give it a go. It's worth it at full price and if you're still not sure the game goes on sale often. In comparison to the new one Catalyst, this is the better game though Catalyst itself is still quite a good one it had some differences from this.			"

												This game is very unique and interesting and although laggy (for my PC atleast) it is easy to overcome by turning of PhysX, it is a fast paced parkour, running away from the S.W.A.T team, action packed and generally awesome gameplay.What i love is even though it's not open-world (get working on that please DICE) it has many different paths you can take which almost gives a feel of open world.Hope to see more games like this in the future!

												One of the most original games of recent years. I would never have guessed that a developer company would some day release an FPS game where the emphasis would be on running, sliding, jumping, vaulting, rolling, crouching and all this done on the rooftops of skyscrapers. These are the movements your protagonist, Faith, uses whenever she is faced with an obstacle.The game is an unstoppable roller coaster ride. All the movements you do you do while running. And to make it more exciting the game does not want you to stop - your ""vision"" enables you to see certain objects, ramps, ledges and pipes highlighted in red so you know you can interact with these objects and you do not need to stop to look for clues. Later on as the game gets gradually more difficult this assistance is reduced and you can even turn it off completely so that the game can offer you the ultimate challenge.Enemies can be taken down with melee combat but most of the time you need to run. Those that have weapons can easily eliminate you. Interestingly, you can knock out some of these police officers and pick up their weapons. Bear in mind that the ammo is limited so once your magazine is empty you should get rid of your firearm. But with weapons you want to aim like in a true FPS game, right? So, using a firearm will break the pace here, therefore, it's best to just skip this opportunity and run all the way till the game ends.And pretty much that is the only problem with Mirror's Edge. You run fast and you reach the end fast. They could have included some extra chapters to make the game longer. You have time trial challenges so that you can keep playing stages over and over again improving your total time for completion.  I really wish, however, if there was a sequel to this game as it was such an exciting ride. It would be really nice to be a courier again in the new era of next-gen games.			"

												Mirror’s Edge is one of my all time favorite games, I’ve played through it multiple time on the xbox and twice now on my PC and it never gets boring. The controls and gameplay are damn near perfect when it comes to running and jumping, once you get past the training level most of the moves you do feel natural and the game does a great job of telling you when to do what without being super obvious and still allowing for improvisation. It gets your heart pounding and makes you feel like a badass and is just genuinely really fun. But the game isn’t perfect, the most obvious thing to point out is the forced gun combat. It feels like it was added as an afterthought because the publisher wanted a more action packed game, and by action packed I mean more guns, and it never felt as intuitive or as fun as the running parts of the game. Another disappointment was the story, it’s just not well written and it’s way too short. If they hired a team of great writers to write Mirror’s Edge the game could have easily become a classic. But those are minor things, the bottom line is that this game really ♥♥♥♥ing fun to play.			"

												At first, I was really frustrated with how this game plays. It felt like every area was a maze and the ""runner vision"" didn't seem to help on some places. But the moment I got good at the game it became amazing. You will break the game in ways you won't imagine, you will skip pipes and jump further than humanly possible, and when you reach that moment, the game becomes truly one of the best games made in the last decade.

												TL;DR : Skip to conclusion.Mirror's Edge, a First Person Action game developed by DICE and published by EA. Although the game was released in 2009, it still has features that many games nowadays can't recreate.Story Introduction: You play as Faith Connors, an agile and deadly information carrier called ""Runners"". You live in a city that has been heavily monitored and is run by private security corporations. Also, your sister, Kate Connors, is framed to be a murderer of a mayor candidate named ""Pope"". You must save your sister and uncover the secrets that will bring harm not only to herself and Kate, but everyone she loves.Here are the game's Pros and Cons:Pros: The movement system: Mirror's Edge is known for it's parkour elements. You can scale walls, jump between buildings and even ziplining across skyscrapers!Combat: You can jumpkick, slidekick, and also disarm opponent's weapons. It is not hard nor easy.Scenery: It is simple, but yet beautiful. There are not much colors, like mostly I see white, red, green, blue, and black. Also, somehow, trees are white... but in this game, scenery is stunning to watch and explore.No UI Clutter: This game has just one small dot in the middle and the screen, and that's it. No ammo counter, no health bar, and you might ask how in the world am I going to know where to go? The answer is Runner Vision.Runner Vision: Some objects in the game, eg. stairs or pipes will turn red if you get close to them, it gives you a hint of where to go or do. Runner Vision is a very creative game design in my opinion, you don't need a waypoint with distance marker in this game, just the Runner Vision.You can always turn it off if you don't want it.Cons:Story: The story is tedious, the characters are okayish, and also it's very short. I beat the whole game in 4 hours! It is just too quick. However, I did not collect all the ""Runner Bags"" (Collectibles) that are scattered in every level though. I'll do that later.AI: The enemy shoots like stormtroopers, they do not have a good aim (at least in Easy and Normal difficulty), but their weapon damage is fair enough.Bugs and WTF moments: You will find some bugs and some WTF moments, but they are not to the point where you will rage.Conclusion: I loved this game, despite the flaws I can see that this is one of the best FPA games I've ever played. Parkour hasn't been so much fun in a videogame! I recommend that you get this game on sale if you want to parkour and shoot!			"

												Mirror's edge is uniquely frustrating. The aesthetic is wonderful; the cyberpunk city, the intriguing story, the beautifully rendered scenery. However the gameplay left a lot to be desired. The game starts off well, the free running aspect of the game is very smooth and rewards skill. However even early on I found myself with no real sense of direction, and I lost track of the amount of times I yelled ""Well where the HELL am I supposed to go now?"" in frustration. On top of that, the gun-combat does not fit in with the game AT ALL, and those areas of the game where gun combat is MANDATORY (towards the end of the game) became tedious in the extreme. It's a real shame because Mirror's Edge has so much going for it, but I honestly can'y recommend it unless you pick it up for a greatly reduced price. I've heard the sequel is superior. We shall see.			"

												This game is absolutley beautiful. Almost everything in this game is done perfectly even if it is not intentional.Pros:Graphics hold up wellFluid movement Infinite replayability The glitches improve the game (more on that later)Great FPS on almost any computerCons:The combat is clunky and boringHit-boxes can be odd at timesPipe clumbing is unbearably slowHackers ruin any chance at in game world record timesDifficulty goes from good to what is this when going from normal to hardAs mentioned earlier, the glitches greatly improve this game. What I mean by this is that the capability of using the glitches (which actually require skill to pull off) can allow you to improve your speed on runs greatly. It is one of the best feelings ever to successfully pull of a difficult kick-glitch that shaves of 10 seconds of your time. The only time I have encountered a hindering bug was while performing a non-hindering bug so, what can you expect.Aside from that, if you aren't interested in speedrunning this game still includes some of the smoothest freerunnung in any game to date. The genre created by this game is the best of it's kind and has not been bested, which only proves this game's greatness more.TL;DR This game is godly get it immediatley. "

												Mirror's Edge is a fun to play and beautiful looking game that I would reccomend for anyone looking in the genre of parkour, as it is plenty of fun to jump from building to building like a parkour master.			"

												One of my all-time favorite games. Fantastic mechanics, fun combat, good soundtrack visuals that still look great today, and while short, an enjoyable story. The only real negative I have is that the cutscenes are animated like those old esurance commercials, and look pretty cheap and ugly as a result. Other than that, this is a fantastic game that shouldn't be missed by anyone.			"

												Very good story line with amazing flow and rhythm!  Very good graphics and sound. Weak combat system but, hey, you're not suposed to be fighting anyways, just run and run, dont loose that momentum. Cut scenes look their best possible. Fast loadings, what more could you ask ? Oh I know what, Mirror's Edge 2!			"

												Mirror's edge is an interesting tale of free-runners (parkour, if you will) be sort of rebels in a city overran by corruption, ""law enforcement"", and conspiracy. You play this female freerunner whose sister somehow gotten herself involved in a giant conspiracy, and you need to run through a gauntlet of cops, SWAT teams, and perhaps, other runners in your quest for truth and justice. As this is a first-person parkour game, you will be vaulting fences, guard rails, making death defying jumps between buildings, zipline across cables, wallruning between platforms sliding under some obstacles, as well as do some unarmed combat where you take guns away from cops and such (optional, this is NOT a shooter). There are plenty of challenges, and the game has a way to ease you into it by having a rooftop training course. Then it's balls to walls time as you're being chased by everybody... cops, SWAT, even helicopters. The idea is to chain together moves smoothly to get maximum speed, and it's not easy. But it's quite satisfying, as it's a very unique game.			"

												Lots of fun. While many people say it's not replayable, I've gone through the game a good ten times and enjoyed each run. Memorizing spots to speed up your runs that you may not have known existed during your first playthrough and seeing a great running combo pay off is very rewarding, which adds a sense of replayability to the game and also makes second and third runs faster and more fun.On the flip side, by giving players such an intensely graceful experience, after a few runs the player starts to play overly recklessly and hectically as they try to keep the flow going, which often results in death and frustration. Going fast for the whole level is incredibly addicting, and I hope Mirror's Edge 2 either adaps to or changes this. Give the player an incentive to ever stop going very quickly, like a decent combat system or a small chance to explore and see what the safest/fastest routes through a level are and make your choice. Otherwise, make sure the game flows as neatly as possible and feels graceful and fast the whole way.For what it is, Mirror's edge is definitely worth the buy, especially at $4.99, which I've seen it go for many times.

												Mirror's Edge is the game made for me. The parkour system that is implemented in this game is phenomenal. With other games, you put in 12 or so hours in the campaign and then ask yourself ""Now what?"". Not with this game! There are about 20 or so time trial missons to do! Or go back to different levels of the campaign and think of different ways to get from A to B! However the levels are more linear than they appear. The screenshots show a massive area with tons of skyscrapers and... you can't climb them. However, this game gets a 8/10! I recommend!			"

												Game with boring story, not interesting characters, terrible fighting and not catchy soundtrack. There is only one thing that made this game great and it's running. Running in Mirror's Edge, or just parkour, is amazing. It makes things that aren't good not important at all, just a little addition which you can ignore. There probably aren't game about running made so well and enjoyable. There is also one thing praiseworthy and it's graphics. Graphic in Mirror's Edge is great, even tho it's game from 2009 - simply yet beatiful mix of few colors on and in buildings makes you think ""damn, it looks great"".Mirror's Edge is short game - for the first time playing you might spent at most 5 hours but trust me, every second is filled with great parkour actions. There are few difficulty levels, special speed run option so you can see how fast you are and time trials, where you can beat tracks as fast as you can and compare scores with your friends. There are also bags to collect in story mode if you enjoy searching for hidden stuff. These things makes game much longer to enjoy. I haven't tried everything yet (speed runs and all of time trials) but I'm sure I will be back to Mirror's Edge one day, when Virtual Reality headsets will be avaible for everyone. Just imagine, this thrill and excitement with goggles which will make gaming even more real... I can't wait for this to happen!			"

												Mirror's Edge was dissapointing. I enjoyed the game more before I played it than when I actually finished it. When I got this game I was excited for the pretty art style and the flowing parkour. I had heard great things about this game and got it on sale for $4. It seemed like a steal. Looking back, that should be the actual price for the game without being on sale. When I first launched into the game I was dumbfounded by how pretty the game looked for coming out in 2007 and was immediatly intrigued in the gameplay. The controls worked, it felt good, and I was completly in control. But as I got further  into the game I was less and less impressed. I found myself asking ""Why didn't I grab that?"", ""How did that fall hurt me?"" and ""How was I supposed to know that?"" For a game about keeping momentum it stops you. Like.. A LOT. I started to feel like the game was constantly messing with me. ""Climb this ladder which takes to long to climb and you get shot on!"" ""Go here and let us all of a sudden introduce a concept that we should have done A LONG time ago!"" ""Heres this huge thing to climb up that is not only tedious, but extremely difficult as you start loose control and forget why you're playing this!"" This game was suprisingly a rage game. You spend more time wondering where to go than spending time getting there. The art style worked for and against the game. Making it look unique and fun with red prompts showing you where to go worked if you havn't played the game. The prompts are fine but the rest is bland and you can't tell where you are because everything looks the same. A big problem was that sometimes when I pressed shift to roll from a big jump Faith (the character) just didn't. Or when I right clicked to grab someones gun from them and keep them from hitting me nothing happened. I got frustrated easier and easier knowing things were probably only going to get worse. The story was bland and predictable. The music wasn't great and was repetitive. My favorite scene was at the very end where (spoilers from here on out) Faith and Kate looked over the city and the music actually fit for once. Other than that moment I felt almost no emotional connection to any other characters. When Merc was shot (predictable) I didn't care. When you found out that celest was a bad guy (predictable) I didn't care. When Jackknife turned out to be the big baddie (predictable) I didn't care. This game was a mess and deserves a low 6/10. I do reccomend this game but only when it's on sale. Otherwise don't waste your cash or time on this game.			"

First person parkour gaming at its finest.Short versionRun around, get creative on how to get from A to B using parkour tactics while avoiding enemies that attack you. What's not to like?Long versionThe story is a bit weak and predictable with some big plot holes and on the short side but you are not going to care about that. You'll be too busy running around the city map missions using creative ways to get around, under and above obstacles. Enemies can be avoided, fought or just killed; it's up to you. The PC version does not have the trophies achievements from the console versions, you will unlock everything by just finishing the game on any difficulty. So go nuts and kill if you want, there is no penalty or Steam achievements.The game uses checkpoints, but they are not located far from each other so no frustrating long re-attempts at difficult points.The stage designs.....GORGEOUS!!!  Bright clean colors and great architecture. Even background (or rather the far ground floor looking down from skyscrapers) has actual people and traffic life to it. You don't feel like you're in a dead city. Even birds and airplanes are sometimes visible in the sky. Seriously, who ever made the maps, is a genius. I really enjoyed just being there like it is a real city. The atmosphere alone is totally worth playing this game.			"

												Saturated colours and beautiful lighting combined with amazing music makes this an experience you must have. Movement is extremely satisfying making you feel like a parkour expert as you jump roof to roof. Combat can be frustrating at times; the few forced combat sections really stall the pacing of the game. The only time combat is done well is when fighting the assassin on chapter 7.The game has great potential for speed running as there are normally multiple paths available through most of the open areas which can help optimize your time through a level. It is very rewarding when you figure out a new path to help shave a few extra seconds off your time. There are also time trails which take place on different chapters found throughout the single player game. This displays a timer on the top of your screen and measures your time between checkpoints showing if you were faster or slower between each one.You can race against your friend’s ghosts for the best time, which is good fun especially if you are both racing each other at the same time and in a chat together. (Requires you login with an EA account)Being a new franchise they had to experiment with features which may or may not have worked, causing the game to have a few downfalls. But it definitely makes up for it with the unique experience it offers.			"

												What a dissapointment after all the hype around this game. Yes it's awesome. looks good and controls are great. I could play this all day long  ...If it would be actualy centered around parkour without the plot. Game is at it's best when you try to figure out a route across an area that looks just impossible. or you are following someone and trying to hang on. Game is also at it's worst when there is a lot of combat and deus ex style plot twists.  The pipes and bars marked red should have been skipped and instead given ample time to observe the roof tops and plan your route. Also there is very rarely any alternative routes despite the fact that the game tells you to be on the lookout for alternatives. Thumbs up anyways - If you are not that interested in parkour then atleast check out how Dice managed to make believable parkour game.			"

Rank:	8/10Recommendation(s):	Be interested in game art and yearn for something without gun mechanic focus.Major Theme:	Something different while doing tests for FrostBite.Bought at Price:	$20Different. That's the key here. If you are looking for something that doesn't have to do with gun mechanics all the time, this is the title for you.Being the FPS player I am, I still want to take breaks from the genre. Mirror's Edge at the time was the perfect solution. I don't have to pick up a gun to progress the action and story.Shooting enemies in a first person camera has always been a ""been there, done that"" thing. Just look at the Battlefield series. It's Americans vs. <Insert National Enemy>. Where's the new ""dyamics"" or ""mechanics"" that make it worthwhile to play? The answer is, there isn't, and that's where Mirror's Edge is different.Now, speaking about guns.. You can do all those fancy disarm moves and take guns for your own use — if that floats your boat you are allowed to do that. Remeber that you should be using your environment to your advantage, and that's where the challange lies.With simple colours, you may find your self looking at the environment instead of playing. Mirror's Edge has a very unique art style to it, which is yet another reason I picked the title up.While certainly an ""older"" game for sure, the graphics still have a kick. Throw in the integrated PhysX however, and the environment responds to a different factors. I should make a note here to say that the game ships with it's own copy of the PhysX dlls. This can cause serious frame rate drops when effects are activated. You can simply remove them to fix the issues. Just look online for details.So if this game is so ""great"", why does it have a 81 on the metascore? Isn't that against my recommendation system to tell people to play this game with such a low score? Here's the thing...The story... isn't long. It takes about 8 hours to finish the game. So price wise, $20 isn't worth the lack of story. $1 a hour for enjoyment tends to be my guideline, and works reasonably well for the most part.A lot of the cinematics should be done in game, but they aren't. There's nothing more I hate then low res compressed prerecorded cut scenes.Weapons look like the ones in Battlefield Bad Company 2. My suspition is due to testing for EA's (and thus DICE's) Frostbite engine. If you have played Battlefield Bad Company 2, you should see some simularities.To tag on here, there isn't really any interaction with other characters either. It tends to be a few words to whoever, and then that's it.So really I would still pass this game a thumbs up. However, I'd buy it on sale, and take some time to look at the environment.			"

												One of my favourite games I have ever played, Mirror's Edge is a unique game which has the potential to become a truly great franchise. Tight controls makes running around the game's different environments such a joy.It's minimilistic colour palette and high contrast art design, as well as the gorgeous graphics make this game look heavenly. Mirror's Edge is a thing of beauty. The ambient soundtrack fits into the minimilistic style of the game perfectly and just adds to that lonely atmospheric feeling the game has. I highly recommend it.			"

												The concept of not playing another first person shooter is refreshing but then game ruins it by introducing awful gunplay .First person platforming is not completely original idea but Mirror's Edge provides more variety for jumps and techniques .Overall this game is a mixed bag of experiences with some great and not so great moments . Some parts are exciting like jumping on a train but for the most part you stack in close spaces doing easy linear platforming which gets repetitive .Initially you are encouraged to avoid enemies which gives this game a unique feel . Unfortunetly toward second half of the game you often find yourself playing crapy first person shooter .I think game fails to progressively add more intuitive options to gameplay . If you played it for 1 hour you pretty much have seen eveything that it has to offer in terms of moves .Sliding down the building like Jackie Chan is awesome but there is not enough of that .I like the artstyle which is probably the best thing about this game .Animated cutscenes and aesthetic hights gives the game good atmosphere . It is a bit too bright sometimes but it makes the game look different . Music is good also but I wish there was more heavy techno for when you in danger .Not much to say about the story . I did not really care for it because of complete disbelief in a person running away from bulelts . 7/10 Mirror's Edge is very much linear so there is almost no creative ways to approching a problem . You just move from point A to poing B with poor gunplay and minimal fighting options . There is a lot of downtime in this game to do mindless platforming which I find a bit boring . It is unique enough to play it once but I am not really crazy about buying sequal .			"

												This game has been defined as a ""Cult Classic"" by Gameinformer in 2013 and, quite frankly, I couldn't agree more. The game did suprisingly horrible at launch, but over the years, Mirror's Edge is a force to be reckoned with. This game packs AMAZING visuals for such low requirements. The controls are absolutely perfect. They feel like you're not doing a ridiculous combo move to move Faith around, but you're also not one-buttoning it. The story is amazing, and packs a punch. You'll love feeling like a badass, dodging bullets and slaying the ""blues"" of the game. But, along with every person that has ever played this game ever, THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GUNS IN IT.			"

												Saturated colours and beautiful lighting combined with amazing music makes this an experience you must have. Movement is extremely satisfying making you feel like a parkour expert as you jump roof to roof. Combat can be frustrating at times; the few forced combat sections really stall the pacing of the game. The only time combat is done well is when fighting the assassin on chapter 7.The game has great potential for speed running as there are normally multiple paths available through most of the open areas which can help optimize your time through a level. It is very rewarding when you figure out a new path to help shave a few extra seconds off your time. There are also time trails which take place on different chapters found throughout the single player game. This displays a timer on the top of your screen and measures your time between checkpoints showing if you were faster or slower between each one.You can race against your friend’s ghosts for the best time, which is good fun especially if you are both racing each other at the same time and in a chat together. (Requires you login with an EA account)Being a new franchise they had to experiment with features which may or may not have worked, causing the game to have a few downfalls. But it definitely makes up for it with the unique experience it offers.			"

												Fantastic game.The game mechanics were fluid. The art style and soundtrack was beautiful. The story is debatable. Some find in cliche, others don't. I personally thought it was fine. The game is somewhat shorter than what you might expect, but the game itself has a lot of replayability. There are ""Race/Speedrun"" and ""timetrial"" versions of each level that aim to please players.Some describe the levels linear - as opposed to an open world - but I find that Mirror's Edge levels lies somewhere in between. Yes, objectives can be as simple as ""Getting from Point A to Point B"" but I believe the beauty is this game is that there are so many different routes to take to get to your objectives. Which is why I advice you to turn off ""Runner's Vision"" in the options. ""Runner's Vision"" is the guide to the game, showing you just ONE way to get to the objective. I feel the game is more fun when you discover these routes yourselves and develop your own ""Runner's Vision"" without the game doing it for you.I Already finished the main campaign but I'll be playing it again in the future. Then I'm off to it's sequel ""Mirror's Edge: Catalyst"" 10/10			"

ENG score 6/10 thumbed down due lack of neutral Go with the flow they said. You're going to go le parkour in first person they said. I'm running, looking for it while a blur effect cuts the screen - must be the babe ""feeling"" it, screen starts tearings badly - must be Nvidia Phsyx ""feeling it'', dead. Even with a GTX 970, turning it off, rebooting. Back again I need to jump, through the flow and up above a 4 meters wall - police start firing at me (again), need to jump, wrong direction, too fast, dead. Helicopter found me (again, no options) first person le parkour with white background, can't see a thing, too slow, dead. Another fighting, (while cops are firing as always) he's disarmed, another sniper ahead, dead. A flat roof! I can finally feel the flow!... nope, police start firing (again), bored, fingers hurting, dead. I try to get in the one said ""feeling"", but when I'm in, the flow is interrupted by some glitches here and there, bad design and EA's Illuminati dystopia cliche. How I will flow, if I'm always being barred by the game's mistakes?Port nota 6/10 negativado por falta de neutro Falaram pra ir no fluxo. Falaram dar uma de Altair do futuro em primeira pessoa. Estou correndo, quando sentindo, a tela fica desfocada - deve ser a gata ""sentindo"" aquilo, tela começa a cortar feio - deve ser a Phsyx da Nvidia ""sentindo"", até com uma GTX 970, desliguei, reiniciei. Voltei e preciso pular, por pelo menos 4 metros de parede - polícia já tá atirando em mim (denovo) preciso pular, direção errada, fui muito rápido, morte. Helicoptero me achou denovo (óbvio, vc não tem escolha) dar uma de Altair com cenário muito branco, não enxergo nada, fui devagar demais, morte. Outra luta (enquanto chove bala) disarmei-o, mas já outro sniper ali, morte. Um telhado liso! Agora sim posso sentir o fluxo!... nada, polícia já está atirando (denovo) enjoado, dedos doem, morte. Eu tento chegar no tal ""sentido"", mas quando estou quase despertando o meu cosmo, o fluxo é constantemente interrompido por glitches lá e cá, uma história de nova ordem mundial jaz machacada pela EA, e um mal design de jogo. Como vou fluir no tal do fluxo, se estou sempre sendo barrado pelo erros do jogo? "

												I only have to be mildly drunk before I start swearing this is the best game ever. It’s not, but between the fights there’s something absolutely unparalleled about the rough and tumble of scrambling around these rooftops and offices. You see yourself roll with every fall, feel every clamber, hear every breath and footfall, and at the same time you have a sense of how quiet and small it all is. Next to this vast, stingingly bright, bleach-clean city, you’re completely insignificant. Apparently that’s something I want to feel.			"

Personal Rating : ""Worth trying""Traditional Rating : 7/10Let's jump on conclusion, this one is a breakthrough of all platformer game with touch of 3D environment and well, running x jumping simulation.The overall story and gameplay is so so, neither the soundacting. Sometimes the cutscene are the Faith itself or just a cartoon drawing. And until now I still don't know what Faith doing.Despite of not-so-good story and roughly 5hours of gameplay, running and jumping a.k.a parkour, is always fun to do.The UI in-game are so minimum it makes you feel like your really face the running and obstacles yourself.the only, downside of this game, is countless trying.. sometimes the save point are so far away from the hardest part of the map, so everytime you die you need to run for a minute or two before facing the hard part again. Or sometimes its just too short from save point that when you respawn a second later you're already dead.The cycles always the same, run > dead > loading > run > (almost got it) but dead > et cetera.Im not fond of tryhard person, but it really iritates me when there's only a linear story and linear path to follow.TL;DRworth to try, easy to learn but hard to master. but no, it's not worth to master this game anyway.

												Surprisingly good game, I really enjoyed it despite its shortness (it takes about 5-7 hours to beat it, may be 10 hours with finding all collectives, but if you're interested in speedrun walkthrough, current world record is about 35 minutes with skipping all cut scenes and using all short cuts, if I'm not mistaken).Strong colours everywhere, protagonist is so full of life, whole city is beautiful(although a little empty on pedestrians), very immersive first person view, stylish 2d in game clips.Reminds me about Portal, where you have impressive (no sarcasm) running skills instead of portal gun. Climbing isn't as boring as in Assassin's creed, story is good too, although I find it a little unfinished.Levels are mix of running, labyrinth puzzles and fighting/running away from enemies. And some more running. Yes, even more on top of that.I enjoyed every minute of gameplay(except the time where I got stuck in puzzles).""Extras"" menu in game allows you to check some beautiful concept arts, from early ones to the latest pre-release ones.The game worth the price even without discounts, that's a rare sight to see, for me at least, so I totally recommend anyone to grab it and spend at least few evenings playing it.

												Definetly worth getting. Its quite nice fast-paced puzzle/fps game- unlike in Portal series, you have to think fast, on the go, while bullets fly by your ears.You play as Faith Connors, female runner in futuristic city ruled by dictatorship. Runners serve as line of communications for those who want freedom back.Anyways, this is sadly where things go.. cliché. Faith's sister is framed for murder she didnt do and rest of game Faith tries to save her. Without spoiling (hopefully), on top of everything this has open ending, for sequel that still isnt announced (new Mirror's Edge is prequel).But despite story, its incredibly fun game. There are literally dozens of ways to reach your goal in every map, you can fight guards, you can avoid them, you can lure them into your trap. There is nothing like playing peek-a-boo with cops with shotguns near shipping crates for few hours (though AI is actually quite good).Be warned though, at first this might seem dull because its frankly very easy to play trough it but bloody hard to master, but when you do, you are going to play this for hours			"

												The game started out fun, but the more I play it, the more of a drag it becomes. I just want to get through it.The game presents itself as a parkour game, when it's actually a fighting/puzzle solving game. The combat is super lame, you can punch and kick people, but they have heavy armor, so you can't take them out smoothly while running and you have to fight fists vs guns at point blank. It's usually easier to just pick up a gun from a fallen enemy and shoot. If I wanted to shoot people, I would have chosen to play literally any other shooter. The puzzles are also usually annoying because you miss one thing and spend up combing the map for it.I've only spent about 10% of my gametime doing cool parkour stuff, which I expected to be the point of the entire game.

												Pros- Interesting genre: parcours with FPS. A lot of variety.  - You 'should' not get lost as both visual and audio clues help you to find your way to your goal.- Some parts of the games are without any clues. This allows you to be a bit creative and succeeding feels more rewarding. This is what games such as 'Remember Me' are lacking. - The controls are generally rather smooth...- ... and the FPS elements let you blow off some steam when the controls just fail. Because you die - a lot. - The respawn system works well. Really. - Stunning graphics and environments- Very fitting music- A great amount of detail in terms of random banter. Cons- The story. Only the surface of so many things has been scratched. No depth and the ending feels abrupt. - Basically no character development and everyone feels like a filler. You do not get attached to your heroine.- Controls are sometimes horrible for no reason whatsoever. Very, very annoying.- The odd balance between ""a lot of help"" and ""no help whatsoever"" in the parcours makes the game rather frustrating. - The combat system is difficult to master. Even slowing down time (your ability) makes it difficult to disarm ennemies. - Avoiding combat feels much better than actually fighting.- No replayability. No time trials. - Collectables are pointless as they do not unlock anything nor give any achievements.  - Audio quality sometimes sucks as most of the conversations happen through radio waves.  While you are being shot at by machine guns.- FPS Issues despite owning a Nvidia card. Disabling PhysX is mandatory. - Alt+Tab is a deathwish.I honestly did not enjoy this game. You might.			"

												This game has a particular fanbase, guess that isn't me. Beat it in under 6hrs, also with no achievments theres no point in playing without using guns.Mirror's Edge is a unique parkour style game with some cool elements and tension driven missions toward the end (where enemies parkour chase you).However with some clunky controls and a cheesy story with oddly done cutscenes it's not very memorable. At least for me.Worth it on sale, definitely recommend using a controller.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a pretty incredible game- as is everything made by DICE, I'd say. Not only is this a great game to play, but it also functions as en excellent gag-gift for those mates of yours that can't play Portal. And unlike Portal, this game, will DESTROY them. In this game, you play as Faith, a master in CQC and parkour, working for a secret orginization trying to lay low from the dystopian future government and corrupt politicians. It's hard to lay low when you've got people on your tail the second they see you though- so wave your middle finger proudly and RUN with all the secret information that must be witheld from the city officials. Featuring Feng Shui-friendly environments, you will run through what appears to be endless IKEA locations; just no stopping for Swedish meatballs.With gameplay similar to the GoPro Helmet Camera used in BMX activiites, you will become a free-running, clock-punching, adrenaline junkie with a disregard for cardinal direction!

												Mirror's Edge was released in 2007 as one of the first Frostbite Engine games, as a proof-of-concept of sorts. You play as Faith, a runner (messenger) in a futuristic city that can't seem to decide whether it's in America or Asia, with signs displaying both English words and characters. The color scheme is amazing, and the way lighting and textures are handled, I probably would've guessed it was released in 2010 or 2011 based on how good it looks. Faith gets through the city using parkour moves, with the game focusing more on acrobatics than combat mechanics. Running, jumping, sliding, and the other moves feel fluid and not at all nausea-inducing, but fighting is reduced to mashing buttons and hoping you don't die. There are only 3 types of guns, which you pick up off police officers and drop when ammo is gone, but gunplay is minimal in the game. This is encouraged by not being able to do any sort of parkour while holding a gun. I found myself only using Runner Vision (slow-mo) when I really needed to, though mostly just to make long jumps look really cool. I did also find myself accidentally triggering it fairly often. Bugs are rare, having encountered only 2 or 3 in the many times I've played it.TL;DR - Looks great, but you need a higher-end GPU. Parkour is great, combat not so much. Overall fun, and more should be expected from 2015 (?) sequel. More should be revealed E3 2014.			"

Game looks nicer because some things shine a lot but that is because they programmed it so that there you see no more coloyr, only the shiny thing- Missions are somewhat repetitive, some are too easy, some are way too difficult- Storyline hard to believe but still interesting enough ( cuz it's a cartoon for God's sake!)- Although the city looks well planned and beautiful, no free running 'round unfortunately.

												Mirror's Edge is a properly done 3d Sonic in disguise.If you are stopping to fight enemies, you did something wrong. In fact, if you are slowing down at all, you did something wrong.Much like in Sonic, speed is earned in Mirror's Edge. It's the reward for doing well. Are the levels linear? Yes. Does that make them bad? No. Does that make it so that there are no options? Heck no. If you play time trial mode, you'll quickly discover that you did the levels in the story mode all wrong- you were taking the wrong paths, timing your jumps badly, or otherwise screwing up.The occasional platforming puzzle can sometimes be frustrating, but if you're looking for a game about dodging gunfire as you wallrun, power-slide, vault, and just flat-out RUN, you've found the right title.Now hurry up with the damn sequel, DICE.

												Mirror's Edge is special, because they took a very simple approach, using existing gameplay mechanics in such a way as to basically create a new genre: first-person platformer, very much inspired by parkour.The game is pretty much flawed in some instances, perhaps by trying way too much to appeal to gamers used to first-person shooter at some points in the game.Perhaps they didn't quite know themselves what they had in their hands when they made the game, but hopefully they can now use it to build a better sequel and in the meantime, Mirror's Edge is definitely worth a playthrough.

												Even though this game caught my attention back in 2008, I didn't get the chance to play it until recently. I am glad I took the time to go back and try this, because it was definitely a great purchase. The story was certainly good, albeit a bit too short for my tastes, but what truly made this a good purchase was the unique ""puzzle"" aspect of the game. There were plenty of brain stumpers sprinkled throughout and gave it a good challenge so it wasn't too easy and rewarded the player with a sense of self-satisfaction when getting through a level. The fighting/gun mechanics could've been a lot better, but for what the game was made to center around; it definitely hit the nail on the head.The environment and music certainly immerses you in the experience and sets the tone for an exciting/fast-paced game that will keep you playing until the very end. I say if it's on sale, then it's worth picking up and trying for yourself.			"

												A beautiful game with a very distinct art style. While in the actual game you're in a 3D environment, the story parts are in 2D, in style reminiscent of a graphic novel.Gameplay can become quite frustrating at times, as timing is extremely important. You might find youself repeating the same part of the level literally dozens of times. After the first three levels though, you should probably understand how to solve most of the problems.The tutorial, while going very in-depth and showing you practically every move you might need in-game, feeds you all the information in one five-minute session. If you're not one of those people that remember every combination of keystrokes right away, you might find yourself in a pinch not knowing what to do when faced with certain obstacles (going from personal experience: by forgetting I had the ability to double tap space while wall running, I added probably one or two hours of gameplay and frustration to my first playthrough). But once you get the hang of the controls and figure out the different ways you can use your surroundings to move around, most of the levels become a breeze.While the story, in terms of development, is pretty predictable, there's a few aspects that make it (and the whole game) stand out. For one, the main character is a woman of Asian descent, who instead of being driven by some kind of romantic nonsense, is trying to save her sister. No one makes a deal about her being a woman, no one even acknowledges it. She's not special because of it. She's just another runner. And that is really great, in my opinion.In conclussion: after two hours of head-bashing against the keyboard trying to understand the controls, it quite quickly jumped to one of my top 10 games of all time. The recently announced Mirror's Edge 2 is definitely on my watch list.			"

												In Mirror's Edge, you can choose to either play aggressively or passively. The whole fun of the game (and the obvious core) is running around and doing parkour in possibly one of the most beautiful cities you could ever parkour in (and clean). For a game released in 2009, it's more than what you could ask for (visually/aesthetically talking). The clean, peaceful and safe feeling that the environment around you provides is simply amazing (which is funny seeing how sometimes you might be running for your life). Even though the overall game is visually stunning, some of the levels (again, visually speaking) will just keep you speechless (causing my deaths several times in several levels, but...""IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT.""The game itself, well. Some levels you will find incredibly frustrating and nearly impossible at times, but that's actually a good thing, or a pro about the game. The reason behind this is, because once you manage to accomplish the level, the satisfaction and the sense of accomplishment (and lets admit, cleverness) is beyond satisfying. Cons? Well, my top recommendation is to disable physx. That is basically the killer of the game. It can cause severe (and I mean SEVERE) frame issues and lag, even going as far as crashing your game. I'd also recommend avoiding confrontation when faced against many cops or snipers (oh how I despise those snipers).Oh and, you'll find out what I mean when I say that you should probably RUN FOR YOUR LIFE when you're being chased by your shadows (or runner's shadows, not quite a spoiler. As you probably don't have a clue of what I'm taking about).If you're having problems in deciding if the game is worth it or not, I guarantee it, if you love parkour and stunning visuals, go for it. I'd also recommend it so you get to know the origin of Mirror's Edge (as the second one will be coming out eventually).What are you waiting for, buy the game!			"

												At best Mirror's Edge is fast paced and brilliantly exciting. Leaping across buildings, sliding and rolling through a beatifully stylised city, the parkour can be fast and fluid with a real sense of freedom. Dodging bullets and racing through buildings, disarming guards and finding quiet moments by sneaking through air vents is all great fun. For odd bursts of thirty seconds or so, this game is brilliant.Then you find a jump which is just too pixel-perfect and takes thirty tries to get right, or the slightly awkward combat and inconsistent level design keeps getting you killed, or despite the hint system it simply isn't obvious where to go next or how. As well as being frustrating in themselves, these events break up the pace of the game and take the shine off the best parts.If it were consistent, this would be one of the best games ever made. As it is, it is a variable experience which is superb in parts and well worth playing overall.			"

												There is no doubt - ""Mirror's Edge"" is a masterpiece.It was released in 2009, but even now it's a pretty good game. In fact, I think ""Mirror's Edge"" was one of those pattern-makers in game industry, which highly increased awesomeness of first-person-games-gameplay.This game kinda reminds me ""Portal"", because the point of the game is finding a way out. That's it.You can distinguish two parts in ""Mirror's Edge"".First one. I'd call it ""Flying part"", because in these moments you can truelly relax and go with the stream. Just fast running, jumping, finding new directions to go. This part makes an impression of this game, cause it takes the most time of the game.The second one is a ""Puzzle part"". Like in ""Portal"", you can go through the game with insane speed and then BOOM. You got stuck. There was a couple of places where I really got stuck for a long time, but this makes this game more interesting. Sometimes you gotta stop and realise that this game is not about button-mashing. There is some intellectual work here, you know.So both of these parts are perfectly combined in one game, mixed and interfered from time to time by a simple combat with enemies. And when you play it, it goes really well.I can't say that there are some deep thoughts in a story-line, jokes in a dialoges or some really unexcpected plot-twists, BUT this game is amazing. It's all about gameplay, I guess, and about this freedom that you feel in a mid-air.And having good gameplay only doesn't spoil anything. Very unique game. Totally a ""must-have"".So go buy it, cause I'm out of words.			"

												Mirror's Edge. Fast-paced action game all about momentum and using three buttons to do a million things. The game is set in a dystopian and overly uniform city of towering skyscrapers, and the plot revolves around the murder of a close friend of the main character's family. The game is essentially get to Point A to Point B, without dying, as fast as you can. Combat is rather awkward and there isn't much of a way to learn moves except trial and error, which can prove to be extremely irratating. Graphics reflect the dystopian world in solid, vivid colors, and keep the puzzles simpler as different key objects can be easily separated by the distinct colors. Voice acting is tolerable, but not especially impressive. As previously mentioned, momentum is imperative in performinfg many of the game's not-so-realistic moves, but oddly is often lost in solving some of the intermediately difficult puzzles. Overall, I would recommend this game.Graphics: simple yet uniquely beautiful. Gameplay: engaging, smooth and straightforward, although some moves are difficult to figure out. Story: not exactly gripping, but good enough for a parkour game.I would give it a confident 8/10 review.			"

												Mirrors Edge is one of the most innovative games ive seen in a while. I does something that no on has done before which is making a game solely based on parkour and freerunning. The game has very little combat but it isnt a flaw here, the sheer adrenaline and excitement that the freerunning gives you completely makes up for it. Story wise this game isnt very big on that. You wont care for most of the characters besides the protagonist Faith who is a total bad♥♥♥♥♥ The overall plot is a bit convoluted and boring but is still a fun game. It is a short game so i would recommend you get the game when its on sale for less than 10 dollars. The main game is around 7-8 hours long with the extra time trials maybe giving an hour or two of extra fun. 7.6/10 great game.			"

												8/10 Original e viciante.O tema do parkour leva aqui umas pinceladas de história para justificar um jogo em que corremos, saltamos e voamos pelo alto dos edifícios de uma cidade deliciosamente desenhada, com contornos minimalistas mas salpicada com pormenores q.b.É extremamente viciante percorrer aqueles telhados e descobrir caminhos que normalmente não percorreríamos, acelerando cada vez mais. A sensação de velocidade e de liberdade é o que torna este jogo viciante e permite esquecer a história com algumas lacunas. Os cutscenes também merecem destaque, por se demarcarem dos gráficos (bastante bons) do jogo e apostarem numa vertente mais banda-desenhada que acaba por funcionar bem após o choque inicial.No fundo, é um jogo de puzzles e perícia. Parece simples. E é. Mas é extremamente agradável de jogar. E, sendo que o Mirror's Edge 2 já foi anunciado para breve... não percam este!			"

												Mirrors Edge's negatives blurred the fun concepts. The game's music, and cut scene animation was near perfection, being both unique and beautiful. However the level design, (some cases) voice acting, and gameplay was the epitome of a repetitiveness. I felt as if i was playing the same level over and over again, until the story finally threw it's self together during every cutscene. By far the worst problem was repetition, and this was will hopefully be improved in the sequel.			"

												 If you are tired of the usual genres and gameplay styles and want something new give this a go.  Yes, parkour is sooooo 2005, but it's really well done here: it's fast, fluid, and fun with just the right balance in player control required to keep the game from turning into ether a cumbersome and overcomplicated mess or an over simplified and tedious push-a-button-and-mindlessly-jump-from-roof-to-roof ""Assassain's Creed"" type experience.  The storyline isn't all that great (although it's kind of refreshing in its ""run from the bad guys!"" simplicity), but the graphics are still awesome 4 years later and the art design has a nice ""Run Lola Run"" meets ""Blade Runner"" aesthetic to it.    The game can get a bit too ""trial and error"" at times, but it's so short (I completed the entire thing in 4 hours my first time through) and it looks and plays so well that it really doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's the perfect game to get on sale for 5 dollars and waste an evening or so with.			"

												Positives:-Gorgeous visuals, with colorful aesthetics, that escape from the boring greys and darks from typical urban environments in videogames.-Well implemented Parkour gameplay (the core aspect of the game), with decent physics and a nice flow of momevement and momentum. A breath of fresh air, on a market where all first person games are shooters by default.-Great soundtrack, that fits the visuals of each level (even for those who dont usually appreciate the subgenre of ambient music, like me).-Faith, the protagonist and best character in the game.Negatives:-The combat gameplay, felt a bit clunky and forced, i always preferred to run away form enemies.-The shooting gameplay is not very good, but it wasnt supposed to be anyway, with the option of not using firearms in all scenarios, and discarding the guns when done with them (this is a positive!).-The story and most secondary characters are, if not bad, at least, unremarkable, and the ending is too rushed (hopefully the sequel will provide more answers and some sense of achievement).Overall:Great, innovative game with fun, fluid (not so much on my crap PC) gameplay, with a short story but with a good amount of extra challenges, that add up to a nice length of entertainment. May Mirrors Edge 2 come quickly, and even better!			"

												This game is a great example of a game where the controls/options/mechanics don't have to be super in depth for it to be extremely enjoyable.  Once you get down movement of the game (which can take a while), speeding through areas, flying over sky scrapers, and dodging police can give you an adrenaline rush at some times.  Movement is nice and fluid, and the soundtrack is amazing.  It's not that expensive of a game either, so I'd say it is definitely worth picking up.

												Completed the game in 5 hours in mostly normal, and then eventually turned the level down to easy. The story was 'meh', but at least there was some sort of story. This was the first game though, where I was really scared while playing. This isn't a horror game, but you do run away a lot. Whenever people show up with guns, I freak out, and noticed that I was holding my breath the whole time while trying to flee from the gunmen. Pretty fun puzzle game.			"

												This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the ""intelligent"" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.			"

												One of the most unique games you'll ever  play, albeit not without it's rough edges. Mirror's Edge fuses platforming and parkour in a first-person perspective. You'll do lots of climbing and running, and with the exception of a few problem areas, it's very easy to control your character. The visual design is an eye-catching mix of real and abstract, with lots of sterile white and heavily-saturated colors that help you quickly make your way along rooftops and through interior sections.The sound design and music are excellent. Objects whizz by your ears and you feel every scrape, slide, and impact. The music is dynamic, changing based on whether or not you are being pursued or what you're doing.That said, Mirror's Edge suffers from its own design. The level design is near-perfect at some times, but in other times the layouts are so damn confusing. Autosaves are well-placed, but it tends to rub salt in the would, especially considering how hard it is to make vertical distance as opposed to horizontal distance. The controls in the context of climbing or scaling things are either unresponsive or lead to unintended consequences.And to add to these occasional moments of frustration, the game boasts micro-sized gunfights and a few scripted fight sequences. These do a decent job of breaking the platforming, but they're frustrating in their own right. The gunplay feels very hollow and brings the speed and grace to a grinding halt. Normally you can run past your assailants, but a few times you will need to disarm them and slaughter every hostile in the area before you can continue. It feels incredibly shoehorned, half-baked, and I daresay it goes against the setting and the characters' nature. There are also two or three sequences where you need to fight or disarm someone as part of a cutscene, and these are not only frustrating, but they stop the game flow entirely.There's also the issue of the story. It's all over the place, and it rarely makes sense. She's something of a courier, but her higher-up has no qualm about her running around and trying to solve her own problems instead of actually doing her job. The game shuffles you around different areas and stories, hoping you won't realize it actually fleshes none of them out. The animated cutscenes are nice, but considering the game can be completed in an afternoon, there's nothing long-lasting about them. It's the kind of game that would benefit from a nicely-crafted story; unfortunately, you won't get that here.Despite all this, however, Mirror's Edge isn't a bad game. It shows hints of pure genius, and for the most part it's good. It's unique enough to stand out in almost every aspect, but the experience as a whole is kind of forgettable.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a first person parkour game with platforming and shooter elements. The player takes control of Faith as she uncovers the plot of murder, into which her sister was framed.The graphics look amazing for its time, and stand out even today. Just like it's name suggests, the environments are shiny and often pure eye candy (if you like big cities or semi-futuristic rooms).The gameplay is very simple: you use your parkour skills to move from one location to the next, exploring new areas, forwarding the story, and sometimes fighting enemies. For movement, you can perform wallruns, walljumps, pull-ups, rolls, slides... overall, it feels like there is no obstacle you can't surmount. The game (on lower difficulties, at least) also supplies you with Runner Vision, coloring red every object that you can use to move forward. The controls, while not lacking in options, do feel kind of stiff however. Mostly because you see everything from first-person perspective and thus your vision is often obscured by some objects. Environmental awareness is the key to success. Also, one bad jump or trick can send you plummetting to your death (which is a quite realistic portrayal of how it feels to fall from 30-story building to your death), but whenever that happens, it's almost always your fault.Combat, however, tends to be frustrating. Considering a few bullets will put you down and you often fight several gun-wielders while unarmed, it's quite understandable that you'll be at a disadvantage. Even on Normal it's very easy to lose. However, it's not that bad once you get the hang of it and can also wield weapons taken from defeated enemies (you do only get one clip, tho). The game gives you pistols, submachine guns, machine guns, and even sniper rifles at some points of the game, so don't be afraid to use those.The game offers three main gamemodes: Story, Race and Speedrun. Story allows you to play through different chapters of the story mode, accompanied by comic book-style custscenes. This mode is however very short, taking only maybe five hours to complete, including retries due to frequent deaths. Race allows you to do time trials on various short sections of the game, after which the game rates your performance. Speedrun is unlocked after completing the game and is basically Race applied to whole chapters of the Story mode.Overall, this game is very well done, a bit short, but has a good replay value.			"

												Mirror's Edge. Painfully tedious at times, too heavily reliant on guns, unimpressive combat.And yet, the best parkour game out there, probably. (Until ME: Catalyst comes out.)Worth buying if you like these kinds of games.Parkour was not a theme commonly used in games until recently. So when Mirror's Edge came out no doubt people would have been excited. And as a person that enjoys Titanfall, I think it's got the best first-person mobility on the market. (ME, not Titanfall, great game though it is.)But the fluidity came at a cost. I can't help but feel DICE tried too hard to make it part-FPS. The combat breaks the smooth free feel of the game, unless you just run away. They're fixing this in Catalyst, making the combat more parkour-based, which is only good news. So, that's another box ticked for fans of the game.One of ME's best qualities was that, in theory, most chapters could be beaten in one fluid run, without stopping. And it does a good job of replicating the adrenaline-filled leaps of faith that comes with rooftop running.And you can't help but admire the art style of the city. It's a beautiful landscape of white and red that can hardly be put into words. It has to be experienced.Except that you're kind of trapped in small areas in the levels. But, again, DICE is adressing this and giving Catalyst the open world that the original desperately needed.To summmarise:Good parkourBad mostly everything else, but that doesn't matterEasy on the eyes - very easyNeeds open world and better fighting (both happening, thanks DICE)Buy this if you can't be bothered to climb a building and jump off roofs yourself.I would have made this review humourous, but I just couldn't think of any jokes. Sorry, folks.			"

												When it comes to gaming, it takes a lot to get me to actually finish a game. Usually I play a decent ways through, get bored, drop the game for a few months, and then if I try again I have to start from scratch because I don't remember what I'm doing. Mirror's Edge, however, broke the pattern: This game seriously captivated me start to finish and honestly I would've still been hooked if it went twice as long.You can't access hard mode until you've played through the game at one of the lower difficulties, so I went ahead and made it more challenging on my own by turning off Runner's Vision and refusing to shoot a gun. This was so much fun: Without Runner's Vision suddenly every room was not just an obstacle course but a puzzle where you had to figure out where exactly you can grab ledges or scurry up walls to get to the exit. And without grabbing a gun I got the satisfaction of punching a bunch of enemies in the face repeatedly, even if I died a lot because it's still ""fists vs bullets"" after all.The story left a bit to be desired in my opinion. The plot twists were rather predictable and I would've liked a little ""hint of the future"" at the end of the story rather than an abrupt ""Welp, that sure happened."" It keeps the story open-ended, certainly, but nevertheless it just felt unsatisfying. I also think it would've been good to have more red herrings about where you're supposed to go with additional pointless ramps or some such, but that might just be because my favorite part was the puzzle of not using Runner's Vision and I like challenging puzzles.All in all, this is a fantastic game that I heartily recommend. It feels so real without a visible health bar or constant background music that you will be suddenly convinced that jumping between buildings in real life is a good idea. I also heartily recommend turning off Runner's Vision especially for your first playthrough, since it makes things a lot more fun than just allowing the game to tell you where to go.			"

Time for Parkour!This is a good parkour game that has a lot of action and an interesting enough story to make you want to keep playing. The controls take a little bit to get used to however the tutorial is adequate enough so that you have a decent feel for the game before you make the leap to fighting enemies at the same time. With that being said the combat is challenging at times and doesnt feel clunky, and the techno music the accompanies the game is fitting. However it should be mentioned that the game is fairly short for a single-player game, with the main story being approximately 6 hours long. Although it is short, this game is very cheap to buy on the steam sales and other sites, so it is definitely going to be worth the money shoudl you buy it at a discounted price :)			"

Definitely a fun game if you like to really let yourself be taken away by  a tense moment in a game world. Worth the sale price. SUGGESTION: Don't come to this party packing a 9800GT or some other vid card from the Bush Administration. This game needs power. Also check the forums if you can't get the  Physx effects working. You sometimes have to install an older version of Physx if I remember correctly.			"

												Mirror's Edge has a really short but nonetheless very enjoyable singleplayer campaign. It takes roughly 5 hours to complete. The story set for the campaign is decent- but that shouldn't deter you from buying the game. The main selling point of this game is the parkour. The parkour is very enjoyable, you will get to do many stunts and it will feel quite satisfying. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop, ziplining, walljumping and even using weapons (even though it is quite mediocre).There aren't many cons to this game, overall it is a decent game but there isn't much to do other than the campaign, and that being quite short- leaves you at a quench for more. I'd recommend this game, but do yourself a favor and buy it during a sale.			"

												Mirror's Edge. Fast-paced action game all about momentum and using three buttons to do a million things. The game is set in a dystopian and overly uniform city of towering skyscrapers, and the plot revolves around the murder of a close friend of the main character's family. The game is essentially get to Point A to Point B, without dying, as fast as you can. Combat is rather awkward and there isn't much of a way to learn moves except trial and error, which can prove to be extremely irratating. Graphics reflect the dystopian world in solid, vivid colors, and keep the puzzles simpler as different key objects can be easily separated by the distinct colors. Voice acting is tolerable, but not especially impressive. As previously mentioned, momentum is imperative in performinfg many of the game's not-so-realistic moves, but oddly is often lost in solving some of the intermediately difficult puzzles. Overall, I would recommend this game.Graphics: simple yet uniquely beautiful. Gameplay: engaging, smooth and straightforward, although some moves are difficult to figure out. Story: not exactly gripping, but good enough for a parkour game.I would give it a confident 8/10 review.			"

												I wish we could see more games like Mirror's Edge in the future. Mirror's Edge is not the usual first-person shooter or adventure game. Instead, it is a game highly focused on art. The buildings contain outstanding color schemes and the game always feels very bright. However, not only is the environment stunning but the score and Faith's movement are outstanding as well. The score is perfect. It adds so much to the game without drowning out the sounds of the city when you would expect to hear it. It was also very captivating at times that you would want it to be. Faith's movements feel very real and fluid. It is extremely satisfying to jump from a high place and hit the ground with a roll. The story in this game is quite good, but not the best. This is because I was overwhelmed by the fantastic score and eye candy building interiors.    Though this game is outstanding in almost every way, it also has its faults. I found it extremely difficult to memorize the controls. Certain actions, such as jumping, are mapped to an odd place on the controller (Left shoulder button). However, I don't see it being mapped any other way that would have made sense. The only other down side that I have noticed would be the rare glitch in the free running mechanics. This is expected because no video game is without a glitch or flaw somewhere. Overall, Mirror's edge is one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a long time. This is definitely one of my favorite games.  I see myself playing it in the future time, and time again.			"

The Leveldesign is awesome, even the Handling and the possibilities to reach the goals. The Replay-value is high, because you can try to beat your last time, you can compare your powers and skills in Timetrials and compare the result to other Player all over the World or just beat the Game on another Difficult and get some other Achievements!Just pick it up and play it right now.

There really isn't anything wrong with the game besides the combat, and the fact that it is unlike most other first person experiences. Five years later, the game is still way worth the money.

I have played through the story about 6 times now and every time you find a new route to shave seconds off your previous record. The movement  in this game is what makes it truely unique. Faith controls like an actual person and running and jumping feels fluid and natural.The combat consists mostly of spamming attacks and pre animated takedowns but as you play the game you realise that you should be running past everyone anyway.Give this game a try. Play for two hours and if you're not hooked by then then get a refund because you'll have already experienced everything this game has to offer.			"

Mirror's Edge ReviewFree-running game with a terrible storyline but fantastic mechanics.The most fantastic parkour game ever created by mankind. Would of been better as an open world experience, but still great. The sequel to this game, Mirror's Edge: Catalyst is coming out reasonably soon and that will be open world, so that's hopefully going to be fantastic!This game is very well optimized and has some nice graphics. Albeit, the visuals can be a bit tiring at some times because of the lack of colour to the enviroment. Regardless of the visuals, this has some brilliant parkour gameplay! The controls are not what you'd think but are very easy to learn once you start playing!Also, please skip the cartoon cutscenes. The storyline in this game is terrible, ignore it completely for the best experience with this game.			"

												An amazing game! The first person perspective redone in a fully immersive experience. Sure, at certain points you can disarm and use guard weapons against them, but that isn't the focus of the game. It's about running, jumping, and using parkour style techniques to work your way past guards and through obsticles. Hearing the character breathing, hearing and even FEELING the damage done by messed up jumps, and the camera's movements according to the character has literally left me on the edge of my seat more than once. If you enjoy platform games, enjoy a action packed game, enjoy a parkour-style game, I highly recommend Mirror's Edge. And if you enjoyed this game already be sure to keep on the lookout for a Mirror's Edge 2, I've heard that there's one in the making!			"

												Mirror's Edge is special, because they took a very simple approach, using existing gameplay mechanics in such a way as to basically create a new genre: first-person platformer, very much inspired by parkour.The game is pretty much flawed in some instances, perhaps by trying way too much to appeal to gamers used to first-person shooter at some points in the game.Perhaps they didn't quite know themselves what they had in their hands when they made the game, but hopefully they can now use it to build a better sequel and in the meantime, Mirror's Edge is definitely worth a playthrough.

The graphics, oh my god, so realistic and I can admire the details in the enviroment. But then again, I'm a little old-school on videogames such as ps2 gamecube or even nintendo 64 so you probably won't be surprised if your used to the new graphics today. It's so much fun running with very well-fitted music and sometimes I feel the adrenaline pumping when I know the parkour persuit cops are on my tail. Seriously, I got intersted in free-running after playing this game. This is a game where you are struck in awe, but a shame that the adventure ends quick. The game's a little short and I wished there had been more modes than just time trial and single player.. EA and Dice definately needs to make a sequel.

												Did I like this game? Not at first, no. It took a while to like it. My main problem with it? Nvidia. PhysX is awful. Its broken. It doesn't work. I spent the longest time trying to get the game to stop lagging and to stop screen-tearing. I gave up for a couple months, and eventually came back. This time I figured out what was wrong. It was PhysX. So I enabled v-sync and disabled PhysX. BAM, suddenly the game runs perfectly. BUT when you finally get into the game, its great. The running is a bit awkward, parts of the running and stuff seem unrealistic, however on the whole, its pretty awesome. You get to run around and jump and vault and wall-run and more. What I wish they'd fix is the combat. Its okay, I guess, but when you're trying to disarm, its a 50/50 for whether you can actually do it. Most of the time you're a split-second late or early, and the soldier kills you. You can take a few shots, but it gets to the point later in the game where you're getting killed what seems to be WAY too easily, compared to earlier in the game. The story is great if you're paying attention. It could be a lot better, they should have revealed more about what happened to the City and how its come to this awful state its in now, but instead they set all the focus on saving Kate. Its not bad, because its still a pretty great story, but it could be better and more indepth. I figure Mirror's Edge 2 (if it ever gets released, and if DICE doesn't ♥♥♥♥ it up) will have all that backstory.			"

												I enjoyed the time I had with Mirrors Edge. While it manages to pull of a beautifully fluent free running and combat system that tie greatly into the world, it does have its host of problems.The first thing I saw in Mirror's Edge was the controls. At first, I was hard on the idea that these controls sucked, and that they needed alot of tweaking. However, I learned quickly the game had a curve to it, and got passed the controls. When I finally got good at basic movements, I became absorbed in the world. The towering skyscrapers, colorful rooftops as well as the very dark secrets that were hid in this utopian masquerade. Cool right? Yes. However, it is really hard for me to appreciate the mythos of the game beyond its scenery, and beautiful scoring. This was because the story was god awful. Riddled with messy , sloppy, cheezy, and otherwise worthless dialouge, there was no way I was going to give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the sister to sister relationship in the story. And to put the icing on the cake, I was utterly displeased with the ending. You will know when you get there. Completely disregarding the story, the freerunning in the game was spectacular. With many ways to run on rooftops and build up momentum, I was very much envigorated when I pulled off the perfect string of moves. The blur on the sides of the screen when momentum building is a very amazing feeling. Then came the combat. For reasons I can not understand, people hated the combat in the game. And I agree and disagree at the same time. While pulling off ninja moves on a guard was fitting for the missons, the gunplay was stale. This could have easily been avoided by making weapons more sleek and getting rid of the heavy guns. It really brought me out of all the agility in the game when I lugging around a huge♥♥♥♥♥M249. So for Mirrors Edge 2, please keep the gunplay; but make it exciting! Make me feel like a badass when I finally get the gun out of the guards hands and run away from the firefight.There is also one other problem in the game, and that was the Runner's Vision. While artisticly this was cool, I felt as a game mechanic I did not like this. However, this really comes down to personal preference. I personally thought Runner's Vision held my hand throughout the game, highlighting where I should go next. Being chased from rooftop to rooftop by guards is not very fun when you know exactly where to go - I want to have to think fast to move to my objective! This mechanic can only be turned off on the hardest difficulty too, which is a shame. However, this is totally up to you on what you want out of Mirror's Edge. To conclude, Mirrors Edge is a great game. Free running is a wonderful time, and stringing together the perfect combo is simply rewarding as hell. The combat, while it can be vastly improved, is a good concept. And Runner's Vision is totally up to personal prefrence. The world is spectacular too, really putting a ""POW"" into the scenery with all its spectacular and vibrant color, while appropiatley contrasting the darkness that lies within the utopian universe. I really wish I could care more for the politics in this game, but the story is just too boring and dull for me to care! Characters are generic and unexciting, not to mention the cutscenes look like an All State commercial. But overall, this game is a gem, and the parkour is hands down the best I have ever been able to experience.			"

												This is a personal favorite of mine. The graphics are great, the combat system is somewhat complex, but doesn't have a steep learning curve. I love the color scheme that they have, the use of white to make color stand out. The storyline is well written, and the song ""Still Alive"" (Not GlaDOS) is one of the big reasons why I love this game. However, don't enable Nvidia's PhysX or whatever if you don't have an Nvidia card, or whenever glass breaks it will LAAAAAAAAAAAAG. Might have just been me though.Overall, I would highly reccomend this game.			"

												As im reading the reviews on here, im noticing alot of graphical difficulties. This I personally solved by turning off the physics portion in the options. For some reason the bullet particles cause lag. I can recommend this game as a precursor to Catalyst, but only because i finished it. Parkour is so so ie Dying Light makes this look like a bad joke. Combat is horrid but passible IF you can remember to jump kick and steal their guns long enough to shoot them dead. Reason why i think its a mediocre undone mess is that towards the end of the game you are required to jump jump jump up a tower of construction peices while bouncing off walls, and without precision aiming its nearly impossible to execute. Is the game fun, of course. Is is worth buying, on sale yes. Is it worth more than one playthrough, depends on your level of patience with crap mechanics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat. Story is fairly simple with a few twists. The graphics style of anime story is kinda lame, but its just the format, doesnt depreciate the game. Something wouldve made this game excellent regardless of the crap mechanics is free running, but all you get is time trials which only unlock after beating the levels ie you rerun what you beat in the game. There is no circuit of path you can go like some the of newer fps that basically let you run around the map in practice mode: this i hear is dealt wth in Catalyst by becoming open world. Also mentioning graphics: Turning off Physics, Post Processing and Anti Aliasing should fix the lag fps. Over all, this game is clearly 5/10. I recommend this game on sale ONLY as a practice for Catalyst.HOPEULLY THE DEVS FIX THINGS FOR THE NEW ONE			"

												Mirror's Edge is a fun, fast paced first person parkour game where you get to play as Faith, a runner(someone who act as a courier to transmit messages while evading government surveillance) as she escapes countless encounters with the government hunting her down. It's a game where you have to parkour over objects and obstacles to reach your point of destination, occasionally fighting enemies with melee and firearms. I personally feel like the game would have been better without the shooting parts. It kind of interferes with the pace of the game imo. The graphics are beautiful, they still look good. Overall, it's a great game for anyone who wants to experience a first person parkour game.Sound: 7.5/10 pretty goodGraphics: 8/10 good for their time, still looks good todayGameplay: 9/10 It's innovative and good for what it does.Characters: 5/10 nothing really interesting about themStory: 5/10 It has a good premise but it doesn't really get better than that, pretty lacking.Overall: 7/10 awesome game, get it if you like first person parkour			"

												One of the most unique games you'll ever  play, albeit not without it's rough edges. Mirror's Edge fuses platforming and parkour in a first-person perspective. You'll do lots of climbing and running, and with the exception of a few problem areas, it's very easy to control your character. The visual design is an eye-catching mix of real and abstract, with lots of sterile white and heavily-saturated colors that help you quickly make your way along rooftops and through interior sections.The sound design and music are excellent. Objects whizz by your ears and you feel every scrape, slide, and impact. The music is dynamic, changing based on whether or not you are being pursued or what you're doing.That said, Mirror's Edge suffers from its own design. The level design is near-perfect at some times, but in other times the layouts are so damn confusing. Autosaves are well-placed, but it tends to rub salt in the would, especially considering how hard it is to make vertical distance as opposed to horizontal distance. The controls in the context of climbing or scaling things are either unresponsive or lead to unintended consequences.And to add to these occasional moments of frustration, the game boasts micro-sized gunfights and a few scripted fight sequences. These do a decent job of breaking the platforming, but they're frustrating in their own right. The gunplay feels very hollow and brings the speed and grace to a grinding halt. Normally you can run past your assailants, but a few times you will need to disarm them and slaughter every hostile in the area before you can continue. It feels incredibly shoehorned, half-baked, and I daresay it goes against the setting and the characters' nature. There are also two or three sequences where you need to fight or disarm someone as part of a cutscene, and these are not only frustrating, but they stop the game flow entirely.There's also the issue of the story. It's all over the place, and it rarely makes sense. She's something of a courier, but her higher-up has no qualm about her running around and trying to solve her own problems instead of actually doing her job. The game shuffles you around different areas and stories, hoping you won't realize it actually fleshes none of them out. The animated cutscenes are nice, but considering the game can be completed in an afternoon, there's nothing long-lasting about them. It's the kind of game that would benefit from a nicely-crafted story; unfortunately, you won't get that here.Despite all this, however, Mirror's Edge isn't a bad game. It shows hints of pure genius, and for the most part it's good. It's unique enough to stand out in almost every aspect, but the experience as a whole is kind of forgettable.			"

This game just brings loads of fun to the player but if your not a person who dosnt like running around and jumping i would prob give this a miss but if your into climbing gun shooting fast action wouldnt give this a second thought. Only problems i had with this is that it will sometimes not let me grab stuff that i want it to now (rarely).			"

												I enjoyed the time I had with Mirrors Edge. While it manages to pull of a beautifully fluent free running and combat system that tie greatly into the world, it does have its host of problems.The first thing I saw in Mirror's Edge was the controls. At first, I was hard on the idea that these controls sucked, and that they needed alot of tweaking. However, I learned quickly the game had a curve to it, and got passed the controls. When I finally got good at basic movements, I became absorbed in the world. The towering skyscrapers, colorful rooftops as well as the very dark secrets that were hid in this utopian masquerade. Cool right? Yes. However, it is really hard for me to appreciate the mythos of the game beyond its scenery, and beautiful scoring. This was because the story was god awful. Riddled with messy , sloppy, cheezy, and otherwise worthless dialouge, there was no way I was going to give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the sister to sister relationship in the story. And to put the icing on the cake, I was utterly displeased with the ending. You will know when you get there. Completely disregarding the story, the freerunning in the game was spectacular. With many ways to run on rooftops and build up momentum, I was very much envigorated when I pulled off the perfect string of moves. The blur on the sides of the screen when momentum building is a very amazing feeling. Then came the combat. For reasons I can not understand, people hated the combat in the game. And I agree and disagree at the same time. While pulling off ninja moves on a guard was fitting for the missons, the gunplay was stale. This could have easily been avoided by making weapons more sleek and getting rid of the heavy guns. It really brought me out of all the agility in the game when I lugging around a huge♥♥♥♥♥M249. So for Mirrors Edge 2, please keep the gunplay; but make it exciting! Make me feel like a badass when I finally get the gun out of the guards hands and run away from the firefight.There is also one other problem in the game, and that was the Runner's Vision. While artisticly this was cool, I felt as a game mechanic I did not like this. However, this really comes down to personal preference. I personally thought Runner's Vision held my hand throughout the game, highlighting where I should go next. Being chased from rooftop to rooftop by guards is not very fun when you know exactly where to go - I want to have to think fast to move to my objective! This mechanic can only be turned off on the hardest difficulty too, which is a shame. However, this is totally up to you on what you want out of Mirror's Edge. To conclude, Mirrors Edge is a great game. Free running is a wonderful time, and stringing together the perfect combo is simply rewarding as hell. The combat, while it can be vastly improved, is a good concept. And Runner's Vision is totally up to personal prefrence. The world is spectacular too, really putting a ""POW"" into the scenery with all its spectacular and vibrant color, while appropiatley contrasting the darkness that lies within the utopian universe. I really wish I could care more for the politics in this game, but the story is just too boring and dull for me to care! Characters are generic and unexciting, not to mention the cutscenes look like an All State commercial. But overall, this game is a gem, and the parkour is hands down the best I have ever been able to experience.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a gorgeous and unappreciated freerunning game. It has an art style that really struggles to be beaten for something that was made in the Unreal 3 Engine. This is probably due to the fact that DICE developed their own lighting system for the game. The vibrant colours and cleancut city really made the game stand out in an era of brown and grey ""realism"".The freerunning itself is often let down by clunky controls and ""that was crap, I pressed that"" moments, but if you get it right and can make the freerunning flow it really does make the game and you can get a lot out of the time trial missions.The gunplay is pretty much non-existant and I would highly recommend a no guns playthrough in order to really get the runner feeling.

												Do you like parkour?  Do you like dystopian societies?  Do you like unresponsive controls?  Hot-damn, this is for you!  The story is one that video games tend to not bother with, but that in itself allows it to give you a unique cast of characters who feel real in a world that feels all too realistic.  In the gameplay you run around and do stunts in an attempt to get to the next designated location.  The problem is that more times than not, you know exactly what you should be doing and you did the right inputs for it, but the game oftentimes arbitrarily decides that you die this time, and have to try again.  Still, pick this one up during a sale and play it through, it's worth it for the story.			"

												A parkour game mashed with first-person shooter elements. That is essentially what Mirror's Edge encompasses. Upon hearing about this game I was immediately excited and curious by the notion that it was different from many other 'first person shooters' I had previously played. The screenshots looked enticing and the trailer was amazing.Picking up during a Steam sale was perhaps one of the best purchases I have made on Steam.The game is exciting, fluid and dynamic. The mere feel of jumping over buildings in a huge, modern and visually striking city coupled with the stunningly real feeling of vertigo, is something unique to this game. The controls are excellent which give the feeling of power and strength that your character, Faith, encompasses. This along with the stunning graphics, which scaled remarkably well on mid-range hardware (i7 3630qm, GT 740m), being still able to run on 'highest' on full resolution; are just a couple of the reasons why this game is rather excellent. (I recommend turning off the crosshair and HUD. This increases the feeling of immersion)For all these good points however, there are some negatives. This game is not perfect. The story is rather short and forgettable, revolving around some sort of political conspiracy; and I felt the cartoon-like cutscenes clashed with the photorealistic nature of the rest of the game, pulling me out of the immersion. Several stages were also poorly designed which left me dying repeatedly until I managed to accomplish a semi-impossible feat (I'm looking at you last level). But this could have perhaps been due to my incompetence at the game itself...When taken as a whole however, Mirror's Edge is amazing, which leaves me eagerly anticipating its second instalment.			"

												Mirrors Edge, for a game made in 2008 it's graphics are outstanding. Released along titles like fallout 3, L4D2, and Dead Space this game has earned its rightfull spot among those titles. Though its cutscenes and dialogue may be a little lacking I think its story makes up for it. Game play may be difficult because the game wants you to remember what you learned in your traning in the first level and has no popup hints. Nor are there directions to tell you where to go. You have an objective and red doors to find, run fast faith.			"

												In this game, your objective is to run, climb, jump, etc to reach the end of the level. It's pretty much a parkour simulator with guns and combat sprinkled in here and there for a bit of variety.The combat system is alright, but I just wish it flowed better into and from the parkour because stopping to fight or disarm an enemy slows the game down a lot.The story isn't that good, but for your first playthrough I still reccommend watching the cutscenes just to understand whats going on in the game.The game is organised into chapters, all of which are fun and at no point in the game did I ever say ""Oh no, here comes THAT part"".This is one of the few first person games I've played where I actually feel like I'm controlling a real person, instead of a floating head who can shoot guns. This comes from the fact that movement is fluid and responsive, and if you look down you can actually see your character's body.The main character who you play as, Faith, is a woman, but doesn't come across as the ""STONG, INDEPENDENT, DON'T NEED NO MAN"" type. This is a good thing thing because I despise feminazis and SJWs.A lot of the problems with this game seem to be fixed with the sequel releasing next year, which I am eagerly awaiting because this is one of my favourite games I've ever played.Go buy it, it's dirt cheap.

												Mirror's Edge is a freerun shoot/punch game,pro's:-It runs smooth and feels like it is well optimised.-It looks fresh and the colors really pop out.-The freerun gameplay feels great.-Great replay value, in fact I would say the more times you play and the better you get at it, the more fun it becomes.-Falling to your death makes your face muscles active xD.-Great for speedrunning challanges-Most of the time it's clear which routes you can take and keeps the speed in sprinting and jumping aroundcons:-Combat is megh, against pistol cops the combat is kinda fun, but after mid game the enemies are just annoying to deal with, it takes the speed out of the game and hand to hand combat is just clumsy as balls.-Boss battle like things are awfull-Story doesn't grab me at all.. in fact I played through it 3 times before getting it on steam and I still only remember half of it.-Sometimes the game is quite unclear about where to go, and you're running around in the same room untill you get bored, grab a guide and go like: ""jebus could've made it a bit more obvious"".Conclusion:The pro's far outweigh the cons and if you like first person fast paced free run games then this is a must have.

												Very Good game!I love the graphics and the environmens. It's almost Portal-like.The controls can be a little hard at first, but you get used to them. Unfortunately the combat is very hard, and you don't always end up doing it the way you wanted it to be. Beyond that It's very easy to find the way around because of the red marking.I really enjoy this game and look forward to Mirrors edge 2.			"

												I honestly don't know where to begin, other than saying that this is a great game. And I truely mean it. With a compelling story, fascinating and yet unique gameplay, and georgeous level design, this game forms a true masterpiece.While the story certainly isn't  BioShock-level great (no, I'm not comparing this game to BioShock), it's not bad either. You play as a runner (the ""protagonists"" of the story), Faith, and save her sister after she's been accused of murder. Nothing to fancy. Unless you've complete the game, however, but I'm not going to spoil it. The story also is a bit short, I managed to complete it in 4 and a half hours, and that was on my first run through it. Story - 7/10The graphics some will say aren't the best, and I can see that. But I think that the game looks spectacular when running at the highest settings. Brilliant use of color, especially an uncommonly used color in games these days, white. The lighting helps too, however, it proved to be a bit annoying in some levels, but that's okay as you can turn the brightness down if you wish. The levels mainly consist of rooftops, and sometimes inside a building. However, you will also explore the inside of a storm drain, alleyways, and a harbor. I did think that it was a bit linear - at first it seems like pathways branch, and they do, but only in certain segments of a level. (Example, you're on a rooftop, and there is a gate. There are multiple ways to get around the gate, but once you do get around it, lies behind it a ramp you're to spring off of.)  Level deisgn/graphics - 8/10While the gameplay may look quirky in videos, and actually may seem quirky when learning them for the first time, believe me, they're not. You'll get used to them right away, and just like the game's purpose, you'll flow smoothly right through the stages. The game isn't that difficult, but some levels can be. You also can use guns, which was actually going to be a bigger element of gameplay in earlier versions, it really isn't that big. They work like normal guns, should - they shoot.  But honestly, they didn't feel needed, if it weren't for how many cops the game throws at you in certain levels. But like I said before, the game's intenion is to flow through the levels. They want the gameplay to become a natural thing. And I think they achieved that.Gameplay - 9/10Mirror's Edge is a wonderful, exhilerating action-platformer that requires some skill. While things may look different through a video, the game will suck you in and drop you into a whole new world of flow and colors. I think it is completely worth the $20 it charges, though if a sale is coming quite soon, I reccomend waiting as you won't be missing much. Final verdict - 8/10			"

												A beautiful game with a very distinct art style. While in the actual game you're in a 3D environment, the story parts are in 2D, in style reminiscent of a graphic novel.Gameplay can become quite frustrating at times, as timing is extremely important. You might find youself repeating the same part of the level literally dozens of times. After the first three levels though, you should probably understand how to solve most of the problems.The tutorial, while going very in-depth and showing you practically every move you might need in-game, feeds you all the information in one five-minute session. If you're not one of those people that remember every combination of keystrokes right away, you might find yourself in a pinch not knowing what to do when faced with certain obstacles (going from personal experience: by forgetting I had the ability to double tap space while wall running, I added probably one or two hours of gameplay and frustration to my first playthrough). But once you get the hang of the controls and figure out the different ways you can use your surroundings to move around, most of the levels become a breeze.While the story, in terms of development, is pretty predictable, there's a few aspects that make it (and the whole game) stand out. For one, the main character is a woman of Asian descent, who instead of being driven by some kind of romantic nonsense, is trying to save her sister. No one makes a deal about her being a woman, no one even acknowledges it. She's not special because of it. She's just another runner. And that is really great, in my opinion.In conclussion: after two hours of head-bashing against the keyboard trying to understand the controls, it quite quickly jumped to one of my top 10 games of all time. The recently announced Mirror's Edge 2 is definitely on my watch list.			"

												Even though this game caught my attention back in 2008, I didn't get the chance to play it until recently. I am glad I took the time to go back and try this, because it was definitely a great purchase. The story was certainly good, albeit a bit too short for my tastes, but what truly made this a good purchase was the unique ""puzzle"" aspect of the game. There were plenty of brain stumpers sprinkled throughout and gave it a good challenge so it wasn't too easy and rewarded the player with a sense of self-satisfaction when getting through a level. The fighting/gun mechanics could've been a lot better, but for what the game was made to center around; it definitely hit the nail on the head.The environment and music certainly immerses you in the experience and sets the tone for an exciting/fast-paced game that will keep you playing until the very end. I say if it's on sale, then it's worth picking up and trying for yourself.			"

												Loved the game. Parcouring is the central point of this game, you're free to get from one point to another however you like.Speed is the key, you're really looking through the eyes of the character and you get drawn in to the game like it's actually you running. Making quick left-right decisions, how do I get to that point, it's all set up brilliantly.Only point that's discussable for me is the length, the story's quite short, at the end it left me with the feeling of wanting more, playing more.On the other hand making it longer, extending the story might make it dull as the enemies remain generally the same, there's only so many locations to access... it's a thin line of being repetitive and keeping the player at the edge of his seat.

												One of the most unique games you'll ever  play, albeit not without it's rough edges. Mirror's Edge fuses platforming and parkour in a first-person perspective. You'll do lots of climbing and running, and with the exception of a few problem areas, it's very easy to control your character. The visual design is an eye-catching mix of real and abstract, with lots of sterile white and heavily-saturated colors that help you quickly make your way along rooftops and through interior sections.The sound design and music are excellent. Objects whizz by your ears and you feel every scrape, slide, and impact. The music is dynamic, changing based on whether or not you are being pursued or what you're doing.That said, Mirror's Edge suffers from its own design. The level design is near-perfect at some times, but in other times the layouts are so damn confusing. Autosaves are well-placed, but it tends to rub salt in the would, especially considering how hard it is to make vertical distance as opposed to horizontal distance. The controls in the context of climbing or scaling things are either unresponsive or lead to unintended consequences.And to add to these occasional moments of frustration, the game boasts micro-sized gunfights and a few scripted fight sequences. These do a decent job of breaking the platforming, but they're frustrating in their own right. The gunplay feels very hollow and brings the speed and grace to a grinding halt. Normally you can run past your assailants, but a few times you will need to disarm them and slaughter every hostile in the area before you can continue. It feels incredibly shoehorned, half-baked, and I daresay it goes against the setting and the characters' nature. There are also two or three sequences where you need to fight or disarm someone as part of a cutscene, and these are not only frustrating, but they stop the game flow entirely.There's also the issue of the story. It's all over the place, and it rarely makes sense. She's something of a courier, but her higher-up has no qualm about her running around and trying to solve her own problems instead of actually doing her job. The game shuffles you around different areas and stories, hoping you won't realize it actually fleshes none of them out. The animated cutscenes are nice, but considering the game can be completed in an afternoon, there's nothing long-lasting about them. It's the kind of game that would benefit from a nicely-crafted story; unfortunately, you won't get that here.Despite all this, however, Mirror's Edge isn't a bad game. It shows hints of pure genius, and for the most part it's good. It's unique enough to stand out in almost every aspect, but the experience as a whole is kind of forgettable.			"

												In Mirror's Edge, you can choose to either play aggressively or passively. The whole fun of the game (and the obvious core) is running around and doing parkour in possibly one of the most beautiful cities you could ever parkour in (and clean). For a game released in 2009, it's more than what you could ask for (visually/aesthetically talking). The clean, peaceful and safe feeling that the environment around you provides is simply amazing (which is funny seeing how sometimes you might be running for your life). Even though the overall game is visually stunning, some of the levels (again, visually speaking) will just keep you speechless (causing my deaths several times in several levels, but...""IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT.""The game itself, well. Some levels you will find incredibly frustrating and nearly impossible at times, but that's actually a good thing, or a pro about the game. The reason behind this is, because once you manage to accomplish the level, the satisfaction and the sense of accomplishment (and lets admit, cleverness) is beyond satisfying. Cons? Well, my top recommendation is to disable physx. That is basically the killer of the game. It can cause severe (and I mean SEVERE) frame issues and lag, even going as far as crashing your game. I'd also recommend avoiding confrontation when faced against many cops or snipers (oh how I despise those snipers).Oh and, you'll find out what I mean when I say that you should probably RUN FOR YOUR LIFE when you're being chased by your shadows (or runner's shadows, not quite a spoiler. As you probably don't have a clue of what I'm taking about).If you're having problems in deciding if the game is worth it or not, I guarantee it, if you love parkour and stunning visuals, go for it. I'd also recommend it so you get to know the origin of Mirror's Edge (as the second one will be coming out eventually).What are you waiting for, buy the game!			"

												This game feels ageless, depite being released in 2009 it feels suprisingly modern. Perhaps that's its art style, or perhaps it's because it is incredibly fun to play. Perhaps not recommended for those who get motion sick, Mirror's Edge is a first person freerunning game. While there is some combat (unfortunately), the main focus is getting from place to place without dying, huge jumps from building to building way above the city streets, running from enemies, jumping over anything and everything. 10/10 would run again, and again... and again.

Battlefield's nice and all; 2142 and the Bad Company series are fantastic, but most of the other ones are pretty boring and generic. This game is anything but. Definitely worth a play. There are some frustrating bits where the freerunning mechanics get in your way (that lousy part with the slick wet slidedown to that hole. The game looks like it expects you to jump over it, but that doesn't work.) All in all though its still pretty good.			"

												This game is amazing!This is the only game I've played that's all about parkour, and I love it.Amazing graphics, amazing gameplay.There's only a few things I don't like, including the fact that the combat system is a bit wonky. I wish the combat system was better, instead of just MOUSE1 spam, you would kick, dodge, light punch, hard punch, throw, et cetera. That would be awesome.The other thing I don't like is that you can't change video settings in-game, yet the option is there.PhysX is also enabled by default, which causes a lot of lag, but that's no major issue.I got this game while it was -78% off. I could not have gotten a better deal than that.Pros:+ Beautiful graphics! I love the simplistic art style.+ Fantastic parkour elements of gameplay!+ Good story.+ Amazing voice acting!Cons:- Wonky combat system.- PhysX is enabled by default.- No third person mode. (You can activate a glitchy third person mode by changing some fancy settings, but you can only look a certain way. It would be nice if they implemented a third person mode into the game which you could choose from - either first person or third person. Still, I love the first person, and I most likely would not use third person anyway, but it would have been nice. A toggle-able third person would've been nice at long jumps, et cetera.)- You cannot change video (graphics) settings while playing the game, which is weird.- Cutscenes share this weird comic book art style for some reason. I don't hate it, but I don't like it very much either.For a game from 2009, this game is overwhelmingly fantastic.I really wish they'd make a sequel.			"

												8/10: Mirror's Edge is a very cool game. I thought I'd better try it out since Mirror's Edge 2 will be coming out, and I'm sure glad I did. Mirror's Edge offers a really unique and entertaining form of gameplay with its free-running mechanics and a beautiful world with vibrant colors to enjoy them in. The story isn't amazing, but it works well with the gameplay. The gunplay/combat is pretty poor (though you can pull off a pretty sweet dropkick), and I wish you had the option of simply avoiding fighting altogether, so you could focus on the aspect of the game that really shines: its core mechanics. Running, jumping, and navigating the city feels extremely satisfying, and the game presents you with many exciting environments to test your parkour skills. The chase scenes in particular can be quite exhilarating. There are some moments of frustration and minor annoying details, but overall the free-running system is done very well. There is also definitely some good replay value as there are time trials, and the main story could easily be enjoyed for multiple playthroughs. I will definitely be looking forward to the sequel.

												Mirror's Edge is a properly done 3d Sonic in disguise.If you are stopping to fight enemies, you did something wrong. In fact, if you are slowing down at all, you did something wrong.Much like in Sonic, speed is earned in Mirror's Edge. It's the reward for doing well. Are the levels linear? Yes. Does that make them bad? No. Does that make it so that there are no options? Heck no. If you play time trial mode, you'll quickly discover that you did the levels in the story mode all wrong- you were taking the wrong paths, timing your jumps badly, or otherwise screwing up.The occasional platforming puzzle can sometimes be frustrating, but if you're looking for a game about dodging gunfire as you wallrun, power-slide, vault, and just flat-out RUN, you've found the right title.Now hurry up with the damn sequel, DICE.

												Mirror's Edge is an extremely enjoyable game that provides great freedom to the player in regards to speed.This game is a first person game where you are able to run as fast as you can to get to point A to point B. And it does not disappoint in doing so. You can climb over many obstacles, gaining momentum as you zip through your mission. Speed matters in this game, and Mirror's Edge does a good job at bringing parkouring to life. You can jump to buildings, climb on pipes, wall run across billboards, and sprint your way to the goal. There is so much you can do in regards to running and the adrenaline you get from it is amazing. There are not a lot of games out there that solely focus on freerunning (InMomentum and the Assassin's Creed series only come to mind to me) but this game harbors a great experience. The story is neat, and you can enjoy some time trials to beat your old times or top others. There are some puzzles in the game that you have to go through, but it's what makes the runner experience just as fun.There are some issues that I would like to point out. The story is short. I was disappointed when the game had ended to early, and would like it if they added more to the mix. The combat system could have been improved as well. In some instances in the game you would resort to killing your enemies via gun or hand-to-hand combat. The gun mechanics are okay but lack the ability to aim down the sight (but that shouldn't matter since this isn't an first person shooter). The close quarters combat is really clunky with only one animation to combo some punches and a kick to knock your enemy down. Fighting in this game wasn't really satisfying, but it didn't ruin the experience for me. I had more fun sprinting freely through obstacles than punching guys who sometimes are not worth fighting.I hightly recommend this to those who love freerunning and a fast paced adventure game. Mirror's Edge brings up a nice take to a type of game that has not been touched upon in a while.			"

												Possibly my favourite game of its generation. It may not be overly complex, it may not have an amazing story, It may be linear. But my goodness is it immersive. The animations, the art style, the platforming style gameplay all blew me away. It's great when dev actually try and make something different and this game is testament to that. I'm sure you can pick this game up for no more than a few pounds now so if you missed this gem initially, give it a shot. It still looks and plays wonderfully.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a smallish morsel of amazing. Beautiful, fast-paced, exciting, and fun. The first thing you'll notice besides the lovely intro track is that this is primarily a puzzle parkour game with a little combat sprinkled in. The second is that the screenshots fail to represent just how gorgeous the game looks in motion. It has a near perfect first person movement model.The lowest point is the predictibility of the story, but it's so well executed that you can forgive the cliches. There is an average of 6 hours of main storyline game time, so you may want to pick it up for $15 or less although there are speed runs and trials to help compensate. The parkour is more fun and dynamic than any assassin's creed and even if the levels are very linear there are multiple ways to engage each combat situation or puzzle.Note: If you have vertigo or experience motion sickness, you definitely want to watch some videos full screen to make sure you will be able to enjoy the game without severe side-effects.

												First person running game. The world is cool and the way they use white with whatever other color in buildings really stands out. The combat involves countering a guy with a gun and then shooting everyone else with said gun for the most part. The hint system that points you in the direction of the next way point is not that helpful. Moving through vents and swinging on pipes is slow. The cops that chase you are the least of your worries cause you fall and die a lot trying to jump on pipes but the checkpoints load quick so it is not too bad. The gun play is not good. Summary: Running on rooftops is fun but the other stuff not so much. A good 4hr game to knockout out in one day and it is cheap.      4/5 stars "

												This game is like no other. A completely untapped genre that came and went in the blink of an eye. This game, is one of the most visually appealing games I have ever played. Running over high rises never felt easier, or cooler for that matter. Seamlessly jumping from rooftop to rooftop as fast as you can. Totally amazing.If you have not played this game, or have only played a bit of it, I implore you. Buy this game and play it. You will NOT be disapointed. This is the only game I have played that has guns, and yet they seem so worthless given what you can do already. Very exciting. Never a dull moment in this game.			"

												Oh my god. I love this game and I hate it. The structure is sections of really, really satisfying first-person parkour broken up by awful sections where you'll die to a bunch of dudes with guns over and over. I don't know if I've ever played a game with such a huge gap between my best and worst experiences: at its best, its levels are designed like puzzles you need to solve with the handful of techniques you're taught (for better or worse) at the start of the game. At its worst, you're thrown into a big room with a bunch of boxes and heavily-armed guys, and given no sense of where to go or whether to fight. (Pressing the Alt key is supposed to direct your view toward your goal, but that's not always the case.)The joy of running, the visual design, and the world-building are all good enough, in my opinion, to still make this a game worth playing. I just wish I could give an unqualified recommendation.			"

Time for Parkour!This is a good parkour game that has a lot of action and an interesting enough story to make you want to keep playing. The controls take a little bit to get used to however the tutorial is adequate enough so that you have a decent feel for the game before you make the leap to fighting enemies at the same time. With that being said the combat is challenging at times and doesnt feel clunky, and the techno music the accompanies the game is fitting. However it should be mentioned that the game is fairly short for a single-player game, with the main story being approximately 6 hours long. Although it is short, this game is very cheap to buy on the steam sales and other sites, so it is definitely going to be worth the money shoudl you buy it at a discounted price :)			"

												I've heard about ME years ago. After finishing the whole story line, I have to say that this is quite a great game, in my own opinion.As a parkour game, ME is totally focused on the element of PARKOURing. Unlike Assassin's Creed, which has a far longer story line, ME is totally about parkouring. The heroine, also known as Faith, runs around on the roofs and inside buildings in order to rescue her sister. Although the story line seems a little short for me, it is still a good game to play.

												Mirror's Edge. Painfully tedious at times, too heavily reliant on guns, unimpressive combat.And yet, the best parkour game out there, probably. (Until ME: Catalyst comes out.)Worth buying if you like these kinds of games.Parkour was not a theme commonly used in games until recently. So when Mirror's Edge came out no doubt people would have been excited. And as a person that enjoys Titanfall, I think it's got the best first-person mobility on the market. (ME, not Titanfall, great game though it is.)But the fluidity came at a cost. I can't help but feel DICE tried too hard to make it part-FPS. The combat breaks the smooth free feel of the game, unless you just run away. They're fixing this in Catalyst, making the combat more parkour-based, which is only good news. So, that's another box ticked for fans of the game.One of ME's best qualities was that, in theory, most chapters could be beaten in one fluid run, without stopping. And it does a good job of replicating the adrenaline-filled leaps of faith that comes with rooftop running.And you can't help but admire the art style of the city. It's a beautiful landscape of white and red that can hardly be put into words. It has to be experienced.Except that you're kind of trapped in small areas in the levels. But, again, DICE is adressing this and giving Catalyst the open world that the original desperately needed.To summmarise:Good parkourBad mostly everything else, but that doesn't matterEasy on the eyes - very easyNeeds open world and better fighting (both happening, thanks DICE)Buy this if you can't be bothered to climb a building and jump off roofs yourself.I would have made this review humourous, but I just couldn't think of any jokes. Sorry, folks.			"

Gameplay does get soemwhat repetitive and at least to me at some parts it seemed really difficult to get by enemies without picking up their gun and shooting them. Which isn't what this game is about in essence.The parkour elements are really satisfying. Animations look great, and just look at that city. Absolutely beautiful.

												Mirror's Edge is a fantastically presented mediocre game.While its visual style, music, and atmosphere are top-notch, its core gameplay is, in my opinion, slightly lacking. While the game shines in its free-running segments, pretty much every part of the game where you're being shot at feels like a chore. And these segments are unfortunately numerous.The main theme of the game is free-running, and the first advice you're given about combat is ""avoid the enemy"". Naturally, the best option in a game like this, where your character, Faith, is extremely agile and quick, is to run from the enemy, evade them, or sneak by them. However, stealth is impossible; enemies will simply detect you no matter how much care you take to sneak quietly. Additionally, there are many forced combat segments: the game tells you to avoid the enemy, then places you in situations where you are unable to do so. This wouldn't be a problem if the combat were enjoyable, but unfortunately, I did not enjoy it.The main flaw with the combat is the lack of a learning curve. On Normal mode, enemies can shoot you dead in two or three hits. This means that there is no time for Faith to practice her moves; if she messes up at all, which is inevitable when practicing, she's dead, and you have to start the whole sequence over again. Reaction time does little to remedy this. These segments really throw a wrench in the otherwise smooth action of Mirror's Edge.As I said, the game is very smooth, and its free-running segments, where your only enemy is a steep drop off a roof, are stellar. It feels very rewarding to get the hang of the controls and totally ace a segment without falling or losing momentum. Unfortunately, these segments are mostly used as links between the combat segments in the later game. I feel as though Dice, a developer probably best known for its shooters, felt they needed to incorporate shooter elements here in abundance. But the game would be much better off if it revolved more around the parkour elements, with combat being optional.Enough about the combat, let's talk about the better parts of this game: The design is fantastic. The use of strong color and good use of visual filters makes this game look like a work of art. The cartoon cutscenes between chapters are great, if slightly low-budget feeling (many frames are noticably re-used). The music is great, and helps the peaceful sections feel peaceful and the dangerous sections feel tense. The characters, while not explored terribly much, still play their parts well, and putting yourself in Faith's shoes is not hard. The unlockables are a nice touch as well.Despite its flaws, this game is still solid. But now that I've experienced it first-hand, I wouldn't say it's as great as many people say it is. When I find myself admiring the aesthetics and theme of a game more than its actual gameplay, it's hard for me to recommend it to others. However, if you can get this game on sale, I would recommend you play through it simply for the experience. It's presented very well, and it's a shame it didn't have more dev time (there are some cut things in the unlockables), and it's also a shame that it was so short. Hopefully the sequel can improve on this game's flaws, but as it stands, I'd only recommend it at a reduced price.Good Points:- Stunning visual design, amazing aesthetics- Good free-running segments, Runner Vision is an intuitive system- Good music that bolsters the atmosphere- Engaging charactersFlaws:- Forced combat segments feel out-of-place- Lack of learning curve, no real way to practice combat- Too little free-running for a game that's supposed to revolve around it, compared to gunplay and combat- Pretty short, no expansions or extra story content - Stealth is impossible, enemy AI is telepathicBottom Line: It's a great work of art, but only a passable game. Recommended, but only if it's on sale.			"

												Do you like parkour?  Do you like dystopian societies?  Do you like unresponsive controls?  Hot-damn, this is for you!  The story is one that video games tend to not bother with, but that in itself allows it to give you a unique cast of characters who feel real in a world that feels all too realistic.  In the gameplay you run around and do stunts in an attempt to get to the next designated location.  The problem is that more times than not, you know exactly what you should be doing and you did the right inputs for it, but the game oftentimes arbitrarily decides that you die this time, and have to try again.  Still, pick this one up during a sale and play it through, it's worth it for the story.			"

												Set into a not-so-distant future, in which cybernetic communications are frivoulous, Mirror's Edge tells the story of a runner, whose job is to deliver packages and information to whoever is willing to pay, and her sister: a cop who works for the system. In a period in which almost all games have become shooters, ME makes a difference through its new way of handling enemies. Once you go Mirror's Edge, you can't go back!			"

												I've played this game ritualistically every Christmas Eve since the day I got it, I'll start a new game and just... Run.Why? I couldn't tell you. I love this game, I could play through 10 times over in quick succession and still enjoy every minute of it. The freerunning is smooth, and the controls are simple yet refined. I decided to buy this game on PC, having only recently become a member of the PCMR in the last 2 years, but I did have this on my Xbox 360 since release. I will say that not having to deal with the annoying loading screens that would pop up WHILE you're running on the console version is extremely refreshing, it doesn't kill the pacing of the game like it once did.With the sequel (prequel? reboot?) fast approaching and having already pre-ordered it (something I am blatantly against, but it's MIRROR'S EDGE), wetting my feet and joining faith on her free running parkrusade once again has been incredibly fun.The game still holds up, and is still a blast, it's super relaxing just going, running, jumping, sliding, the flow of it.

												This game is like going on a roller coaster. It has a lot of great moments with a few dull turns here and there. Great gameplay and movement with nice sleek visuals that hold up to this day. Good voice acting, awesome level design that makes full use of your abilities and a nice dificulty curve that goes up each chapter.On the downside the story is predictable, lacks focus and the boss fights are underwhelming. The style of the game is great. What's not so great is the dull AI and poor weapon controlls that make you feel like you're trying to juggle cats while they're focused with using you as their scratch post.While this is a short defo I highly recommend getting it on a discount especially if you're a fan of platformers. The 1st person perspective changes jumping and the level design puts your mind and skill to the test. While it's not very hard it will give you a nice feeling of accomplishment when you find your way out of a tricky puzzle room.			"

												Fun 1st person parkour themed game thats unlike any game I have played before.  From time to time you may find use for a gun, but most of the time you are trying to avoid enemies and get to one place to another as safely and quickly as possible.  The soundtrack is fairly upbeat.  As for the storyline its ok, everything moves along rather fast.  Occasionally you may get a little frustrated trying to find the way out of area and die more than you would like, but overall the game isn't that hard.			"

Product received for free
												I got this game through family sharing. So, I didn't pay for it, but it wasn't given to me by EA or anything. It was still paid for, just not by me.First off, I've wanted to play this for years, but couldn't. Either the splash screen showed up and went away and that was it, or it just plain didn't do anything except start the process for a bit. The solution? Move one file up a folder. (It's got its own folder within the folder it should be in, and it won't work with the way it's set up when you install it. Don't know how whatever update did that got sent out, or why it's not fixed. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MOVE ONE FILE UP A FOLDER, EA.)Then I had to shut off PhysX because it's apparently an old version that don't work so good or something, and I would get major FPS drops when glass shattered. That means glass breaking doesn't look as nice, but it's better than playing a slideshow of still images.Now, to the actual game after fixing all problems. Was super excited. Its story is okay, and supposedly Catalyst is better when it comes to story, but I haven't played it yet. It's just kind of ""Here's a reason to go to this place. WOOP, HERE ARE THE COPS, BETTER RUN!"" It's sorta interesting, but definitely follows that pattern most of the time. The gameplay is good and I honestly think those who say combat ""breaks the flow"" should be quiet. You can jump, kick them in the face, and go past while they're stunned, or you can have a good time stealing people's weapons and clearing the room to make your escape. It's a grab-a-gun-shoot-gun-throw-gun-away sort of thing. Sort of like SUPERHOT; the enemies have infinite ammo, but you have a limited amount and a basic cop's gun isn't going to take down an entire room full of heavily-armed and well-armored private guards. I think combat was relatively well-executed for a game not focused on it and fits well. My only problem is that the guards that chase you and are really difficult to fight are hard to fight partially because it seems like when you both do the same thing, their attacks take priority and only you take damage when you both should. I know, they're supposed to be the near-unstoppable force that you need a gun or serious skill to defeat, but I feel like they're a little broken in just how unbeatable they are. It's like two people punching eachother in the chest and only one getting hurt because the other's the stronger of the two. They only show up in like, three places in the game (though in two there's no guns around to shoot them with) so they're no big deal. At first, I thought combat was simple. Grab dude's gun, shoot his buddies, move on, but there's a suprising number of weapons, four or five.Now, to actually talk about the freerunning. It's great. It's the kind of system I wish every game had. It feels almost exactly like it should, except the three times out of a hundred that you jump sideways, or wallrun vertically instead of horizontally (or vice versa). That and the fact that you seem to not stretch your arms out all the way to grab stuff sometimes are my only problems. The bar is right there, Faith. Just grab the bar. Just reach out, and grab the bar. Nope, okay, go plummeting to the ground and lose track of the person you're chasing. That's fine too. Oh, I have to wallrun up and bounce off the wall. Didn't know that got you higher than just jumping. (This was like halfway through the game that I learned this.) Thanks for reading to this point, by the way. I know I talk a lot. Anyways, it just feels great just because you go fast and it's the smoothest movement system I've seen, really. Works really well.It's a pretty game. It even makes ventilation ducts look nice, at least in the final area. The gold lighting is great. The game mostly follows a white-and-bright-color scheme, say, white and orange or white and green. Most interactable things are red, and the secrets are bright, glowing orange, obviously visible once you get to where they are, which I didn't always. There's always an indicator that there's one about, though, if you care to look. I'm pretty sure that the colors were thought about to some extent for almost every area. Nothing looks plain, not even the white rooftops. There's always a splash of color visible somewhere, it seems.I loved this game and wish there was more. I hope Catalyst is longer, because I'm probably going to buy it at some point.			"

												I orignially played this game a couple of years ago on a friends Xbox and it was really frustrating because of my awful controller skills. Then I got it a couple of years back and it was just standing in my library. In the last couple of days I realised that I haven't really played a full game in a long time so I installed and started my runner journey. The tutorial was basic stuff and I really liked the mechanics and combos you can do with the walls and jumping on enemies. It felt great, the different routes you could do was quite fun, because the game didn't feel linear. Still it should've been more open, with side quests, different factions, discovering the city, helping other people or something like that, only that was lacking. But again the game was quite fun. Picking up guns was not my style, I only used the guns when there were a lot of enemies. The A.I. was quite good, it actually made me think twice before jumping on more of them, because they kill me fast. Hell, it has better A.I. then most games today. I had problems in some areas because when you jump on the red ledge it does not always work, but maybe it's just me. A couple of times I got stuck in the wall, or got slowed by an invisible bump. The enemies glich and start going bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy when I kick them in the ground, but that happened about 3 times in the whole game. It's quite a fast game, if you don't make any mistakes you can finish it in about 4 hours, but if you are like me it takes a bit more. Sometimes I thought I needed to backtrack when I get away from enemies and die, until I realise I just have to go forward. The story was pretty good, but it wasn't all that clear. I felt like it needed more explanation (Yeah, I know I can go on the Wiki and find everything I need to know, but that's not the point). The animations were not that bad, but not that good either. They were a bit messy, if more effort was put into them, the cutscenes would've been so much better.Do I recommend it? Absolutely, if you like the parkour type games, you will enjoy it a lot. How would I rate it? 9/10, it's great, but some things are still missing, I pointed it all out.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a gorgeous and unappreciated freerunning game. It has an art style that really struggles to be beaten for something that was made in the Unreal 3 Engine. This is probably due to the fact that DICE developed their own lighting system for the game. The vibrant colours and cleancut city really made the game stand out in an era of brown and grey ""realism"".The freerunning itself is often let down by clunky controls and ""that was crap, I pressed that"" moments, but if you get it right and can make the freerunning flow it really does make the game and you can get a lot out of the time trial missions.The gunplay is pretty much non-existant and I would highly recommend a no guns playthrough in order to really get the runner feeling.

I got it mainly because I was excited to see a game with just parkour and freerunning instead of weapons (although you can occasionally still use weapons) like usual games these days are. I was completely satisfied when I started playing it. Graphics could be a bit better, but the gameplay and plot totally makes up for it.			"

												Mirror's Edge was released in 2007 as one of the first Frostbite Engine games, as a proof-of-concept of sorts. You play as Faith, a runner (messenger) in a futuristic city that can't seem to decide whether it's in America or Asia, with signs displaying both English words and characters. The color scheme is amazing, and the way lighting and textures are handled, I probably would've guessed it was released in 2010 or 2011 based on how good it looks. Faith gets through the city using parkour moves, with the game focusing more on acrobatics than combat mechanics. Running, jumping, sliding, and the other moves feel fluid and not at all nausea-inducing, but fighting is reduced to mashing buttons and hoping you don't die. There are only 3 types of guns, which you pick up off police officers and drop when ammo is gone, but gunplay is minimal in the game. This is encouraged by not being able to do any sort of parkour while holding a gun. I found myself only using Runner Vision (slow-mo) when I really needed to, though mostly just to make long jumps look really cool. I did also find myself accidentally triggering it fairly often. Bugs are rare, having encountered only 2 or 3 in the many times I've played it.TL;DR - Looks great, but you need a higher-end GPU. Parkour is great, combat not so much. Overall fun, and more should be expected from 2015 (?) sequel. More should be revealed E3 2014.			"

												There are two mechanics of this game that are implemented with varying amounts of success.First: the parkour. This is the thing this game was made for. Faith runs like a dream, and there's nothing more satisfying than flying across rooftops and making those jumps that would probably break a normal person's legs. When this game is going fast, it's great.Second: the combat. Where do I even start with this? First of all, the game encourages you to avoid combat as often as possible. After all, you're playing a fragile speedster, so when it comes to fight or flight, flight is the better option. That being said, the game often doesnt LET you avoid combat. There'll be too many people shooting at you, and even with all your running and ducking and dodging chances are you'll be gunned down in seconds. And again, you're a fragile speedster, emphasis on the fragile part. You can't take very many hits. So when running isn't an option (even though the game will remind you that you SHOULDN'T be fighting), the only other choice you have is to fight. So what's the problem with fighting? Try: most everything. The timing for disarming someone is absurdly anal (and chances are while you're doing that someone else will be shooting you in the back), the timing for striking is anal (most often they'll just block and you'll be knocked back instead), and the controls for attacking someone while moving are awkward. If you engage in hand to hand, expect to have to repeat a segment over, and over, and over.In other words, every time combat happens, the game comes to a grinding halt. The point of the game is to be going fast and getting from place to place quickly and adeptly, but this becomes impossible when you have to slow down to fight 10 heavily armed guards that just rushed you and cut off the only escape route that doesn't end with a sickening *splat* sound. Combat completely throws off the pacing. The game tries to make the combat faster paced by causing the action to start the moment you enter a room, but this leaves no window of time for you to adjust to the surroundings. I get that part of the game is being able to react and choose routes quickly and everything, but there's only so fast a human can react before they get shot.(And I'll add here that you could just grab a gun and use that, but there's this little notice on the pause menu that tracks if you've shot anyone yet, and though I haven't finished the game yet, I can figure it'll be important. If this doesn't bother you, go for it. The game's great.)For all my complaining, though, I really do like this game and would recommend it, or at least the parkour parts. The combat system is poorly managed (and IMO doesn't belong in this type of game), but it isn't impossible, just incredibly frustrating. My grievances with the combat system are meant to be more of a forewarning than a dissuasion. Mechanics aside, the story, art, and voicing are fantastic, so design in that sense is solid.TL:DR; play it, it's great, but either brace yourself for grueling combat sequences or stuff your morality and use a gun.

												Really good game, pretty short but that just helps it to not get old.Mind blowing textures (not so much models, but hey, those textures are amazing) on walls, pipes, and pretty much everything.Really good fast-paced 3D platforming with a good use of enviromental movement.The biggest flaw of the game is how it suddenly focuses in combat near the end of the game and the combat isn't particularly great, even worse, this combat sections aren't even optional, you are forced to fight many soldiers while the whole main focus of the game was running away.There's a story but it isn't anything spectacular or mind blowing, not even surprising at all in my opinion, it's just there for the sake of making the aesthetics of the game stand out even more, which is ok but there's more that could've done to it.Overall a good and pretty unique experience, if they ever make a sequel to this game lets hope they ditch the combat entirely and it'll be even better.

												 If you are tired of the usual genres and gameplay styles and want something new give this a go.  Yes, parkour is sooooo 2005, but it's really well done here: it's fast, fluid, and fun with just the right balance in player control required to keep the game from turning into ether a cumbersome and overcomplicated mess or an over simplified and tedious push-a-button-and-mindlessly-jump-from-roof-to-roof ""Assassain's Creed"" type experience.  The storyline isn't all that great (although it's kind of refreshing in its ""run from the bad guys!"" simplicity), but the graphics are still awesome 4 years later and the art design has a nice ""Run Lola Run"" meets ""Blade Runner"" aesthetic to it.    The game can get a bit too ""trial and error"" at times, but it's so short (I completed the entire thing in 4 hours my first time through) and it looks and plays so well that it really doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's the perfect game to get on sale for 5 dollars and waste an evening or so with.			"

												Positives:-Gorgeous visuals, with colorful aesthetics, that escape from the boring greys and darks from typical urban environments in videogames.-Well implemented Parkour gameplay (the core aspect of the game), with decent physics and a nice flow of momevement and momentum. A breath of fresh air, on a market where all first person games are shooters by default.-Great soundtrack, that fits the visuals of each level (even for those who dont usually appreciate the subgenre of ambient music, like me).-Faith, the protagonist and best character in the game.Negatives:-The combat gameplay, felt a bit clunky and forced, i always preferred to run away form enemies.-The shooting gameplay is not very good, but it wasnt supposed to be anyway, with the option of not using firearms in all scenarios, and discarding the guns when done with them (this is a positive!).-The story and most secondary characters are, if not bad, at least, unremarkable, and the ending is too rushed (hopefully the sequel will provide more answers and some sense of achievement).Overall:Great, innovative game with fun, fluid (not so much on my crap PC) gameplay, with a short story but with a good amount of extra challenges, that add up to a nice length of entertainment. May Mirrors Edge 2 come quickly, and even better!			"

												This game is a great example of a game where the controls/options/mechanics don't have to be super in depth for it to be extremely enjoyable.  Once you get down movement of the game (which can take a while), speeding through areas, flying over sky scrapers, and dodging police can give you an adrenaline rush at some times.  Movement is nice and fluid, and the soundtrack is amazing.  It's not that expensive of a game either, so I'd say it is definitely worth picking up.  Took me about 9 hours to finish, but that included a lot of retrying areas.			"

I sometimes struggle grabbing onto pipes and can take as many as 30 tries to grab a basic pipe (many others have had this problem and apparently using a controller fixes this) the Art direction in this game is brilliant and where as the story is nothing to write home about in my opinion, the fast paced gameplay more than makes up for it.

The emphasis is on the parkour type movement rather than shooting, and you only get a gun for a minute at a time as you snatch one from a guard or officer, throwing it away in order to be mobile again.

												It kinda pains me how underestimated this game is. It's truly remarkable game with intense gameplay - the freedom of movement it gives you, the speed of your running, jumping, flying... sometimes you can really  feel just like a wind.The graphics are maybe a bit unusual, but somehow beautiful and optimistic in otherwise grey and pesimistic world. Storyline is no Deus Ex, but still - it's above average.And the soundtrack - especially with the title ""Still alive"" song - is just beautiful and fits into the game perfectly.Overall I dare to say it's one of the games that I've enjoyed playing the most and left me with really nice feeling in the end. And from time to time I jut have to play it through once again - which is truly unusual for me.For the price it's being offered here on Steam, it's just a steal.			"

												Amazing game. The world feels very vast and open on the rooftops and the first person freerunning is very smooth. The mechanic of building up momentum is very well integrated into gameplay. I also liked the shift away from shooting and combat, relying more on evasion to get past enemies, as facing them head on is pretty much suicidal. If I had one complaint it's that navigating can be a little bit confusing at times because it's not always clear where you need to go. Otherwise, this game is stunning in it's world design and gameplay.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a gorgeous and unappreciated freerunning game. It has an art style that really struggles to be beaten for something that was made in the Unreal 3 Engine. This is probably due to the fact that DICE developed their own lighting system for the game. The vibrant colours and cleancut city really made the game stand out in an era of brown and grey ""realism"".The freerunning itself is often let down by clunky controls and ""that was crap, I pressed that"" moments, but if you get it right and can make the freerunning flow it really does make the game and you can get a lot out of the time trial missions.The gunplay is pretty much non-existant and I would highly recommend a no guns playthrough in order to really get the runner feeling.

												A race for time, or a waste of time?Mirror's Edge takes something that many of us wish we were fit enough to do, and makes it into a core gameplay mechanic for anyone to enjoy. Is it fun? Yes! Absolutely! But it's not as groundbreaking as some hoped it would be (someone like me :P).It's a good game with some designer flaws, none of which, however, deter from the experience. Allow me to elaborate.In this game you play as a runner named Faith (how quaint) who runs into a, well, let's call it a ""political disagreement"" with the local PD, giving her (and you) an excuse jump off walls, off buildings, off TRAINS! Basically there is a lot of stuff to jump off of. And on, as well, as you are given the ability to beat the crap out of your enemies using said running and jumping abilities. This is very a smooth combat system, and very entertaining to do, as using your momentum to drive your punches and kicks like a projectile leaves you with an awesome feeling. The game seems to suffer from some kind of split personality disorder, though, as it can't tell if it wants to be a freerunning racing game, or another stylish EA shooter (meh). There are several points in the game where the only way to progress is to pick up a gun and blast/snipe your way through. Luckily there are only a few parts like these. The game markets itself as something unique and different that the current FPS generation would enjoy, however if you ignore running aspect and focus on what else the game is offering you basically have a linear campaign with several elements taken from games such as Half-Life 1+2 and portal, such as having to analyze your surroundings and cleverly use them to your advantage (another would be crawling through the air vents). This doesn't necessarily make this a bad game, just don't expect it to be ground breaking. I thought I was going to have an experience similar to Prince of Persia, but really it was far from it. It's a game of speed and momentum, where you are trying to get from point A to point B in the smoothest and quickest way possible, whereas Prince is about using special climbing techniques to solve puzzles that take up entire rooms.The graphics are great, and the massive city truely looks amazing. The Unreal 3 engine really shines in this game. I just wish we could actually go into the city and explore it more. Instead you are guided through a linear path, probably because that way it could tell the story, however unrelatable it was. It's clear that they worked hard on the story, but it's just so convoluted that I found myself paying less and less attention to it as I went along. The gameplay keeps you more engaged than the story, which is ok.I personally liked it, and found myself coming back to the time trials to kill some time. Without a doubt this game had much more potential, and with the fact that they had to revise the story several times, it kinda shows. But for a new IP with an experimental play style it seemed to present itself quite well. I would recommend this game to people who want to kill a weekend with some high velocity scissor kicks and clever outside-the-box speed run levels.			"

												I enjoyed the time I had with Mirrors Edge. While it manages to pull of a beautifully fluent free running and combat system that tie greatly into the world, it does have its host of problems.The first thing I saw in Mirror's Edge was the controls. At first, I was hard on the idea that these controls sucked, and that they needed alot of tweaking. However, I learned quickly the game had a curve to it, and got passed the controls. When I finally got good at basic movements, I became absorbed in the world. The towering skyscrapers, colorful rooftops as well as the very dark secrets that were hid in this utopian masquerade. Cool right? Yes. However, it is really hard for me to appreciate the mythos of the game beyond its scenery, and beautiful scoring. This was because the story was god awful. Riddled with messy , sloppy, cheezy, and otherwise worthless dialouge, there was no way I was going to give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the sister to sister relationship in the story. And to put the icing on the cake, I was utterly displeased with the ending. You will know when you get there. Completely disregarding the story, the freerunning in the game was spectacular. With many ways to run on rooftops and build up momentum, I was very much envigorated when I pulled off the perfect string of moves. The blur on the sides of the screen when momentum building is a very amazing feeling. Then came the combat. For reasons I can not understand, people hated the combat in the game. And I agree and disagree at the same time. While pulling off ninja moves on a guard was fitting for the missons, the gunplay was stale. This could have easily been avoided by making weapons more sleek and getting rid of the heavy guns. It really brought me out of all the agility in the game when I lugging around a huge♥♥♥♥♥M249. So for Mirrors Edge 2, please keep the gunplay; but make it exciting! Make me feel like a badass when I finally get the gun out of the guards hands and run away from the firefight.There is also one other problem in the game, and that was the Runner's Vision. While artisticly this was cool, I felt as a game mechanic I did not like this. However, this really comes down to personal preference. I personally thought Runner's Vision held my hand throughout the game, highlighting where I should go next. Being chased from rooftop to rooftop by guards is not very fun when you know exactly where to go - I want to have to think fast to move to my objective! This mechanic can only be turned off on the hardest difficulty too, which is a shame. However, this is totally up to you on what you want out of Mirror's Edge. To conclude, Mirrors Edge is a great game. Free running is a wonderful time, and stringing together the perfect combo is simply rewarding as hell. The combat, while it can be vastly improved, is a good concept. And Runner's Vision is totally up to personal prefrence. The world is spectacular too, really putting a ""POW"" into the scenery with all its spectacular and vibrant color, while appropiatley contrasting the darkness that lies within the utopian universe. I really wish I could care more for the politics in this game, but the story is just too boring and dull for me to care! Characters are generic and unexciting, not to mention the cutscenes look like an All State commercial. But overall, this game is a gem, and the parkour is hands down the best I have ever been able to experience.			"

												Mirror's Edge has done something not many games do. It combined visuals and gameplay into such a unique experience that you cannot find in much games. Mirror's Edge takes the term 'parkour' to such an extreme level. You're literally traveling from building to building. With your FEET. The only other game I can think of that takes free-running to such an extent would be Assassin's Creed, only first-person and modern. The visuals, thankfully made with the Frostbite engine, are spectacular. Especially if you have the right PC setup. The style is amazing, with the mostly white metropolis brightly lighting up objectives and significant building with color-schemes for every level. Not only are you running from enemies, but you have to fight them too. In most situations, you choose between fight or flight. Stealth is an option, but a hard one. After taking out an enemy, you can pick up their weapon and use it against your enemies. The thing is, there is no ammo count; you only use the ammo in the clip and discard the gun. This enthuses players to go the traditional parkour gameplay of the game. The game is not that long, since I beat it in a short 4-hour session. But it has decent replayability, being encouraged to try to beat your time throughout the levels. The story... is pretty dull. I won't talk about the story, but it's a bit cliche. For the price, I think this game is definitely worth buying, with its original gameplay and concepts that you can't really get anywhere else.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a fun, fast paced first person parkour game where you get to play as Faith, a runner(someone who act as a courier to transmit messages while evading government surveillance) as she escapes countless encounters with the government hunting her down. It's a game where you have to parkour over objects and obstacles to reach your point of destination, occasionally fighting enemies with melee and firearms. I personally feel like the game would have been better without the shooting parts. It kind of interferes with the pace of the game imo. The graphics are beautiful, they still look good. Overall, it's a great game for anyone who wants to experience a first person parkour game.Sound: 7.5/10 pretty goodGraphics: 8/10 good for their time, still looks good todayGameplay: 9/10 It's innovative and good for what it does.Characters: 5/10 nothing really interesting about themStory: 5/10 It has a good premise but it doesn't really get better than that, pretty lacking.Overall: 7/10 awesome game, get it if you like first person parkour			"

Mirror's Edge ReviewFree-running game with a terrible storyline but fantastic mechanics.The most fantastic parkour game ever created by mankind. Would of been better as an open world experience, but still great. The sequel to this game, Mirror's Edge: Catalyst is coming out reasonably soon and that will be open world, so that's hopefully going to be fantastic!This game is very well optimized and has some nice graphics. Albeit, the visuals can be a bit tiring at some times because of the lack of colour to the enviroment. Regardless of the visuals, this has some brilliant parkour gameplay! The controls are not what you'd think but are very easy to learn once you start playing!Also, please skip the cartoon cutscenes. The storyline in this game is terrible, ignore it completely for the best experience with this game.			"

												Completed the game in 5 hours in mostly normal, and then eventually turned the level down to easy. The story was 'meh', but at least there was some sort of story. This was the first game though, where I was really scared while playing. This isn't a horror game, but you do run away a lot. Whenever people show up with guns, I freak out, and noticed that I was holding my breath the whole time while trying to flee from the gunmen. Pretty fun puzzle game.			"

												Do you like parkour?  Do you like dystopian societies?  Do you like unresponsive controls?  Hot-damn, this is for you!  The story is one that video games tend to not bother with, but that in itself allows it to give you a unique cast of characters who feel real in a world that feels all too realistic.  In the gameplay you run around and do stunts in an attempt to get to the next designated location.  The problem is that more times than not, you know exactly what you should be doing and you did the right inputs for it, but the game oftentimes arbitrarily decides that you die this time, and have to try again.  Still, pick this one up during a sale and play it through, it's worth it for the story.			"

But Mirror's Edge is not like others, there aren't many parkour games.At first hours of playing it was really fun, later it becomes harder, it takes more time to complete chapters, i actually don't really like it, because it was too difficult to find where to go, but it was quite fun.When i bought this game, i really didn't think that this game will have a good story, but i was wrong, story in this game is better than i though.I just recommend this game to buy everyone, who want to try something diffirent from other games.

												A parkour game mashed with first-person shooter elements. That is essentially what Mirror's Edge encompasses. Upon hearing about this game I was immediately excited and curious by the notion that it was different from many other 'first person shooters' I had previously played. The screenshots looked enticing and the trailer was amazing.Picking up during a Steam sale was perhaps one of the best purchases I have made on Steam.The game is exciting, fluid and dynamic. The mere feel of jumping over buildings in a huge, modern and visually striking city coupled with the stunningly real feeling of vertigo, is something unique to this game. The controls are excellent which give the feeling of power and strength that your character, Faith, encompasses. This along with the stunning graphics, which scaled remarkably well on mid-range hardware (i7 3630qm, GT 740m), being still able to run on 'highest' on full resolution; are just a couple of the reasons why this game is rather excellent. (I recommend turning off the crosshair and HUD. This increases the feeling of immersion)For all these good points however, there are some negatives. This game is not perfect. The story is rather short and forgettable, revolving around some sort of political conspiracy; and I felt the cartoon-like cutscenes clashed with the photorealistic nature of the rest of the game, pulling me out of the immersion. Several stages were also poorly designed which left me dying repeatedly until I managed to accomplish a semi-impossible feat (I'm looking at you last level). But this could have perhaps been due to my incompetence at the game itself...When taken as a whole however, Mirror's Edge is amazing, which leaves me eagerly anticipating its second instalment.			"

Posted: February 1, 2015
												There are two mechanics of this game that are implemented with varying amounts of success.First: the parkour. This is the thing this game was made for. Faith runs like a dream, and there's nothing more satisfying than flying across rooftops and making those jumps that would probably break a normal person's legs. When this game is going fast, it's great.Second: the combat. Where do I even start with this? First of all, the game encourages you to avoid combat as often as possible. After all, you're playing a fragile speedster, so when it comes to fight or flight, flight is the better option. That being said, the game often doesnt LET you avoid combat. There'll be too many people shooting at you, and even with all your running and ducking and dodging chances are you'll be gunned down in seconds. And again, you're a fragile speedster, emphasis on the fragile part. You can't take very many hits. So when running isn't an option (even though the game will remind you that you SHOULDN'T be fighting), the only other choice you have is to fight. So what's the problem with fighting? Try: most everything. The timing for disarming someone is absurdly anal (and chances are while you're doing that someone else will be shooting you in the back), the timing for striking is anal (most often they'll just block and you'll be knocked back instead), and the controls for attacking someone while moving are awkward. If you engage in hand to hand, expect to have to repeat a segment over, and over, and over.In other words, every time combat happens, the game comes to a grinding halt. The point of the game is to be going fast and getting from place to place quickly and adeptly, but this becomes impossible when you have to slow down to fight 10 heavily armed guards that just rushed you and cut off the only escape route that doesn't end with a sickening *splat* sound. Combat completely throws off the pacing. The game tries to make the combat faster paced by causing the action to start the moment you enter a room, but this leaves no window of time for you to adjust to the surroundings. I get that part of the game is being able to react and choose routes quickly and everything, but there's only so fast a human can react before they get shot.(And I'll add here that you could just grab a gun and use that, but there's this little notice on the pause menu that tracks if you've shot anyone yet, and though I haven't finished the game yet, I can figure it'll be important. If this doesn't bother you, go for it. The game's great.)For all my complaining, though, I really do like this game and would recommend it, or at least the parkour parts. The combat system is poorly managed (and IMO doesn't belong in this type of game), but it isn't impossible, just incredibly frustrating. My grievances with the combat system are meant to be more of a forewarning than a dissuasion. Mechanics aside, the story, art, and voicing are fantastic, so design in that sense is solid.TL:DR; play it, it's great, but either brace yourself for grueling combat sequences or stuff your morality and use a gun.

												Mirrors Edge, for a game made in 2008 it's graphics are outstanding. Released along titles like fallout 3, L4D2, and Dead Space this game has earned its rightfull spot among those titles. Though its cutscenes and dialogue may be a little lacking I think its story makes up for it. Game play may be difficult because the game wants you to remember what you learned in your traning in the first level and has no popup hints. Nor are there directions to tell you where to go. You have an objective and red doors to find, run fast faith.			"

It's very adrenaline pumping, especially when you're running through glass, jumping and vaulting over obstacles, having the popo on your tail constantly shooting at you, breaking through windows and dodging bullets.

												Needless to say, this is one of the greatest games ever made. It's a first person parkour game. I would leave it at that but that wouldn't be very helpful. As a free runner myself I can say this is the best free running engine I have seen in a game. Whereas games like Assassins' Creed feel too floaty and Sleeping Dogs feels too clunky, this really feels as if I'm the one doing it. The physics seem very accurate to doing the real thing, if ever so slightly floaty at points but compared to some of the engines I have played with, it's superior by far. The story is nothing special but the game makes up for that through game play mechanics and stunning visuals. It has been a long time since I completed the game but it's still very enjoyable to go back and improve your ""flow"". Would I recommend this game? Yes, if you want something original and enjoyable gaming wise, this will satisfy your want.			"

I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension.

												Mirror's edge is the funnest game I have ever played, It had a ok storyline and the graphics are alright as well. It was a great game at the time, now when you look back at it, it still looks the same as some of the games made today. Or in 2010, when i first saw mirror's edge i was exited to buy the game and play it, back then, i have never seen a fast-paced parkour related game like mirrors edge before. And when i played it i had fun. Onto details about the game!The game is a Action packed Fast-paced parkour game, and i mean really fast. You gotta make shure you time things right sometimes, and one small slip may mean your death. but all in all, when you get used to the game it is great, and it is very fun. It's like Pouring Oxy-Clean Detergent on your laundry.I haven't seen much of the community of the game, Mirror's edge is kind of dead, but is still a fun game. There are no mods for it. But if you get back to it in a few months you will want to play it again. I heard that they are working on a mirror's edge 2, but i think they cancelled progress on it, i think they started working on it on 2012, i haven't heard much about mirror's edge or mirror's edge 2 scince then, just a bunch of call of duty and stuff like that. You know, the usual video game commercials.Mirror's edge is a Dead game that i think is lost and probably hasn't been touched by people in a while. (no pun intended) But someone somewhere in the world probably looks at it and plays it again for old time's sack. It is a great game and i reccomend it highly.			"

												This is by far one of the absolute best parkour games out there.If you enjoy parkour games, then you will fall in love with this game.PROS:Jumping around and parkouring makes you feel like the coolest person ever.Many different parkour moves such as wallrunning, vaulting, climbing, and rolling.Awesome animations for each different parkour move.A pretty good storyline.Great replayability, the amazing parkour never gets old.CONS:There are a few exploits and glitches. Most of them are minor, but a couple of them can really improve speedrun times and such.The combat system isn't the best thing I've ever seen.There are only 10 levels, making the game pretty short. There are time trials, though, which can take a while to beat.You might ragequit.Overall: 7.8/10 "

												Mirror's Edge is a first person parkour game with platforming and shooter elements. The player takes control of Faith as she uncovers the plot of murder, into which her sister was framed.The graphics look amazing for its time, and stand out even today. Just like it's name suggests, the environments are shiny and often pure eye candy (if you like big cities or semi-futuristic rooms).The gameplay is very simple: you use your parkour skills to move from one location to the next, exploring new areas, forwarding the story, and sometimes fighting enemies. For movement, you can perform wallruns, walljumps, pull-ups, rolls, slides... overall, it feels like there is no obstacle you can't surmount. The game (on lower difficulties, at least) also supplies you with Runner Vision, coloring red every object that you can use to move forward. The controls, while not lacking in options, do feel kind of stiff however. Mostly because you see everything from first-person perspective and thus your vision is often obscured by some objects. Environmental awareness is the key to success. Also, one bad jump or trick can send you plummetting to your death (which is a quite realistic portrayal of how it feels to fall from 30-story building to your death), but whenever that happens, it's almost always your fault.Combat, however, tends to be frustrating. Considering a few bullets will put you down and you often fight several gun-wielders while unarmed, it's quite understandable that you'll be at a disadvantage. Even on Normal it's very easy to lose. However, it's not that bad once you get the hang of it and can also wield weapons taken from defeated enemies (you do only get one clip, tho). The game gives you pistols, submachine guns, machine guns, and even sniper rifles at some points of the game, so don't be afraid to use those.The game offers three main gamemodes: Story, Race and Speedrun. Story allows you to play through different chapters of the story mode, accompanied by comic book-style custscenes. This mode is however very short, taking only maybe five hours to complete, including retries due to frequent deaths. Race allows you to do time trials on various short sections of the game, after which the game rates your performance. Speedrun is unlocked after completing the game and is basically Race applied to whole chapters of the Story mode.Overall, this game is very well done, a bit short, but has a good replay value.			"

												Beautiful graphics and soundtrack with heart in mouth moments. However can be abit clunky at times with a mouse and keyboard. I sometimes struggle grabbing onto pipes and can take as many as 30 tries to grab a basic pipe (many others have had this problem and apparently using a controller fixes this) the Art direction in this game is brilliant and where as the story is nothing to write home about in my opinion, the fast paced gameplay more than makes up for it.

												Mirrors edge is a very small, short lived game, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes a first-person view. The emphasis is on the parkour type movement rather than shooting, and you only get a gun for a minute at a time as you snatch one from a guard or officer, throwing it away in order to be mobile again. This game looks stunning and is worth the price just for the free-running challenge mode.			"

												The linear storyline to me went against the grain of the idea behind the flow. Being forced into a straight line when the ideal is to be able to go anywhere and do anything is somewhat of a barrier, as jarring as any invisible wall or locked door.However, the feel of the game when you did achieve the sensation of flowing from one place to another is one of the best feelings that I have experienced in a game to date. Also, when combined with the amazing level and puzzle design makes this a game well worth playing.			"

												The art direction and overall feel of this game is great. The gameplay is awesome most of the time. There are frustrating parts, and some physics that doesn't make sense, but for the most part this game is extremely enjoyable and set in a pretty cool Orwellian slightly futuristic world. The story is interesting mainly for the setting, and the cutscenes are pretty cool, but the plot isn't winning any awards for original writing.  The graphics still hold up amazingly today.  Just a technical note, I had to disable PhysX because the game would drop to 3 fps at parts where lots of glass broke and there was also an alt-tab glitch where the game would be stuck black screen. Turning off PhysX fixed both these problems. It might just be a problem with AMD. I'm running on radeon r9 290 and AMD fx-8350 cpu.			"

												Mirror's Edge. Painfully tedious at times, too heavily reliant on guns, unimpressive combat.And yet, the best parkour game out there, probably. (Until ME: Catalyst comes out.)Worth buying if you like these kinds of games.Parkour was not a theme commonly used in games until recently. So when Mirror's Edge came out no doubt people would have been excited. And as a person that enjoys Titanfall, I think it's got the best first-person mobility on the market. (ME, not Titanfall, great game though it is.)But the fluidity came at a cost. I can't help but feel DICE tried too hard to make it part-FPS. The combat breaks the smooth free feel of the game, unless you just run away. They're fixing this in Catalyst, making the combat more parkour-based, which is only good news. So, that's another box ticked for fans of the game.One of ME's best qualities was that, in theory, most chapters could be beaten in one fluid run, without stopping. And it does a good job of replicating the adrenaline-filled leaps of faith that comes with rooftop running.And you can't help but admire the art style of the city. It's a beautiful landscape of white and red that can hardly be put into words. It has to be experienced.Except that you're kind of trapped in small areas in the levels. But, again, DICE is adressing this and giving Catalyst the open world that the original desperately needed.To summmarise:Good parkourBad mostly everything else, but that doesn't matterEasy on the eyes - very easyNeeds open world and better fighting (both happening, thanks DICE)Buy this if you can't be bothered to climb a building and jump off roofs yourself.I would have made this review humourous, but I just couldn't think of any jokes. Sorry, folks.			"

												I wish we could see more games like Mirror's Edge in the future. Mirror's Edge is not the usual first-person shooter or adventure game. Instead, it is a game highly focused on art. The buildings contain outstanding color schemes and the game always feels very bright. However, not only is the environment stunning but the score and Faith's movement are outstanding as well. The score is perfect. It adds so much to the game without drowning out the sounds of the city when you would expect to hear it. It was also very captivating at times that you would want it to be. Faith's movements feel very real and fluid. It is extremely satisfying to jump from a high place and hit the ground with a roll. The story in this game is quite good, but not the best. This is because I was overwhelmed by the fantastic score and eye candy building interiors.    Though this game is outstanding in almost every way, it also has its faults. I found it extremely difficult to memorize the controls. Certain actions, such as jumping, are mapped to an odd place on the controller (Left shoulder button). However, I don't see it being mapped any other way that would have made sense. The only other down side that I have noticed would be the rare glitch in the free running mechanics. This is expected because no video game is without a glitch or flaw somewhere. Overall, Mirror's edge is one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a long time. This is definitely one of my favorite games.  I see myself playing it in the future time, and time again.			"

Mirror's Edge ReviewFree-running game with a terrible storyline but fantastic mechanics.The most fantastic parkour game ever created by mankind. Would of been better as an open world experience, but still great. The sequel to this game, Mirror's Edge: Catalyst is coming out reasonably soon and that will be open world, so that's hopefully going to be fantastic!This game is very well optimized and has some nice graphics. Albeit, the visuals can be a bit tiring at some times because of the lack of colour to the enviroment. Regardless of the visuals, this has some brilliant parkour gameplay! The controls are not what you'd think but are very easy to learn once you start playing!Also, please skip the cartoon cutscenes. The storyline in this game is terrible, ignore it completely for the best experience with this game.			"

I have played through the story about 6 times now and every time you find a new route to shave seconds off your previous record. The movement  in this game is what makes it truely unique. Faith controls like an actual person and running and jumping feels fluid and natural.The combat consists mostly of spamming attacks and pre animated takedowns but as you play the game you realise that you should be running past everyone anyway.Give this game a try. Play for two hours and if you're not hooked by then then get a refund because you'll have already experienced everything this game has to offer.			"

												Freedom.That's pretty much what this game made me feel. The platforming and running mechanics amazingly portrayed what parkour is all about. And the game gives off a definite feeling of speed and momentum as you navigate the few levels the base game has to offer. And that feeling is emphasized even further by the vibrant and colorful environments. The premise is neat but how they told the story and the characterization could have been done better. That's kinda disappointing since the player character, Faith, is pretty much a badass.Only thing though is don't buy it on Steam. Buy the game on Origin, EA's own client, because for some absurd reason the great Time Trials DLC is not for sale here on Steam. The DLC is worth it because it's just pure running and none of the atrocious combat is present.			"

												I dont do very many reviews, in fact I have to be truly impressed with a game or thoroughly dislike one to even bother.Mirrors Edge has landed on truly impressed. The citywide graphics are refreshingly bright and crisp, where most rpg graphics tend to be dark and sinister this brings a really nice feel of realism to the game. The only issue I had with framerate was when a lot of bullets are flying and cops are chasing Faith the impact of the particle system slowed them down a touch. My system can handle them but just to be sure I lowered the settings and lost very little of the detail and none of the beauty of the game and the framerate never wavered. The CG cutscenes are very well done and fall into the action with seamless ease. I personally would have liked to see more of these and a bit less of the cartoon styled ones, but thats just a matter of preference and takes nothing away from the story. The story thus far is well written and nicely voice acted, emersing you into the game and keeping you hungry to see what happens next. The combination of eyecandy graphics and great storyline are what has impressed me the most. I cant wait to see if they truly do make a Mirror's Edge movie and will absolutely want a copy. This brings me to gameplay, which takes some timing skill and plays out a lot like a 3D platform game might, with Faith running the rooftops for her life, jumping and sliding, in parkour style movements that have to be perfectly timed to keep her from falling to certain injury or death. Dont expect to fight your way out of most situations. Yes she has some skills but this isnt a female Rambo. She fights only when she has to. Which for myself only makes it seem more realistic and challenging. Albeit the story line is a bit linear the game does have a race mode and challenges that give it some replay value, and hours of story game play that will keep you coming back. Not many games can hold my attention enough to make me forget time. But it was easy for me to sit down here thinking I'll play for an hour and go to bed , only to look at the clock four hours later and wonder where the time went. Addictive, emersive gaming, I absolutely reccomend this to anyone looking for something new and exciting to play.			"

												I've played this game ritualistically every Christmas Eve since the day I got it, I'll start a new game and just... Run.Why? I couldn't tell you. I love this game, I could play through 10 times over in quick succession and still enjoy every minute of it. The freerunning is smooth, and the controls are simple yet refined. I decided to buy this game on PC, having only recently become a member of the PCMR in the last 2 years, but I did have this on my Xbox 360 since release. I will say that not having to deal with the annoying loading screens that would pop up WHILE you're running on the console version is extremely refreshing, it doesn't kill the pacing of the game like it once did.With the sequel (prequel? reboot?) fast approaching and having already pre-ordered it (something I am blatantly against, but it's MIRROR'S EDGE), wetting my feet and joining faith on her free running parkrusade once again has been incredibly fun.The game still holds up, and is still a blast, it's super relaxing just going, running, jumping, sliding, the flow of it.

												Honestly for mw, It's not the case of paying to support EA.Dice is an awesome group that's being dragged down by EA.Still back in the days of Mirrors Edge around 08-09 they were rocking.They still do as a single company. So i like to pay my hard earned money to support Dice instead of EA. At least that's what i set my mind to.Not an expensive game and well written story, awesome graphics to this day with a beautifully optimised engine that will even run on intel chips at high details.Definitely a game to buy and play and when you finished, you'll see yourself coming back to either do speedruns or play the campaign again.Definitely worth buying.Also keep a look out for catalyst.Overall 8.5/10			"

Gameplay does get soemwhat repetitive and at least to me at some parts it seemed really difficult to get by enemies without picking up their gun and shooting them. Which isn't what this game is about in essence.The parkour elements are really satisfying. Animations look great, and just look at that city. Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend to anyone looking for something a little off the beaten path.			"

												The art direction and overall feel of this game is great. The gameplay is awesome most of the time. There are frustrating parts, and some physics that doesn't make sense, but for the most part this game is extremely enjoyable and set in a pretty cool Orwellian slightly futuristic world. The story is interesting mainly for the setting, and the cutscenes are pretty cool, but the plot isn't winning any awards for original writing.  The graphics still hold up amazingly today.  Just a technical note, I had to disable PhysX because the game would drop to 3 fps at parts where lots of glass broke and there was also an alt-tab glitch where the game would be stuck black screen. Turning off PhysX fixed both these problems. It might just be a problem with AMD. I'm running on radeon r9 290 and AMD fx-8350 cpu.			"

This was the first game though, where I was really scared while playing. This isn't a horror game, but you do run away a lot. Whenever people show up with guns, I freak out, and noticed that I was holding my breath the whole time while trying to flee from the gunmen. Pretty fun puzzle game.			"

Surprisingly addicting to try and see how many different paths you can take and how many miliseconds you can shed off the clock. It's almost reminds me of Rocket Jumping in TF2, or Pathfinder from Tribes Ascend.If this had some gun play mixed in, it'd be a hell of a game.			"

												This is a personal favorite of mine. The graphics are great, the combat system is somewhat complex, but doesn't have a steep learning curve. I love the color scheme that they have, the use of white to make color stand out. The storyline is well written, and the song ""Still Alive"" (Not GlaDOS) is one of the big reasons why I love this game. However, don't enable Nvidia's PhysX or whatever if you don't have an Nvidia card, or whenever glass breaks it will LAAAAAAAAAAAAG. Might have just been me though.Overall, I would highly reccomend this game.			"

I found mirror's edge from sources on youtube and I decided it would be worth a try. I couldn't find it anywhere so the next best thing was to get a demo. I played it and it was fun but you can only do so much with a demo. Fast forwards to a couple years later and here I am. I purchased the game on sale. I booted it up and adjusted my controls and began to play. It is so fun. I would recommend it to anyone. Go get it. Now.			"

												Oh my god. I love this game and I hate it. The structure is sections of really, really satisfying first-person parkour broken up by awful sections where you'll die to a bunch of dudes with guns over and over. I don't know if I've ever played a game with such a huge gap between my best and worst experiences: at its best, its levels are designed like puzzles you need to solve with the handful of techniques you're taught (for better or worse) at the start of the game. At its worst, you're thrown into a big room with a bunch of boxes and heavily-armed guys, and given no sense of where to go or whether to fight. (Pressing the Alt key is supposed to direct your view toward your goal, but that's not always the case.)The joy of running, the visual design, and the world-building are all good enough, in my opinion, to still make this a game worth playing. I just wish I could give an unqualified recommendation.			"

Time for Parkour!This is a good parkour game that has a lot of action and an interesting enough story to make you want to keep playing. The controls take a little bit to get used to however the tutorial is adequate enough so that you have a decent feel for the game before you make the leap to fighting enemies at the same time. With that being said the combat is challenging at times and doesnt feel clunky, and the techno music the accompanies the game is fitting. However it should be mentioned that the game is fairly short for a single-player game, with the main story being approximately 6 hours long. Although it is short, this game is very cheap to buy on the steam sales and other sites, so it is definitely going to be worth the money shoudl you buy it at a discounted price :)			"

												I had done a commission and requested this game as a payment. The hours I spent drawing was 100% worth the reward, and has already taken my total and complete interest from my many other games and put it all into Mirror's Edge. This game has already been one of my top favorites, and has wonderfully transfixed me on it's visual style and EXTREMELY smooth gameplay.Pros:-Wonderful visual style.-Strong story line.-Great mechanics.-Reliable characters.-Great combat.-WONDERFUL first person view. Never had any other game that felt so alive and real.Cons:-Cannot in any way block during melee fights. Can be a BIG annoyance when facing later enemies.-Some minor clipping issues with the pipes, mostly ignorable. Pro Tip; definitely look straight at the ♥♥♥♥ing things and keep going forward, it'll all work out.-You will die, a lot. Not kidding, it makes you want to rage, but you can't since the game is so damned good at the same time.Even though EA helped lead the development, Dice definitely made up for it with the first person view.Total Rating, 10/10			"

												Honestly if you love Parkour then you definetaly want this game. The POV is amazing, the scenery is amazing, the story is amazing and just everything about it is amazing. The controls can be a little tough to get used to at first but once that happens its not hard to get addicted to this game. <3 It will forever be the best game for parkour and platforming lovers.

												Mirror's Edge is a fantastically presented mediocre game.While its visual style, music, and atmosphere are top-notch, its core gameplay is, in my opinion, slightly lacking. While the game shines in its free-running segments, pretty much every part of the game where you're being shot at feels like a chore. And these segments are unfortunately numerous.The main theme of the game is free-running, and the first advice you're given about combat is ""avoid the enemy"". Naturally, the best option in a game like this, where your character, Faith, is extremely agile and quick, is to run from the enemy, evade them, or sneak by them. However, stealth is impossible; enemies will simply detect you no matter how much care you take to sneak quietly. Additionally, there are many forced combat segments: the game tells you to avoid the enemy, then places you in situations where you are unable to do so. This wouldn't be a problem if the combat were enjoyable, but unfortunately, I did not enjoy it.The main flaw with the combat is the lack of a learning curve. On Normal mode, enemies can shoot you dead in two or three hits. This means that there is no time for Faith to practice her moves; if she messes up at all, which is inevitable when practicing, she's dead, and you have to start the whole sequence over again. Reaction time does little to remedy this. These segments really throw a wrench in the otherwise smooth action of Mirror's Edge.As I said, the game is very smooth, and its free-running segments, where your only enemy is a steep drop off a roof, are stellar. It feels very rewarding to get the hang of the controls and totally ace a segment without falling or losing momentum. Unfortunately, these segments are mostly used as links between the combat segments in the later game. I feel as though Dice, a developer probably best known for its shooters, felt they needed to incorporate shooter elements here in abundance. But the game would be much better off if it revolved more around the parkour elements, with combat being optional.Enough about the combat, let's talk about the better parts of this game: The design is fantastic. The use of strong color and good use of visual filters makes this game look like a work of art. The cartoon cutscenes between chapters are great, if slightly low-budget feeling (many frames are noticably re-used). The music is great, and helps the peaceful sections feel peaceful and the dangerous sections feel tense. The characters, while not explored terribly much, still play their parts well, and putting yourself in Faith's shoes is not hard. The unlockables are a nice touch as well.Despite its flaws, this game is still solid. But now that I've experienced it first-hand, I wouldn't say it's as great as many people say it is. When I find myself admiring the aesthetics and theme of a game more than its actual gameplay, it's hard for me to recommend it to others. However, if you can get this game on sale, I would recommend you play through it simply for the experience. It's presented very well, and it's a shame it didn't have more dev time (there are some cut things in the unlockables), and it's also a shame that it was so short. Hopefully the sequel can improve on this game's flaws, but as it stands, I'd only recommend it at a reduced price.Good Points:- Stunning visual design, amazing aesthetics- Good free-running segments, Runner Vision is an intuitive system- Good music that bolsters the atmosphere- Engaging charactersFlaws:- Forced combat segments feel out-of-place- Lack of learning curve, no real way to practice combat- Too little free-running for a game that's supposed to revolve around it, compared to gunplay and combat- Pretty short, no expansions or extra story content - Stealth is impossible, enemy AI is telepathicBottom Line: It's a great work of art, but only a passable game. Recommended, but only if it's on sale.			"

												This is still to this day one of the more refreshing games I have played. When it first came out it caught me by surprise and it sure didn't let down.It has it's downfalls. Gameplay does get soemwhat repetitive and at least to me at some parts it seemed really difficult to get by enemies without picking up their gun and shooting them. Which isn't what this game is about in essence.The parkour elements are really satisfying. Animations look great, and just look at that city. Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend to anyone looking for something a little off the beaten path.			"

												I definetely recommend this game. In my opinion, it is most fun when you don't know the way to go, get lost, and die 7 times. It's an amazing experience to learn your way with the freerunning mechanics and starting to see different patterns that show paths. The later game gets nice and hard (no innuendos here). The only negative is the combat. If you're trying to do a pacifist run, then the enemies are too plentiful. If you plan on killing people, then it's fine, though.			"

												With the recent announcement of the sequel I assume many will be checking out this game for the first time and I'm happy to tell you it has aged like fine wine. It is still one of the all time best first person games. Unparalled immersion, movement second to none, and a great soundtrack to boot. Many complain about the story, and while it's a tad simplistic, I found it very easy to get into and care about the characters. Of course it ends on a huge cliff hanger and it may or may not ever be continued, but us PC gamers are used to that now aren't we? 10/10 Must buy			"

												I don't care. This game is Dice's best work. It's got the best gunplay, best mechanics, best visual style, best everything of anything they've ever done. Battlefield's nice and all; 2142 and the Bad Company series are fantastic, but most of the other ones are pretty boring and generic. This game is anything but. Definitely worth a play. There are some frustrating bits where the freerunning mechanics get in your way (that lousy part with the slick wet slidedown to that hole. The game looks like it expects you to jump over it, but that doesn't work.) All in all though its still pretty good.			"

												Do you like parkour?  Do you like dystopian societies?  Do you like unresponsive controls?  Hot-damn, this is for you!  The story is one that video games tend to not bother with, but that in itself allows it to give you a unique cast of characters who feel real in a world that feels all too realistic.  In the gameplay you run around and do stunts in an attempt to get to the next designated location.  The problem is that more times than not, you know exactly what you should be doing and you did the right inputs for it, but the game oftentimes arbitrarily decides that you die this time, and have to try again.  Still, pick this one up during a sale and play it through, it's worth it for the story.			"

												Mirrors Edge's negatives blurred the fun concepts. The game's music, and cut scene animation was near perfection, being both unique and beautiful. However the level design, (some cases) voice acting, and gameplay was the epitome of a repetitiveness. I felt as if i was playing the same level over and over again, until the story finally threw it's self together during every cutscene. By far the worst problem was repetition, and this was will hopefully be improved in the sequel.			"

The level design with its color scheme is superb, and you don't get lost in the world while running around, because off one adjustment; The ALT-key. Just press it, and Faith, the protagonist, looks in the direction where you should go.The combat isn't good at all and feels misplaced. It's repetitive and not elaborated.

												PROS:Very nice environmentsGameplay is fun, smooth (mostly) and intenseGreat soundtrackCONS:While the gameplay is nice and fluid most of the time, it can also be extremely frustrating and repetitive, being shot at whilst trying to do parkour really isn't as fun as you'd think it would be in a game, and since you die ridiculously easily and will fall off ledges a lot you can expect to be repeating the same part of a level a few times before you progress. The game doesn't seem to be able to decide whether it's a parkour or an action game, the two don't really fit together well here, so the action ends up being annoying and interrupts the flow most of the time.Very short story, it took me a little under 5 hours to complete the entire game from start to finish. Story itself is pretty bland, I mean it wasn't a bad story, just wasn't particularly interesting, also it kind of cuts off at the end.Basically more of a beta test than a proper game.

												Mirror's Edge is a riveting first person adventure. Intense and fast paced with amazing graphics and awesome lighting, DICE release their most original game with an intriguing plot involving Faith and company, and an ambiguous ending. I just can't wait for more.I do wanna add that the campaign is quite short, but that might be expected, considering DICE usually concentrates on multiplayer titles, but the immersion of running and jumping across buildings is worth it. Plus the graphics haven't aged at all. This game is nearly 6 or 7 years old now, 2014, and still looks stunning. The story, though, isn't as amazing as it could be. The thrill and mystery is there, but it doesn't pull you in as well as the graphics and gameplay do. What draws the player in is clearly the first person parkour. Faith is a great character but so little is known about her, yet the game's antagonists are clearly out to get her because of who she is. The limited backstory on her and her family with the world building.Fantastic game regardless.9.0/10			"

												The selling point of 'Mirror's Edge' is the gameplay -- that is the parkour-inspired platforming in the first-person perspective. There was nothing like it at the time of the game's release, and there is nothing like it now at the time of this review. There is a story in 'Mirror's Edge', but it is not that interesting and is merely there to move the action along. As a fan of good stories in video games, I can overlook that because the first-person platforming is fun, albeit much, much trial and error is needed to complete a level most of the time.The game's clean, bright visuals are refreshing given the predominantly dark, brownish, shadowy looks of contemporary first-person shooters. The look of the game makes the gaming experience uplifting, which is much needed when you get frustrated from falling to your death many times in the game. There is an in-game system called ""Runner Vision"" that highlights environmental elements that are useful in solving the platforming puzzles, but those elements can still be hard to see as you may be in fast motion at the time. In later parts of the game, objects are highlighted less and less.The game is plagued with strange technical flaws that are hard to overlook though. First, if the PhysX option is turned on, it will cause debilitating drops in framerates if you are not using an nVidia GPU. (It should have been disabled automatically.) Second, you can't change a game's video settings mid-game and you will need to quit your current game to do so. Lastly, the checkpoints where you resume your game can vary, seemingly based on whether you are in the same game session (e.g. after an in-game death) or you are continuing a previously saved game (e.g. you start the game and click ""Continue Game""). That means you may find yourself playing a level all over again just because you decided to quit the game mid-level. More frequent checkpoint saves would have been nice.At the time of this review, I have not played the game for over three months. I have uninstalled it even though I have not finished it because there is just not enough good points to lure me back for more. (Ironically in short, I have lost my momentum with the game.) Despite its flaws, I am still recommending 'Mirror's Edge', but not as enthusiastically as I had for games like 'Dishonored' and the 'Tomb Raider' reboot. There is much to improve on to make 'Mirror's Edge' an even better game, but what we have here is good enough to experience at a discount price.			"

												I had heard of this game a lot when it came up, I had seen the trailers for it a long time ago, the awesome anime-ish style trailers and seen very small amounts of gameplay. Let me tell you, I have only (At the time of me writing this review) played about 25 minutes. Already love this game. FIrst off, I was happy how my crappy PC ran this game so smoothly, Secondly, I LOVE How your character Faith Feels, her movements are so fluid, like water, so agile and graceful. I freaking LOVE IT. And it needs to be all these things in order to play the game. The game it'self is more of a puzle game slightly portal-esque, Minus portal, Why it reminds me of portal is because it uses the enviroment as the puzzles, I freaking love that. There are so many ways to move, like making yourself smaller in mid air so you can hop over barbed wire fences, Zipline, slide, climb, shimmy, sidestep, wall ride, roll to save yourself from taking damage. You literally FEEL LIKE A RUNNER. You feel like a legitimate bada$$. I highly recommend this game, even if you may have a slightly laggy computer, this game will run beautifully for you. SOOOO worth the money, even though I got this game on sale for 5 bucks, It's sooo worth more! But I have more money to spend on other games as well >.>			"

												PROS:Very nice environmentsGameplay is fun, smooth (mostly) and intenseGreat soundtrackCONS:While the gameplay is nice and fluid most of the time, it can also be extremely frustrating and repetitive, being shot at whilst trying to do parkour really isn't as fun as you'd think it would be in a game, and since you die ridiculously easily and will fall off ledges a lot you can expect to be repeating the same part of a level a few times before you progress. The game doesn't seem to be able to decide whether it's a parkour or an action game, the two don't really fit together well here, so the action ends up being annoying and interrupts the flow most of the time.Very short story, it took me a little under 5 hours to complete the entire game from start to finish. Story itself is pretty bland, I mean it wasn't a bad story, just wasn't particularly interesting, also it kind of cuts off at the end.Basically more of a beta test than a proper game. Still fun though.			"

Short Version+ great art design+ parcour running feels fantastic- highly frustrating fights- here and there problems with controls not reacting as expectedGame supports 360 controller and I recommend using it.Long VersionThis game could be awesome. But it has two serious problems. Let's start with the really great sides of Mirror's Edge. The art design is just astonishing. The looks of the city with their different color themes, the asia touch and the fitting music create an interesting futuristic scenario. These components established the same feeling which I had in Deus Ex: HR before. If you played it you will know what I mean. Also the parcour running is just pure fun. When you are able to chain multiple moves in a fast run you feel SO good! If the game would feature parcour runs only, it would probably one of my favourite games of all time. BUT the game also is higly frustrating. There are several sequences where you have to fight armed policemen. And it is possibly the most horrible thing I have ever experienced. You will die. You will die so often. And that is not all, it will also feel unfair. You know this feeling when you think you are doing the best the game has to offer and you still die almost randomly? At one point I even thought about quitting completely. Another con is that the controls are sometimes not precise. If you played the old Tomb Raider games you will remember deaths because you jumped 5 degrees in the wrong direction. Overall the controls are good, don't get me wrong, but I had several moments where I definitely pressed the right button in the right moment and still somehow fell down or the character didn't grab the ledge.Nevertheless if you are interested in the game you should grab it for this price. The good sides of it are worth experiencing the frustrating ones. In reflection I feel positive about Mirror's Edge. And from my personal point of view everyone who is interested in video games in general should know this title.You should also use a 360 Controller, the game even supports it.			"

This is a terrific game and is well-worth the $20 (it also goes on sale a lot, though).			"

												It's great, kind of a fan-favorite to anyonewho knows it, with good reasons. Quite easy to get familiar with the parkour mechanics, a shame they came up with the excuse that the (flop???) was due to the game not having an online component, got quite some controversial statements made about it being worth it to develop a sequel, fortunately those ended up being dismissed as corporate rubbish talk. The visuals and soundtrack are great, but don't ever attempt to gunfight, it really wasn't made with that in mind, in fact forget about combat, the real challenge is to actually avoid enemies, being creative with the path you walk into. Get it for the low price and memorable unique experience.			"

												This has been my favorite parkour game of all time since it was released. I enjoy jumping from building to building and evading cops with effort. The terrain and scenery look very nice and give you a feeling you are really in a clean and futuristic city. The game itself does lack story-telling. A lot of times I already knew what would happen to a certain character and really could not create a bond with one of the characters. When I played the game I really didn't feel like I was in a world where I could choose the route to the objective. Every way you go is planned but it luckily reachable through just not going over that bench but around it. If you are looking for something pretty to look at while running away and giving you a feeling that you are actaully runnning then this is the game for you. But if you are searching for in-depth story-tellling or a large campaign to play through then I do reccomend trying to find something else.			"

												Dude its the best! a new type of genre game that came out in 2008...it was revolutionary. I still do play it from time to time (installing this and uninstalling it seems like a bother now) but it's one of my top 10 games and I am looking forward for Mirror's Edge 2 as it seems to deliver a worthy sequel from the trailers (wouldn't know until the game is released and played). One thing I loved is the music score they used in this game (especially Chapter 9 Kate and the beginning score used in the Shard); an absolute masterpiece! I just stared in the sky during start of the Shard and seeing that airplane flying across the atmosphere (contrails) and the night time office buildings around it, reminds me of my hometown (quite literally infact, and also hosted a clean, sterile environment but to the extremes like bleaching trees white and free-style police is of that world). These kind of scenes made me happy and think of hope for reasons that I remembered back in my childhood (my dad would take me to his office in his work if he has to work late night and just staring out in the big window from his desk, seeing the aesthics of city properties with post-modern lamp posts and the office lights of other buildings adjacent to where I am)...its the best sight and memory to keep forever. The beauty of Urban landscaping at its best.But the one that topped everything off with cherry on top was the MAIN MENU ANMATION and the menu music complemented each other perfectly...I've been trying to find out how they made such graciful animation from and my conclusions lead to Autodesk, 3DS Max, or Maya but I am not sure and emailed countless times to DICE Sweden but like any other video game company, they always don't respond.I hope Mirror's Edge 2 would have equal or greater standards for their Main Menu Animation (love the city-scaping motion) and of course the Music Score has to be top-notch.

												STEEL ALIVE, M0F0S.This über-incomprehensible interactive 4D motion-picture by Electronic Arts of all publishers once again shatters the defining traits of a first-person shooter by incorporating athletic puzzles in the form of intense, high speed parkour throughout mesmerising yet infinitely hostile urban environments in what clearly is the plotline of a Cinderella-esque run-for-freedom merged with a theme highly reminiscent of elements from both Logan's Run and the Hunger Games series. Because who else has such superhuman strength, dexterity and apparent immortality as Faith in real life to scale entire metropolitan skylines while constantly on the run from equally-undaunted secret police dispatches? Oh, and although the game is quite dated it still refuses to run on almost all modern GPUs when at maximum physX settings. 7.8/10 would buy the upcoming prequel.			"

How to change your FOV in Mirror's Edge

			A lot of people's main complaint with Mirror's Edge is the narrow field of view. It can cause motion sickness and in my opinion prevents the game from being as immersive as it could be.

												As of right now, I haven't played much of Mirror's Edge, but somehow, I already know what level of enjoyment I'm gonna get out of this fanstastic game. Meerly saying that this title is a running simulator is entirely discrediting its main mechanic of action-packed parkour. It's simply exhilarating and incredibly satisfying to pull off a series of jumps, wall runs, vaults off roof-tops, and jump kick an ememy all in one cohesive, reflex-dependant motion. Colorfully stylized environments and a jazzy soundtrack compliment the pace of the action beautifully and makes the experience all the more thrilling. Don't try any of this at home...			"

												The most common words out of your mouth when playing a game probably shouldn't be ""oh for ♥♥♥♥'s sake"". And yet...Yeah you don't need me to tell you what every other bad review has told you over the years but so thought I when I got this in the sale. I should preface by saying I really wanted to enjoy it, I mean really really wanted too but by the end, I was mad enough having spend £3 on it I'd've probably been been spitting if I spent ten. The sheer number of times you'll imagine your environment is built for a certain action and instead it will end with you plummeting to the street below is unreal. Say what you will of Assassin's Creed, at least it only tends to throw you to your death if you take a flying leap. Mirror's Edge will fling you off a ledge like an infant sacrifice if you sneeze while pressing left. Part of this is cos its so linear; you must Do The Thing in a timely manner or you will be getting aquainted with the floor super-quick. My only hope for people who play the sequel is that by then the dev team has fully worked up the environment and you can just fanny about in a giant playground should you so wish. My wishlist also follows; you have a circle of vision greater than the 45 degrees of wall you are facing when hanging from it; your only options when hitting a bloke isn't a one-two punch before getting rammed in the teeth with the butt of a rifle.In fairness, the story's alright, bit short but not awful. Non-descript villains who haven't really done something awful  except be ordered to stop the murder suspect, but who I'm going to shoot in the face anayway etc. I'd imagine you get more story -and feel like less of an♥♥♥♥♥ if you bother finding the runner's cases, since over the whole 7 hours I was playing I only came across five (I eschewed actually looking for them in favour of ending the farce as quick a possible) and at number five got a random burst of history lesson/moral patter from Faith that gave me V for Vendetta flashbacks. But again I didn't walk that road. Faith herself? Bit of a cow. By that logic she and I should get on, but instead I felt slightly more justified about the numerous times I would purposely hurl her off buildings -usually after another Stupid Death(TM)- just to hear all her bones go crunch when she met the pavement. That doesn't reflect well on me however so moving on.Its pretty too, I'll give it that. Although don't play in a dark room cos otherwise it ramps up from pretty to retina searing, say goodbye to a few colour receptors, because they will be inevitably BURNED AWAY.So if you want first person parkour I'd wait for the sequel to see if they've ironed out what didn't work. I can also imagine a few years down the line, after turning the saturation down (like to a dog's level of colour appreciation) playing this on Oculus Rift, cos THAT would make FPP fun, even if it will leave me in a puddle of my own sick.

												Hmm... Where to start?You should definitely buy Mirror's Edge, and here's whyMirror's edge gives you a unique free run experience. You can even run on the wall!Though the story is short, it's definitely interesting. I completed the game in 7 hours, but it might take you longer as you die quite a lot. The enemies in this game make it way harder to complete a part of a level. They kick you, and shoot at you. The graphics are great for its time, you could compare it to some games from now! What isn't that great is the fps cap, but with a small change in the files, it will run at as high as your graphics card allows it to.Let's talk about the levels for a second. The levels get harder and harder as you progress. Which sometimes makes it frustrating, and some people may ragequit. Though you'll have to use the same skills over and over again, the levels aren't boring. Everytime you start a level, you're in a completely different location. Sometimes you're at ground level, and sometimes on the roofs. The red textures indicate where you have to go, though sometimes you might get stuck as sometimes they're located too far from eachother. You'll just have to keep on looking for them.Mirror's Edge Catalyst will be out in 2016. If you can't wait for that one, then just play this one! "

The level design with its color scheme is superb, and you don't get lost in the world while running around, because off one adjustment; The ALT-key. Just press it, and Faith, the protagonist, looks in the direction where you should go.The combat isn't good at all and feels misplaced. It's repetitive and not elaborated.

												Another game that is completely dissolved of its flawed sins by the things that it just does so damn well. Great atmosphere & design, solid parkour mechanics (though the fighting is atrocious & clunky), and a fantastic soundtrack. Another group of developers at DICE that are gonna hit a home run with the sequel...so jump in when it's on sale & get a taste of the Mirror's Edge franchise.			"

												Skip to bottom for key points.This game was straight up awesome.  Once you take the time to learn the controls and develop some rudimentary skills, the fun factor goes way up.  The most fun part of the game for me was the time trials, because it's just pure parkour all over the place.  You get to make the rooftops your own, and run/jump/climb all over your territory.  The campaign itself is quite good.  The writing isn't great, and the plot unfolds somewhat predictably, but that was never the main focus of the game.  The focus is running from the cops, or chasing other dudes, and that's where all the excitement is.  There is a ton of adrenaline value in most of the levels, and the non-chase puzzle levels are so interesting, you're still on the edge of your seat.  A lot of the enjoyment of the game comes from how good everything looks.  It's a bit unrealistic that everywhere you go is so clean and amazing looking, but that just adds to the experience, and helps to remove anything that might distract you while you run full speed past it all.  The only downside to the campaign is that once you've really hit your stride and parkour through the levels like lighting, it ends up being over rather quick, leaving you wanting more.  Then it's time to challenge yourself and run it all again, looking for quicker runs, and more efficient paths.  There's such a good selection of path options, that it really encourages you to make split second decisions, and judgement calls.  If you do get hung up, and decide to fight it out with the pursuers, there's a pretty interesting and engaging combat system.  *Spoilers*  The cops constantly try to kill you and never hesitate to open fire.  Shooting them is fun, but you don't get much ammo so if you go exterminator mode like I did, you have to plan out your attacks and work your way from enemy to enemy one at a time.  Fighting one enemy is really fun.  Fighting two gives you about a 50% survival chance but it's still doable and still fun if you pull it off.  It's understandably not fun to get mowed down from 3 or 4 different directions if you just run into the fray, and that's what happens, so you have to stay tactical.  *More SPOILERS*  The ninja dudes at the end are hard as hell to beat, but they are killable, and I figured out to beat the sh** out of those mofos, but again it involves extreme tactics.  They, like you, regenerate unless hit a lot of times in quick succession.  Get 3 good hits on them in under 10 seconds and you knock them the heck out, but that's so hard to pull off it's easier to just run away and escape them.  Just to summarizePros:  Fun CampaignFun extra modesAwesome concepts and executionCool main characterLevels look coolParkour looks awesome and sounds awesome (the sound clips used are perfect)Can play like a speed demon or a vengeful punisherCons:Campaign is short if you speed demon the whole thingStory is probably the least developed part of the game.How much fun you have depends on how well you learn the system and timing.I spent a lot of time on the levels, finding shortcuts, killing everything, and exploring, so I got a lot out of the game.  It's unique and it draws you in.  Immersive yet light on a heavy gamer's pallete.  I'd even say, it's an almost perfect game.  5/5 stars.			"

												So far after PLaying 40 minutes of he pc version and playing it a little on the console side to its overall a really great game. For pc its a really really pretty game with all the graphics cranked up to ultra and getting high fps is amazing. The story is really good so far from my standerds, and overall a great pc port to. But if there is one thing that i have to complain about from playing it on pc and console its that there is no map or mini map to tell you where the hell your supposed to go. Thats really my only flaw about this game but its still a great game, so if you looking to buy a game were you parkour everywhere through a city and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of cops then i really recomend you get this game :)			"

												As of right now, I haven't played much of Mirror's Edge, but somehow, I already know what level of enjoyment I'm gonna get out of this fanstastic game. Meerly saying that this title is a running simulator is entirely discrediting its main mechanic of action-packed parkour. It's simply exhilarating and incredibly satisfying to pull off a series of jumps, wall runs, vaults off roof-tops, and jump kick an ememy all in one cohesive, reflex-dependant motion. Colorfully stylized environments and a jazzy soundtrack compliment the pace of the action beautifully and makes the experience all the more thrilling. Don't try any of this at home...			"

												This game is absulotely amazing! The Graphics are beautiful for a FPS (First-Person-Shooter). Considering it's one of the first of it's kind, the way it chooses to create  the parkour elements are mix perfectly. The gameplay is phenomanol for such a sadly short game... I found myself wishing for more content after I finished the campaign. While the game is short, every moment is memorable. Sometimes you go jumping of buildings, sometimes you dodge billboards on a train, and sometimes you find yourself facing your rival on a storage crates... wherever you are, it's action packed gameplay! The controls are smooth and responsive, and the difficulty isn't to hard, although it does spike everynow and then. The Story isn't bad, but it definately isn't memoriable. I found myself skipping cutscenes just so I could get on to the gameplay. Speaking of cutscenes, the creators either choose to be lazy about them or just to have a set art style for them. If the later why wouldn't they set the art style for the entire game? All in all though, I really have no complaints about Mirror's Edge. It definately deserves an 8/10!			"

												I played this game a lot on the 360 and it is so much fun, though some players may find the gunplay and combat a little lackluster. At its core though, the game is about running instead of fighting.  You can expect getting stuck in a few places and retrying failed jumps, but once you get the hang of it, the parkour-gameplay feels very satisfying, and the time trials offer plenty of replay value.

												7 out of 10.  I'm giving it a thumbs-up because the free-running gameplay is an interesting mechanic, but the game has enough faults that I really only recommend it when you can find it on sale.All in all not a very good game, even though it seems to have a pretty rabid fan base. To be fair, the graphics are very good, especially considering it's a few years old, and the developers had some innovative ideas for how to play the game. Unfortunately actually playing the game just wasn't as fun as it should have been. Mostly the game suffers from pretty bad controls coupled with unforgiving gameplay mechanics, which results in having to replay sections over and over again. Most jumps and grabs have to be precisely timed and the distance precisely judged, but many times the button presses didn't register quickly enough, and it's in general pretty difficult to judge distances, so I found myself dying dozens of times when I missed jumps by no more than an inch or two - that got frustrating really fast. The control issue also raised its ugly head in the wholly mediocre combat. Many, many times the right-mouse button counterattack failed, which got me killed more times than I could count. I eventually grew to hate the combat so much that I just pounded on the first guard I saw, took his gun, then shot everyone else just to get it over with.The other huge frustration with the game was the fact that for such a completely linear game it was often nearly impossible to figure out where to go. There was supposed to be a hint system that highlighted your path in red, but sometimes it showed up off in the distance, sometimes not until you were right on top of the path, and sometimes not at all - I wandered around a lot because of that. Even worse was the level where the devs decided to paint everything in the building red; I don't know why, I guess maybe they just thought it was funny to frustrate us even further.To make matters even worse (or perhaps better, as things turned out) - beyond the spotty controls, oft-failing hint system, unforgiving mechanics and mediocre combat, the game took me all of 5 hours and change to complete. I'm not necessarily opposed to short games, as long as the story is engaging and gameplay is fun - The Darkness II is a perfect example. But this game was neither engaging nor more than moderately fun, and was far too short for the money they normally charge. Luckily I got this as part of the EA Humble Bundle, so I really didn't shell anything out for it. If you can pick it up really cheap then it's fine to waste time on for a few hours, but anything more than a few bucks is probably a waste of your money.			"

												This game is alot of fun.  Despite the campaign lacking in length as well as story, first person free running has never been so fun.  The game can be very difficult at some points, but with a simple control system and rather addiciting gameplay you can't go wrong with this one.  however i would say 20 dollars is rather steep, especially when the content of the game is a bit lacking. wait for a sale			"

												Mirror's Edge can be described in one word, and only one word really seems to fit. ""Unique"". Everything from the visual style of a bleached white city (which is hardly as boring to look at as it sounds) to the gameplay are some thing that I've never seen before, and am sad I haven't.The gameplay is hard to explain, and fits no real genre. ""First person parkour shooter puzzle game"" is probably the closest. When you reach that point in the game where you play flawlessly, able to launch over and under any obstacle you see it's something that feels... right.Combat is somewhat important, but most encounters can be avoided. Moving into combat comes as seamlessly as moving through parts of the level, and you can bring the same momentum and speed you feel in the parkour elements right into the battles.That's not to say the game is *all* gameplay. The story is also interesting, and the comic book style cutscenes do a great job portraying every important character in the game.It's not the world's longest game, but it's got immense replay value. Time trials, and the satisfaction of nailing each section with perfect landings and non stop running kept brining me back to the game.I recommend this game to fans of puzzle games (searching for paths to objectives up and down buildings and rooftops), and action game fans (because of the hectic movement and combat) alike. Every element seems to fall into place together, and it makes this a true classic that every fan of gaming should own a copy of.			"

												Mirror's Edge is an FPS set in a big city where Runners transport sensitive data across the city whilst avoiding the opposing forces of the law. Instead of relying on weapons, the theme in this game is set on outrunning your enemies. While the game is a bit dated, it is still a highly appreciated classic found in almost every common Steam user's library.PROS:+ Great freerunning adventure+ Nice and colourful graphics+ Fluent movement control+ Built-in speedrun option+ Replay value due remembering the paths and being able to do it fasterCONS:- The story is somewhat shallow- Sometimes the game focusses on a tricky jump rather than a parcour- Finding out where to go can be a little irritating at timesMy rating: 8/10			"

												Hmm... Where to start?You should definitely buy Mirror's Edge, and here's whyMirror's edge gives you a unique free run experience. You can even run on the wall!Though the story is short, it's definitely interesting. I completed the game in 7 hours, but it might take you longer as you die quite a lot. The enemies in this game make it way harder to complete a part of a level. They kick you, and shoot at you. The graphics are great for its time, you could compare it to some games from now! What isn't that great is the fps cap, but with a small change in the files, it will run at as high as your graphics card allows it to.Let's talk about the levels for a second. The levels get harder and harder as you progress. Which sometimes makes it frustrating, and some people may ragequit. Though you'll have to use the same skills over and over again, the levels aren't boring. Everytime you start a level, you're in a completely different location. Sometimes you're at ground level, and sometimes on the roofs. The red textures indicate where you have to go, though sometimes you might get stuck as sometimes they're located too far from eachother. You'll just have to keep on looking for them.Mirror's Edge Catalyst will be out in 2016. If you can't wait for that one, then just play this one! "

												Mirrors Edge is one of my favourite games (I used to own it on Xbox and recently bought it on Steam) as it has a pretty good story, great atmosphere, amazing fluidity and action. The game is quite short but does offer a reasonable amount of replayability and has extra things to do such as challenges and time trials so its definitely worth buying especially in a sale. Overall I really enjoy this game and the only limitations/problems that i believe exist in this game are the lack of music whilst playing although this might detract from the action if it was present but also the play time. The play time is an issue because the main story can easily be done in about 4/5 hours as I found upon rebuying and playing this game as i managed to beat it in just about 3 hours but the normal new player might expect to beat it in 4/5. Althought despite this being a flaw I think I have collectively (On Xbox and PC) played through the story about 5 times (I think) and have spent numerous hours trying to beat personal bests in time trials and challenges so for me this hasn't been a massive problem but just thought it was the main and probably only limitation for Mirrors Edge on the whole. Have fun.EDIT: One thing I did forget to mention was that the only real difference from the console version to the PC version that makes the pc version a bit less enjoyable is the exclusion of achievements from PC as some of the achievements were extremely challenging and a good thing to show off your ability at a difficult game. For example some of the ones i remember were completing the game without shooting someone and another for not hitting people i think.			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. It's one of my best, gorgeous and emotional experience in my gaming life. It's just so pumped with action, and the music it's just too damn beautifull. Pros - It's just gorgeous         - Brilliant story         - Nice animation         - Cool Graphics         - Incredible smooth gameplay         - The cool badass parkour feeling         - The emotions in the end         - The levels are nicely designed         - The ""new faster route discovery"" satisfaction         - The combat and combos you can do         - The GPU PhysX is very beautifullAnd no cons for me. Not expirienced any bus so far, and I have a couple hours into it. So there you go, if you like an emotional story, cool action parkour game, this is your game. I can't wait to play Mirror's Edge Catalyst :)			"

												Mirror's edge, a great game. I've completed the story mode in a bit over 7 hours. I've bought it in sale, so it was €2,50, which was really worth it!One problem thought, this game has it's way of angering you quite easily. Sometimes when you make a jump, Faith doesn't grab the edge, or clutch onto some pipe. Also, sometimes it's quite hard to find the way to go. This is a part of the adventure, but when it's really confusing where to go, this game isn't any fun. I've had a lot of fun while playing this game. It's like a 3D puzzle, finding out where you have to go and finding a way to get there. There is ofcourse an extend to this, as i've said. If you dont know what to do/where to go, this could be a pain in the ***. Another good thing, the visuals.  This game is just so beautiful. While running over the rooftops, you can have a quick peek over the city. It's mostly about the gameplay and the visuals are just a plus. If i'd have to rate this game, i'd give it an 8/10, reasons shown above.			"

												I'm a parkour enthusiast, and since the first time I saw the Mirror's Edge trailer I was dying for playing it.Now that I had the opportunity, I can gladfully say that the gameplay is excellent.The only negative point of it is the story. To be honest, recently I don't really give a damn about lore in a game. But I think ME's story is generally considered badly executed. I didn't even know what was the problem in the game and what was Faith trying to accomplish. But you know what? It doesn't matter for me. They could have just made it with a more arcade concept and just having to go from point A to B and still would like the game.			"

												PROS:Very nice environmentsGameplay is fun, smooth (mostly) and intenseGreat soundtrackCONS:While the gameplay is nice and fluid most of the time, it can also be extremely frustrating and repetitive, being shot at whilst trying to do parkour really isn't as fun as you'd think it would be in a game, and since you die ridiculously easily and will fall off ledges a lot you can expect to be repeating the same part of a level a few times before you progress. The game doesn't seem to be able to decide whether it's a parkour or an action game, the two don't really fit together well here, so the action ends up being annoying and interrupts the flow most of the time.Very short story, it took me a little under 5 hours to complete the entire game from start to finish. Story itself is pretty bland, I mean it wasn't a bad story, just wasn't particularly interesting, also it kind of cuts off at the end.Basically more of a beta test than a proper game. Still fun though.			"

												I do not know any other parkour games than this one. So i can not make any comparisons and i may not be objective. But i will try.Mirrors edge was a ground braking game back when it was released. A brand new concept for its time. So i think even if the story is cliche and short (4 hours is enough tom complete) and police is heroicly good at shooting and you are feeling puzzled more than a runner, the game deserves a recommended vote. Today there may be other parkour like games better than this but it does not mean no one is gonna enjoy this one.I tried to mention cons and here are the pros: The environment look nice, the sounds are realistic and you can realy feel you are running on top of the buildings. However there are plenty of obstacles to go over while you are running, the free run feeling is satisfying enough. If there were no walls or fences, the game would be a ""Run Like Hell"" game :DThere are challenges to spend time. If you are not a fan of parkouring, this gets boring. You can challenge online people if you can find. Or race with their ghosts. Game is not much optimized but not the worst either.So i recommend this game because it was aground braking idea. But you can wait for the sequal too. Remember the story is 4 hours long and it is not only about running. Most of the time, running for your life.			"

												I bought this game really wanting to love it. The concept of parkour and run-and-gun gameplay sounds great on paper, but its execution in Mirror's Edge is questionable. The story is boring and the voice acting, while not the most dreadful I've heard, is still pretty bland. The ending was incredibly rushed and there was practically no substance or depth throughout the plot.The parkour mechanics work and do pump some adrenaline in your gaming veins (I also have a phobia of heights, so it was kinda fun in that sense). There are moments where Faith will unexpectedly not grab ledges (where your margin to grab onto one is pretty reasonable) and you will end up raging quite a bit when Faith will jump to a pipe but not grab it because you're SLIGHTLY off-centered. The game isn't broken per se, but it could've used a lot more work in regards to parkour fluidity and ledge detection.The enemy AI is incredibly dumb and unfair. All the ""blues"" do is charge towards you with a constant set of bullets, and snipers have 110% accuracy, even when you're in mid-air. The parry system works half the time since when enemies try to hit you it's always hard to see if the gun turns red (prompt to parry and take the gun). Headshots deal the same amount of damage as a shot to the torso. There is also ZERO variation in enemies. You can argue that they have different weapons and abilities but they all the feel the same; they're all male (except for that one exception), they all have guns, and they all charge towards you.The story is painfully predictable. Every ""twist"" I witnessed, I expected early on (the antagonists have the stereotypical ""this is how the world works bla bla bla"" attitude). Also, the game takes four hours to complete on NORMAL. The other hour I spent playing was me trying to escape the train section, which was absolutely pointless and unrewardingly difficult.BUT I did have fun with this game. The main parkour sections are well laid out and I did enjoy using different tactics to take down enemies. The visuals are refreshing and the environments feel very open (albeit a little repetitive). The textures are appropriately saturated and detailed.I can only give this game a maximum of 6 out of 10, and can only recommend Mirror's Edge to people who don't mind trying retracing their steps multiple times. I am looking forward to Mirror's Edge Catalyst, hoping some of my issues with this installment will be fixed for the sequel.			"

												*tldr* its like... its like... well i guess dying light but with no zombies or open world. prime game?this is a very unique game. there are few games that have attempted this style. that may be because its hard to get it right. your in first person and the main mechanic is free running. the challenge is you cant see your feet which makes it hard to judge when to jump. the first time i beat this game i remember thinking dang this was unique and fun. playing it again i would say its rare for a reason. that's not to say it wasn't fun or good. i'm just glad too many games haven't badly blundered through this genera. clunky comes to mind when looking for adjectives to describe the control's. when your cooking along and really chugging through the rooftops if feels great and is really fun. the puzzles though should be the most intriguing part and unfortunately is where the clumsiness comes in. they aren't just challenging. challenging implies that every thing is stack equally against you. the controls seem to work when they want to. sometimes faith will grab the ledge you want her to and other times she doesn't. its frustrating because the game is really fun and i do recommended it but i really struggled to slog through to the end. the story is not bad. its not super memorable and it really feels like they were setting up for another game that never came. i know it sounds like I'm complaining allot but its because i really liked them game. i'm hoping they make more in the series but i hope they listen to feed back.

												First person parkour bursting with vibrant colors. Controls can be finicky at times (using keyboard and mouse), but the overall experience is rewarding, as long as the game does not require you to engage in combat situations. Punching, kicking, and shooting are in fact not very satisfying. Luckily, you will mostly be running, jumping, climbing, sliding, and swinging. There are plenty of opportunities for taking stylish screenshots while touring rooftops, construction sites, deserted office spaces, and underground levels.			"

												Mirror's edge may be a short game but it has lots of great features. The one part about the game I couldnt get enough of is the graphics; this game's graphics still hold of with games today. the next part about the game that I enjoyed was the movement, which is the base of this game, there were many parts of the game that looked very fluent and there are many ays to get through the level. Now the only bad part of the game that I personally did not like; The game is incredibly short and if you play it in one sitting you will be occupied for 4 maybe 5 hours before it is complete. Though the game does have flaws I would honestly recommend this title			"

												My review feels more ""meh"" then anything, when finishing this game. As discussing with my roommate, the idea and premise behind is cool, but the combat is lackluster, and you spend a lot of time in combat or running from it. The story has plot holes, character models don't have more than one outfit in the story. The game is pretty and there are times when I get lost in the focus of freerunning, but more often than not, you will be frustrated by trying to deal with combat, or not being sure how to get to your next objective. If you can find it heavily discounted, you might find some fun in it, but would not recommend it at full price.			"

												I really love the gameplay in mirror’s edge. There is never a dull or boring moment throughout the 4 hour long game, it keeps a steady pace the whole time. I can see people not liking the game much on console because a gamepad is just not as precise and quicker than the mouse and keyboard controls which is a big reason why I love the game on pc is because the mouse and keyboard are so responsive for this kind of game. So many memorable and awesome scripted moments like jumping from the crane, sliding down a building, riding on top of a train etc. The level design is so well done, it creates a great environment for you to free run across both indoor and outdoor. A big complaint I hear is the combat but I personally love it. I always got in the rhythm of disarming the first guy I see and using his gun to take out the others and I really enjoyed the brief moments I got to use a gun it was so much fun. The graphics, art style and soundtrack is all amazing. The only thing that keeps it from being a masterpiece is the story and characters. Both boring and uninteresting to say the least. Luckily it’s not a very big focus of the game. 9/10 (Amazing)			"

												I bought this game really wanting to love it. The concept of parkour and run-and-gun gameplay sounds great on paper, but its execution in Mirror's Edge is questionable. The story is boring and the voice acting, while not the most dreadful I've heard, is still pretty bland. The ending was incredibly rushed and there was practically no substance or depth throughout the plot.The parkour mechanics work and do pump some adrenaline in your gaming veins (I also have a phobia of heights, so it was kinda fun in that sense). There are moments where Faith will unexpectedly not grab ledges (where your margin to grab onto one is pretty reasonable) and you will end up raging quite a bit when Faith will jump to a pipe but not grab it because you're SLIGHTLY off-centered. The game isn't broken per se, but it could've used a lot more work in regards to parkour fluidity and ledge detection.The enemy AI is incredibly dumb and unfair. All the ""blues"" do is charge towards you with a constant set of bullets, and snipers have 110% accuracy, even when you're in mid-air. The parry system works half the time since when enemies try to hit you it's always hard to see if the gun turns red (prompt to parry and take the gun). Headshots deal the same amount of damage as a shot to the torso. There is also ZERO variation in enemies. You can argue that they have different weapons and abilities but they all the feel the same; they're all male (except for that one exception), they all have guns, and they all charge towards you.The story is painfully predictable. Every ""twist"" I witnessed, I expected early on (the antagonists have the stereotypical ""this is how the world works bla bla bla"" attitude). Also, the game takes four hours to complete on NORMAL. The other hour I spent playing was me trying to escape the train section, which was absolutely pointless and unrewardingly difficult.BUT I did have fun with this game. The main parkour sections are well laid out and I did enjoy using different tactics to take down enemies. The visuals are refreshing and the environments feel very open (albeit a little repetitive). The textures are appropriately saturated and detailed.I can only give this game a maximum of 6 out of 10, and can only recommend Mirror's Edge to people who don't mind trying retracing their steps multiple times. I am looking forward to Mirror's Edge Catalyst, hoping some of my issues with this installment will be fixed for the sequel.			"

												Let me tell you something about Celeste Wilson. We were close friends in Mercurys lair. I know, right? It's so embarrassing. I don't even... Whatever. So then a month later, I started going out with my first city officer Miller who was totally gorgeous but then he moved to New Eden, and Celeste was like, weirdly jealous of him. Like, if I would blow her off to meet with Miller, she'd be like, ""Why didn't you invite me with?"" And I'd be like, ""Why are you so obsessed with me?"" So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls runner party, I was like, ""Celeste, I can't invite you, because I think you're lesbian."" I mean I couldn't have a lesbian at my party. There were gonna be girls there in their *Spandex*. I mean, right? She was a LESBIAN. So Celeste called Mercury and started yelling at him, it was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And then she dropped out of Mercurys group because no one would talk to her, and she came back in the fall after Kate was arrested, She was wearing some tight bodysuit and mask and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on working with Project Icarus..

												I've played this game many times, beaten it just as much too (only if Faith was acting up ;) ), not once got bored.However it seemed the more that I played it, the less focussed I was in getting to the ending. Instead I just runned around, jumped on and off things, trying to find hidden, secret places and spots where you just weren't suppossed to be.All in all this game was fun.Pros:------ Great graphics, the fact that there mainly are 3 prevailing colors (white, red and blue) just give it an unique feel- Intense moments, when jumping from building to building not trying to fall face first onto the pavement 30stories    below always gets my heart going- Not action oriented, I know some games that are the same yet are filled with action like you're suppossed to be some kind of surgeon yet you have to kill a bunch of aliens everytime you go to work. This game doesn't Faith isn't a fighter and even though you can partipate in the action, it usually is better if you don't because you will have to retry several times.- Nice open feel. Again I know a lot of games that claim to have the same yet you are kept on a short leash the entire time. Here you can but not always, goof around, trying to find the obscure runner bags which I still haven't found all of. But I remember this one time when some freak glitch happened and I had managed to get on street level, some weird...things happen down there.- Fluent control. Well at least most of the times, sometimes you'll run so fast and nail that perfect jump with the even more perfect landing. While other times, you'll get fried on some electric fences or take the one-way-express-elevator down. But working on your ingame parcour skills is what's most fun, doing all your moves in superspeed and getting from A to B in the quickest and most dangerous way possibleBut no game is perfectCons:------- Confusing level design. Or maybe it's only me, but first time playing it I got stuck a lot. Didn't know where to go, sometimes I could spent up to an hour searching for where I was suppossed to go, other times there was an added pressure because I was being chased by a lot of guys with guns. I only had my feet...they are not faster than a hailstorm of bullets. When I haven't played it in a year I forget I run in the same problems, only they don't take as long anymore.- Restrictions. Yes what I said earlier about open feel is still true, yet it isn't open world or sandbox. But it should've been, you can goof around as much as you like but you can't go further than the game lets you each level. You still have to go from A to B, how you do is up to you.- Action. Must be a first for me where I actually think the action is kinda...forced, phoned in. Don't get me wrong, the action is fun, but this isn't an FPS. So therefor it shouldn't feel like one, there are some moments in the game when you are forced to pick up a gun and shoot someone. Like I said earlier, Faith isn't a fighter yet she can use 9mms, shotguns, sniper rifles and heavy machine guns all with deadly accuracy. But you will run slower with a gun and you can't mount objects either, you can I supposse avoid most if not all combat situations but for me it shouldn't even have been in there.- Difficulty. This game can be pretty hard, but my point is actually at a more personal level. I don't expect that anyone agrees with me over this it's just me. I don't like the fact that in a higher difficulty setting 'Runner Vision' gets turned off. For those that don't know, any object you can use to get to your objective becomes red. This is the games way of saying, you need to use this. I understand without this vision the game becomes harder but for me not seeing splashes of red in a sea of whiteness destroys the entire game's feel. I really like the abscenes of most colors, everytime you see any other color it looks a bit odd because of it. But in the end this won't affect the scoring in anyway.- Length. This game is too short! It's really short, you'll have fun, you'll get stuck, you'll be back on your way and then it's done.Would I recommend this? Yes of course, if you actually had read any of it you wouldn't even be asking.Overall score I'd give it an 8/10 for being a great game, in this world where they are but a few.			"

												Mirror's Edge is an FPS set in a big city where Runners transport sensitive data across the city whilst avoiding the opposing forces of the law. Instead of relying on weapons, the theme in this game is set on outrunning your enemies. While the game is a bit dated, it is still a highly appreciated classic found in almost every common Steam user's library.PROS:+ Great freerunning adventure+ Nice and colourful graphics+ Fluent movement control+ Built-in speedrun option+ Replay value due remembering the paths and being able to do it fasterCONS:- The story is somewhat shallow- Sometimes the game focusses on a tricky jump rather than a parcour- Finding out where to go can be a little irritating at timesMy rating: 8/10			"

												*tldr* its like... its like... well i guess dying light but with no zombies or open world. prime game?this is a very unique game. there are few games that have attempted this style. that may be because its hard to get it right. your in first person and the main mechanic is free running. the challenge is you cant see your feet which makes it hard to judge when to jump. the first time i beat this game i remember thinking dang this was unique and fun. playing it again i would say its rare for a reason. that's not to say it wasn't fun or good. i'm just glad too many games haven't badly blundered through this genera. clunky comes to mind when looking for adjectives to describe the control's. when your cooking along and really chugging through the rooftops if feels great and is really fun. the puzzles though should be the most intriguing part and unfortunately is where the clumsiness comes in. they aren't just challenging. challenging implies that every thing is stack equally against you. the controls seem to work when they want to. sometimes faith will grab the ledge you want her to and other times she doesn't. its frustrating because the game is really fun and i do recommended it but i really struggled to slog through to the end. the story is not bad. its not super memorable and it really feels like they were setting up for another game that never came. i know it sounds like I'm complaining allot but its because i really liked them game. i'm hoping they make more in the series but i hope they listen to feed back.

												I do not know any other parkour games than this one. So i can not make any comparisons and i may not be objective. But i will try.Mirrors edge was a ground braking game back when it was released. A brand new concept for its time. So i think even if the story is cliche and short (4 hours is enough tom complete) and police is heroicly good at shooting and you are feeling puzzled more than a runner, the game deserves a recommended vote. Today there may be other parkour like games better than this but it does not mean no one is gonna enjoy this one.I tried to mention cons and here are the pros: The environment look nice, the sounds are realistic and you can realy feel you are running on top of the buildings. However there are plenty of obstacles to go over while you are running, the free run feeling is satisfying enough. If there were no walls or fences, the game would be a ""Run Like Hell"" game :DThere are challenges to spend time. If you are not a fan of parkouring, this gets boring. You can challenge online people if you can find. Or race with their ghosts. Game is not much optimized but not the worst either.So i recommend this game because it was aground braking idea. But you can wait for the sequal too. Remember the story is 4 hours long and it is not only about running. Most of the time, running for your life.			"

												MIrror's edge is a parkour/running game where you are basically a courier trying to deliver something and tring to avoid trouble. The game progresses through a decently compelling story and requires faster reflexes and knowledge of possible moves as the story unfolds. The environment is nicely crafted and the controls and movement are smooth. I would recommend this to anybody who even just vaguely likes the parkour genre as Mirror's Edge was litearlly the defining game of the genre.Rating: 8.0/10			"

												My review feels more ""meh"" then anything, when finishing this game. As discussing with my roommate, the idea and premise behind is cool, but the combat is lackluster, and you spend a lot of time in combat or running from it. The story has plot holes, character models don't have more than one outfit in the story. The game is pretty and there are times when I get lost in the focus of freerunning, but more often than not, you will be frustrated by trying to deal with combat, or not being sure how to get to your next objective. If you can find it heavily discounted, you might find some fun in it, but would not recommend it at full price.			"

												First person parkour bursting with vibrant colors. Controls can be finicky at times (using keyboard and mouse), but the overall experience is rewarding, as long as the game does not require you to engage in combat situations. Punching, kicking, and shooting are in fact not very satisfying. Luckily, you will mostly be running, jumping, climbing, sliding, and swinging. There are plenty of opportunities for taking stylish screenshots while touring rooftops, construction sites, deserted office spaces, and underground levels.			"

												This is my new favorite power-fantasy game.  It's not an objectively good game, but just from personal taste, I love it.  It really goes all-out with the first person view, most immersive I've seen without a VR headset.  I've always wanted a game where I can walljump or roll in first person, and now I have it!  Faith's acrobatics *feel* more powerful than pretty much any shoot-em-up or stab-em-up, it's simultaneously lower-power and way more superpowered than anything you can pull off in Skyrim.  The fight sequences aren't too exciting, but it's a really nice change to disarm enemies with good timing (and then throw away the gun because seriously who needs guns) instead of blowing them away.  Of course you don't have to throw away those guns, I'm sure my playthrough would have been a lot easier if I wasn't playing pacifist, but it felt more natural that way.  Weird.It's your standard Prince of Persia jumping-puzzle fare, which means there's spots that can be really frustrating to get through, but that only caught me a couple times.  Checkpoints are pretty liberal, so getting stuck is always ""Getting past this part is hard"", not ""great, I need to backtrack through half the level again"".Other comments...well, it's always nice having games with female protagonists and no romantic subplots.  The game feels a little short, but it was worthwhile, it didn't feel tedious.  There's hidden collectables (like pretty much every Prince of Persia style game) but there's not a whole lot; completionists won't lose whole weeks of their life over it, thank God.  It doesn't have achievements, which is really annoying considering that the console versions did get them.  Despite the fact that it's a console port though, the controls still feel simple and natural.  Fascinating bold use of colors in the game, I liked it a lot aesthetically.So, yeah.  In summary, it has cool aesthetics, and it makes you feel like a superhero more than any superhero game.  Very worthwhile diversion that won't eat up a lot of time.			"

												Great game for a change of pace from most others. I have played through it many times since owning it because I will just reinstall it about every year to play through it again. It's not worth the $20 it seems to be at for base price but pick it up on a sale and you will not be disappointed.Try plaing through the storyline a few times, get good at each chapter and try and remember where to go. Then make sure a friend does the exact same thing. Get your computers in the same room (Or you can just use volice chat) and start the game up and select the hardest mode. Now race each other through the storyline and see who wins. I have done this with a friend on a few games and it is a lot of fun. Bet something if you would like. Makes a cheap but fun game even more worth the price.			"

												Few games give people a lot of freedom of movement or the feeling of fluidity as they transition from one area to the next. Mirror's Edge, on the other hand, makes it all effortless and smooth. No other game has made me feel quite as mobile and agile as controlling Faith as she moves across the rooftops.Faith can stop and fight if she really wants to, and she'll do alright at it. However, the game gives us a second and often wiser choice: run away. Faith moves faster and better than any other enemy in the game, so the cops can't catch her once she's past. As in Thief and Dishonoured, it's possible to play through with minimal combat, though it's arguably a lot easier to do in Mirror's Edge. This isn't a combat game at heart.I like games that try to do something different, and I especially like games that succeed. Mirror's Edge shows that a game can be all about movement, to the point that combat, though present, is largely unnecessary.			"

The other half with the shooting and the combat, didn't really fit in it... I know it's one of the biggest complaints here and I add my voice to it with full agreement.

  Feature Y/N/Rating   SLI Yes   Framerate Cap 120-144+ *   FOV 32-110+ *   Key Rebinding Yes   Options Minimal   Performance Good/Great * = Needs Basic Unreal Engine 3 Config File Tweak - See PCGamingWiki.com/wiki/Mirror's_EdgePC Port QualityIt's a UE3 game, which are usually great or only have small issues than can be fixed in the generic UE3 config files. Side note, in the bindings file where you add in Numpad binds for FOV changing, you can also add in various cheat, camera, and level-unlock commands. The in-game mapping is basic but definitely capable for the amount of inputs the game calls for. I've found the game to crash if you Alt-Tab, and the main menu isn't amazingly responsive, but other then that, the performance is great. You may need to rename one file to improve Physx performance though, details on the wiki above. The game feels great with mouse and keyboard, and it's extremely satisfying and comfortable with an FOV suited to your viewing angle. The game is just shy of 7 years old, but most of it's environments are astoundingly beautiful, especially in motion. It doesn't have that sheen and insane dynamic lighting effects that some brand new titles have, but I have no qualms about it's appearance even today. I'm very strict, and I have surprisingly few issues with the port, largely because of the games limited scope and it's engine.GameplayThere's honestly nothing like it. Certain games have used small parts of it's movement systems years after it's release, but none I'm aware of other than a small indie title or two have focused purely on it. There are some small frustrating sections involving guns, but they can largely be avoided. At it's core it's a navigation/exploration focused first person platforming game, and it's atmosphere is incredible. There are many sections with a calm and quiet ambiance that are a joy to experience, but simultaneously, it's really suited to speedrunning and it rewards memorizing the routes. You can even go further, learning shortcuts across a wide range of difficulty, and nailing them in one run is extremely satisfying. There are even modes suited to this, allowing you to run both entire levels and specified routes through various areas that often differ from what you might have seen through the game initially. Certain sections of the game, like the very last section of the game, are b-lined through under a time restriction with enemies, so it's great to be able to experiment and play in those areas without restrictions. Sadly, not ALL of the most interesting areas of the game were included within the time trial mode. If all else fails, you could toggle god mode with a hotkey, clear the enemies, and fool around from there. I do wish the game avoided combat scenarios entirely, and that there was a quick-save option to allow quick experimentation within levels.The cutscenes are of two types. 2D animations in a unique style, as well as small moments in first person that transition right from play. They are okay, but they are sometimes awkward and are the clearest example of the game's limited budget. I feel the game could have benefited instead from Half-Life style scenes where you remain largely in control. Similarly, I feel the game could have also benefited from some optional areas to explore, again in the style of Portal 2 and Half-Life. Forcing the player to look through desks for a key would be needless and annoying for speedrunning, but optional areas to explore and search through, possibly for some voiced exposition/thoughts from Faith, the player character.TLDR - SummaryDon't let my hours played fool you, this is one of my favorite games of all time. I played the game on both 360 and PS3 for hundreds of hours, and then again multiple times outside of steam over on origin. It's not brand spanking new, and could benefit from some more interesting modes as well as some additional convenience features, but the core gameplay is beyond satisfying and incredibly unique. I felt exposition was largely lacking and rarely memorable, the locations however will be familiar for a long time. A common issue with games this age and older, is a case of rose tinted glasses. The shocking thing here, is that for this game I've found the opposite to be true. The game now at 120FPS, maxed out with SweetFX is extremely easy to achieve in terms of hardware, and that combined with the switch to mouse and keyboard controls with a higher FOV, make the game far more beautiful, comfortable, and satisfying than I ever remember it being. As I said the cutscenes and certain combat sequences aren't great, but I've known that from the beginning.The game frequently goes on sale on both Steam and Origin, and has been in two Humble Bundles as well, and I completely recommend buying and playing it when it does. The sequel is set to release soon, and I hope more than anything that they can do the original justice. It looks promising thus-far.			"

												One of the only games in the genre, this first-person parkour game does something almost unique. The graphics are bright and blooming with futuristic white buildings which have aged well on the older game. The parkour can at times feel a bit clunky, but once you get the hang of it you'll be racing across rooftops easily, which is where the bulk of this game's fun is. This game is also a must-play for speedrunners, as I can easily imagine all kinds of little tricks you can do to shave off more and more time in-game.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a first person running game developed by DICE. You play as Faith, a free runner. The story is set in a modern utopian society with a totalitarian government. Invasive surveillance is a part of life in this city and runners help exchange information between parties without getting caught.Gameplay is the most admirable aspect, its not perfect but its very innovative and first of its kind. I was skeptical of how the game is going on handle. I am glad that DICE persisted with the first person perspective because Mirror's Edge is very unique.Graphics are good enough, some of the views from the tall buildings are beautiful and vertigo inducing. During the frantic chase sequences when there is a real rush to escape, vision tends to get a little blurry by the edges when leapt over rooftops and I could feel my stomach lurch forward at times. Playing this on my 24 inch monitor at 1920x1200 at highest settings with PhysX enabled is real treat. On the flip side, Mirror's Edge can be frustrating in spite of DICE getting all the hard parts right. They made a game that handles free running extremely well. I never found the camera to be a problem and the controls on the PC are great. I loved the the chase sequences and getting the stunts right is not very difficult. The is hurt mainly by some intentional bad design choices - the scourge of all games. Weapons are extremely weak, it reminded me of Tomb Raider Legend and not in a good way - those of you who played it would know the reference, and melee combat is frustrating and unsatisfying. This only serves to break the momentum needlessly and seemed like an after thought. DICE have developed Battlefield games, so its not as if they are inexperienced in first person shooters, yet the gunplay in Mirror's Edge is very inadequate. I would recommend playing the game on Easy setting to avoid the frustration of combat.Also, the game is quite short. On Easy I finished the game in about 6 hours. For a free running game to be truly effective, it must have the feel of an open city where the gameplay is not restrictive. I can understand that at times this might be necessary, but throughout the game, you will be in a huge city, which you cannot explore and the path is very linear - just like an old platformer. + Visuals+ Brilliant soundtrack+ Decent story telling+ Some segments are truly breathtaking+ Tight controls- Very weak combat- Crappy 2D cut scenes- Short			"

Gotta Go FastMirror's Edge is a first-person, parkour, kind-of-shooter, where you run, jump, kick and punch LIKE A BOSS! The design of Mirror's Edge is resembling a futuristic city, where running is not allowed. Mirror's Edge is a beautiful, well built, HD graphic game where punching and kicking people off a building is the best fun you can have.Mirror's Edge is a really good game, althouhg it gets a bit boring with the drills that Celeste teachs you, and when she lets you borrow her gun, you cannot kill her. But, this is easy overriden by the levels to follow after. Ziplining in it just makes you feel pure awesome. If you want to get the most out of this game, you should pick up an Oculus Rift to feel like you are actually Faith, jumping over fences, dodging bullets from cops and helicopters, and recreating the ""This is Sparta"" scene.You are bound to have the absolute best experience of your life in this game.Oculus Rift not included8.5/10 "

												Игра Mirror's edge одна из запоминающихся игр. В игре действие происходит от первого лица, причем эффект присутствия выражается в полной мере, особенно когда персонаж падает куда-то. Игра - это почти один сплошной плюс, минусов не много. Начинается необычно, как будто на тренировке. Присутствуют элементы паркура, что на мой взгляд очень актуально, играется на одном дыхании. В Mirror's edge нет никаких аптечек, брони и тому подобного, вполне реальный сюжет, нет двадцати пушек за спиной, только одна.			"

Or atleast seems colorful when everything is white expect the office rooms. It looks really darn cool. I wonder how does it have such graphics because it was published before 2009. - It's quite fast based and interesting. The story however was a bit strange.It's quite okay. 3/5			"

												This is the game that would be called a masterpiece, and a prime example used to demonstrate that video games can truly be viewed as art if not for some of its technicalities. Unfortunately, its combat mechanics and generic story hold it back from what is an absolutely beautiful world. The scenery and atmosphere is astonishing, and roaming this world feels like a genuine adventure in physical endurance. Despite some of the flaws noted above, it's a great game even as is, but close to what with more creativity and thought could have been the game of the decade.			"

												Very fun parkour game with some combat elements.This game is really short though, so I recommand only picking it up when it's on sale.Some of the complaints vs. my experiences:- ""Combat is wonky""-> True, but this is not a fighting game, if you run past the enemies and try to escape, it adds some pressure, making it possibly more challenging.- ""Parkour under pressure is not fun""-> Dunno, I had a lot of fun trying to figure out a route while being chased. Had something of a movie.- ""Enemies either cannot hit you when you are standing right in front of them or snipe you over 500 miles""-> True, but to be more specific: When the game wants to push you or hold you out of a specific area (e.g. if you try leaving the map) enemies become deadly accurate. That way you stay on track and don't try to fight your way out. And that not every enemy is deadly accurate is actually a good thing, don't you think ;)- ""bah too much gun figthing""-> Well, it is a game taking place in a distopian future and you are on the other side of the law. As I said, 90% of the time you shouldn't and in most of the other cases you don't need to engage in fights.			"

You go on an epic journey to find who framed your sister, lifting all the charges and showing the world she is innocent.Pros:+ Really nice Grafics and Environment+ Epic Parkour+ Runs pretty well on bad computers+ A really nice storylineCons:- I think this game wasnt made for the character to use guns, its another element on the game wich adds more diversity but I dont think It works that well.- Not sure if its really a con but short story I would love if there was more too it.TLDR: Buy It its worth it.

												One of the only games in the genre, this first-person parkour game does something almost unique. The graphics are bright and blooming with futuristic white buildings which have aged well on the older game. The parkour can at times feel a bit clunky, but once you get the hang of it you'll be racing across rooftops easily, which is where the bulk of this game's fun is. This game is also a must-play for speedrunners, as I can easily imagine all kinds of little tricks you can do to shave off more and more time in-game.			"

PresentationMirror's Edge is unique, fast and unforgiving, putting you in a strict governmentally-controlled city where the ""Blues"" are controlling everything and the only group standing between them and the total control of the city are the ""Runners"", highly trained and fast free runners that are doing their best to avoid the blues for as long as they can and live from the shadows, undisturbed by the oppression of the blues, which seemed to work just fine. You play as Faith, a young girl who was trained to become a runner after her mother died in what was the last attempt of revolution, and whose only relative that she cares about is her sister, a cop who was framed for the murder of the only man capable to make a chance, Robert Pope who was soon to become the new mayor of the city. She then starts a mission of clearing her name and finding the ones who were truly behind the assassination as it is not only about her sister going to jail, but also about the future of the city which now seemed to remain under totalitarian oppression for a long time. This game isn't your typical open-world adventure, mostly because it isn't exactly open world: you can always see the city and how big it truly is, but you are limited to the area where you current task is, simply because you will spend most of your time jumping from a rooftop to another, and reaching to a different direction than the one where your objective is, is impossible. This isn't a bad thing, as the game will automatically move you from one area to another as the story progresses and even with its limitations you can still choose which route to take, even though sometimes the obvious one is the only one available. The universe created for this game and the possibilities are enormous, however it never reaches its full potential; the campaign is indeed a powerful story about family and honesty, but the anime cutscenes between missions don't favour the plot at all, as they are merely dialogues between a few characters with some movement that most often feels out of place. The cast of characters is also impressive, but in the same way it feels disappointing as you never get to meet all of the runners and find more about their stories or the previous events and the conversations that you do have are just small talk without anything interesting to say that would affect your view of Mirror's Edge' universe.Rating: 7.5GameplayThe entire city is made to be your playground and so the game chooses to focus on just a few primary colours, with the white being predominant for almost anything around you, using red for objects that you may interact with and blue or green for secondary objects that are not necessarily a part of the free-running concept. Using this mechanic, the game manages to deliver a fast phased gameplay where the colours are your guiding instruments, but can sometimes become your disorientation tools as well as some objects such as stairs which will always be painted in red can be put on top of some cranes which will also be painted in red, making it hard to see where the stair is. Aside from those small issues that are isolated to certain areas only, the free running mechanic runs smoothly and the entire game takes no more than five buttons + directions to control, making it easy to move fast as the game originally intended. Aside from the free running, there are certain shooting sequences where you must disarm one of the opponents and use his weapon to kill the others, and even though those work just as smoothly, they are not the thing that makes this game shine, but thankfully some of them are optional as you can avoid certain encounter with the enemies pursuing you and those that are however mandatory will be over before you know it. Throughout the game you will use almost any combination of parkour manoeuvres, from wall jumps to flips, dodges and lots of jumping, and even though at first the entire thing will look hard to do at high speeds, once you get the hang of it you will amaze yourself with the tricks that you managed to pull off and a somehow impossible gap between building will suddenly become a piece of cake once you learn to use everything around you to your advantage. Aside from the free running that is exceptionally made, there is little to change the phase of the game, aside from turning a valve or pressing a button here and there in order to open a door and even though the hidden bags which act as the game's main and only collectible are a significant part of the game itself as you will be alerted by the game's logo on a wall when a bag is nearby, they will only distract you for a few seconds, and after that you're back to see where the story leads you.Rating: 8GraphicsMirror's Edge looks awesome without the smallest doubt and seeing the entire city from the rooftops is impressive, even though you can't access most of it, but for a short game that is meant to take you from one corner of the city to the next one the environments look pretty much the same wherever you go and that is mostly due to the heavy use of white and red to favour the gameplay and even thought it does look unique and amazing at first, seeing the same white and red everywhere you go will eventually make everything seem dull. The PhysX effects do a great job, making glass shatter in realistic ways and explosions or water effects look even more amazing, topping that off with the superb character design makes the game look beautiful wherever you go, no matter who you interact with.Rating: 8AudioThe game sounds as good as it looks, with effects realistic enough to make you feel each fall or wrong turn when you fail a jump and accidentally drop down a few meters or water splashes when you step into a puddle. The gun effects might not be as top notch as the ones you would see in a first person shooter, but they get the job done; the voice acting is decent, but aside from Faith you won't hear anything spectacular, and she doesn't even talk during the actual gameplay, only in cutscenes. The soundtrack is rhythmic with the action and always perfectly bonded with whatever is going on the screen, and the good part is that most of it will unlock as an extra once you finish the game so if you liked it you can listen to it how many times you want afterwards.Rating: 8ExtrasSadly, the entire campaign only takes around 5 hours to complete and even though you do have a time trial and a speed run mode, you only have the playgrounds from the campaign at your disposal, so you will eventually grow tired of running around the same tracks, but at least you have online and friends leaderboards, so you can brag about your scores.Rating: 6VerdictWith its minor flaws, Mirror's Edge is still a must play, especially for those in search of a unique, eye-view experience, but unfortunately the game will only last for a few hours and after that aside from the time trial and speed run modes that might keep you busy for a couple more hours at best, there is nothing else to do.Rating Overall: 7.5Check the full review and a lot more about Mirror's Edge at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=230 "

												What happens when a underground style gets so popular that even a game is made using its unique style? Mirror's Edge happened. With this said, let's begin, shall we?Graphics: Oh my god, i forgot how i used to love how Mirror's Edge looked like. It had a different visual style, using more red, blue and white than any other color. That's because it fuses together with the universe of the game and give a better personification of who are the heroes and the villains. More than that, textures and overall presentation were pretty sweet. Using PhysicX to make all the details (Grass breaking, heavy footsteeps and some animations) even more detailed was a nice touch and let us experience a game that, even tough is linear and not really open world, gives to the player the sensation of freedom.Gameplay: Mirror's Edge is like Sonic in first person. You will run and jump, but it also haves a variation of the many challenges/puzzles that you will have to do so you can arrive at your mission objective. The game did a good job at keep motion and mobility of parkour at the same time and it's pretty realistic. No ""you just din't survived this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; falls and no ""oh my god, my characther is so weak"", it's all up for the player's capacity of thinking fast and making the right decision to either escape from the police or pass through one of the challenges that i mentioned above.Gunplay is quite okay and, since you don't use it so much (Except for the final part of the game), it's okay for what this game is. The mechanic of making the characther heavier while carrying guns was rather annoying. Why does a single pistol weights so much that i can't even make a straight, low, jump with it? Damn. But i guess it was to keep the focus of the game: Fighting with your own hands and making your way using only your parkous abilities. A bit forced, but okay for me.Slow motion helps a lot, even more because you can use it on quick time events, and damn, they are fast. I'm pretty sure that there were times that i pushed the defense button but my characther just kept dun goofing. Weird, but passable.Level Design: Really love. Exploring for secrets, doing time runs and just playing the game for the sake of doing it feels good. All the levels maintain both the interest of the player and variation, always showing new challenges and different ways to use your parkous abilities to solve all the problems that you will face. Sometimes the jumps looks almost impossible, but it's all about using what the game will give you. Sometimes the answer is right in front of you, but you just can't see it. And as i said, combining it with the graphics, it gives the sensation of freedom to the play and always make you think that you're playing a open world game. Even if it's linear, i can remember of 2-3 that i could've taken another path to get to the same place, and it was a nice touch. It could've been more used through the game, but that doesn't take the bright of the effort put in the level design itself.Soundtrack: Calm while not being seen and really rock hard when being chased or something is happening in the story side of the game. It always add something to the gameplay and it's pretty neat to hear. Based Lisa Miskovsky (Still Alive, credits song).Story: Even so people said that this was the low point of the game, for it was actually a pretty good CONCEPT of a plot. Mirror's Edge isn't a game that tries to have a lot of twists or a complicated storyline, but it does haves a good plot to follow and it's enjoyable for what it is. I think i liked it for the fact of the animated scenes making me think that i was watching an Anime or maybe because i think the whole thing of ""Freedom To Spread Your Way Of Thinking"" gives the player a lot to think about. Even tough Faith and her sister are pretty much the only characters that will shine to you (Aside from the main villain, that, being pretty serious now, i din't liked that much), there are other ones that can be explored in the sequel (Confirmed by EA) and may gives new ways of creating plot devices and sub-stories. The universe is like a hole: The more you dig it, more sand you will have outside of it. I really hope that, since the next game in the series seems to be a open world one, that the NPCs will, at least, have a conection with the first one characters (Or just let them be the first game chracters already). TL;DR - Story had an amazing potential, but it was okay for what the first game tried to be.Overall, Mirror's Edge is one of a few DICE and EA Games that make it into my ""favorite games ever"" list. Not even Battlefield 2 made it into this one (And it's a pretty awesome shooter IMO). I guess it's because of how this game tried to change the way of using FPS and explored the many possibilites of using parkour in your favor as a game developer. I really hope that the sequel keeps the shine that i still can see in this gem and will be as good as the first one.If you are waiting for the second game, being afraid of buying the first one, please, don't. Even tough i think you really don't need to play it for the story, there's a lot in this game to see and explore. Even i keep revisiting this game from time to time, always surprising myself with something that i haven't seen before.			"

												Mirror's Edge ist ein simples wenn aber auch nicht ganz so leichtes Jump'n Run spiel.ERKLÄRUNG:In Mirro's Edge wird man in die Rolle der Runnerin Faith geschmissen. Am Anfang des Spieles wird dir die Aufgabe aufgetragen einen Hindernissparkour zu meister. Hört sich einfach an, ist es zu anfangs auch. Später werden die Level komplizierter, doch mehr dazu unter Gameplay. Jetzt werdet ihr euch denken: Aber was heißt das denn jetzt, Runner?Nun, die Runner sind eine der Zwei großen Gruppen in diesem Spiel. Dazu aber mehr im Storyabschnitt, welcher folgt.STORY:In Mirror's Edge befindet man sich in einer Stadt im Jahre 20XX. Diese Stadt wird (wie in de Story erklärt) bereits komplet t überwacht wird. Die meisten kommen damit klar, oder interessieren sich überhaupt nicht dafür. Die bereits gennanten Runner sind eine Gruppe die meistens im verdeckten Pakete etc. ausliefern. Die Polizei spielt hierbei natürlich auch eine Rolle. Denn die Polizei weiß von den Runner und wird natürlich alles erdenkliche probieren um euch im Spiel aufzuhalten.GAMEPLAY:Am Anfang vom Spiel wird man als erstes in einen Trainingskurs gesetzt weil die Hauptcharaktärin einen Unfall hatte.Hier lernt man zu Anfang viele verschiedene Gameplayelemete wie zum Beispiel: Wallrun, Abrollen (wird sehr wichtig im Verlauf des Spiels.) und andere auf Parkour bezogene Dinge. Die Steuerung ist nicht so schlimm wie manche behaupten und ich denke sogar ohne Gamepad besser.GRAFIK:Mirror's Edge benutzt einen Comic-Grafikstyle. Allgeimen sieht die Grafik aber ganz schön aus für das Jahr 2010FAZIT:Mirror's Edge ist ein sehr spannendes Spiel mit schöner Grafik, Soundtrack und mehr. Es lohnt sich wirklich für Fans von Parkour. Es hat so gut wie keine Bugs und läuft flüssig wenn man die PC anforderung erfüllt, oder überschreitet.Habt Spaß mit diesem Stück Software.			"

												Six years late, but better late than never. The combat and story are a little weak but I didn't buy this game for its combat and story. I bought it to do parkour and, oh my, is it a fantastic free running simulator. Once you get a feel for it, you can seamlessly scale walls, vault over obstacles and jump from building to building to reach your destination. The visuals holds up surprisingly well for a six year old game. The colors are vibrant and gives the game a distinct look. The soundtrack is amazing and really sets the atmosphere of the game. 10/10			"

												Nice looking game, but I felt the game play was annoying and repetitive. It's like ""parkour-hero"": mash the correct buttons, in the correct order, at the correct time and all is well. Miss one and the crowd goes boo and you get to restart the current obstacle course. To make matters worse, the protagonist frequently decides she would prefer to plummet to her death rather than grab a ledge - really fun stuff.As a falling to your death simulator: 10/10 - the bone crunching sounds are a nice touchAs a preview of Interior Design Concepts of the future: 8/10 As a game to play for fun 5/10 - only for a certain type of gamer; not this one.

												Definitly worth buying if you like parkour in general, the game has a unique style in both the graphics and the gameplay which makes it MY top favorite game at the moment.I definitly recommend it and i hope it'll be your favorite game too if you buy it!, also there's coming a Sequal Mirror's Edge Catalyst. And that's something to look forward on if you really love the game.The story line is very progressive but fun and adventurous in some ways but most of the time i enjoyed it was on the rooftops to see the world, unfortunatly it's not open world but in MEC there will be which is very great.9/10, no open world :( otherwise it's my top game.( Sorry for my grammar it's a bit bad i think idk i probably spelt wrong sometimes! ) "

												I hated the gameplay. It's very unclear. The controls are horrible and complex.But there's a couple of things I absolutely love about this.- It's colorful. Or atleast seems colorful when everything is white expect the office rooms. It looks really darn cool. I wonder how does it have such graphics because it was published before 2009. - It's quite fast based and interesting. The story however was a bit strange.It's quite okay. 3/5			"

												Very fun parkour game with some combat elements.This game is really short though, so I recommand only picking it up when it's on sale.Some of the complaints vs. my experiences:- ""Combat is wonky""-> True, but this is not a fighting game, if you run past the enemies and try to escape, it adds some pressure, making it possibly more challenging.- ""Parkour under pressure is not fun""-> Dunno, I had a lot of fun trying to figure out a route while being chased. Had something of a movie.- ""Enemies either cannot hit you when you are standing right in front of them or snipe you over 500 miles""-> True, but to be more specific: When the game wants to push you or hold you out of a specific area (e.g. if you try leaving the map) enemies become deadly accurate. That way you stay on track and don't try to fight your way out. And that not every enemy is deadly accurate is actually a good thing, don't you think ;)- ""bah too much gun figthing""-> Well, it is a game taking place in a distopian future and you are on the other side of the law. As I said, 90% of the time you shouldn't and in most of the other cases you don't need to engage in fights.			"

												Unique parkour game you will hardly find one like this.StoryYou are a Runner, an agile courier that transport data on the shadows, one day your sister is framed for a crime she didnt commit and now her fate is in your hands. You go on an epic journey to find who framed your sister, lifting all the charges and showing the world she is innocent.Pros:+ Really nice Grafics and Environment+ Epic Parkour+ Runs pretty well on bad computers+ A really nice storylineCons:- I think this game wasnt made for the character to use guns, its another element on the game wich adds more diversity but I dont think It works that well.- Not sure if its really a con but short story I would love if there was more too it.TLDR: Buy It its worth it. Second game is coming next year definitely going to buy it.			"

So here is what I recommend to you...1. Buy it on steam2. Play it for an hour and see if you like it3. Refund it4. If you didn't like it, then you dont have to keep following the steps, but if you did like it, make an origin user.5. Download origin for pc.6. Buy it on origin for much cheaper.There is my advice to you for when you buy this			"

												Firstly,just cause you play this doesn't mean you can ""Hardcore Parkour"" round town (unless you actually do that...)Mirrors Edge is visual minimalistic but still pretty to look at and play through in it's own right, some actions can seem a bit weird (i.e. jumping long distances or jumping walls you didn't intend on scaling), the game really centers more around the story and puzzle solving then combat, in fact the game seems almost opposed to you getting in any conflict other then the occational disarming pushing of enemies out of the way. lasting, it's very short; 4.5/5hrs max if you try to find all the secret/packages. If you can get this on sale grab it, if not really up to you if you to pay full-pop for suck a short play through time.			"

												I wish there was a neutral 50/50 option. Instead, I'll have to choose one which does not fully represent my impressions.To me this games looks more like a proof of concept, a competent experiment, rather than a full-fledged game. Its mechanics are rather simple, but it does not make the game easy. It has a full-on story, which is somewhat grim in contrast to stunning vibrant visuals. Oh, the visuals... Mirror's Edge looks gorgeous even in 2016, to me at least. Use of colour is brilliant and artists surely knew what they were doing. Music is great too, by the way, and complements the action greatly.So why did I choose to not recommend this game?From a parkour simulator I expected a bit more flow, a bit more uninterrupted motion. Due to level design choices it's only possible(at least it was for me me) when you replay the levels you have beaten previously, which is frankly not the thing I'd like to do. But then again, first-person platforming is not as well developed of a genre.And lastly, combat. The game actively discourages you from engaging in unnecessary sombat, to the point of being unfair, like deleting all loose guns and removing the one you held in your hands upon loading a checkpoint(checkpoint placement could be better in places, too). But still, for some reason I used every opportunity to kill 'blues' that I could. To me it was much more fun than avoiding them, and it clearly wasn't the intended way to beat this game.Still, if are interested in such sort of game and the pros outweigh the cons - go for it. It's a competent product overall which you might enjoy far more than I did.			"

												Pros:+ Fun, to a point + Enough time to get your money's worth (if you paid for it during the sale and not $20) + Graphics are good + Super simple, super linear (good for if you want a short, easy game)Cons:- super simple, super linear (hence it can get boring in one sitting)- the characters are also linear (not much development throughout the game)- the lag when shooters come out - the lag when Faith runs sometimes (your movements has to be onpoint for certain jump, runs, etc.)- Faith can jump ledges and run on walls but she can't jump a 2 feet vent- weird game logic (shooters hit you when you're far but their aim is as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as storm troopers when you're close)- the game is ""running"" centered but there's a lot of elements throughout the game that forces you to engage in combat, which kind of defeats the concept of being a runnerOverall the game is not that bad but it's not great either.

												This review is a bit late because I thought I wrote it but I had only made my preliminary notes on it while playing the game and hadn't ACTUALLY written my review, because I'm an idiot.Sorry guyzAnywho, Mirror's Edge follows Faith Connors through a narrow strip of the City of Glas, a setting which looks like it would be a beautiful open world type area, BUT we didn't get that until 2016 whenever Catalyst came out. Which was meant to be a sequel then a prequel and now is.... Kind of a prequel kind of a reboot, people are pretty divided. The point is the series has kind of been in development hell.Bellyaching about that aside, the game has a decent storyline which is told through these cartoony cinematics. Which was really different than most other games that had come out in 2009. This is good. The game, however, tries to tell a deep story with a lot of edgy characters with shady pasts that we don't get any kind of background on. And while this could be accomplished with 2D styled animation, it.... just doesn't fit in with the tone of the game. This is not so good. I can see why some people enjoyed it, but it didn't sit well imo. Let's talk about gameplay. I hope you like moving forward and occasionally telling Faith to jump or dash, then getting angry whenever she DOESN'T do what you said. As far as difficulty goes, there isn't much difficulty that can be attributed to anything other than glitchy gameplay.  I feel like the game also didn't know what it wanted to be. One second, you're running in a straight line, and the next minute, you're at a standstill trying to either sneak around enemies or getting shot at. To me it didn't flow very well, it felt choppy, like the true essence of the game was being stifled by the combat or puzzle platforming sections. Motion isn't fluid, it's like a river that has been dammed up, it still flows, but the flow is choppy at best.  As far as the story goes, it is shallow. The one twist in the game (which has been spoiled for pretty much anyone with an internet connection) can be EASILY seen coming. I purposefully avoided content pertaining to this game because I had beem told there was one twist in the entire game, and it would be spoiled really easily, and I STILL saw it coming. And usually, you feel satisfied with a game's ending. The story gets wrapped up all nice and pretty unless the devs KNOW there will be a followup. Not here though. The end, without spoiling anything, sets up for a sequel that never comes. The story doesn't start to get good until the last few chapters of the game, and then none of the questions that arise gets an actual legitimate answer. And my last gripe... THE ENTIRE GAME GETS RETCONNED. ""Oh but the devs wanted to go in a different direction."" I hear you say. ""But Pokemon Master 503, you loved Tomb Raider and it got retconned!"" NO THESE ARE NOT THE SAME SCENARIOS. Tomb Raider got retconned by DIFFERENT COMPANIES. Also, most games that get retconned HAVE MORE THAN ONE GAME IN THE FUDGING SERIES.As far as bang for your buck goes, this game doesn't really give it to you. It's a game based on speed, with time trials for all the chapters and everything, but other than going forward a la Sonic the HedgeHog, the gameplay doesn't really vary all that much. Granted there wasn't much gameplay to vary.. Ten hours is all it took for me to gain 100% completion. And while this would be okay with, say, an indie game, this game was a AAA title, with huge marketting behind it at the time. If I'm not mistaken, it sold for full price back in '09, and to me 10 hours of gameplay would NOT have been worth the full price tag. It's not even worth the current $20 price tag to be completely honest. If you're gonna pick up the game, pick it up on sale.Verdict, go play Catalyst. It's ten billion times better despite what IGN said.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a piece of art, but it isn't for me.  It plays like a very well-made indie game, and that's not so great for a AAA developer.The game has a very polished visual style, with lots of bright colors and good level composition.  There's something about it that reminds me of the Portal games.  Voice acting is passable, but after playing it you'll be hard put to say that there was even any music because it's so forgettable.  The story is... underdeveloped.  It's not bad, but it's short, predictable, and the Flash-player cutscene style contrasts too much with the visual design of the rest of the game.  The ending also sequel-baits pretty hard, so it loses points for that.  The parkour in the game, I have no doubt, was polished and maybe even revolutionary in 2008 when the game came out, but is now clunky and to some degree inconsistent compared to modern games like Dying Light which I have no doubt copied a great deal of their systems from Mirror's Edge.  When you're running around here, you feel heavy somehow, but I suppose that's just more realistic than other games with similar mechanics. There are three things that defeated my enjoyment of the parkour.  The first was a mostly garbage checkpoint system.  It isn't any secret that the game causes some degree of rage amongst players, but to me it ruined the flow a parkour game is supposed to have.  I would not have had a problem with this if %100 of my deaths were my fault, except...The second issue is that there are legitimate times when particular ledges or walls trip you up.  There are usually multiple causes for this.  In some cases, a degree of inches matters.  You jump too soon or at slightly the wrong angle, or without enough momentum you didn't know that you needed, and the game will screw you hardcore.  Sometimes there are spaces that you SHOULD be able to get around/onto, but it wasn't programmed into the game, resulting in you bouncing right off.  But, there were also a few times where the environmental design frankly just derped out with ""false edges."" Are the environments unnavigable?  No, of course not, many people have completed it just fine.  But you need to bend your expectations around the game's quirks more than you really should have to.  The third element that ruined the parkour for me is that it's all linear.  The game is on rails, and quite honestly that's a real shame for a game about climbing and freedom of movement.  There is exactly one way to proceed through the levels, and although I appreciated that you can hit Alt at any time to orient yourself on where you're trying to get to, this linearity greatly overshadowed my supposed freedom.  The combat is extremely basic, and you know, beyond the fact that the game included a way to induce bullet time because even it thinks that its own window for weapon disarms is too small, I don't expect a parkour game to have much more than is presented here.  My one gripe in this respect is that given how complicated the environments are, there are a lot of times when there's absolutely no way those pre-scripted enemies intercepted you that quickly.  It's great for keeping the pressure on the player, which is why they do it, but it's also fantastic at breaking immersion.  Even though I just♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the game, I don't hate it.  If you're still curious about it, go for it.  I'm just saying that there are reasons it goes on huge sales so frequently.			"

												NOTE: if you get this game, there's a glitch that can lag the game so it's impossibly slow. You CAN fix it by turning off PhysX and tweaking the graphics.I wish I could halfway recommend this. You know: not a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, but a thumb lying on its side.On the one hand, the feeling of successfully completing a level is incomparable. On the other hand, the dialogue's clunky and the combat's a mess. I ended up running the same narrow stretches over and over, chanting the sequence of moves: jump, slide, disarm, drop, wall-run, JUMP no JUMP no NOPE. And repeat. If you really like challenging platformers, this game may click for you. For me, frustration ultimately outweighed joy.			"

												I personally think that Mirror's Edge is a good game, let me tell you the Pros and Cons Pros [/b][/i]It has a fun story line.You get to do cool things.There are behind the scenes features, such as behind the scenes pictures,races and trailers. Cons [/b][/i]It is very short.It can be very hard at times.The characters cuss, which I am not very happy about.So that is what I think of Mirror's Edge. If you buy this game, stay fresh and have fun ;3. "

												Unique FP(s)Parkour action game that's adrenaline rush. Could've been much better if it didnt't have random accuracy ennemies(i swear they are either terrible, or too good).the game suffers from the same illness as assassin's creed 1; few object schemes, every building looks the same.Combat/fps modes could've been better.Otherwise, great game and definitly worth trying.Overall: 6.5/10. Seems low, not because it's bad, but because it's flawed.			"

												Wow what a fun game to play! I loved having the feeling of running between buildings and being able to do things that only happen in our dreams. I loved the controls on the PC, I just modified the controls to fit my style of play and there was no problems getting around. It is a very graphically beautiful and gives you the sense that you are actually in that location of the world. The buildings are high above the city and you really do have a great view when looking around. The action in the game is fun because you can disarm your enemies with quick reactions. There is a slow-mo part of the characters abilities were she can slow time down to be able to see movements of the enemies this is were she gets the ability to disarm them quickly. The story was alot of fun to follow and the cut-scenes looked like you were watching a good looking cartoon. This game is a thinking game and you have a couple of routes you can go to overcome particular parts each level. The overall game is amazing!			"

												Just finished my second playthrough of this game (first one was in 2012).This game has good graphic design, but bad game design. And the story sucks a lot.Unlockables are almost meaningless. There's even no achievements (though there are achievements on consoles, duh).And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ do this game enrages me sometimes. Especially the parts where you must fight the cops. Especially the cops with machineguns which kill you in, like, two hits.But the design is really really good.  And there's awesome music by Solar Fields.Worth trying.5/10.			"

												Just finished Mirror's Edge. What an unpolished disappointment. As the difficulty went up it became more apparent how sloppy the controls were. I like playing a game, but not where I need to fight with the controls to do what I wanted. There were times I was unsure what to do and in my opinion it was because of a lack of communication. Destroy the servers, okay, but I don't know what the servers were! How was I supposed to know I had to use a gun and not look for a switch in a game where you use a gun maybe 5% of the time? A decent romp but sloppy controls frustrated. I hope they make the combat more robust in the next one.			"

												Rating: 8.1/10Overview:Mirror's Edge was developed by DICE in 2009. It is an action/adventure first-person shooter parkour game.The game is based around the  female protagonist “Faith” who is part of a group of couriers called “runners” who carry packages around the city. Using their parkour skills, they avoid police by running along rooftops, sliding down rails and ziplines, bashing through doors, and jumping off walls.Gameplay:I played this game using an Xbox 360 controller which synced all controls instantly. The controls and game feel like they were made for a controller. The movements are very fluid, the button setup is flawless, and it all feels natural in your hands.  Graphically, it is a masterpiece of its own.  It has a beautiful art style with graphics matching the time of the game’s release. The soundtrack matched the game very well; exciting and fast paced when it needed and slow melodies to soak in the beautiful cityscape.  The game itself was fun. It had its fair share of puzzles and fights that required the use of its multi-button parkour system. There were almost always multiple routes the any destination. The only downside to the style of gameplay was that at times it felt repetitive. It doesn’t give the desire to keep playing until the end, but still exciting enough to beat the game.Price: $4.99 during Winter sale. $19.99 regularly. Absolutely worth the price on sale. But I would still say the game is worth $15.Conclusion:A must play. This game is fun and exciting with a one of a kind style.  A controller is recommended. This is recommended for anyone who enjoys FPS, puzzles, or the idea of doing parkour and become a street ninja without actually risking their life.Price: 9 (on sale)Graphics: 8Story: 7Gameplay: 7Controls: 9Enjoyment: 8Concept: 8Music: 9			"

												DISCLAIMER: Don't pay full price.I feel like I will leave that disclaimer at the top of many other Recommendations from here until forever.While Mirror's Edge is a beautiful and fun game, it is not worth the full money either. Well, perhaps it is, depending on your interests. Call me a Scrooge, if you will.But I found the game terrifyingly short as I beat it in a few hours, and neither the time trials nor returning to the story for the collectibles really make me want to keep playing, so I find no replayability either. Hence, I believe it lacks enough to justify the full price tag.However, the game is definitely worth playing and it's very fun. The parkour style running is interestingly done and lends to puzzle-like rooms very well, often livening up the game instead of making you simply run down a hallway over and over. The combat isn't too great, but it's not really a combat-oriented game, though I did like that sewer section where you can snipe at the guys in the tunnels.As I said already, the game is also beautiful. Man, it may kill your machine if you don't have something new. I have a newer laptop which is able to handle quite a lot of gaming, actually, but full graphics on this game would make it churn heat like no other. It still ran beautifully, though, even with all of the settings maxed out, with the exception of a few places here and there which would lag the game into oblivion. Oddly enough, most of those sections didn't seem to have anything around that made sense with the lag, as I couldn't figure out why the game would die out in an empty hallway, for instance.In any case, if you've been interested in the game, certainly purchase it on sale. I never thought I'd play it and eventually I bit the bullet and got it. I'm glad I did.			"

												(WARNING: Deep and meaningful review incoming that may be long that only talks about the aesthetics of the game and NOT gameplay)It may have taken only a small while to complete (I've had it on the 360 years before I had it on Steam), but for a short game, this is now one of my all time favorites. Why you may ask? Is it the story? Not really. The Gameplay? Well, yes, it's nice and all. What the hell is it I hear you ask? Well, this game, this little gem in the gaming world is something I like to refer to as 'aesthetically pleasing'. The beauty of this game is something that's inspired me and gave me a new view on the world and life, but I won't bore you with what I believe in and all that. Take at look at the images on this game, see the colour schemes? That's right. There's only really ever 2-3 colours at a time most of the time. Everything is mostly white, but there are some positive colours as well. Like orange, green and blue. This use of colours just... relaxes me. The city in which this game takes place is unknown, no name. All there is to suggest where this city is, is a clock within the game that shows an American timezone, Seattle, to be more precise. This whole game, the way the world is presented makes me believe that there is a future without a gloomy outcome. I personally believe all cities should look like the one in this game. Even more so like how this very same city is shown in Mirror's Edge 2. In the 2nd game which isn't out until late 2015 to Spring 2016, the city looks way better and more like how I would want an ideal city to be like. It is so peaceful. It shows safety, order and peace. I'm not sure how to describe it. The city in this game is so... its just 'aesthetically pleasing'. The city shows progress and that humans can craft such wonderful things. Look at the trailer for the 2nd one:

This is how I see the future (ignore the fighting scenese and all that). Focus on the music and visuals more. Most notably the 0:57 part and onwards. This. This is what I see as beauty. And with Mirror's Edge 1, you will get that! And hopefully the same with the second one. There is a character in this game called Miller. If you look at his uniform, look how classy it is! That attire is just... it matches the world so much! The guards uniforms too!Same goes for the music. The music is just... it does the city and game justice. It makes me see a brighter future. I don't know. I probably sound like a crack-head right now, but this game is just SO. DAMNED. BEAUTIFUL.The music is so relaxing and makes me think of a brighter future without fighting and whatnot. Well, that's the end. I'm sorry I didn't talk about gameplay, but that's not what I wanted to talk about. I'm sure others have JUST talked about the gameplay. Few have talked about the game as a form of... 'art'? Maybe 'art' is too much. Well, for others at least. I personally think this game is art in terms of visuals.Thanks for reading. Sorry for any spelling mistakes too. *bows like a boss as curtains fall and roses get thrown on the Steam stage*P.S. Back when DICE could make games and EA could publish them. Let's hope ('I' hope) they do a fantastic job on the second one! By the trailer, everything still feels like Mirror's Edge!			"

												I dont know what else to say after this but... beauty flows in this games every corner and is an awesome experience due to the movement and combat system. Only downside I can find may be that the game is maybe a little short-ish but still a wonderful one. Pick it up even at 10€ price or in sale since money that goes to EA from this is rightfully earned there!6/5 Waiting for the sequel in 2016!!!			"

												The game was okay in some parts. The story was really short, and the gameplay controls are insanely clunky and you have to be insanely precise. I loved the story line though, even though it was quick, and not a slow approach. I liked the maps, the gameplay, and the character. 7/10. Needs work.			"

												here is a gem of a game that somehow went under my radarMirror's Edge is a gem of its own,featuring an unique artstyle that we haven't seen before,a mixture of Cel Shading and Anime. combined with a parkour mechanic that pays homage to Prince of Persia Sands of Time.You are Faith,a Runner on a city where all information is controlled and observed. Your sister is framed for murdering the mayoral candidate: Robert Pope, and now you must save her and find the true culprit.featuring a really satisfying parkour mechanic,excellent visuals and sound design Mirror's Edge is an adventure you shouldn't miss,the only gripe i have about this game would be its length,i took 5 hours to complete the single player campaign,wishing for more parkour action,but after all we are all in the edge,the question is when will we jump?

												This game...this game....it's ok I suppose..............nah i'll explain why.PROS:Free running: When I heard about this I had thought that someone actually made a game that a lot of people would enjoy, well it kind of went everywhere on this.Characters: All of the characters you meet in Mirrors Edge are actually part of the story, not one of them feels really left out as far as I know.Story: The story felt pretty good, I didn't really seem to miss out on anything, it all made sense, atleast until the end though, I ended up forgetting or maybe not knowing why *Spoiler* Faith's sister was being dragged away by a bloody helicopter though.Fighting: The fighting in this game is a little simple but that's why I like it, it's either counter, punching, or GLACK GLACK GLACK GLACK with guns the whole time.Well that's all I can think of for pros...CONS:Free running: This feels a little glitchy at times, it works well yes but on the (I want to say skyscraper level) where you have to go through all of this construction part I ended up getting really glitched because Faith wouldn't grab onto some of the ledges or pipes to swing but when I did it another time she seemed to do it just fine.Sight Seeing Tour: This entire game isn't free roaming like I was hoping, it's just a f*%king sight seeing tour, it's way too linear, when I thought of free running I expected I don't know FREE ROAMING?!  All of those big and shiny buildings that looks just perfect for running on are basically just there to oogle and not to interact with, it's like a strip club.Fighting: This game doesn't know what it wants to do sometimes, sometimes it says to run away and others it says to kill them all, make up your mind Mirrors Edge it's either one or the other not both.Quick time events: This is kind of crowbared in you could say, you have to hit a button when a enemy tries to melee you, when you hit the button is when their gun turns red, but it's hard to get it right, the slow down is very useful but jesus christ does the slow down take forever to get out, and it's very very slow, why not just slow down a little bit that way it will still be challenging but it won't lose it's flow at the same time?Slow turning: What I mean by this is the slow head turning you have to do on ledges or pipes, yeah it's fine but seriously Faith TURN YOUR DAMN HEAD ALREADY.  It doesn't take 5 seconds to do that it takes half a second to.Red Vision: This was kind of annoying, if you got lost the red colored objects mean to use this, but sometimes there wasn't any AT ALL telling you where to go and it got annoying running around the place trying to find out what you had to do.Well that's all I can think of...the game gets a 6/10 for me, many things I was hoping for got destroyed but then again this is EA we are talking about, and they can't do anything too well.Is this game worth it as it sits? NO. Is it worth it on a sale? YES.			"

												DISCLAIMER: Don't pay full price.I feel like I will leave that disclaimer at the top of many other Recommendations from here until forever.While Mirror's Edge is a beautiful and fun game, it is not worth the full money either. Well, perhaps it is, depending on your interests. Call me a Scrooge, if you will.But I found the game terrifyingly short as I beat it in a few hours, and neither the time trials nor returning to the story for the collectibles really make me want to keep playing, so I find no replayability either. Hence, I believe it lacks enough to justify the full price tag.However, the game is definitely worth playing and it's very fun. The parkour style running is interestingly done and lends to puzzle-like rooms very well, often livening up the game instead of making you simply run down a hallway over and over. The combat isn't too great, but it's not really a combat-oriented game, though I did like that sewer section where you can snipe at the guys in the tunnels.As I said already, the game is also beautiful. Man, it may kill your machine if you don't have something new. I have a newer laptop which is able to handle quite a lot of gaming, actually, but full graphics on this game would make it churn heat like no other. It still ran beautifully, though, even with all of the settings maxed out, with the exception of a few places here and there which would lag the game into oblivion. Oddly enough, most of those sections didn't seem to have anything around that made sense with the lag, as I couldn't figure out why the game would die out in an empty hallway, for instance.In any case, if you've been interested in the game, certainly purchase it on sale. I never thought I'd play it and eventually I bit the bullet and got it. I'm glad I did.			"

												So this is a pretty old game which at the time had revolutional graphics ( so i guess) but ill just go through the cons and pros-PRO´s-it had a fairly good combat system-you can use guns which i didnt expect-a pretty long story-good graphic design-16xqa anti aliasing which makes the game look like 4k on 1080p monitor-good performance keeps 60 on maxed out settings the whole time-very solid modeling-good parkour sections-CON´s-the textures are most of the time pretty blurry and sometimes they clip through some things-very,very small variety of weapon ( though i have to give credit to it that it actually got some)-the places you gonna play the whole game on are mostly copied from previous levels-levels are sometimes very weridly constructed and/or buggy which really upsets me as you have to get to find a like milimeter spot that you have to stand on just to get somewhere else-the bots behave like robots sometimes even running at walls-very linear in terms of level designWhen youre looking for a parkour/fps based game then go for it cause it is very cheap.Im giving it a 6.8/10 "

												NOTE: This game isn't for everyone, but it stands strong for me. I got Mirror's edge on the PS3 a few years back and fell in love. I just recently bought the game on steam. Don't judge the amount of time I played the game because I've mastered every level. REVIEW: This game has a sense of endless running, most free run games do. But this one has the smoothest freerunning and is different in every aspect. You have advanced control over Faith and her actions. You can quick turn, strafe, slide, roll, duck, jump, vault, vault jump, climb, wall run, wall climb, and shimmy. This is all from a first person view, which makes the game stand out. Back to the actions, when you combine all of these in a flawless motion you feel unstoppable. You play as Faith, a female runner, that wants to stop a corrupt government and save her sister. As a runner, you see the world in primary colors, red being your guide through out the game. To everyone you seem like an outcast, but all you're doing is stopping the government from taking away peoples freedom. The game lacks interesting characters besides Faith, and the story isn't the most memorable. At first you will find the game hard and very frustrating, but the more you play it the more you use the free running to your advantage. From there, you will find new paths and ways to navigate the environment. The combat isn't the best, The counters are bad, the punching isn't satisfying, and the gun play is useless. The wall run kicks, disarms, and jump kick and slides are the best part of the combat. The campaign is short too. Besides those minor flaws, the game is fun and worth getting if on a sale. It's a solid 8/10 for me.			"

												Mirror's Edge, 5 years from its PC release still looks pretty impressive, even by todays standards. The game world is gorgeous and makes me feel pretty chill (when I'm not in the midst of a fighting sequence). The controls are simple, clean and easy to grasp, and the level design is creative. I especially enjoyed how puzzles could have multiple routes to their solutions, and how the route to the end point of a level wasn't immediately obvious because of this. There is also a rather nice soundtrack to accompany the game, and it fits the environment well. The story unfolds well enough, though for me the story took the back seat to the gameplay experience. The free running style, the jumping and the problem solving involved in completing levels was very satisfying. This isn't to say it was a bad story at all, it engaged me just fine, but it was perhaps one of the less strong aspects of the game. The game wasn't particularly long, but I feel this may work in its favour. There is the risk of challenges becoming frustratingly difficult/repetitive, especially when there isn't a particularly impressive story to drive it. I feel it ended at just the right time and the ending was executed well.Overall, I found Mirror's Edge to be a challenging, visually impressive game whose key selling point is the game mechanics. The parkour system is pretty good especially for it's time, and it just feels fun when you're running and jumping and executing the sequences. If Mirror's Edge 2 takes these elements forward and builds on them using todays technology, it should hopefully be a very good game, much like its predecessor.			"

												This Review has a long version and a short version, so if you like to read a lot of text and information then read the long version, but if you don't like reading a lot of text and just want to make it quick and snappy then read the short version.It's your choose if you want to read my long or short version.Sorry but the long version is incomplete--------------Long Version--------------So at the start of the game there is a tutoral like most game, but in the tutoral it shows all of the buttons in the game on what your going to need to use, but it's all right if the game shows you all of the keys you can do that on a loading screen but they don't and have a pretty good map design for the tutoral to help you practice.In the game you maybe get stuck on one or more levels as sometimes you will get confused on where to go but luckly they thought of this and helped you out and put faded red arrows on the floor to show you on where you need to go. Also you can turn this option off in the main menu if you don't need any help or you thing that the arrow if annoying you.As this is a first person game what makes this feel that your in the game (depending on your monitor). The other reason on why it feels like your in the game and you are the person jumping all over the buildings with amazing graphics! This helps you play the game for a long time per session you click on the icon.INCOMPLETE--------------Short Version--------------This game is a nice game if you like parkour and lots of options in the main menu! I have not finished the game! so don't look at the review and think i've finished the game.Pros-------Helpful tutoral - Tells you all you need to do in the game.Tells you where to go if you get lost in the game - Red highlights on where to go.Makes you feel like you are in the game running around the buildings - As this is a 1st person parkour it does make feel like your in the game, only if you have good monitors and a good computer for the FPS.Good story line - Tells why your in trouble and why your a runner in this city and how you can fix it.Cons--------Fighting - As this is a parkour game why should there be running away from people or killing people? the main thing what I hate is the parts where you have to run away from the helicopter!Landing - Just remember i've have not finished the game so i'm not the best but it is hard to land when you jump off buildings, you have to press the button close to the ground but not too high up from the ground.I rate this game 8.9/10 "

Also you can turn this option off in the main menu if you don't need any help or you thing that the arrow if annoying you.As this is a first person game what makes this feel that your in the game (depending on your monitor). The other reason on why it feels like your in the game and you are the person jumping all over the buildings with amazing graphics! This helps you play the game for a long time per session you click on the icon.INCOMPLETE--------------Short Version--------------This game is a nice game if you like parkour and lots of options in the main menu! I have not finished the game! so don't look at the review and think i've finished the game.Pros-------Helpful tutoral - Tells you all you need to do in the game.Tells you where to go if you get lost in the game - Red highlights on where to go.Makes you feel like you are in the game running around the buildings - As this is a 1st person parkour it does make feel like your in the game, only if you have good monitors and a good computer for the FPS.Good story line - Tells why your in trouble and why your a runner in this city and how you can fix it.Cons--------Fighting - As this is a parkour game why should there be running away from people or killing people? the main thing what I hate is the parts where you have to run away from the helicopter!Landing - Just remember i've have not finished the game so i'm not the best but it is hard to land when you jump off buildings, you have to press the button close to the ground but not too high up from the ground.I rate this game 8.9/10 "

												A game pulled down by excessive glitches.  Positive: good story, great visuals (the blinding white contrasted with bright colors).  Negative: glitches everywhere: gamepad won't work, tutorial doesn't give keyboard commands (leaving you to figure out which buttons to use), combat isn't clear (disarm when the gun turns red? when did they tell you that?), combat is uber-precise button mashing, save/recall points force you to rewatch cutscenes over and over again.  Total: 6.5			"

												Mirror's Edge is essentially a trial-and-error game for me. The Reaction Time feature works wonders! However, although the game features moves heavily inspired by parkour, I felt that the only overwhelming stunts were the box vaults and the wallrunning. As a first-person point-of-view game, seeing the vaults being performed were much less appealing.The main character could have been more relatable if it weren't for the fragmented revelations of her past. I know that this is not that kind of story, but the motivations for each character, although explicitly stated, passes by too quickly without giving the player a chance to be immersed in the game. The game also promised melee combat yet most of the enemy NPCs wield guns and are VERY TRIGGER HAPPY. I see no reason to shoot an unarmed assailant even at point-blank. However, if the game is made such that the player should avoid most conlicts at all costs by just freerunning, then the selling point of this game is half-achieved. The game is actually short minus the parkour fails! I expect more from the next installment!PS. The sound effects as she falls are gut-wrenching. As an acrophobic, I approve.			"

												Mirrors Edge is a game, which is a bit different from all the other FPS...though...i wouldn't even call it FPS...more like First-Person-Parcour-Simulation-with-bits-of-Combat.So, if you like the idea of Parcour and running through levels, running along walls, jumping over obstacles or sliding below them, give this game a try.If not, then don't even bother continue reading.You're taking over the Role of Faith, a so called Runner (which is sort of a courier which brings informations or items to their clients).As already said, you will run and jump and slide through the levels in First-Person View, which is actually quite fun and pretty well executed.It does feel pretty good to do wallruns, jumps and slides and try to get the proper timing.Though it has it's flaws, the story is rather thin, the combat (which isn't mandatory, you can outrun them or punch them to the floor in most cases) can be pretty frustrating and checkpoints are sometimes set a bit stupid (though most of the time pretty fair).It's definitely worth a look, especially because it does things different and it was definitely a risk doing such a game, and for me this needs to be rewarded, even though it's nowhere near perfect.

												here is a gem of a game that somehow went under my radarMirror's Edge is a gem of its own,featuring an unique artstyle that we haven't seen before,a mixture of Cel Shading and Anime. combined with a parkour mechanic that pays homage to Prince of Persia Sands of Time.You are Faith,a Runner on a city where all information is controlled and observed. Your sister is framed for murdering the mayoral candidate: Robert Pope, and now you must save her and find the true culprit.featuring a really satisfying parkour mechanic,excellent visuals and sound design Mirror's Edge is an adventure you shouldn't miss,the only gripe i have about this game would be its length,i took 5 hours to complete the single player campaign,wishing for more parkour action,but after all we are all in the edge,the question is when will we jump?

												I love this game for multiple reasons.It has a great parcour core game mechanic which really feels great. it gives a great sense of movement and vertigo. Another point is the incredibly nice looking art direction, beautiful environment and sound design. The story may feel a bit bland, but still fits in the environment and is okay in general.The combat occasionally may feel a bit off when you pick up a gun and turns into a shooter. This game does not need FPS mechanics. Although, being under ennemy fire adds some good time pressure, and punching ennemies in the face feels enjoyable since you don't need to fire a gun to have decent combat.			"

												What you're reading this for:       + The game looks as good or better than the images above, which were surely what brough you to check it out. Trust me, it's gorgeous, it's everything you thought it'd be.       + It has deep, rewarding, visceral, insanely well thought movement system.       + Amazing soundtrack and art design.     -/+ You'll restart a single checkpoint over and over which ruins the feel of flowy momentum of running around. There's going to be one jump in ever level that'll test your patience. But you'll end up liking the way you hone your skill by repeating it.       - Very short single player.        - The animated cutscenes seem forced in and depart from the overall style of the game.       - Trial and error.This is my favorite game. Of all the ones I've played, this is my favorite. It feels very physical to run around and you actually gain momentum the longer the run-up to a jump is. Not only that, but DICE didn't even just pitch an idea and fill the rest of the 12 hours of the campaign with whatever... oh no no no. Ever level and stage is carefully though through with design and graphics and location of the enemies. Faith is a slender, quick cat and the game makes an excellent job of making you feel like one yourself, but never powerful, always weak, oportunistic, wathcing for where the soldiers are. Except when they're aware of exactly where you are and you are trying to grab the tiny pipe on the ledge while avoiding contact with buckshot.I think this game was an amazing premise brought down slightly by some marketing representative who insisted that market research demanded shooting things.

												The first time I played Mirrors Edge was on the 360.  And let me tell you, this is a fantastic game.  Set in the future, it's about a girl called ""Faith"" who is what is called a ""runner"" they are basiclly some sort of resistance group against a corrupted Goverment. Without spoiling too much, Someone gets framed and it's up to Faith to figure out what is really going on.What I really liked about this game was the fact that unlike most dystopican future settings, it's not set in a dreary dark enviroment. But rather a very beautiful looking city. But as you play more and more, you realize that beauty has almost an ominous feel to it. And to me, that's even more creepy. Something that appears to be beautiful, but deep down has a darker secret.  The gameplay is very uniqe, in a sense you focus more on jumping to other buildings,over obstacles, ect, and you try to avoid combat as much as possible. I have a bit of a bias for games that try to use other methods other than combat.(Like metal gear for example, where running and gunning gets you punished.) but this game really does do it well. I know that a sequel(or rather prequel) is coming out soon. And I hope it will as good as the original. I reccomend it.			"

												Not playing Mirror's Edge is like not seeing The Mona Lisa. You hear its art. And when you see it in snapshots and images and stuff you can't really see why; its just another game/painting. Nothing special. Then you sit down with it. Have a drink. Play it, admire it. Whatever. Then you realize it could have been way better—like, WAY better—but for a piece of crap made in 2009 or 1503, its really something. It's not the best of its kind, nor its year, but it sure as hell is fun to look at is my point.			"

												I loved Mirror's Edge, but the game is not completly perfect yet. The difficulty level is not bad, the art style is unique and beautiful and the storyline is ok (although I didn't really get into the story too much). The gameplay is good, its a wonderful improvement to the first person action games, but I didn't really like the fighting in the game (it seemed that running away is the best option). The game gave the feeling that it should be an open world game and you have many ways to reach your objective,but acutally it was a linear world, you can't really approach things from many different places. Anyways, I really hope to see what they are going to improve in Mirror's Edge 2.8/10.			"

												A game that relies heavily on a good flow to be enjoyable but does every little thing in it's power to ruin that flow. It took me roughly seven years, a disc, a Steam purchase, and six or so installs/attempts of Mirror's Edge to finally put it in the completed pile. I had glimmers of fun each attempt but always ran into a rough area of gunplay or something else that gave me a window to go astray and play something else. A bundle purchase some time ago gave it a new opportunity to catch my eyes on the Steam platform but still it rotted in my backlog. Until yesterday. After years of hearing good things and people's fond memories I decided I would beat it. I did. And I did not enjoy most of the experience and was consistently reminded why I always walked away all those times over the years. After a night to sleep on it and make sure cooler heads prevailed, the verdict remained the same; I did not enjoy Mirror's Edge at all. This game features the absolute worst FPS gunplay I have ever experienced. This is not hyperbole. The worst. A ""bullet time"" skill that is too slow and a disarming skill that is entirely clunky do very little to alleviate the problems. There is also some frustrating platforming but that I would easily forgive. I only bring it up because it and the bad gunplay mean you die a lot. Which is only an issue due to very oddly picked respawn checkpoints. Some are spaced too far from the last, some put you too close to a ledge to generate the speed required to make a jump without backtracking, some put you back before a, hopefully, short scripted sequence or annoying script line, some put you behind slow opening doors again and again, etc etc. I'd have to say at least 30 minutes of my 4.3 hours was repeating stuff from my hundreds of failures. Yes, the game can take a mere 4 hours to conquer. Toss in config setup, bad dragging cutscenes, LONG elevator rides, lots of vent crawling... That 4.3 hours gets really really short. That ended up a relief for me though, I did enjoy that it ended sooner rather than later. The story is the definition of average which I normally wouldn't complain about in a game but man, the universe they created was decently fascinating! So it was a stark contrast of this unique world and this downright boring story. The stories on newsreel monitors in those long elevator rides were by far the most interesting lore that was offered up.It is a beautiful game. Visually stunning, even all these years later. The city is crisp, clean, and unique. The platforming gameplay can feel downright amazing too. When you string together jumps and wall runs, it just feels right. The other thing is that it doesn't even need the fast pace to feel good. There were more methodical puzzle-like sections that with a little polish would've been wholly satisfying. But, following every brief moment of these fun things are abrupt, painful, interruptions to ruin things. Visually stunning game, suddenly cutscenes for an ordinary story with atrocious unfitting animation. Five minutes of free running filled amazing gameplay, interrupted by a section of that gunplay or some obtuse obstacle sequence. Methodical puzzle, interrupted by a poorly implemented ledge and shoddy checkpoint placement. It never stayed fun for a long enough period of time for me to forgive it's shortcomings. Its hard to recommend against a consensus ""cult classic"" and I fully grasp why people have raved about this game all these years. But the fact of the matter is the flow was interrupted far too regularly for me. And, again for me, the gunplay implementation was egregious and plain unforgivable. I would never recommend the game at any price. I didn't have fun. ""Faith the trains!! ... Take the trains!""			"

												I seriously wanted to like it. It has an iconic art style and there's nothing wrong with running and jumping and an occasional kick in a baddie's face.But for some reason the devs thought that rubbing a jump fail or weapon grab fail (and you'll have 100s of those) in our noses would be a good idea. When you fail you'll have to endure a fall to death with horrible bone break and squishy wet noises in the end. Thats kinda ok once or twice but believe me it gets tedious. And that's the best outcome.In some cases you can't even fall to your death and yet you know that you've failed (because you haven't escaped the guards). In that case you'll have to let the guards kill you. You might ask ""but can't I just go back to the previous save point?"" No you can't. You have to let yourself fall to death. When that doesn't work you have to let the guards shoot you down. And even for that, sometimes you have to climb a long ladder because the guards are too stupid to reach you otherwise.Seriously, dear devs, this kind of game design stopped being good around 1989.Additionally one might mention that putting puzzles (finding a non-trivial way in a building) and pressure (guards rushing in) together results in frustration. It breaks immersion when you solve the puzzle by just dying and respawning and trying again. This alone wouldn't break the game but it is a point.Difficulty is ok if the player has control. XCOM can be very difficult but there the player has control. Here too many things (wall runs come to mind) are far too random. There difficulty turns to frustration.As I said, I wanted to like it but it's impossible. I also thought about recommending it only for its art style but I think it's necessary to discourage this kind of game system design.If you are looking for something where immersion isn't broken all the time, that also has a very good art style and actually likable characters and a likeable story, try Remember Me.

												This is one of the games that have captured the Emotion and the Atmopshere of the game and tied it with the gameplay so well thats its perfect. This is a true unique game both in the gameplay and the atmosphere aspects and its a must-buy for anyone. The only disadvantage I can think of is the fact that the game was short, I wished I was allowed to free roam around the city a bit more to capture the atmosphere even further. I also wished there were more night levels. I have never played a game like this before, it defined its own franchise and it done it with style. 10/10			"

												This game has been glorified way too much, and deserves to be called innovative, but it is definitely not the best it can be. It is a good concept, good design and looked like it could be fun. There are many parts however where the system breaks. A climbing segment where Faith must jump to her left onto a ledge took me 8 tries to perform. The jump itself was not difficult, and I had all the time in the world to take it, but she refused to jump. Instead the spacebar would prompt her to fall to her death and reset the checkpoint at the bottom of the climb. I did eventually make it and continued on for another 30 minutes, but the game had way too many moments like this for me to appreciate it. I hear the sequel will have easier combat and will be improving a lot of other things, so I may try it when it goes on sale. As for this, time to be refunded.			"

												I really really wanted to like this game.  It has a great concept, a fantastic art style (Including the cartoonish looking cutscenes), and a likeable protagonist.  Yet... it still just fell short of what I was expecting.  The storyline was a run of the mill filler storyline, I've played 10 other games with an incredibly similar story.  The movement in and out of combat was functionally smooth, but sadly just wasn't that responsive. Also a personal annoyance in free runner games like this all the movement is basically just WASD and spacebar, and there was quite often times especially when starting when you would just hit the wrong move again and again.  I played it all the way through, collected all the extra baggage, yet still I just wasn't satisfied with it.  I'm happy I only paid $6 for it on sale, so much potential, but feels like so little effort.			"

												Pros:Fun story, cool main character.Still good graphics, it works well in 4K.Sounds and music is fine.It's fun to jump around.Latest version is a lot more playable than early builds were.Cons:NPCs have little to no background story.There are just jumps which are impossible to do.PhysX kills the FPS randomly, IE sometimes it doesn't affect it, sometimes it drops to about 5ish when I'm on a corridor without any glass/effects/enemies in sight. The community has a way to fix this, some files needs to be overwritten, but still...Character does unrealistic stunts, which is a problem because it does not do realistic ones in turn: stuff even I can do like pole climbing, clibming and then crounching to the top of railings (even when there is a pole to grab). Instead it just jump over all railings(often to certain death!), it's fine it won't stand on top of a fence, but railings?It also hangs on stuff like horizontal pipes and wall mounted lights, which is cool, but when it does the camera does not let you look around (contary to when it hangs from a vertical pipe) at all and does not let you move in any direction except letting it go (jump down to whatever death avaits below).So often instead of going the obvious way, it forces the player to go the hard way which is sometimes still near impossible (too time consuming, and interrupts the fun) despite how it improved a lot since release. This kills immersion.If you do not kill anyone, only run away, or ocasionally punch, IE you stay true to the role of being a runner and not a serial killer, nothing will change, everything seems to be the same. This ruins immersion, might as well just kill ever cop then, no consequence but at least it's funny when they fly down rooftops instead of the player for a change.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I've heard great things about the story and the engine has a lot of potential. Unfortunately the level design and gameplay are some of the worst I have ever seen, completely ruining what might have otherwise been a good game. There is little to no indication of where you should go (and no indication at all of why in most cases), so that randomly hurling yourself into space a few times until you pick a direction which doesn't kill you is the primary feature of play. This might be okay if you had time to scout around and figure out your route but every level (as far as I have played) has hostiles forcing you to keep moving at most times. You seem to need to identify (by, as far as I can figure out, trial and error) the right route for each section and follow that exactly, ruining the illusion of an open world which the engine gives.I understand that some people are probably happy with trial and error game play, random seeming action with little or  in-game explanation or real clue as to what is going on, being content to learn routes and try for their best time on them, but I am not one of them. I only spent £2.50 on this nonsense and I feel cheated, I can only hope that I can get my money's worth from non-story play since, as I said, the engine itself seems very good.			"

												I didn't like it. I may try it again in a few months when I'm not♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at it anymore. The game flip flops too much from the very fun, and fast paced parkour friendly city, and near endless frustration. I keep dying 50 times over in the same spot because there is no way to get from one place to another without breaking cover. The cops in this game make marine snipers look like storm troopers, and there is no way to sneak your way past them. You can take their guns, but while they have unlimited amunition the player doesn't though you should avoid armed confrontation at all costs because the gunplay is horrid.  I've never played a game that tempted me to throw my controller through the TV as much as this one, and that is not what I am looking for in a game. A little more in game help would be nice at times, and a change in what is there would be good as well. I've fallen off of buildings using the in game help which does nothing but turn you instantly towards the next destination.			"

												Seems like a nice game, but: - The game believes that my Roccat Tyon mouse is a controller (most likely due to the axis thumb ""wing""), which means- I can't use my 360 controller since it won't register any button presses. - It still shows controller tips in menus and tutorial though...- The game has crashed twice during the hour or so that I've played.- You can't change any graphics settings what so ever without heading back to main menu. (Actually, that's not true. You can change the brightness.)Based on other reviews I guess these problems aren't too common, and the game seems really nice apart from the issues I've had with it so far.

												Mirror's Edge is a strange game. It provides a unique goal of getting from place to place and really discourages typical gunplay.  Instead of shooting your way through a number of police and SWAT, you try and get around them through expert use of terrain and untraditional paths.While Mirror's Edge is significantly short, some replay value comes from the time trials that are offered to you as you complete the game. The real feeling of success comes from stringing entire stages together, taking almost no slow downs and taking the most efficient paths to just FLOW through the stages. "

												Mirror's Edge is a strange game. It provides a unique goal of getting from place to place and really discourages typical gunplay.  Instead of shooting your way through a number of police and SWAT, you try and get around them through expert use of terrain and untraditional paths.While Mirror's Edge is significantly short, some replay value comes from the time trials that are offered to you as you complete the game. The real feeling of success comes from stringing entire stages together, taking almost no slow downs and taking the most efficient paths to just FLOW through the stages. "

												Move controls is pretty good for a parkour game and simple to play, enjoyable to fly around, yes. But worst, WORST combat system (fighting + shooting) and most stupid AI of all time.Edit 1:  you know you often encounter with enemies in this game. If i want to hide and go on my way without facing enemies, they know exactly where i am and i forced to fight; or if i want to fight, they outmatch me with unfairly mechanics and guns. If it's a parkour game like you said, developers have to offer me choices: go on my way without fighting, or a fair, well designed fight system againts good AI. I consent good AI even with the same combat system. But AI's are also bad...			"

												Mirror's Edge is an all around great game. Although the story is only alright, the gameplay keeps you adrenaline running the whole game. I feel that the movement is very well developed considering this game was made 7 years ago. I don't know if i would have bought it for $20.00 but when Mirror's Edge is on sale it is definitely worth buying.			"

												This first-person platformer game is disappointing. At first glance it appeared to offer interesting gameplay based on parkour, as well as nice artwork, but the implementation leaves much to be desired. Despite the apparent ""open world"" environment, levels are very linear. Yes, the player character runs on rooftops and inside large buildings in a big city, but the doors, windows, gates, vents etc. are blocked, locked, or just unbreakable, except for a specific path which the player has to find, often while being shot at. There are pipes, crates, planks, and other objects in the environment, but player can't move or otherwise use them to create new paths. There are armed enemies and the player has ability to fight, but combat system is subpar. And yet for some reason the story has the player character frequently go directly into the midst of said armed enemies, particularly in the last few chapters, making the combat system more conspicuously annoying. The lacklustre plot doesn't help either. Would have been better if it has actual ""open world"" environment, better combat system, and perhaps ability to bypass confrontations altogether (e.g. by sneaking around enemies or creating distractions). Overall, after completing it, I feel that while this game may be interesting when it was first released, it isn't a good use of time and money today.			"

												Despite not reaching mega sales numbers, this did OK when it came out. It has a big cult following and the demand for a sequel is so great that EA finally ordered for the sequel to be made. If you can catch this on sale, go for it. Or hell, just pony up the $20 for some good fun. It is a cool first-person platform jumper that really gives you a sense of being high up and doing dangerous things, like banging Josh Holmes mother without a rubber, the most dangerous job of them all. It is well produced and good in almost every aspect. This game is very fun and one of my all-time favorite games. Probably my favorite parkour game of all-time as well.8/10			"

												I understand that this game was released in 2008. It holds up graphically to this day, and the game looks great once you iron out the performance issues with physX. However, the combat is absolutely horrendous, even for 2008. You have to either memorize an INSANELY small window where you can melee an enemy safely and take his gun, or use the slow motion which is clunky and ruins the immersion. Once you have a gun, it handles horribly and your movement speed is reduced to a crawl (unless you have the pea-shooter of a handgun). The level design is pretty bad as well. Too many times I found myself stuck in a building or something trying to find the exit. This game would have greatly benefitted from a radar system or a map, as your ""runner vision"" can only work if you are already close to your destination. The actual parkour mechanics are wonderful though, and it is really fun to play once you get up to speed. It is a shame that the game's had such glaring issues because the core gameplay is really fun.			"

												EDIT: In case you can't see it, I currently have 19 hours in this game, mostly in offline mode.     Mirror's Edge, I'm sure, is going to stay one of my all time favorite games. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is relaxing, and the parkour is very fluid. This is the game I play when I get frustrated with CS:GO (I'm not the best). It does have its faults however. It will require you to pick up a fallen enemy's firearm every so often, and the gunplay is less than desireable, which is surprising coming from the creators of Battlefield (DICE). Aside from the poor gunplay, the levels sometimes incorporate live, die, repeat, Super Mario Bros-esque jumps that make the game feel almost unfair, but when you finally do make it (usually by utilizing some aspect of the environment that was previously overlooked), the rush of victory and accomplishment feels great.     The game makes you play through it on easy or normal difficulty the first time, which means Runner Vision is enabled. Runner Vision highlights different objects that can be used to navigate to your destination, which I find can be immersion breaking. Hard mode is unlocked after your first playthrough. It increases the combat difficulty and has Runner Vision permanently disabled.     I recommend this game to everyone especially when it goes on sale for $5. You have no reason to pass this up. The story isn't memorable, but the relaxing, detailed atmosphere and simple, fluid parkour controls make this game a must have.			"

												While I do agree that the optimization on this game is appalling (and I will get to that in a sec), this game remains my favourite. I do parkour in real life, and this game's movement system is the most satisfying and most realistic I have seen in any game (and I noticed that Dying Light copied a lot of it), and the graphics, especially considering its age, are astounding. It is a short, simple game, and I am looking forward to the sequel.My advice for graphics settings:-Anti-aliasing off-Phys-X off-Graphics quality lowest-Texture quality high/highestThis makes it look pretty good and run really smoothly.

												Mirrors Freaking Edge. I game that combines combat with swift parkour and movement. A game with a solid soundtrack and spectacular graphics. Mirrors Edge appears more superb then most first person shooting games out on the market BUT IT'S NOT. The movement of the parkour is accurate and the foot and hand gestures match the pace of your character. Even the way Faith moved her finger was a indicaton that this games parkour perspective is realistic. Very realistic. This platformer has astonishing views, great use of color and a great concept but of course there's a glitch in the matrix. The concept is intriging at first indeed..but after quite sometime you stop caring for the story. You would think the plot would be major, involving a world crisis or a fatal disaster but you're only saving your sister.... your sister, that is most likely the most minor plot I've known.The character's aren't enjoyable since the writers hardly know anything about character development. Faiths emotions stay the same throughtout the whole game. You would assume she would become more hostile or lose hope but nooopppe. Mirrors Edge also gives you different areas to roam. Instead of running on a platform with 1 pole in the first chapter, you get to run on a platform with 2 poles this time. Imagine running into up coming traffic, jumping past traffic lights and vehicles. That would be more enjoyable. The fighting between you and the enemies is outstanding since you can steal their weapons and use them as your own but the shooting itself is too bleak and pointless. The shooting mechanic is useless since you have the oppurtunity to outrun enemies. (Always) and the shooting is one of the worst I have seen in years. This game was shaped into a paradise but a tropical storm knocked it on it's a**. 4.9/10			"

What is this, a school hallway?!?-Be antisocial and run away from everyone you meet. If they're red, kill them. They don't deserve that holy color.-No matter how bad the urge is, don't ever say ""Leap of Faith"" when you jump.

												I love this game. I played it through so many times that I just had to get it when I lost my hardcopy from the 360.Needless to say. It's an OK port. 60 fps better graphics and smoother visuals and faster loading. All that jazz.But I can't recommend it for 2 reasons.Game doesn't save data over Steam shutdown. All controls are not adaptable to keyboard-mouse (basically the display doesn't change with different hotkeys).Save data doesn't save.SAVE DATA DOESN'T SAVE.What the hell.			"

												Excellent traceur navigation, beautiful environments, lovely white highlighted by primary colors, a fresh step away from the bleak brown shooters of today. Its beauty is accentuated by nvidia physx, The first person point of view is superb and makes you feel as though you are doing the action yourself. the only things it is lacking in is the story, which is sub-par, and the gunplay(though this is definitely intended). But at the end of the day, cumbersome guns and contrived stories can be disregarded, since all we want to do is leap around on rooftops anyways:)Don't forget to check out the reboot too! It's running frostbite and will be even more beautiful, and it has some sweet new moves to perform!			"

												I'm going to remain completely objective about this review. Personally...I couldn't get into it. The main reason why is because I suck at these kind of games with trying to time my movement just right and figuring out how to get to different places. However, that being said, this game is great. The little that I could get right it was awesome and you had a sense of satisfaction when you pull it off flawlessly parkouring through the city. I want to like this game, but I don't. Hopefully you guys do. If what I said earlier doesn't dissuade you then please play this game.			"

												Game was pretty good, went  into it with little expectations came out to be a decent game honestly. $5-$10.Graphics are pretty good, performance is pretty good even with Physx on.   Game uses it very little, but when it does use it, it does a  decent job. (my favorite is whent he chopper if following you firing a machine gun at you, and the bullets are ripping through the scaffolding of the skyscraper you are climbing around on)Story is ok, could of been better, and the game was a bit short, not short enough to complain about, especially if you got the game on sale, (for $60 it is too short)Controls are decent, though half way through I switched to 360 (Onza) controller, and turned the sensitivity up.  Melee combat was fun, but I think it could of been better, I remember Chronicles of Riddick, and a game called Breakdown that did it better. Music was decent and the setting was nice to explore, would be interested in a more fleshed out sequel.			"

												Everyone I know seems to absolutely LOVE this game to death.Lemme get one thing straight: This game sucks in a lot of categories. Lemme list them from worst to best.Level design:The level design sucks in this game. Half the time I have no hint of an idea where I should be going, and even with runne r vision on, am left just to sprint around and desperately try to find a way to continue the game. It is just garbage. 4.5/10Difficulty:This game is oddly too difficult. I haven't even managed to make it through the halfpoint of this game, and I've been playing for what... 6 hours? Yeah. 6/10Parkour mechanics:The moving mechanics are... okay. At the right time they are actually very fun. However, they are broken to hell. Jumping from pipe to pipe is very difficult at times when it shouldn't be, and even just jumping to a higher position can be almost impossible. I've remapped the keyboard controls to fit what I think actually works, but it still is just a steaming hot pile of poop. 5.5/10Story:The story is decent. The voice acting in the cutscenes really lacks, I think. It just seems too forced and poorly written. ""You can't just keep living on the edge! At some point, you'll have to jump!"" Yeah. Really amazing writing. 6.5/10Life:By life I basically mean the normal populace things going on in the background. They're pretty good for a 2008 game, but they still really lack in some parts. The cars can sometimes not render properly, making them shine bright like they're being hit by light while they're clearly under a shadow. There are also way to few people. In a city as big as the one in Mirror's Edge, the city should be bustling with people! 7/10Total:5.8/10			"

												I recently beat Mirrors Edge (in about 6 hours of gameplay)The game is unlike any other, which you'll find out as you're jumping around actually avoiding enemies. You don't run into fights like in most games nowadays, you die too easily. You can take out one enemy easily, but they always move in two or more. If you're able to knock out or kill an enemy with your kickass martial arts skills you can pick up his gun, but you only have the magazine that is currently in it. The gunfights aren't exactly interesting, as its not a shooting game, but sometimes I found them necessary because I couldn't get around the enemies in that particular level. Of course the focus of the game is hardcore parkour essentially, you feel superhuman as you run across walls and jump across buildings. One bad step and you can find yourself plummetting toward the ground in a stomach churning fall ending with a sickening crack of bones and a splat. The cutscenes aren't interesting, they use an animation style that literally makes you feel like you're watching an esurance commercial. Honestly I would be sucked into the game, having a lot of fun when a cutscene reared its ugly head, and I didn't feel like playing anymore.Overall, the graphics are nice, the gameplay is fresh but sometimes repetetive, the story is generic and uninteresting, and the game is moderately hard to run.7 / 10			"

												This is one of those games I go back to on a regular basis. This is a timeless classic, a true piece of art.Countless playthroughs on my 360 and just recently picked up the PC version. And nothing has changed, the game is still fun and atmospheric as ever.Mastering each level will take some time, but the amazing flow of Faith will keep you coming back for more.The difficulty might be offputting, especially some of the combat sections, but the overall epicness of your journey will make you forgive any shortcomings of the game.Kudos to DICE for the outstanding job!

												I would like to recommend this game on discount like i bought it. I did expect more of a kind of adventure or action rpg not sure why. But i wasnt too disappointed when it turned out to be a parcour fps game in the end. I wish there was a bit more nuance to the voting when writing a preview cause this game would have needed one. As overall i am not disappoint by the game but there are several things that were either missing or could have been done better. pro: - good graphics for the time it was published (around 2010)- nice flow if you find a good path that gets your speed going- not too easy, even when using the hint to the next objective often- female bad♥♥♥♥♥lead character (nice for a change)- interface simple and controls are sufficent for most stuff ingame- hints and runners vision help a lot  cons:- combat, i really wish you could completly skip the fighting part. But if you dont want to overly frustrate yourself you have to fight at some points in the game. Faith just isnt made for fighting full armor riot cops, so it kinda seems dumb when she swing bare handed at a full gear cop shooting her with a mp. The jump kicks dont do much and neve will knock out someone instant, same goes for the slide kicks. The whole thing feels so clunky and would be impossible to do if not for her amazing self healing powers so i took one cop out and hide around the corner waiting to heal back up. The fights could have been so much better if you could fully avoid them (sneaky beaky like) or just combine it with some form of martial arts like matrix or other games have shown.   - pathing, the game flow seldom felt like a smooth parcours like to me. Maybe its better when you know the levels in and out but when a game fails on one of its core mechanics it sucks. The rooftop chases and runs are usually done better but as soon as you enter a building it turned into a wild guessing game. Sometimes i just jumped every wall and rail to look if it would net me some kind of clue where to go next, this was a really bad break of the flow for me. Even f'---- mario can do better wall jumps than this girl. Things get worse when you are presented with a room full of policemen shooting at you while you are ducking behind a van and try to figure out how to reach that vent up above.  So i multiple times tried different paths just to get gunned down. In the end i had to clear the room (again with lame clunky fighting) just to have a moment to think about the layout. This whole thing could have been done so much better, if the developers want to make us believe that every building is filled with vents, pipes and edges to dangle on, why not take it a step further and make all the surrounding climbable or able to interact with. - story/atmosphere, story could have used a bit more pep apart from the standard ways. You are trying to survive in an authotarian city but barely feel the threat. Why not run through a crowd of people? Why are all the building empty but these obnixious cops? How do the cops always find you even if you escaped through different vents and underground facilities, as soon as you pop up, they are already waiting, is this girl wired? This was the biggest let down for me, a bit more life a bit more people and interaction. The only other persons apart from cops apear in cut scenes. Just take a hint out of Assasins Creed, disappear in a crowd, police will just notice you if you behave suspiciously.Just to get this clear, the game was ok, and worth the discounted price, but overall i never got too engaged with it as the cons are just too glaring and i hate when i play something and feel like dumb kid standing around with question marks all over my head. The game should almost never force you to do that. Its a different thing to repeat a sequence over and over again cause you know what went wrong, but this games lets you repeat some parts again and again not even knowing IF you are doing the right thing in the first place.

												I would like to recommend this game on discount like i bought it. I did expect more of a kind of adventure or action rpg not sure why. But i wasnt too disappointed when it turned out to be a parcour fps game in the end. I wish there was a bit more nuance to the voting when writing a preview cause this game would have needed one. As overall i am not disappoint by the game but there are several things that were either missing or could have been done better. pro: - good graphics for the time it was published (around 2010)- nice flow if you find a good path that gets your speed going- not too easy, even when using the hint to the next objective often- female bad♥♥♥♥♥lead character (nice for a change)- interface simple and controls are sufficent for most stuff ingame- hints and runners vision help a lot  cons:- combat, i really wish you could completly skip the fighting part. But if you dont want to overly frustrate yourself you have to fight at some points in the game. Faith just isnt made for fighting full armor riot cops, so it kinda seems dumb when she swing bare handed at a full gear cop shooting her with a mp. The jump kicks dont do much and neve will knock out someone instant, same goes for the slide kicks. The whole thing feels so clunky and would be impossible to do if not for her amazing self healing powers so i took one cop out and hide around the corner waiting to heal back up. The fights could have been so much better if you could fully avoid them (sneaky beaky like) or just combine it with some form of martial arts like matrix or other games have shown.   - pathing, the game flow seldom felt like a smooth parcours like to me. Maybe its better when you know the levels in and out but when a game fails on one of its core mechanics it sucks. The rooftop chases and runs are usually done better but as soon as you enter a building it turned into a wild guessing game. Sometimes i just jumped every wall and rail to look if it would net me some kind of clue where to go next, this was a really bad break of the flow for me. Even f'---- mario can do better wall jumps than this girl. Things get worse when you are presented with a room full of policemen shooting at you while you are ducking behind a van and try to figure out how to reach that vent up above.  So i multiple times tried different paths just to get gunned down. In the end i had to clear the room (again with lame clunky fighting) just to have a moment to think about the layout. This whole thing could have been done so much better, if the developers want to make us believe that every building is filled with vents, pipes and edges to dangle on, why not take it a step further and make all the surrounding climbable or able to interact with. - story/atmosphere, story could have used a bit more pep apart from the standard ways. You are trying to survive in an authotarian city but barely feel the threat. Why not run through a crowd of people? Why are all the building empty but these obnixious cops? How do the cops always find you even if you escaped through different vents and underground facilities, as soon as you pop up, they are already waiting, is this girl wired?

												It's a decent game but it's not what I expected. It feels kinda slow when you run and jump around. Sometimes it gets frustrating. The story is ok, nothing special. Graphics are really good, considering the game being released in 2009. I'd like to mention that I experienced some horrible lag but I fixed it after messing around with video settings (turned off the PhysX option).Mirrors Edge is a good game but don't buy it for a full price, it's just not worth 10 euros (in my opinion). 6.5/10 0.5 points for a cool name :)			"

												Mirrors Freaking Edge. I game that combines combat with swift parkour and movement. A game with a solid soundtrack and spectacular graphics. Mirrors Edge appears more superb then most first person shooting games out on the market BUT IT'S NOT. The movement of the parkour is accurate and the foot and hand gestures match the pace of your character. Even the way Faith moved her finger was a indicaton that this games parkour perspective is realistic. Very realistic. This platformer has astonishing views, great use of color and a great concept but of course there's a glitch in the matrix. The concept is intriging at first indeed..but after quite sometime you stop caring for the story. You would think the plot would be major, involving a world crisis or a fatal disaster but you're only saving your sister.... your sister, that is most likely the most minor plot I've known.The character's aren't enjoyable since the writers hardly know anything about character development. Faiths emotions stay the same throughtout the whole game. You would assume she would become more hostile or lose hope but nooopppe. Mirrors Edge also gives you different areas to roam. Instead of running on a platform with 1 pole in the first chapter, you get to run on a platform with 2 poles this time. Imagine running into up coming traffic, jumping past traffic lights and vehicles. That would be more enjoyable. The fighting between you and the enemies is outstanding since you can steal their weapons and use them as your own but the shooting itself is too bleak and pointless. The shooting mechanic is useless since you have the oppurtunity to outrun enemies. (Always) and the shooting is one of the worst I have seen in years. This game was shaped into a paradise but a tropical storm knocked it on it's a**. 4.9/10			"

												EDIT: In case you can't see it, I currently have 19 hours in this game, mostly in offline mode.     Mirror's Edge, I'm sure, is going to stay one of my all time favorite games. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is relaxing, and the parkour is very fluid. This is the game I play when I get frustrated with CS:GO (I'm not the best). It does have its faults however. It will require you to pick up a fallen enemy's firearm every so often, and the gunplay is less than desireable, which is surprising coming from the creators of Battlefield (DICE). Aside from the poor gunplay, the levels sometimes incorporate live, die, repeat, Super Mario Bros-esque jumps that make the game feel almost unfair, but when you finally do make it (usually by utilizing some aspect of the environment that was previously overlooked), the rush of victory and accomplishment feels great.     The game makes you play through it on easy or normal difficulty the first time, which means Runner Vision is enabled. Runner Vision highlights different objects that can be used to navigate to your destination, which I find can be immersion breaking. Hard mode is unlocked after your first playthrough. It increases the combat difficulty and has Runner Vision permanently disabled.     I recommend this game to everyone especially when it goes on sale for $5. You have no reason to pass this up. The story isn't memorable, but the relaxing, detailed atmosphere and simple, fluid parkour controls make this game a must have.			"

												There are very simple rules that all runners must follow:-If it's red, use it.-That thing below the rooftops, called ""the street"", don't use it unless specified.-Don't let yourself be shot.-When you don't see a way out, look for the nearest red thing and use it.-Walking? What is this, a school hallway?!?-Be antisocial and run away from everyone you meet. If they're red, kill them. They don't deserve that holy color.-No matter how bad the urge is, don't ever say ""Leap of Faith"" when you jump.  Ol' Faithy dosen't like puns. -Run even if you just broke your legs.So if you wanna be a Pro MLG 360 YY Noscoper in Mirror's Edge, follow these rules.Red "

												Having played though this game three times, I feel I can write a proper review. If I could describe this game in one word it would be outstanding. This is one of if not the best games DICE have ever produced. The music is absolutely stellar, the polished world is easy on the eye and beautiful to look at and the unique idea of an FPS parkour game is incredible. I also had this game on xbox and I have to say it's one of my favourite games of all time.			"

												So, let me preface this by saying that games with the kind of mechanics that Mirror's Edge uses are not my typical kind of games. However, I saw this in my friend's library and decided to give it a go. I'll be overly cliche in my review by just listing a few pros and cons along with my personal opinions as to why I gave this a thumb's down. Pros:Great parkour mechanicsBeautiful graphicsDecent voice actingDecent storyCons:Rather difficult if not used to these types of gamesDoesn't always give you a cut and dry path (which is fine, but difficult when limited to where you can parkour)Combat is choppy (although hardcore players will tell you it's fine tuned)Looking at the pros, it's obvious that the graphics, story, and voice acting are well done. The parkour itself, it terms of mechanics and overall gameplay, is a lot of fun to play and master. However, a quick glance at the cons draws my attention. The fact that every mission has an inexplicable amount of cops chasing you, while shooting, takes away from what I believe to be the core of the game. I want to parkour around the city, leaping from building to building. If this game was a puzzle game, where you had to figure out how to maneuver around rooftops, making difficult jumps, the game would be phenomenal. I found myself dying several times from missing jumps. Unfortunately, if I had to throw out a guess, out of my 30-40 deaths (I told you, not my type of game), around 25-30 are from dying to cops shooting me. I want the game to allow me to showoff my parkour skills (which the races are great at doing). I did not, however, sign up to play a shooting game. Now, I understand that it's an entirely different element and difficulty level, having to dodge shooting cops. However, it made the game FAR less enjoyable when I knew I was able to make the jump, but couldn't avoid the cop that kept killing me. If you're into the adrenaline rush, quick thinking time lapses of games like this, then this game is your bread and butter. However, with the cops, and shooting, it's far less enjoyable on my end. I don't think it's a bad game, and I plan on finishing it. But I paused mid-mission so I could write this review, because if I die one more time to a cop, I'm going to break something.			"

												Excellent traceur navigation, beautiful environments, lovely white highlighted by primary colors, a fresh step away from the bleak brown shooters of today. Its beauty is accentuated by nvidia physx, The first person point of view is superb and makes you feel as though you are doing the action yourself. the only things it is lacking in is the story, which is sub-par, and the gunplay(though this is definitely intended). But at the end of the day, cumbersome guns and contrived stories can be disregarded, since all we want to do is leap around on rooftops anyways:)Don't forget to check out the reboot too! It's running frostbite and will be even more beautiful, and it has some sweet new moves to perform!			"

												Mirrors Edge is a first person shooter unlike anyother, a game that rewards the player for avoiding combat and taking advantage of the fluid parkour to dodge their foes. It leaves room for the player to decide how they want to play, if they want to take the moral highground and avoid as many casualties as possible, or if they want to get their hands on one of their enemies firearms and blast their way through each mission. The art style of this game is also something that ties in perfectly with the play style, the sharp contrast of the white buildings with neon indoors and the hidden poverty that lurks in the backalleys. Although as much as this game is great it is not without its flaws, the storyline can often be confusing to follow and the missions are somewhat linear limiting the player to how much they can take advantage of the fluid movement in the game. All in all I highly recommend this game for anyone that needs a breath of fresh air from their standard shoot 'em ups.			"

												There are lots of videos on internet about people climbing walls,jumping roofs to roofs etc. Well in Mirror's Edge you need to do that stuff to move on. Just imagine how fun it is.			"

												I love this game. I played it through so many times that I just had to get it when I lost my hardcopy from the 360.Needless to say. It's an OK port. 60 fps better graphics and smoother visuals and faster loading. All that jazz.But I can't recommend it for 2 reasons.Game doesn't save data over Steam shutdown. All controls are not adaptable to keyboard-mouse (basically the display doesn't change with different hotkeys).Save data doesn't save.SAVE DATA DOESN'T SAVE.What the hell.			"

												EDIT: In case you can't see it, I currently have 19 hours in this game, mostly in offline mode.     Mirror's Edge, I'm sure, is going to stay one of my all time favorite games. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is relaxing, and the parkour is very fluid. This is the game I play when I get frustrated with CS:GO (I'm not the best). It does have its faults however. It will require you to pick up a fallen enemy's firearm every so often, and the gunplay is less than desireable, which is surprising coming from the creators of Battlefield (DICE). Aside from the poor gunplay, the levels sometimes incorporate live, die, repeat, Super Mario Bros-esque jumps that make the game feel almost unfair, but when you finally do make it (usually by utilizing some aspect of the environment that was previously overlooked), the rush of victory and accomplishment feels great.     The game makes you play through it on easy or normal difficulty the first time, which means Runner Vision is enabled. Runner Vision highlights different objects that can be used to navigate to your destination, which I find can be immersion breaking. Hard mode is unlocked after your first playthrough. It increases the combat difficulty and has Runner Vision permanently disabled.     I recommend this game to everyone especially when it goes on sale for $5. You have no reason to pass this up. The story isn't memorable, but the relaxing, detailed atmosphere and simple, fluid parkour controls make this game a must have.			"

												EDIT:I wrote this review in about 5 minutes of fast typing, which isn't enough to express how much I LOVE THIS GAME! It is the best gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame in existance, and I think you should buy it to support ME2, or even just give it a play, as this game is EXTREMELY underrated________________________________________________________________Mirror's Edge was such an interesting game and still stands out from the crowd in 2014, even with the release of Mirror's Edge 2 sometime soon. From momentum and wallturning and wall-grabbing your way through the city to prove your sister's innocence leads you from a financial district to The Shard, in which you start from the bottom, leave and come back in and get to the top, kind of like if you go to The Shard in real life. Anyway, this game was so underated for its style which is even incorporated into Dying Light, a Zombie Survival Parkour game, where the parkour reflects Mirror's Edge to the point where Mirror's Edge could finally get the recognition it deserves. I have played about 7 hours I think by now, and I have played about 50 Hours on the PS3 version. Unless I like it, I don't spend that much time on linear, story based games. The only exception I can think of here is The Last of Us. The combat of Mirror's Edge is where this game fails to deliver though. The parkour makes up for the dreadful combat and countering. You can use weapons but you only have until the ammo depletes (which is only one clip) and Mirror's Edge 2 looked promising and I will buy it... for its parkour. I couldn't give a s*** about the story and I f***ing hate DICE and EA working together. I'll call them... DICEEA - Digital Illusions CE AB EA because the gameplay will 'focus more on combat'. WHY!? Mirror's Edge is about parkour not combat and because different people are making the sequel, the have NO IDEA what to do so they focus the game on combat over parkour because in my opinion, DICE give out orders to their workers of 'if you don't know what to do, involve guns. because we love guns and WE WANT GUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!' so... yeah. I think that Mirror's Edge 2 should be bought in a sale of either 100% OFF! or 200% OFF! But knowing EA, I think this sale on Origin would be '0% OFF!' On the plus side, Mirror's Edge doesn't have any DLC. Shocking, I know because it is made by EA. Oh wait... not on Steam. On the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, the Pure Time Trials are a thing that I own. However... for some reason, it 'isn't compatable with the Steam version' and my theory for this is that EA found that most game copies were bought on PC rather than PS3 and Xbox 360 versions and so that if people will buy the PS3 or Xbox 360 versions and the Pure Time Trials to get more money. Classic EA People, Classic EA...PunsKeep the FaithLeap of FaithNo running gags(More for me to remember soon!)			"
