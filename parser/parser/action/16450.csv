												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a first person shooter horror game, developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Brothers. The game was released on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360 in February 2009. This is the second game in the F.E.A.R series. The gameplay in F.E.A.R. 2 remains almost identical to the first game. The slow motion bullet time makes a welcome return, and the ever brilliant gun play. The AI has also been improved too, and will now be even cleverer when it comes to taking cover. A nice feature which is new though, is that you can knock over certain objects in the world to create extra cover, such as file cabinets, desks and tables. I also realised whilst playing F.E.A.R. 2, that the original didn't include down the sights aiming, since this is also a new feature here. Probably the best and most prominent feature is the addition of being able to control robot mechs. The moments in F.E.A.R. 2 where you are in control of a huge mean mech blasting through enemies and destroying buildings, is really something special, and is a memory I will carry with me for a while from this game. One of the biggest problems I had with the original F.E.A.R game is that I didn't find it very scary. Thankfully F.E.A.R. 2 mends all those wrongs. This is a really scary game and had me jumping out of my seat at times. The game doesn't rely on jump scares to keep you creeped out though, there is genuinely some really scary moments, the eerie atmosphere in some of the levels creeped me out to the max! Graphically, F.E.A.R. 2 is only slightly better than the original which I found to be a little disappointing given that there is about a five year gap in release dates, but one redeeming factor here is, that the game can be played on various resolutions, going up to at least 4K so you can still churn out some decent looking moments.  I also cannot fault F.E.A.R. 2 in the audio department though, all of the characters are voice acted, sound effects are well made too - I enjoyed the moments of listening to the enemy radio chatter as well.F.E.A.R. 2 is by no means difficult, I played on medium and the only times I died was when I did something stupid, like jumping off the edge of a building by accident. FPS veterans should really be playing the game on hard mode right from the get go to avoid the game play becoming stale and repetitive. Throughout the game's seven chapters, each level has plenty of collectable items to find which will flesh out the plot and back story even more, it is well worth heading down a corridor which is off the main path just to get these little snippets of information as some of the information you get is really quite interesting if you are a fan of the F.E.A.R series thus far. On the topic of level design, F.E.A.R. 2 uses the same sort of concept as the original in that you can be roaming around a building for a good amount of time before you finally realize the way you are supposed to be going. The addition of some sort of map would have made this type of problem become minimal but it does add to the suspense as you don’t know what is around every corner! I finished F.E.A.R. 2 on medium difficulty in just under five hours. I felt rather disappointed to be fair; I was expecting a play through to last at least as much as the first. I may try playing through again on the harder difficulty but that is the only replay ability the game has with its completely linear level design and story. Much like the first game too, I also had a small technical problem with the game's auto save function. This seems to happen at key moments in the game, but you will also notice a sudden frame drop, meaning you lose the immersion slightly and it just feels really janky. I am not sure whether it is an issue with the engine but like I said, I had the same problem with the first game so it may be a common issue with the series thus far. Apart from that, I only encountered one more problem, in that on one of the latter levels, the ground suddenly became see through, this was easily resolved by a quick relaunch, but I did end up losing a bit of progress on the stage since I must of not reached the next checkpoint which was rather annoying. F.E.A.R. 2 is really just an OK game. I would still class the first game to be a better game though, even though the horror aspects of 2 are a whole lot better. The shortness of the story is a real draw back and the lack of any proper replay ability means you should really be looking to get F.E.A.R. 2 when on sale for less than £5.

												Rating: 7.5/10Overview: FPS with the ability to go into slow-mo The Good:+Game looks good both artisically and technically. Game also makes good use of lighting+ Game has a variety of weapons and grenades. Certain weapons are very creative while others are what you would expect in a FPS+ The game has really solid level design. In addition, the game takes place over a series of different environments and locations. One of my biggest complaints in the first FEAR was that the environments were too similar and felt repetitive so it's nice to see this was fixed in the sequel. +The shooting mechanics feel good, going into slow-mo and shooting enemies is always fun.  The game also introduces sections where you ride a mech to change up the gameplay.The Average:The AI feels average compared to the first FEAR. The first game was renowned for its amazing AI and to this day I still think it sets the standard for AI in a FPS game. This game though doesn't seem to have that.  The AI is not bad by any means, however compared to the first game it doesn't feel close.The horror elements are not as a good as the first game. Between finding a balance between action and horror the developers chose action.  There are certainly plenty of times the game tries to invoke scares but sometimes it just comes across as flat. One of the most satisfying weapons in any FPS game was the shotgun from the first game. In this game, the shotgun doesn't even feel close to satisfying. I found the game to be very easy even on the normal setting, play on hard if you want a challenge. The Bad:- The dialogue in this game is terrible. It makes the story feel like a straight to home video release. It becomes difficult to take the story seriously or be afraid of what's around the corner when the characters are saying things that just make you shake your head.  -The game has a certain flow to it but the entire ending gameplay segment feels frustrating and out of place. -Multiplayer is deadConclusionOn the one hand this game does things a lot better than the first, on the other hand it also doesn't seem to improve any of the flaws and in some cases makes it worse. What could have been a really great horror FPS game turns into you standard run of the mill FPS game.  For a FPS game it is very solid and should provide you with a 5-6 hours of fun.  "

												This is basically a watered down version of the first game. Still a pretty kickass game and I never get sick of shooting the propane tanks on the backs of the bad guys and watching them get blown apart. DLC is about 30 minutes long so avoid that like the plague.Full video review:

												Having never played F.E.A.R. 1 I had no idea what to expect from this game. I was pleasantly surprised and had a blast playing F.E.A.R. 2.  The game looks good and plays well and has a decent storyline to keep you more than interested. This is the first game in a long while that I've wanted to play and finish because it was just that good. It also didn't matter that I hadn't played the first in the series and I wasn't left confused by parts of the story because you had to have played the first one to understand. I would highly recommend this game if you like horror genre FPS. This game delivers and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Project Origin is a direct follow up to the original game released in 2005. It took Monolith 4 years to cook up a sequel and they decided not to change much on the formula that has worked once. But 4 years is a long time and sometimes innovation is better than playing it safe. That's exactly why Project Origin falls short of its predecessor. The formula remained the same, but the audience has changed.The game picks up right the time when the first games is about to end. To be precise, it starts a couple of minutes before the end of F.E.A.R. You are a part of Delta Squad and you're sent to place the head of Armacham Technology Corporation into protective custody. It's when sh*t starts to get serious and a nuclear blast bakes most of the city as a result of the original F.E.A.R. team's endgame. In the rest of the game you move in and out of underground facilities trying to achieve your ultimate goal. Even though the campaign lasts only around 7 hours the story is detailed and interesting. On the other side, you have to pay attention to every detail that happens around you or told to you on the comm because if not you'll find yourself lost in the web organisations and projects thrown at you in every couple of hours. At least if you do get lost eventually right before the end of the game everything will be cleared up in 5 short minutes.The gameplay is very similar to the first game. Little has changed; slow-mo shooting is still great but the novelty has faded in the past four years. You will meet various enemies during your gameplay starting from soldiers, genetically modified monsters, mechs to ghosts even. The game will always try to throw something new at you which is nice, but eventually you'll immediately recognize the spacey room where a firefight is going to take place in 3...2...1. AI was a strong part of the first game and it returns in the second one too. However, it doesn't always work like it meant to be. Sometimes the enemies will be clever enough to kick over tables and take covers, but in other cases they will try to rush you through the same door where you'll stand and shoot them one by one. The Delta Squad, your mates aren't the most brightest either. Most of the times you'll see them splitting up and getting killed (because of the story) and the writers could've written better lines for the voice actors too. Being a psychological game you'll never feel surprised of your team members being killed off. What is worse you'll never feel pity for them because they're unlikable, two-dimensional dolls.Visually F.E.A.R. 2 is a real mystery. On one hand it presents a great world with some stunning lighting effects and great destructibility, on the other hand it's ugly. Everything looks sharp when you move, but stop for a moment a take closer look at minor objects, like consoles or books on desks. They look downresd, blurry and pixelated. The devil is in the details as they say. In the year when hardware pushing games like Modern Warfare 2, Resident Evil 5 or Killzone 2 were put on the shelves of retailers this kind of laziness is disappointing. One can look aside when it comes to these problems, but then there is the audio. The sounds of guns are just atrocious; every one of them sounds like they were taken out from an 80s Atari 7800 game. Every shot you have to take with the shotgun or machine gun irritates your ears. It's like firing with toy guns from the crappiest Chinese manufacturer.F.E.A.R. is a decent shooter with its flaws and assets. The formula that made the first game great has aged greatly and the horror factor is M.I.A. in most of the game. Great number of ""tricks"" has already been used up in the previous title or other games. When the horror is present the game feels like a real successor of the prequel, but those moments sadly end quickly. It definitely has its moments when it comes to shooting (the mech scenes are great), but drawbacks won't allow to have an experience like with the original F.E.A.R. game.Rating: 68/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 7 hours; Played on: normal.

												Primary from a cinematic standpoint in 2005, F.E.A.R. was an essentially innovative and distinctly competent modern shooter which elevated the genre and was reasonably enough considered the spiritual follow-up of pioneering Half-Life. Despite overall skills and significance in presentation and gameplay, the indisputable lack of variation in environments and fairly dull level design left a significant mark of an overrated first-person-shooter ovation. In response to certain issues, developer Monolith diligently implements a couple of noticeable changes in the inevitable sequel, however, not only are former flaws repaired, other flaws take shape while some are accelerated. All things considered, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is still a skilful and spectacular first-person-sequel, operating within competent mechanics without the elevating relevance of the predecessor.The first-rate atmosphere associated with the intense original unfortunately appears weaken as the objective of a Delta Force member (that would be you) united with squad mates is about to capture the unapproachable president of the suspicious Armacham Corporation that is currently being observed. However, as the objective backfires due to the nuclear incident previously witnessed by the original protagonist, mysterious events involving iconic Alma and Project Origin (hence the title) require some serious unravelling.Although original F.E.A.R. was hectic and spectacular enough in action, this beautifully keen and further expensive sequel boosts up the pace of dynamic visuals and sound more efficiently. While combat certainly is improved, the original game’s innovated bullet time appears further enhanced; as explosions of gunfire and grenades create additionally impressive visual and audio distortions, the masterly conveyed reflex time adds gruesome levels of bloody violence and enjoyable death animations. The superb audio direction continues the frame of reference mode and the excellent soundtrack provide the proper mood of excitement. The strength of the sly artificial intelligence seems preserved as well, offering plenty of unpredictability and enough challenges to evoke your alertness. As before, apart from the occasional change for the worse, enemies more consistently than not continue to response to your presence by flanking, covering and communicating with one another. Your weapons to encounter these opponents remain efficient and versatile, though with the exception of adding a couple of useful new models, the previous arsenal is fairly enough unaltered. A couple of armoured-suit sequences in which you enter a giant metal robot armed with machine-gun and rockets, similar to ED-209 in Robocop, have been added to bring some needful variety in chaos and destruction.Unfortunately unlike F.E.A.R., the story and atmosphere in the sequel is not as intriguing and dense as the up to date components of action, graphics and sound. Apart from an overall decent tension and a certain memorable elementary level, engaging narrative and dramatic devices is hardly founded, despite solid voice-over and half decent dialogue. A great number of readable items attached to the events taking place can be picked up and TV news reports can be seen, but there is rarely a penetrating moment that touches commitment and the unfolding of the story is distractingly abstruse. The occurrence of predictable jump-scares and basic clichéd creepiness has accelerated and become a bit tiring, but some of the attempts are at least decent enough to startle.Regardless of changes made to address certain issues of the acclaimed yet overrated predecessor, the final outcome of the sequel ironically still suffers from issues. As overall aspects of F.E.A.R. are reasonably kept intact, some elements are obviously improved while others unfortunately are impaired. The criticism of repetitive environments receive attention in variation and that mediocre level design is put to an end, however, exterior surroundings turn out to be quite illusory, reaching the silly corridor formula rather than opening things up. Furthermore, the strikingly tight atmosphere from the original is compromised since the pace of the action is picked up even further and the horror perspective is considerably downgraded into sporadic eerie pieces. Nevertheless, Monolith ambitiously creates a skilfully competent, partly enhanced follow-up that in most parts deliver a solid shooter without the essentials.7, 5 / 10			"

												My favourite from the FEAR franchise. Monolith kept all the core elements of the original game (slow-motion ability) and they added some extra features, as well: occasionally you can jump into a huge mech and literally destroy everything in your path. These are great scenes - they are uplifting and bring some extra action the original game lacked. I know it is a psychological horror in essence, but there's nothing wrong with upping the action if you already have the slo-mo making combat fun. The player can now push objects, e.g. you can now turn over tables and hide behind them. I think fast reflexes serve you better so I did not really care about the cover-based approach, at all. Overall, the game looks and runs better than the original and it uses more vivid colours - the psychological aspect they could still keep without having to apply too many dark colours and shadows. There are more enemy types, more supernatural encounters and - in my opinion - a more interesting story. Instead of Point Man you now take control over a member from a delta squad which is tasked to protect the president of Armacham. The first level takes place just before the ending of FEAR so you can see the explosion from a distance and then go through the city only to see the devastation caused by Alma. There are some interesting findings and many collectibles that further explain the background of the Origin project so I'm not spoiling anything further here.The game wasn't exactly praised much upon its release. A lot of people from media considered it just an average shooter, a shooter that can easily be forgotten. I disagree with this - I believe FEAR 2 is a very good sequel and great care and attention was put into the making of it. I suggest you buy it and skip its awfully short DLC content.			"

												I find it'll be easier and less messy if I just put this as a Pro's and Con's list rather than an essay type review. At least for the most part.The Pro's:  -The graphics are quite good (player models, environments, etc), even by today's standards.  -Similarly, lighting and shadows are similarly fantastic.  -The voice acting is quite good as well. Notable actors such as Jen Taylor (Halo Series), Phil LaMarr (Halo, Metal Gear Solid Series) and John Patrick Lowrie (Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2) make an appearance in this game.  -While I see that some disagree, I quite liked the story, and thought it elaborated more on Alma and the Armacham Corporation's backstories and helped make me more sympathetic towards Alma.   -I also thought the environments were a bit more varied than the first, although there are still a couple cut and paste corridors now and then.  -The physics and game engine are quite good, and you don't need top of the line specs to run a good looking game like this.   -Several improvements were added (IMO) such as ADS, Sprinting, moveable cover, destructable environments (kind of), and more.  -Sound effects (except for a couple weapons) and overall audio are top notch, easily some of the best I've heard in a game.  -The sense of tension from the first game is still there, albeit toned down a little bit.  -The Elementary School level 'nuff said.  -Also unlike some, I enjoyed the ending, even if it was a bit WTF? at first.   -There's also an awesome  mech suit portion , even if it is a little out of place in a ""Horror"" game.   -There's a lot more, but those are the major things.The Con's:  -The game isn't as scary as the first, while I wouldn't call any of the F.E.A.R.'s genuinely horrifying (I'm pretty hard to scare however, not true for some people) the game often made noises, or flickered my HUD and either did nothing with it, or focused the scare somewhere where the player's attention wasn't designed to be focused.   -Some of the gun's lacked the ""Oomph"" they had in the first game, particulary the Shotgun and the Sniper Rifle (The latter wasn't in the first game). I quite enjoyed the feel of the shotgun in the first F.E.A.R, the one in F.E.A.R. 2 though feels and sounds particularly lackluster. Grenades also lack that ""Bam, Pow!"" sound when they explode, even if the explosion looks cool.   -The game is easier than the first one, which is caused by several things. On Moderate difficulty (a.k.a Normal) I often found myself just walking out and shooting enemies using Slow-Mo without even touching any sort of cover, something that you couldn't get away with nearly as much in the first game. Slow-Mo also lasts longer than the first game, at some points later in the game (after collecting reflex boosters) I could finish entire firefights in one use of Slow-Mo. I also didn't die very much, something I can't say from the last game either. Also, enemies aren't quite the bullet sponges they were in the first game (not a bad thing IMO), but this makes for firefights being a LOT easier, even with lots of enemies.   -The game is also shorter than the last one, the last one took me around 8-9 hours to beat, this one only about 7.  -The Enemy A.I. has definitely been tuned down from the first game, it's not awful, but many enemies will run out of cover, or rush you for no reason, which is a big change from how they acted in the first game. I've also watched A.I. blow themselves up with grenades and just not run away from them in general (Although this was rare.)Personal Cons (less important stuff and silly nitpicking, but maybe these things bug you as well):  -  Paxton Fettel  isn't in the MAIN game aside from being mentioned in documents. (I know he is in the DLC. But I liked him quite a bit in F.E.A.R  1)  -They took out the option to lean in and out of cover.  -The game has a more CoD/ modern shooter feel, rather than it's more unique first game feel.  -Speaking of which, this game added QTE's, there's not a crazy amount and their done with a decent amount of taste, but I still think they were unnecessary.   -The default controls are really odd, Shift to aim, right mouse to melee, V for thermal vision (which you use only once or twice in the whole game AND it's not necessary) the first game had similarly wonky controls, but it's still an odd thing to not change with a sequel. However, the controls are easily rebindable.   -The film grain visual option is on by default, it adds a nice atmosphere to the look of the game, but after a while began to give me a headache when combined with the motion blur, so I turned the film grain off.   -There's a turret section, two of them to be exact.   -All  Armacham and Replica Soldiers  look pretty much the same, aside from the visual differences based on the ""type"" of enemy. They also don't sound as badass as they did in the first game. Hearing a Replica soldier yell ""Flashlight!"" in a gruff voice was kinda awesome.   -The game also uses the horror game trope of somehow magically seperating you from your squadmates, and the FPS trope of having the environment become destroyed to become a perfect pathway to get somewhere.    -For such a good looking game, most of the skyboxes in this game look pretty bad and you can even see that the skyboxes go under the level in some places.-You are also a stereotypical mute protagonist, which makes for a couple of odd ""conversations"" with your squadmates.      Now, I don't usually give a number score with my reviews, (be it Steam or elsewhere), but I feel it's necessary with this one. Why? Because despite me having seemingly more gripes than likes about this game, I don't want you to feel that impression.      I like this game quite a bit, almost as much as the first game, and would highly recommend you buy it. $14.99 is pretty good price to pay, or about 9.18 Quid/British Pounds. It's a good shooter overall, and a pretty decent horror game besides that, which makes for an pretty good game all around. Finally, for the magic number, I'd give it an 8.5/10.			"

												What everyone says about this game is dead on. It's a good game, it's just not a good F.E.A.R game. Almost everything in F.E.A.R 2 is a step backwards from the original title and its expansion packs. The AI is dumbed down, the graphics are weaker and blurry, the physics are worse, and the horror is almost absent. I would almost recommend playing F.E.A.R 2 before the original F.E.A.R, but I feel that would just take away from the greatness of the original title. F.E.A.R 2 is still worth a play through though.			"

												Before I started F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin out I was a bit worried that they might’ve changed too many things in it. The first F.E.A.R. was so amazingly well-balanced and fun that I wasn’t sure if I was gonna like the sequel. Turned out I worried about nothing because the game was even better than the first one. They kept the stuff that made it fun and improved everything! The graphics looked super good, the atmosphere was fantastic, the weapons were fun, minibosses awesome, the mech parts glorious, and the shooting as addictive as ever. I loved the fact that they switched the levels around a little bit to make it more interesting. Like I mentioned, at one part you’re in a mech, another you’re traveling in an underground cargo platform 100 miles per hour shooting enemies jumping on from all sides. It’s really fun. Even though the atmosphere is a lot better than in the last game it still feels a bit cheesy and it’s hard to get drilled into the narrative. Also, you feel really detached to the main character which doesn’t help when you’re trying to get invested in the game. Still, it’s a damn good shooter.			"

												Better than F.E.A.R 3, but not better than F.E.A.R 1. F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin follows a whole new cast of characters as they navigate through the ruined city of Auburn to stop Alma. You play as Sergeant Becket, a regular old military man who was sent in to rescue Genevieve Aristide, but unwillingly gets mixed up in a plan that involves cleaning up what remains of Armacham and Alma herself. F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin takes the great gameplay from F.E.A.R 1 and improves on it. There are more guns to use, more grenades to throw, you can now flip objects to make cover, and they fixed the melee system so you can't speedrun by kicking everyone in the knee. My biggest complaint is that the Intel you collect is no longer in audio form, but written out. It's not really a big deal but I don't want to have to stop the game and read what is going on.F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is only as scary as you make it, literally. The game relies a lot on events that are triggered by the player rather than being scripted. While this sounds great in theory, you can miss a whole bunch of stuff if you don't take the time to explore. The biggest fault with the horror is that sometimes Alma jumps out at you and you fight her off... with a quicktime event. The game itself runs some tropes with a hospital and a subway setting, but surprisingly avoids the little ghost girl trope by making Alma older.It's not quite as good as F.E.A.R 1, but F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is definitely worth playing and is worthy to be called a sequel to F.E.A.R			"

												FEAR 2 was the first game in the series to be designed for consoles first instead of developed for the PC and later ported to consoles, and it shows in some ways. You can't lean or quicksave anymore, and the AI is notably worse (though still better than your typical FPS grunt), which isn't helped by the fact that the more confined level design generally doesn't give the enemies as much of an opportunity to show off their intelligence. It makes up for the losses by having generally smoother gameplay, better variety, and an increase of the weapon limit from 3 to 4, though, and remains at least about as much fun as the original game, if not maybe more fun. While FEAR 1 had two relatively lengthy expansions that added new enemies and weapons in their campaigns, FEAR 2 just has one DLC, Reborn, and while the main game is definitely worth getting, the DLC, which now costs nearly as much as the base game itself, is not. It basically just condenses a lot of the enemies and gameplay mechanics of FEAR 2 into a roughly 40 minute campaign, so if you just really liked FEAR 2 and want a quick encore of it then it might be worth picking up in a sale for a dollar or two, but it doesn't really continue the story or follow up on the base game's pretty bizarre ending in any relevant way except for explaining why a character shows up in FEAR 3 so if you don't plan on playing that you're probably better off just skipping it entirely.

												It's fine. Like incredibly fine. No it's not the scariest thing, nor the best shooter I've ever played. But playing through FEAR 2 is enjoyable. You're going to have a good time toiling about killing things and experiencing one of the most genuinely ""video gamey"" stories out there. It feels so authentically 2009 in it's presentation and design, that it's almost a nostalgia driven delight to play through.			"

About The Games:The F.E.A.R franchise has always been & always will be a game about ""The Paranormal"" expect a lot of Ghosts in each of the games more so in F.E.A.R 1 & 2. That generally has a solid story line and to be expected in a game about the paranormal plenty of gore & jump scares. THESE ARE NOT BAD THINGS!F.E.A.R had you playing in the shoes of an unknown solider for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon Team"" or F.E.A.R for short, you went in and you were tasked to capture a test subject who was designed to control these ""Super Soldiers"" for a war. The project was a success except things went wrong & the leader went nutso & so you're here to clean up the mess.The ReviewF.E.A.R 2 has you playing the role of a new solider named ""Micheal Becket for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" who is in another squad & is deployed just before Harlan Wade released Alma in the first game, you were tasked to find & capture a doctor who was working on the test subject & then you are to eliminate the test subject & attempt to shut down project Origin by eliminate the main ""Ghost"" who was causing all the mayhem around the city, unfortunatly things don't pan out so well & then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan & of course once more you're trying to battle your way out of the storm.F.E.A.R 2 starts off right before you're deployed into the field, the first conversation from your squad fills you in on the parts you may have missed or if you didn't play the first installment fills you in on what has been happening for the first team. From here you're given a good understanding of your team & then you're plopped into the game and off to start your adventure.F.E.A.R 2 focuses on it's story more than F.E.A.R 1 did & it adds even more into it's ""creepy atmosphere"" by giving you a lot more of the Ghosts you knew and loved in the first game, it also adds more fluent combat in the game by making combat seem more stable and flow well, unlike in F.E.A.R 1 where combat felt kind of chunky.F.E.A.R 2 also saw a huge improvement in the Graphics department with a better engine, more impressive textures & even better shadows than F.E.A.R 1. (That game had some very impressive Textures & Shadows & even games today (2014) have trouble matching.)The Gameplay in F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin is based more on exploring & reading the many stewn about conversations & lab notes dotted throughout each map filling you in on the story & what has been happening with the Origin Project with a hint of action and a lot of Ghosts to spice things up from time to time. Expect nothing much different here as there was in F.E.A.R 1 where you were fighting Mercinaries, Super Soldiers & the occasional Mech, except this time you won't always be fighting on your own 2 feet, sometimes you get some help from your own Mechs.The Verdict:While F.E.A.R 2 is very impressive & most certainly improves on every aspect of the first F.E.A.R it's not what i could call better if anything F.E.A.R 1 & F.E.A.R 2 are very much at the exact same level as each other and it's hard to recommend either of them over the other, you really need to get both of them.F.E.A.R 2 brings you better graphics, more fluent combat & more creepy ghostly moments than F.E.A.R 1 but it doesn't beat the initial feeling that F.E.A.R 1 brought to the gaming world, where it added the ability to carry a gun during moments of intense action & still managed to make you be ♥♥♥♥ scared of an unknown presence waiting to tear your face off.F.E.A.R 2 also brought you an expanded version of the first F.E.A.R's story & made it's self well preserved in the sequal.The Rating:My final rating for F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin is a 7/10F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin brings you everything i said above, improved graphics, more scares & better gun play but it also feels somewhat lacking of what F.E.A.R 1 brought us. It could just be me feeling nastalgic about F.E.A.R because it was nothing short of another DOOM 3 experience when i was younger.And now i ask myself the question.Do I Recommend This Game?:My recommendation is most certainly a YES, this game deserves a playthrough at least once just because it's a good game & it expands on F.E.A.R 1's design flawlessly.Buy this & F.E.A.R 1 if you're able to and you'll most certainly have an enjoyable experience.Further Reading:Check out my Review on F.E.A.R 3: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/21100/ "

												Monolith had a wonderful reputation when it comes to sequels – for example: No Lives Forever I and II, Aliens Vs Predator I and II and to those who remembers Blood I and II. Unsurprisingly these are not the complete list of games produced by Monolith however I'm highlighting the fact that their sequels are normally better than the first. FEAR was a huge blockbuster that captivated many players to the world of the unknown; things that goes 'bump in the night' for which a famous icon of 'who's afraid of a little girl' was born. Given the proven past performance, it will be a daunting task to see if FEAR 2 supersedes FEAR in action, storyline and able to stand on its own two feet.So the choice here is that whether you prefer all-out combat and uncanny AI (a.k.a. FEAR) or a decent story (a.k.a. FEAR 2) yet the irony is that to truly respect FEAR 2 is to play FEAR first (like seeing Star Wars before The Empire Strikes Back). As a standalone FEAR 2 certainly brought dashes of horror and tries to break the 'story' barrier of introducing a new squad but it's not at all a replacement. Play it for what its worth however bare in mind that FEAR 2 is part two of the story hence really couldn't stand on its own two feet if viewed independently.(full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/f-e-a-r-2-project-origin/user-reviews/2200-466600/)7.9 / 10			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: MonolithPublishers: Warner Bros Interactive Initial release: Feb 2009Genre: FPS, Horror #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationF.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin is the sequel to the “classic” F.E.A.R. and I don't have much to say in the way of a traditional review. Its a shooter, its kind of cookie cutter but a kind of weird shaped one that is sort of intriguing so you play with it a bit. This game continues the story from one but it doesn't really add much to me. Its sort of blasé. I didn't find myself engaged with it really at all. The horror elements are also lackluster. I don't recall a single moment where I felt much tension. In fact there was an area clearly designed to be scary in which the lights flashed on and off while apparitions bombarded the room only occasionally doing damage. In this cacophony of confusion I was not frightened, nor did I feel tension. The enemies had become a nuisance and I was unable to easily distinguish a path let alone the correct one. As far as hallway shooters go.. its fine. The guns feel good. People die. Slow motion will always be awesome. There are more modern touches for this game than the first with iron sights. However older elements like leaning have been removed. THE GISTAs a game on its face. Its still very fun. Shooting people in slow motion will be a staple of action games forever. But as a whole I feel very “meh” regarding the whole game. Especially in comparison to one.This section isn't really part of the review per se, It's more of a rantI feel like this game has suffered the proverbial “consolization” process. I feel as though it has lost its soul. As in the developers had their original vision in F.E.A.R. 1 made the game they wanted and are now forced to take that vision and pull on and stretch it to create more content. I feel very strongly about Crysis 1 compared to Crysis 2 and the reason I bring this up is that I feel the same thing has happened here. Both sequels took away what made the original games so unique in exchange for a standard cookie cutter hallway shooter. And I get it. From a business standpoint no one is ever going to say throw away what makes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money for something more creative and unique. Unless the formula really has gotten stale and a new IP actually is the better risk assessment for staying in business. I understand that businesses need to make a profit in order to take risks. At the end of the day I still recommend this game because it is fun. Its mindless and I hate to repeat myself but shooting people in the face in slow motion is really fun. There are also some mech and turret sequences with some really ironic music playing in the background that are sort of qwerky in an endearing way. It just feels a little soulless.Follow my curation for more "

												A little short compared to the content the first F.E.A.R game provides (completed F.E.A.R 2 in a little over 8 hours), but with the Reborn DLC things look OK. Compared to the first game this one looks A LOT better, combat is flashy and feels really responsive. Most of the original weapons are present, but most of them are nerfed - the shotgun is noticeably weaker, which is fine considering that in my 3 difficulty runs in the first game I would use only the shotgun and the Penetrator occasionally. In F.E.A.R 2 the combat is also a lot more open spaced and the level design is a move forward in general, as the different office buildings from the first game do get quite tiring. The story is gripping enough and the horror elements do have their disturbing highlights, especially toward the end.I do also want to make it clear that the game is pretty flawed in some regards. First, it's the supernatural enemies - the different ghosts and fast moving zombies, which appear about halfway through the game. The supernatural enemies, like in the first game, are just tedious to fight. They feel cheap, as the sound effects that give them out are really subtle and it's really easy for them to flank you and hit you a couple of times for free before you can fill their heads with bullets. In the short intervals when I had to fight them I was incredibly bored and was just hoping that some more gunfights with Replica soldiers would come soon. Secondly, it's the AI. Compared to the first game it's actually a lot worse. Replica soldiers will rarely use grenades to get you out of cover. They will instead empty their clips in the wall or table you're behind and proceed to die to you while reloading. On the other hand, it's near impossible to sneak up on them anymore. A lot of times I would actually switch off my flashlight and try to sneak behind their squad for an elaborate flank only for them to immediately know I'm in the viscinity, saying nothing on the radio and just opening fire at me. Pretty disappointing, because the first game is still a cornerstone in believable AI, a decade later.Overall I do recommend the game, it's a fun, kinda arcade-y shooter that looks great even 8 years later and counting. A bit on the short side, and with a few flaws, but coupled with the first F.E.A.R installment it's a quintessential game to play for fans of the action game genre.			"

												A step down from the first F.E.A.R. game. Shorter, downgraded guns, larger hud and smaller FOV. In exchange you get turret segments, quick time events, and cutscenes with characters you won't care about talking about stuff that doesn't matter. Why is the lean gone?			"

												So I've just started playing F.E.A.R 2 after completing the first F.E.A.R and I've gotta say F.E.A.R 2 is a lot scarier. However it has a few improvements and shortcomings over the original F.E.A.R but most of it makes up for it. F.E.A.R 2 takes place directly in the aftermath of F.E.A.R 1, just minutes before, actually. Because of this there is a lot of cross-referencing and it makes it much more enjoyable, as well as new and plentiful intel files and such that offer lots of insight into your character and also characters from F.E.A.R 1. That's all there is to it, really, I'll point out some pros and cons which will be updated as I play.Pros:-Four weapon capacity instead of three-Much, much scarier.-Sprinting system, and it's not forced upon you like in COD because you can only do it for a few seconds.-Graphics are better and more enjoyable. Has the same movement system with that strangely satisfying gun movement as you walk.-Much more grenade types and such-Tons of different enemy variations. You're not fighting Replica's and ATC security throughout the entire game like in the first F.E.A.R-Some objects can be moved to be used as cover, and there's a satisfying animation for it-Sleek, immersive HUD that has an explanation to it.-Lots of in-depth intel on weapons, characters, and other things.-Can aim down the sights now-Did I mention it's a lot more scary?Cons:-Removal of leaning system-Can only carry 3 medkits instead of 10-The difficulty is marred by the fact that Normal is laughably easy and Hard is mind-numbingly difficult with enemies able to take your armor AND health down in less than four shots. Monsters take 3/4ths of your health away in one bite on Hard.-Supposedly quite short. I'll judge that when I beat the game.-Cannot dual-wield anymore, however personally I did not enjoy dual-wielding in F.E.A.R 1 as it was forced upon you in some ways.-Small one, but the shotgun does not knock people on their ♥♥♥ anymore, and it's quite underwhelming in damage. Especially on hard. Having beat F.E.A.R 1 on hard, this urks me more than it should.~will add more~			"

												Unlike the original FEAR, the sequel is no longer a novelty, and worst of all, neither the gameplay improved, nor the story advanced. You are again trying to find a little ""scary"" girl. FEAR 2 doesn't seem to have the atmosphere of the original game either, so it basically becomes another average shooter. Not even unsettling a little bit. Hence I couldn't enjoy it at all, although I liked the first game. I do not recommend it even to those who liked the original FEAR.			"

												It starts minutes before the ending of the original F.E.A.R., and puts you under the role of Michael Becket, a Delta Force sergeant, whose squad's objective was to capture Armacham Technology Corporation's president Genevieve Aristide and bring her to custody. The plan was crushed due to catastrophic events happening, and turning the city into ruins. The game maintains the core gameplay elements from the original game, and incorporates a couple of new features into it. The stunning graphics which have improved, the breathtaking soundtrack, and most eerie scares remain present. What we have is the essence of F.E.A.R. with a couple of touches and a different storyline. A sequel that grasped to me and did not disappoint for the most part. An overall excellent game, 9.0/10.0 "

												The really weird FEAR of the three. I was overjoyed of finally having varied environments, but apparently the change in the level's layout borderline killed the AI. It's so incredibly dumb after the first game, enemies tipping over tables for blockade then hiding at the side of it (being a clear shot) or just running towards you. So this is a letdown.The biggest plus of the second game that single-handedly made it my favourite: they learned how to tell a story. Having meaningful cutscenes, finding data logs, puzzling together so much more about the story than we knew made the game  really enjoyable for me, despite I could not take the shooting really seriously because of the AI. Though about shootings: weapons are quite nice to handle, granades are powerful and you're able to cook them so you can modify where they'll blow up, and their throw is *really* consistant - it's a fantasticly well working feature.If you can get past that the first FEAR is the ""most FEAR"" game, and treat the second as a less horror, more action and more story game in the first one's world, then you're in for a treat. I had low expectations but got utterly surprised how much I enjoyed it. (Huge thanks for the granades, really, if you play the game, don't forget about them! :D )			"

												Played F.E.A.R. several years ago with a buddy of mine, great game even though my memories are now almost gone..F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin is quite a beautiful sequel: it's an ""old school"" First Person Shooter, you know about that: get the ammo, medpacks and fight replicas (enemy soldiers) while following Alma's trails (main story).The most peculiar feature of this game series is time reflex enhancement which lets you slow down time, giving you a tactical advantage over a crowded enemy line. Game is plain simple, advance to next level taking down enemies and that's pretty much about it but you have nice weapons, different type of bad people along the way - not only soldiers but visions and monsters/creepy creatures. The setting is dark and there's plenty of blood, gore; visual effects are very well done too, vivid colors and spark lights contrast the black surroundings.Gameplay gets entertaining from the beginning to the end because there are many cutscenes, the story is well told and developed: you could say this is a ""complete"" FPS which doesn't go down in any aspect - it may not be a masterpiece but I think it's worth playing, especially ""if you already had F.E.A.R."" :)			"

												If you played the first game, be prepared for a dumbed down, but flashier and more story based, experience.Though the story is expanded upon, unquestionably, the game is now a linear corridor shooter with jumpscares and quick time events (that don't work well with keyboard, in a game that doesn't have gamepad compatability).While you may enjoy the game, it ends on a cliffhanger that FEAR 3 fails to deliver on, so invest in this at your own risk, keeping in mind that the multiplayer itself is dead.Edit: According to {EliteNoobSquad}Puškin the multiplayer is not dead.I wouldn't know personally, I wrote this review ages ago and there werent any servers then, so enjoy at your own risk.

												If you like horror games and first-person shooters then the F.E.A.R. series is for you.  The first F.E.A.R. game was good but it's a product of its time so I didn't enjoy it as much as this one.  F.E.A.R. 2 is way better than the first one!  The AI enemies are smarter and more natural compared to the first game.  The controls and weapons are better too.  As for the horror part, wow!  The jump scares and special effects are so much better and less expected.  There also seems to be more scares compared to the first one.  Since the graphics are better it makes the horror more chilling!  Since I play lots of horror games the scares have to be good to get me.  In F.E.A.R. 2 I have to admit, it got me in a few places.  This game is a good pick for the horror genre.			"

												Overall whilst F.E.A.R 2 may not have been as good as the first game and its expansions, it did a great job of continuing the F.E.A.R storyline along. Now let's take a look at the pros and cons!Pros1. Excellent combat and gore added to this game, i think the gore even tops the first game!2. The campaign length was fairly decent and even managed to overtake the original game in length! (6-8 hours.) Whereas the first one could be clocked in 4-5 hours.3. Included a nice change of scenery in comparrison to the old game, going from indoor factories, to an abandoned school and walking through deserted towns.4. The game pieces together the characters only mentioned from the original game very well, well enough for you to have a clear understanding of where they slot in the story!Cons1. Combat wasn't as fun. The hand to hand combat was a bit brought down in my opinion and the enemies had better rag doll and physics, seeing as the orginal included a ""John Woo fighting style.""2. The DLC or expansion F.E.A.R 2 Reborn was a bit disappointing. Whilst the story was pretty good it was no where near the same length as the original games expansions, or as fun for that matter. 3. The story wasnt as interesting as the original for obvious reasons... (No Pointman mentioned or Fettel) 4. In a lot of instances the textures from the original still seem superior to this game as the replicas look better and the textures are more smooth! Overall whilst i may prefer the original, this game has still given me just as much fun as the original and makes a great addition to the series. For $15 you really can't go wrong with the purchase and it wont let you down!			"

												For a long time, as a movie fan, I wasn't quite sure of the difference between a horror and thriller.  Later I was able to piece it together:  Both are about adrenaline flow, but only one actively tries to scare you.I bring this up because it's exactly what acts as a parallel between the original FEAR entries (all three of them) and FEAR 2 Project Origin (and the Reborn DLC).  The original FEAR entries were intense games of cat-and-mouse, skulking about in the shadows hoping enemies with flashlights or automated turrets don't spot you, occasionally broken up by moments of first-person perspective horror more akin to Silent Hill than anything.  FEAR 2 drops this almost entirely - it has only a little bit of the surreal horror, and even that is played more as climactic narrative elements rather than memorable filler.  Each one of these scenes tells you something about the story, and as such they're less throw-away, but because of this, they don't scare you as much as they did before.  It's no longer a horror - it's now a thriller.But having said that, FEAR 2 is a pretty outstanding thriller.  There are moments of genuine tension (like when some troops are resurrected around you in small groups), but by and large, it's an action game with a greater emphasis on intensity.  The atmosphere is solid, the gunplay is less ""fun"" than in most FPS titles, and the horror thematic elements allow the missions to take an almost random turn at any point, sometimes outright breaking reality, and this keeps you on your toes.  The campaign is also rather lengthy, with an absolutely AMAZING ending sequence, so all in all I most certainly recommend this game.On a side note, the Reborn DLC is an excellent 90-minute or so secondary campaign that actually expands the story considerably in interesting ways.  Yes - it's DLC that ACTUALLY MATTERS to the future of the story.  For that alone, as well as the fact that it's just as fun as the rest of the game, I recommend getting the Reborn DLC if you can as well.			"

												A step backward for the franchise, shuffling the games studios didn't help, but the story maintains its excellence.  The biggest problem is the generic nature of the engine.

												""They get what they want and they never want it again"" Courtney LoveI think this is a sad case of super human developers ""who listen"" to us mere mortals. We didn't appreciate the original's stripped down, function corridors designed as a showcase for ALL the sparks and particles (as well as the cutting edge A.I. and gun play). So they gave us these beautiful and ""bioshock detailed"" locations (special mention to the school).We complained it was too grey...now we have neon blue sparks, strawberry jam blood. and a wide variety of locations and pallette.We said it was a bit repetitive, so now we have these mech levels...At this point of community ♥♥♥♥, we got our own way and basicly this franchise , which at one point was like the second coming of the fps genre along with HL2 was basicly left VERY pretty and crying in the shower. Just another  Z list shooter.I realy like it, but i realy miss that pornographic emphasis on particles.As it is , its a shining example of the genre and a realy cool development of the origninals story			"

												This was an amazing follow up to F.E.A.R. The game looks great even though it came out six years ago. The controls are so smooth and there is improved aiming as well as being able to use the environment for cover. Better graphics mean that gore looks...really gory! Also, freaky stuff looks really really freaky. Alma is baaack! This game takes place right after the events of the first game. Throughout the game you are able to find files (shinies!!) to flesh out the story. The game also has achievements. I wish Steam would simply transfer the in-game achievements to their own list of achievements. Oh well. The story and horror elements are stronger felt in this game as you fight different types of soldiers and monsters and uncover more about Project Origin. Also, don't forget Alma. She is quite the force in this game, always waiting for you...F.E.A.R. 2 took what was great about the first game and simply enhanced it. All who loved the first game should definitely play this game. A good blend of action and psychological horror.			"

												FEAR 2 isn't perfect, but it's certainly something special.  I simply can't see a reason why you wouldn't want to give it a chance-- unless you haven't played FEAR 1, of course, in which case you need to throw all your credit cards at the screen immediately and get that game.  Think Half-Life with crazy effects, slow-motion, a crazy conspiratorial plot, and Alma getting up in your grill to give you the spooks.  It has a few shortcomings compared to its predecessor, but also has the same great design and mechanics of the first game while subtly building on the established setup.Just like the first game, FEAR is a horror game told from the perspective of a mute John Wu.  It's terrifying, it's dark, it's atmospheric... but you're John Wu.  It's a fantastic game with Half-Life style storytelling and great writing, not to mention fantastic combat.  But...That Ending.  Just... that ending.10/10 would explode brain and get spooked again			"

												I find F.E.A.R 2 one of the best horror fps game ive ever played along with the first F.E.A.R and for example Doom 3,This game was in my opinion how the previous games should have been however there are some features better in the previous game than in  this one: + The weapons look really cool                                                            + better cover system                                                       +for me  i found F.E.A.R 2 more frightening than the first one ( from time to time u cant                                                         use ur flashlight and everything is dark                                                      + the story gets more interesting and has become more complex than previous                                                      + u can ride a power armor (mech) wich is really cool :)                                                       - u cant use dual pistols anymore wich i found a bit dissapointing                                                      - if u are a regular fps player u should at least play on hard to get a challengeI recommend this game to any fps fan, its a challenging game with a story rich campaign, or to ppl who love hentai although u cant see alma's nipples ( just kidding).

												This game was fun but went downhill the longer it went on.  You could really predict when the combat was about to start because the pacing was pretty much the same throughout the whole game.  The best part was that I finally understood that most of F.E.A.R. 2 could have been cut and...well the rest of that thought would be a spoiler.Oh, and I had to change the difficulty from Hard to Normal at the very end because it was over-the-top difficult. I hate when I have to do that.  I'm all for a challenge, that's why I set it to Hard in the first place.  But when you go overboard and bump the difficulty of the last levels from Hard to Yeah-You-Aren't-Finishing-The-Game-At-This-Difficulty you ruin an otherwise engaging experience.Like in the first F.E.A.R. I had fun again but I don't know why.  The story wasn't too compelling, the gameplay was predictable (or I'm getting good at seeing arenas when they are shown to me) and the entire premise is just...forced.  But it's a fun game.			"

												Playing F.E.A.R., its extensions and then F.E.A.R. 2 is a great lesson in FPS history and in the way triple A ♥♥♥♥ed up everything the way they did around 2008 ; when trying to improve on their licenses while having absolutely no grasp on what made their franchise good in the first place.The game does have some improvements when compared to the earlier title though.+ It's prettier and had aged relatively better than the first one.+ There is some NPC action seen onscreen.+ There is an attempt at having a story.+ The gunfight feels less one-sided and you can actually play it without constant slo-mo.+ Functional ladders, maybe even the best ladders in FPS hystory.+ Balsy finale... That still feel a bit off on the direction but was a bold move.Some changes are neither good nor bad.= One more weapon slot (you didn't need more than 2 in the first game anyway).= You only get slo-mo power ups rather than health and slo-mo, having played through F.E.A.R. 1 expansions I found that only those upgrades really mattered.= More linear than the previous game. While F.E.A.R. was nothing exceptionnal in that regard you often had 2 routes to your enemies encounter, allowing you to flank the ennemy.= You don't really get to have stealth kills in this one, but it always felt like an underused gimmick in the first one.= Call of Duty submachinegun Ironsight will most likely be the main thing you remember from this game.= Mecha sequences. Someone was apparently really upset that SHOGO 2 got cancelled... They are alright.And some are for the worse...- ♥♥♥♥ing ugly pistol.- Dumb QTE.- One terrible QTE boss.- No quicksaves.- Random checkpoints.- Shotgun nerf :(- Only 3 medkits. And the healing system makes little sense overall.- Bullet-sponge enemies that can one-shot you on hard when you have 100% life and some armor left.- Too easy on Normal, frustrating on hard because of the checkpoints.- I have played through really bad written games (I'm looking at you Crysis) but I think this is the worst game I ever played in that regard.- ♥♥♥♥s up its own ambience pretty bad, F.E.A.R. had some scarce jumpscare and cold sweat moments, this one only managed to make me jump in the opening sequence, the rest is just really badly paced and out of place when it's not downright boring.- Ennemy AI feels ""dumber"" than in previous game.I'm still happy I purchased the bundle on sale, because F.E.A.R. 1 and Extraction point are really pleasant to play (Perseus Mandate was forgettable though) but I would not recommand the purchase of F.E.A.R. 2, even (especially?) if you liked the first one.Overall, 4.5/10.

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin manages to continue on with the achievement that its predecessor began; it manages to nearly perfectly combine horror and action into a single game.  Though they keep the two genres seperated by making each segment devoted to one, it is done extraordinarily well and I can't think of a better game than this one to scratch both itches simultaneously.The story is enjoyable and the combat mechanics are well done as well.  The variety of weaponry was an entertaining aspect of the game as well, each player might end up with a different arsenal at the end of the game based on their tastes.  The horror scenes were enjoyable, and some parts were downright scary (I'm looking at you elementary school). My only real complaint with F.E.A.R. 2 was that the story seemed to get a little slow right around the middle.  Once I returned to the game after a short break and powered through another level, it got very exciting, though, and I'm very glad that I kept moving forward.I recommend this game to all fans of FPS and horror.  The game was enjoyable on both sides of that.  If you are a fan of the original, definitely pick this one up as well!			"

												This is hands down the most enjoyable FPS I've played since HL2.This game came out in 2009 yet it still looks amazing.It plays so well that when you see more enemies sprinting your way you don't think ""Oh for god's sake, this again?"", but instead ""Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes, bring it on!"".This game was £2 in the Halloween sale, but I totally would have paid full price for it, no question.Also aesthetically, this game is grey, dark and dreary, but it somehow makes that...interesting! It keeps the action strong by changing the location every ""chapter"", creating new environments, which are all detailed as hell, and full of character.I was aware of this game before, but labelled it as a game that just wasn't for me. But just like Bioshock, I got it in the sale and played it and enjoyed it and looked back at it and can say with nothing holding me back; This is a new favourite game.8/10			"

												FEAR made its mark as one of the best first person shooters of all time, and a monumental achievement in video game horror and storytelling. FEAR 2 barely seemed like it tried to do better, but neither did it try to only be more of the same.The gameplay took a bit of a turn for the generic, falling into the recent crowd of iron-sight shooters that encourage you to be a lightning-fast bulletstorming hero. The first game had realistically inaccurate weapons, but allowed you to lean from cover, both allowing and forcing you to be more delicate about how you handled each firefight. FEAR 2 has no lean ability, so cover is substantially less useful, as you have to expose half your hitbox to get the crosshairs on your enemy.Melee and slowmo are still there, hardly changed, except that melee attacks are no longer one-hit kills to common soldiers. Action-heavy sequences such as the giant mech suits essentially act as glorified turret segments, desperately trying to out-bullet your foes.As far as horror goes, the original FEAR was a little in-your-face with a lot of the scare scenes, but handled the atmosphere with excellent subtlety and sensitivity. The atmosphere in FEAR 2 is far less satisfying, as it is, in turn, much more outrageous. Outdoor segments are often punctuated by blood red skies and outrageous ambience, failing to immerse the player the way the original did. Sections of the game relying on simple, tried and true atmospheric tricks such as low lighting and eerie silence are much more effective.Some of the enemies tend to be legitimately terrifying as well, often in conjunction with the superior atmospheres of the levels they appear in. Watching the Remnants idly try to act out their lives as they did before they died is deeply unsettling, and sneaking past open cell doors knowing Abominations stalk between the darkest corners slowed me to a stop even on my second and third playthroughs.Unfortunately, in keeping up with modern action titles, FEAR 2 undermines a lot of its horror by forcing you to escape scripted insta-death events with furious button mashing. Naturally, the biggest draw to a sequel to FEAR would be the pseudo-'antagonist,' Alma. After FEAR, I was left in eager anticipation to see what she might wreak upon the world. Everything that goes wrong in FEAR 2 is because of Alma. Her character is handled reasonably well in the sequel, even as she is far more apparent and active in trying to get in your way. Her comparatively bi-polar nature is unnerving, as you're never quite sure what she's trying to do to you, though this might instead be confusing to players who struggle to follow this considerably more disjointed plot. A lot of imagination went into furthering Alma's story, but its difficult to decide if that imagination came from the passion of the writers, or their desperation to be more unexpected and outrageous than last time.Bottom line is, FEAR 2 is not the sequel I hoped it would be, and certainly not a landmark achievement in any of its genres, but it came closer than it could have. Many parts of the game toe the line in terror and storytelling drawn by its predecessor, but it never exceeds it, and fails to maintain that level of quality throughout. It's worth picking up on a sale for anyone who wanted more Alma, more FEAR, and more slow-mo scissor kicks, and if you're like me, largely unsatisfied by the so-called ""Vivendi timeline"" of Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate.

												F.E.A.R. 2 improves on many things that were bothersome in the first game, but also changed things that didn't necessarily need to be changed from the first game. The combat is vastly improved and more fun than ever, but the horror element are not as effective as it was originally. The graphics have been buffed up significantly since the series debut, with better lighting effects, a deeper color palette, and some cool ghostly visual effects. However, the new engine the game uses seems to strongly favor a console design which is apparant through the enlarged UI, unnecessary quick-time events, and other additions to the gameplay design. So let's get right into it, what makes FEAR 2's gameplay so different? For one, level design has been changed dramatically. In the original FEAR, levels were sporadic hallways that twisted around in an endless maze of confusing warehouse and office building design. Thankfully, FEAR 2 has more believable environments with larger outdoor areas that feature plenty of cover to play with the weapons you want. The game allows you to carry an additional weapon, now maxing out at 4 but reduces the amount of healthkits you are allowed to carry from 10 down to a measly 3. This never really bothered me though, I played straight through the game and probably died only once on the normal difficulty setting. Enemies are very easy to overcome thanks to the ability to slow down time whenever the situation gets out of hand. Unlike the original, enemies take a lot less damage to kill and all of the weapons feel effective including the SMG. The melee in this game is still terrible. I used it in a few situations, but never did it down an enemy in one hit, so I felt as though i had wasted time meleeing when I could have just been reloading one of my guns. The game offers quite a few large weapons like a rocket launcher, sniper rifle, laser gun, and even some experimental blue shock gun. But I never felt as though any of them were really necessary. The game offers these huge weapons but never really presents an enemy that they felt effective against other than the one or two big mechs you have to take down. There's also a few levels that give you access to your very own mech which is fun to use. You can mow down countless enemies with powerful miniguns and launch a load of rockets at heavily armered mechs whilst using a cool thermal vision. The horror element that the game's title would imply just doesn't seem to be there anymore. ALMA no longer appears as a little girl in creepy places, and instead the big jump scares in the game are just the teenage naked ALMA running at you and forcing you into another repetitive quicktime event. I kept waiting for a big scare but it just never happened. The story picks up close to the end of the first game, right when the nuke goes off. You take the roll of a new silent protagonist who also happens to have the ability to slow down time and shoot people, which makes absolutely no sense because now you're not even remotely related to ALMA in any way. The game has some more interesting characters than the first game, but not interesting enough for me to even remember their names. They feel more like disposable puppets used to shock you whenever ALMA shows up and decides to kill them, and never did I feel emotional towards any of their inevitable deaths, despite the music and other character reactions implying that I should. Unfortunetly, FEAR 2 removes the cool answering machine background storylines that helped give more life to the world and instead replaces them with boring PDA text files that you are told to find in every level. I liked the answering machines more because they didn't interupt the gameplay itself and allowed me to listen while I was looking for the next exit. So overall the story, just like the game itself, does some things better but then does some things worse. The graphics have taken an inevitable leap forward, with an engine that really gives me that ""Unreal 3"" vibe. Especially when you shoot enemies and they turn into ridiculous bloody red mists and yell out similarly to the ""Boomers"" in the ""Gears of War"" franchise. While the game as a whole has more interesting colors, especially in the Elementary School level, the game as a whole felt like a blur of red, gray, and a slightly darker gray. The UI is enlarged to rediculous proportions (most likely to make it more readable for console users) and large prompts appear on screen whenever you approach an object to interact with like a door. Everything about the game itself implied that it was a console port, but thankfully the game has aged well and performance is without any faults throughout the entire game. So to summarize, the gameplay is more action oriented and more fun than ever, but the horror element behind the game suffers deeply because of this. The storyline is pretty uneventful, save for the ending that cliffhangs into the sequel, but it's easier to follow and more interesting than it was in the first game. The graphics are better, but there are many indications that this game is simply a console port and considering it came out in 2009, it could have looked a lot better had it not been held back. Definitely recommend giving the game a try as it was a fun simple shooter, but it certainly isn't the masterpiece that I've been told it is.			"

I recommend playing this at night, it creates a horriffic atmosphere, there are thankfully no cheap jumpscares and the horror scenes are done very well, but most of the time the ""flickering"" is being used too much and from point it stops being spooky.As for combat it feels like a call of duty game (Unrealistic weapon Recoil), headshots do more damage but dont instantly kill the enemy, and yes as you expeted from the previous game, the AI is actually tactical and well made.

 F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin  The second part of FEAR in my opinion the best game of this series. In the game you control a member of the anti-terrorist unit named Michael Becket. The plot is extremely addictive and the climate will keep you held the seat from the beginning to the end of the game. The main antagonist is the leader of a terrorist group but also a little girl (to be precise mature woman) named Alma. I have to admit, and even now the graphics in this game looks very nice as well as lighting. Opponents are mostly terrorists, Replica Soldier and sometimes, depending on the stage will fight with paranormal beings and mutants or something like that. As for the weapons, there are even a lot but it's more about the feeling when we use them. The biggest flavor is ""Bullet Time"" so that we are able to slow down time. The game I would recommend to anyone, the game has a cool story, atmosphere and soundtrack. Certainly you will experience dose of action but also and fear. As for the multiplayer I am played with a few minutes and I have to admit that it is cool.  "

												SPOILERS AHEAD : In this game you play as special ed student Lee Warner who has the ability to slow down time by clenching his sphincter muscles. On his way to school one day, Lee's happy and care-free life is turned upside-down when a tragic short-bus accident kills all of his friends and his mom and his dog. Hell bent on vengeance, Lee injects roids, which combined with his natural retard strength makes him an unstoppable murdering machine. He later learns that the mysterious and sharp Pointy Man and his hoot of a partner Owlma flipped the bus over using magical powers and that they're gonna blow up the whole world if Lee doesn't stop them before snack time. Lee soon discovers that his friends are alive thanks to the bus driver being a closet necromancer, and sets out with his best friend, Woody Harrelson, to stop Pointy Man and Owlma's evil plan. In a strange twist of events, in a sweaty fit of roid-rage Lee, while screaming at the top of his lungs and charging into battle, crushes his own balls between his legs by accident and collapses at Owlma's feet. She then proceeds to violently ♥♥♥♥ him and impregnate herself with all three of his remaining sperm cells. The final scene of the game shows Lee re-murdering his ressurected bus friends and joining Owlma, Pointy Man, and Drew Barrymore atop the world to watch it all burn. Great fun for the whole family. 2/10 would recommend.			"

												Granted, I finished this game in basically 2 sittings; yesterday and today; May 1-2, it was a fantastic experience. There were answers and tidbits of information throughout, there was atmosphere, some occasional scares, sci-fi mystery, the action is far better than the first FEAR thanks to things like iron sights and select fire as well as the different grenades/explosives you have at your disposal. The story was, for me, quite engaging. I was very interested in finding out how things progressed, and the end had me looking forward to FEAR 3. Well, you can check my review on that if you like, but here's the several paragraphs of hatred summed up in 2 words: It Sucked.I find FEAR 2 to be by far the best in the series, FEAR 1 is 2nd best with monotonous but acceptable combat as well as great atmosphere, and FEAR 3 is... well, let's not ruin the moment by bringing that up again. I wholeheartedly suggest getting this game, and while I think it'd be good to play FEAR 1 first, I definitely think this game can be enjoyed without doing things chronologically. Just... make sure you STOP at FEAR 2, unless you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about story or firearm realism, just wanting to blow stuff up with the occasional little needless spook from Alma or other unexplained monsters. Maybe FEAR 4 won't suck... but if it still focuses on that ridiculous 'brother' nonsense, screw that...			"

												I never did play F.E.A.R 1 just because it dint look very good. it just looked like a first person shooter with some jumpscares thrown into it. But then a long time ago i played the demo for F.E.A.R 2 in ps3 (witch i have to ask what happened to that area you play in the demo? was it removed?) and i decided to buy it recently. Im glad i did and here is why:pros -interesting story-fun gameplay (for the half of the game atleast)-good jumpscares and creepy atmosphere-visuals are amazing-Slow-mo mechanic that is fun to usecons- cliffhanger ending ( what hapened to the main character? did he die?)-gameplay gets repetitive eventualy-jumpscares get repetitive and aren't as scary later onWhilst this game is pretty fun for most of it , it does get a bit repetitive towards the end and i found miself rushing the game.  And finaly my opinion on Should you buy this game?If you like horror games and fps shooter games then yes , you shouldthis game has very fun fps sections and scary horror sections.			"

												Because Alma is Alma. Whoever never played FEAR can't understand why.Anyway, FEAR 2 is putting you in the shoes of Michael Becket, a sergeant in a special unit, used to answer to any kind of special missions involving paranormal (F.E.A.R.). Unfortunately, he's sent to retrieve Aristide, the mighty CEO of Armacham Technologies, that has something to do with the current problem in Auburn district. After a powerful detonation (the ending of the original F.E.A.R. game), he wakes up in an hospital, with people trying to kill you and with Alma Wade, the powerful spirit, taking an interest in him.The plot serves to erase Perseus Mandate (a weak link) and Extraction Point (one of the best add-ons I've ever played) and to make a continuity in F.E.A.R's universe by the original developers. While I find it interesting as it's focusing also on Alma Wade's personality and her conflicted feelings. It's true that in itself, Armacham is a company with many secret projects (Origin is one of them, hence the title of the game) but I'm more attracted to Alma's struggling and story than Becket's.Anyway, FEAR 2 is a FPS, like the previous game. While in FEAR, your HUD was pretty simple, in FEAR 2, it's more elaborated, like you have connected glasses or helmet on the head. However, Becket, during the story, will acquire a power that the Pointman in FEAR has: bullet time. True, Becket isn't Alma's son contrary to the previous hero and the previous antagonist. But trust Armacham to play with your character.Anyway, that bullet time is very useful when you have to battle strange creatures or Replikas, clones and soldiers that are controlled by telepathy. You're not alone to fight: the rest of your team is helping, though they're nearly all affected by Alma apart for your lieutenant. Anyway, you fight, you shoot and you take advantage of your environement. You choose which weapons to use, you improve your power thanks to syringues and you collect information in the form of folders. That's how the story is also revealing itself.FEAR 2 has some hard passages, mainly in the high difficulty (hospital, research center, the last fight). While it's well-balanced, you have to be resourceful. Even when piloting an EVE (big robots), you need to take into account everything.However, FEAR 2 is perhaps more tragic than FEAR in the sense that Armacham never hesitated to cross lines for experimentation. It was already creepy to learn Alma's story in FEAR, here, you're learning that she wasn't the only one to be exploited like a piece of meat. While it makes sense to explore an hidden hospital as you were operated, to try to find a way out of Auburn destroyed or to put an end in another hidden compound, it's shocking to find the truth in a school and mainly what's under it.While the previous game was mainly set during the night, this one, when outside, is a daylight game. However, as you're in a battlefield, the graphics are showing this world in chaos, whether you are. And they're pretty good for this game. You're not let down during your hallucinating periods (Alma's doing) or when you're in the real world. Alma herself is less creepy in her adult form but only because she wants to appear normal in Becket's mind - else, she's still the creepy young adult that seeks revenge on the world for what happened to her and her sons.The soundtrack is also very good, fitting to the fights or to the important moments. The voice actings are also good. If anything, I've two favorite tracks that I've listened a lot when I used YouTube as my playlist.Anyway, I loved this game. I'm just sad that there is no Steam Cloud - the technology back then wasn't spread or existing for other games - though it's been a long time since playing but I remember when I changed desktops, that's how I discovered that I've to unlock everything again, as the game has ingame achievements.Like any FEAR, even FEAR 3 that I still need to play, the best is still the plot and Alma. FEAR 2 is an excellent sequel, though I wish Extraction Point to be still cannon - forget about Perseus Mandate. That game is a must-have.			"

												Gone is the intrigue. Gone is the intelligent gunfights. Gone is the sense of 'FEAR'.FEAR 2 is unfortunately a game that virtually feels lost during its development. Monolith is the studio who made the popular Shogan game previous to FEAR, and FEAR 2 is some kind of bizarre cross-over. The franchise at this point has become lost in translation. It no longer has the slow pace, building tension, between amazing gunfights. The whole game has become a B-movie sci-fi chiller. Enemies now consist of dumb sparsely populated goons in crappy generic-looking masks.But as initially fun as it may seem to jump into a mechanical military exo-suit, and start blowing everything up - you soon realise Monolith have succumbed to the Call Of Duty cliché. The fun wears off very quick and you remember you wanted to play FEAR, not Mechwarrior.It's a damn shame. FEAR with its smart enemies should have been the template for future FPS games but instead we're stuck with dumb AI and scripted events thanks to the obsession of console-oriented games (COD). I can only reommend this on the strength of a half decent FPS, it nearly has nothing in common with the first game. Big disappointment.			"

												This game was certainly an improvement upon the original F.E.A.R. but it still has it's faults. But first let's talk about the pros:- improved gameplay- better graphics and lightning - decent amount of content- interesting storyNow the bad things about this game:- The shadows look worse than the original F.E.A.R. even on max settings- Some things were cut from the orignal F.E.A.R. that I would of loved to kept (i.e. slide kicks)- gets kind of boring after playing for a couple of hours- not scary but more funny (probably just me)If you played the original F.E.A.R. you will also be disapointed at the fact that there is no point man but you just start off as some random guy with a parallel storyline to extraction point, if you can call it that as this game doesn't relate to extraction point in any way.This game is still worth a try and should be played, even if you haven't played the original F.E.A.R.

												IMHO this game is much better than the original FEAR. I enjoyed it so much, even though it's still a warFPS (only human bots) for about 85% of the game. The first game seemed to me two games in one, a horror story adventure and a warFPS, and these two were not much in context. But FEAR2 is really ONE contextual game. Sadly it's a console port but still far better than some other i saw. Good work Monolith!Pros:- Very hyped graphics. Millions of details and if you are carefull enough you can find many small references of Alma's past.- Weapon system is perfect. Four weapons can be held, and the weapons itself are very enjoyable (except the Napalm Cannon).- Weapon sounds are good, ambient sounds are perfect, music is better than perfect.- Alma is cooler than ever. No ugly Fettel, except for the built in expansion (Reborn).- The machine cannon and moreoverly the power armor parts are awesome, especially the thermal view of the armor.Cons:- Still a warFPS for most of the time with boring human bots uses way too good aimbot hitscans. Nothing better than one-hit instakills by snipers!- Only ingame achievements, no Steam.- Some part of the game is needlessly hard. The fight on the moving freighter against countless Replica elites and the Reborn campaign 2nd level is unfair and frustrating.- Console port, though a better one, still cannot use more than 3 mouse buttons.8/10 Very good horror warFPS.

												Project Origin tells the haunting, fearful tale of EA's drunken decision to create Origin in the alcohol-induced delerium that they can compete with Steam, oh wait that's not what Project Origin is, my bad.I've heard people say that the FEAR sequels aren't worth the time to play, that they've decreased in quality over the years. However, since I loved the first FEAR and it's expansions and since FEAR 2 was relatively cheap I decided to give it a whirl, and I'm glad I did.One of the things I loved most about the first game was the dynamic gore system, FEAR 2 amps the gore up, almost making the gore on par with Left 4 Dead 2 despite it's engine age. Enemy dismemberment is still brutal and satisfying, especially with the tight-as-a-toigar shooting mechanics. The combat is fast-paced and sends your heart rate soaring, with level design and first-person animations that are immersive and with an inventory that can easily be depleted if you're not cautious. Just like FEAR 1, the combat is the top-selling point making the entire gameplay experience delicious. The developers also improved on the combat, granting the player an extra two weapon slots, more powerful firearms including sniper rifles and flamethrowers and even the ability to further interact with the world in the form of creating improvised cover against enemy fire, you can slide out couches, push over cabinets, and yes, even flip tables  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻While FEAR 2 improves on all of FEAR's strong points, all the weak points remain untouched. The story is yet again lacking, failing to grab my interest and any exposition to it results in my impatient finger-tapping, the characters all feel two-dimensional and seemingly only exist to die at a later point in the game. The worst part of FEAR 2 is quite easily the creepy little girl jump scares. Jump scares are cheap shots, with no build-up and having no need for atmosphere, they are a blemish upon this game. One thing I was dissapointed about was the removal of Q+E leaning, which left me more exposed to incoming fire that I felt was needed, as well as the removal of quick-saves, leaving me 100% dependant on the foul teet of autosaves. Ignoring my quips, FEAR 2 is a really fun game, with it's combat, music, level design and explosive action, I'd definately recommend any players of the first FEAR to give this one a go.ALSO YOU CAN DRIVE A MASSIVE OVER-FREAKING-POWERED BATTLE TANK ARMOR SUIT OF SEXYNESS HOLY GUACAMOLE THAT PART WAS FUN.

												A good game at ITSELFS but against The first F.E.A.R. game its weak on some points, instead of look around corners you can now use tables, closets and other stuff as cover, nice idea but makes battles harder.The story is ok, the gunplay is still amazing (if you dont count the too way overpowered shotgun units, its like you fight against snipers with shotguns), the only problem i have with the game its not so scary as the first 3 games, but the ghosts sequence are ok.I have the game (badly) censored but F.E.A.R. is really one the games i have no problems with it, sure splatter here body parts there, but if you really play on the hardest difficulty you even wont look a this stuff, i spend more attention at the gunplay and the ghosts squence.

												F.E.A.R 2 is a divisive game amongst series fans, and the majority of the hate it gets doesn't make sense. There's only one real complaint I have with F.E.A.R 2, which is the game just doesn't seem to have the same level of care as the original. By level of care, I mean:-The FOV needs to be set through a .cfg -You can't lean-There's a weird delay to sprinting-The hud is terrible-The game feels slimmed down. They're all minor quips, but they're noticable. If you're willing to give it a chance, F.E.A.R 2 is a worthy successor that I feel surpasses the original in some respects. It's not as good as Extraction Point, but it's a game that's definitely worth a play. It does suffer from Wolfenstein: The New Order syndrome, so know that the game gets much better after the first three chapters.Play on hard and make sure to get the fixed hud mod through me or google because the standard hud is straight fugly.

												I was always told that F.E.A.R. was the best of the series and after playing F.E.A.R. 2 I agree, I still have to play the third one though. As I expected, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was a huge improvement both graphically and gameplay wise. I'd say it's still a great looking game and I could clearly notice how the gun handling was improved. I felt like on the first game the recoil was somewhat too much and needed more recoil compensation on the player end but on F.E.A.R. 2 I think they've ""perfected"" the shooting to better suit ""casual players"", while I think this is a good thing I understand if others think that the first game had more ""realism"", if you can call it that, to the weapons. One thing I still find to be rather ""lazy"" about F.E.A.R. 2  is that most of the guns are basicly just new skins of the older ones, you've got the assault rifle, the submachinegun, the ""penetrator"" but I gotta admit these new skins look pretty damn nice so I forgive them, one other thing, or maybe it was just me, I'm pretty sure they re-used the enemy voices and player and enemy animations from the previous game, I'm not complaining they did just the right job but I still find it lazy on the developers end. At the end of the day they did a pretty good job in keeping the shooting just as great as in the first game with improved visuals and gun handling, not to mention you can pilot Mechs on this one which I found out to present a nice variety of gameplay but, they did also put some turret segments in the game (I believe two), which I feel they didn't overdone it like some games. Still I think despite of having a great shooting experience, F.E.A.R. 2 wasn't that tense or scary as the first one, I think that's because of the improved graphics everything looks more ""colourful"" while in the first game everything looked kinda dark and sinister. In the end I think F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a fine piece of work and definitely a great shooter with a nice continuation to the F.E.A.R. plot and the ending clearly gives you the clue that's more to come, I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, either if you're looking for a great first person shooter single player experience or a first person shooter with a paranormal twist to it, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is clearly the game for you.

												A decent sequel to F.E.A.R. The best visual design in the whole series – something more than just gray walls of underground complexes. Not much of horror in it and AI behaviour is simplistic making the enemies easy targets. However, the story is pretty good and it answers many questions I was previously confused about.What I didn't like was that it wasn't always clear where to go and that the quick save feature is removed.Nevertheless, it's a good game and I recommend it to all fans of the franchise.My overall rating: 7.5/10.Many say that F.E.A.R.3 was the worst game in the series, but I think that Project Origin is the one that deserves the third place.F.E.A.R.2: REBORN DLC: you play as one of the replica soldiers guided by Paxton Fettel, who is dead at the time  (shot by Pointman in F.E.A.R.). In terms of gameplay, Reborn is like Extraction Point, but much more sloppy. It offers only short 5 episodes (an hour of gameplay). There's not much of a story and enemy spawning and positioning isn't thought through well. It would be acceptable for an euro or two, but for 8 €, it's a steal. NOT RECOMMENDED.			"

												ATTENTION: REVIEW WAS WRITTED BEFORE PLAYING FEAR3While writting this (by this I mean before playing F.E.A.R. 3) I think this part of trilogy is the best. I was very impressed at start - mostly because of graphics (I find it most beautiful game I've ever played) and this combat. Comparing to first FEAR and the addons, combat is waaay more exciting and fluent - I've really enjoyed the fact you can move things like tables to make covers.The bad thing about this game is the lack of scary moments - I think I jumped twice or three times (prologue is the scariest part). This may be caused by forcing mostly on shooting. I'm also a bit disguisted by the lenght of the game - I finished it in 7 hours, could be a little longer.Some words about difficulty - it is harder than the first FEAR and PM/EP. Enemies look like more clever and more intelligent than before.Anyway, I think this game is the best FEAR game.I can't say anything about Multiplayer, however.			"

												I’ve heard some people say FEAR 2 is inferior to the original game, but I actually prefer it over FEAR 1. Most notably, the graphics of FEAR 2 are greatly improved, now comparable to other Xbox 360 games/ports. There’s still an issue with default key bindings being weird compared to other modern FPS games, but you can change those easily.FEAR 2 picks up a little before the end of FEAR 1, ignoring the FEAR 1 expansion DLCs. This time your character has a name and you actually feel like part of a team, instead of just having a lot of people talk to you on the radio. However, similar to the first game you’re on your own most of the time when the bullets start flying. Your team is tasked with rescuing the CEO of Armacham Corporation, the private military contractor with more firepower than most first world nations. The Armacham leadership is trying to cover its ♥♥♥ by blaming the disaster from FEAR 1 on the CEO and sending in black ops teams to wipe out everyone and everything that could tie them to illegal activities. Not to mention *SPOILER* at the end of Fear 1, Alma was released, so she seems to have awakened all the replica forces around the city. You have a lot of visions of her wandering the halls and tearing people apart like Phoenix in the worst Xmen movie (you know which one). Like its predecessor, FEAR 2 is a first person shooter with a time slowing power that you can use to achieve tactical supremacy. The game seems a lot easier than FEAR 1 for some reason, possibly because the enemies don’t seem to have perfect aim anymore. There’re at least half a dozen new weapons, some of which are pretty cool (Lasers and electro grenades) and a pretty badass mechanized power armor that you can use to lay down the pain. Of course there are a lot of new enemies as well to soak up your bullets. This time around there are non-human enemies that have either been created by Armacham or were summoned by Alma’s psychic presence. You also need to fight some enemies with their own power armor (at least you have a missile launcher). A minor gripe of mine is that not all the weapons seem to have designated “roles.” For example the assault rifle and the submachine gun are basically the same thing. One is weaker but fires faster, that’s about the only difference. There’s also an energy weapon that is basically the same thing as the missile launcher. I won’t complain too much about it though since more variety is nice in a game with modern graphics. I wish there was better documentation of how enemy armor works. Most of the enemies seem to be wearing heavy armor. Does it randomly deflect bullets like in Rage, or just lower the received damage like in the Fallout games? The Hammerhead rifle is supposed to be great against armored enemies, but in a fast paced game like this, it’s really hard to see the difference. This is really kind of nitpicky though and it’s just something that stuck out in my mind, not a real problem.EDIT: I was wrong about the energy weapon being the same as the missile launcher. It seems to be more like a BFG 10k (from Doom) with lightning bolts shooting out of the main blast to fry people around it.Pros:+Great visuals and some unique looking monsters. The ghost summoner is pretty cool+A lot of “intel” items can be found in the game, which give you a flavor for the game world. It’s disgusting the kind of things that Armacham has been up to.+Slow-mo + sniper rifle = fun+Good story and a lot of replay potentialCons:-There’s this weird issue where each time a level loads, it seems to pause around 50% and not move until I alt+tab out of the game and go back in. I don’t know if this is specific to my computer but it also happened with my old non-steam version a few years ago.-The game has no Steam achievements despite having game achievements built right in (like 10 headshots or 10 melee kills). -FEAR 2 is kind of short. I went through it in about 6 hours on normal mode. It may take longer for someone who hasn’t played it before.Overall if you liked FEAR 1 you should like FEAR 2. I find it superior in pretty much every way. As much as I liked the first FEAR, I doubt I’ll replay it again because the outdated graphics really take away from the experience. With FEAR 2 I’ll keep it around to replay in a few months (smaller download size too). If you have this game in your inventory from the Humble Bundle, give it a try. "

												For whatever odd reason, there's an awful lot of fans of the original F.E.A.R. who consider this game to be inferior.  Personally I find both games to be about equally brilliant, but let's try to analyse the possible reasons for this, shall we, and see what conclusions we come to...    Firstly, F.E.A.R. 2 is absolutely, unapologetically a more blatant ""horror"" game.  A large part of the charm and uniqueness of the original was the way in which it spent the vast majority of its time being a reasonably straightforward (if thoroughly excellent) first-person shooter, with only sporadic - but thereby highly effective - bits of supernatural horror creeping in; with this sequel the devs decided to turn that balance of action versus horror into a more balanced fifty-fifty split, with all manner of beasties and what-not galore now terrorising the player as well as the expected super-soldiers and giant robots.  Perhaps some naysayers felt this made the series less unique, or made the horror less ""psychological"" and more, well, downright physical I suppose.  I can see that point of view, honestly I can.  But...I also can't really see how they could have maintained the same super-subtle unpinning of horror without simply REMAKING the original, and this is of course where all manner of ""art"" / ""entertainment"" industry follow-ups encounter controversy; not just games, but movies, books, bands, you name it.    How many people bemoan the fact that their favourite band didn't ""keep the same sound"", and essentially just keep making the EXACT SAME RECORD, over and over again?  How many people believe that Aliens took the stripped-back purity of Alien and ♥♥♥♥ed it right up the pooper-shooter by turning it into a slam-bang, high adrenaline ACTION MOVIE?  Here's the thing: You can't please everybody.  EVER.  Some people want to recapture what they experienced the first time, more or less verbatim, while others want something which is sufficiently different to distinguish itself from the original product, though perhaps with just enough in common that there's some continuity maintained.  I personally belong to the latter category.  I would much rather play F.E.A.R. 2 than F.E.A.R. 1, MARK 2.  There is a difference between these two concepts, after all.    So what one needs to ask themselves, then, is what kind of person they are, or to put it another way...if you enjoyed F.E.A.R. 1 and are wondering if you will also enjoy this one, then perhaps THESE are the questions you need to ask yourself:  Are you the kind of person who enjoyed the first game, in spite of ""not normally"" being a fan of horror games?  If the answer is yes, then perhaps this one may go too far in the ""horror"" direction for your liking.  Or are you, like me, someone who actually HUMOURED the original F.E.A.R. on account of it appearing to be something of a horror game, in spite of the fact that most of the screenshots seemed to indicate otherwise?  If so, then you're probably gonna ADORE this one.  And if you're somewhere in-between the two types of people I just described, well...wait for a sale and take a punt anyway.  Why not?  You only live once.    There are other differences between the two games, of course.  This one is arguably a bit ""harder"", not least of all in the earliest bits where you don't even have the benefit of your slo-mo ability to make up for your ♥♥♥♥-poor marksmanship (I felt THAT one, believe me).  Your ""health"" isn't nearly as generous in this one, either; expect to get more-or-less ""insta-killed""...a LOT.  The soldiers also don't tend to be quite as ""vocal"" as the earlier game...but given that the soldiers in the first game had virtual diarrhea of the mouth and a tendency to give away their location at every possible opportunity, this is arguably an improvement.  You also don't get to shoot two pistols at a time or perform those oh-so-impossible first-person jumps which suggest your character has springs instead of legs (in this one, you actually see your character's hand realistically propel him over obstacles, etc), so overall, a slightly ""grittier"" level of realism is definitely the order of the day here; and again, it's up to the individual whether they consider this to be a boon or an abomination.    If you ask me, this series didn't really start to go (and even then, only slightly) ""downhill"" until the third F.E.A.R. game; which I personally also loved to bits, though I would be inclined to agree with anyone who thinks it's the weakest of the three.  But hey, it gets harder and harder to stay ""fresh"" as a game series progresses, so what do people expect?  If you're happy to live your life in stasis, you have my blessing.  Me, I'll take a pinch of spice in my bowl, thanks.  Then again, I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to stay in the same boring old job for fifty solid years, either.  Each to their own, it takes all kinds to make the world, etc etc... Verdict: 10/10.			"

												OK sadly there is NO NEUTRAL BUTTON! this game isnt as good as FEAR 1 but it is also not that bad but suffers from many issues...... is it worth to play? yes!BUT dont forget the issues:- the story is lacking, there is nothing really extended from the first title, it's very flat sadly.... i wished much more insights- the combat in my opinion is lacking a lot! without slomo you got this time only 20% chances to win as the enemies shoot ASAP when they see you and on hard you are dead in 1-2 shots which is plain UNFAIR!!!- combat again, sadly the game is much more action oriented which wouldnt be a prob if the scheme wouldnt be always the same, enter room, slomo, shoot 3-9 enemies, a few horror scares next room and another action room- the game feels movement wise downgraded, you feel they had prioritized consoles with controllers- the level design wasnt the best in fear 1, they extended it a bit more here but sadly not made it much better...... you walk straightforward find a blocked door, walk right or left and again forward until there is something blocked, right or left and so on and on..... - the environments are boring..... the school is the highlight sadly.... - the jump scares are to 95% unscary as you always expect something next- no manual saving/quicksaving, you always know when enemies appear or the next jumpscare cause the game saves at all points before something happens.... this is taking the scariness out and the surprises. how bad devs have to be....and some more points i forgot.... it's  a good game for what it is but after 1 playthrough there is nothing left and i had to pause every hour as the game bored me fast somehow.

												It's an average first person shooter but also a very disappointing sequel to my favourite first person shooter of all time although it would be crazy to expect something better than the original fear, i expected the game to be at least good when it released and it failed to do that too. The shooting, the weapons and the slow motion is nowhere near as satisfying or good as the original and it overall just feels like the average console shooter. The enemy ai is also nowhere near as good as the original, they feel very scripted and don't react very well to your movements. I feel like the game also struggles with the difficulty settings. Normal is way too easy and hard is just ridiculous they give the enemy amazing accuracy, they never miss a shot and you only die in a few hits. I switched to normal around halfway through the game because it just became so stupid and unfair which is a shame because the rest of the game became a breeze because there is no challenge in normal. A game should never have such drastic difference in difficulty between two side by side settings. I love challenge in games but there is a difference between challenge and unfair it's why i love the dark souls games even though they are very difficult they never feel unfair. That’s my little rant aside about difficulty settings i felt like that needed to be addressed.Some of the scares work great and some feel cheap it's very mixed. Nothing much happens throughout the story of the game which is a shame because i think that the series always had potential to tell a great story and the first game started it off really well and the concept for fear 2 is pretty good its just the storytelling isn't handled well.It sounds like i sh*t all over this game in this review but that's because it's the sequel to my favourite fps of all time so of course im going to compare it to the original and as it's own standalone game it's nothing better then the average shooter. It's only a 5 hour long game and i got sick of the gameplay just 2 hours into it. There are much better single player fps games out there, don’t bother.5/10 (Average)			"

												This game gave a grown man nightmares...FEAR 2 is one of my favorite games of all time.To me it was brutally scary.  I have a thing about paranormal, evil demons, etc. so this game pushes that button.  Hard.It just does everything right and it gets even worse as you get through it.Even to a point where the horror element at one point becomes ultimate.  As in it doesn't get worse.  You will know what I mean when your there.Not to mention all the other crazy cool stuff that goes on.  I won't spoil it, but there is quite a bit of action.  And the back story about the corporation and it's evil deeds...  fantastic!  Creepy all the way.  As long as it's night, the lights are off and your by yourself, or course.  Otherwise don't buy horror games because your a girl.  My little Pony has a large selection.   :)Just kidding.  Lots of people don't think this is scary at all, for some reason.  I dunno, it scarred me.  That's for sure.It wouldn't hurt to play the first one first.  To know what's going on with the story.But forget the third one.  Unless your a fan.  It's really dumb.  Complete contrast to this game.			"

												What is F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin?--F.E.A.R. 2 is the successor of F.E.A.R., an immersive psycho-horror FPS with a fantastic bullet time mechanic.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R. 2?--If you loved the first F.E.A.R. game, you'll most likely love this title as well. That being said, if you felt the first game was too visually dated for your tastes, or too mechanically clunky, the game has improved leaps and bounds in that department. The game also favors action packed gun-battles a little bit more heavily than the first. The tension is very slightly lighter than the first game, but it holds enough strengths to more than compensate for this.----Over-all: 80.0%As a whole, F.E.A.R. 2 is a more solid title than the first game, and will appeal to a wider audience. That being said, some of the elements that make F.E.A.R. 2 a better game as a whole, slightly subtract from the immersive experience that was  the terrifying glory of the first F.E.A.R. game.--Mechanics: 4/5The mechanics are a definiteive improvement here, over the first game. Movement in much more fluid, bullet time is possibly even more smoothly integrated, there's more interaction with the world and terrain, the AI is very well done this  time around, and as a whole, the game feels very appropriately smooth and fluid.--Experience: 4/5In the five years between the release of F.E.A.R. 1 and F.E.A.R. 2, the developers have come along way in improving the audio and visuals of the game. The game went from passibly average looking (just enough so's to not distract from the experience) to downright gorgeous. The textures are fairly average, but  the artistic embellishments in conjunction with the fantastic visual effects definitely help this game shine. The audio has also taken a massive leap, helping tie the experience together. With all that being said, the psycho-horror elements of the game have been toned down just a touch, and that in combination with a few crowd pleaser moments, and the addition of collectible bits of intel, actually subtract from the experience slightly, in my opinion. The game is still fantastically immersive, and will draw you in, unlike many other titles to date, but in comparison with the first title, I feel F.E.A.R. 2 sacrifices a chunk of it's biggest strength -- the raw gripping psycho-horror elements, for a few fun, but unnecessary scripted gun battles.Balance: 4/5--Longevity: 4/5The game is slightly shorter than the first game in the series, containing only 14 missions of roughly 30-45 minute  length each. That being said, it doesn't rely solely on the immersive experience, unlike the first game, and provides a number little bits of intel for the player to run around and find, if that's your thing. There may be room for a second playthrough with F.E.A.R. 2, between looking to find the rest of the missed bits of intel, playing through on a higher difficulty, or simply just to enjoy the beauty and fluidity of the game for second time.

												Strictly inF.E.A.R.ior to the original and its expansion packs, Progect Origin is a comedy wearing the skin of a relatively drab military shooter. There are numerous things missing from it that gave the original much of its charm- the fact that when you bicycle kick someone in F.E.A.R., their head spins round and round thousands of degrees. You can't peek around corners and the stealth system is gutted in favour of run-and-gunning. Even on the hard difficulty. The voice acting is a mixed bag. Enemies are terrible and unconvincing. Your allies are pretty good, though, despite that their personalites aren't explored further than the most elementary of brushstrokes. The gunplay feels weaker, despite that enemies do explode into giblets when you fire a shotgun in their direction and I'm not sure how that's possible, but there it is. I mentioned comedy earlier: the ""actual"" plot- that is, the plot you get if you don't obsessively read all the pieces of intel- is a continuation from the first game, a horror-inflected, slightly dumb action-scifi. However, if you take the time to read the intel, it transforms into a sunday morning cartoon with more blood.  I realised this when I got to the elementary school level, finding a log talking about the side affects of drugs that were put in the children's food. Drugs that caused projectile vomiting. Additonally, in the school office, the parents of children report that their darlings are having nightmares about being shown violent images, strapped to chair and jabbed with needles, and that the parents were at a loss because they never showed their children anything of the sort, and are SURE that they weren't exposed to such things in school.  Even the bullet-time seems dull in comparison. What they have improved on is the degree to which the environment is degradable, and given you the chance to pilot a stompy robot. But even stompy robots cannot save this game from its sheer mediocrity. Don't waste your time. Replay the originals or watch a let's-play.			"

												Fun and full of action.  The game is very similar to the original, which is both good and bad, with some new mechanics.  The ability to use the environment to create cover was an impressive addition, but with many of the levels already chock full of available cover it makes this ability pointless.  The game is hallway crawler shooter, there are almost no outdoor levels and its all kinda the same, which was a weakness from the first game.  The shooting and particle effects are top notch similar to the original.  The story behind the game is kinda cut and paste from the first game and the original protagonist is no where to be seen in the game.  Good game on its own merits though, I recommend it.			"

												WARNING: This review will contain major spoilers of this game.Oh boy...Here comes the hate.F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a first-person shooter with survival horror elements which is the sequel for ""F.E.A.R."", a First Person Shooter with survival horror elements too, released in 2005. F.E.A.R. 2 is also made by Monolith. Starting off with this review, i think F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a very short game. I played a few minutes in real life of this game, the rest 8 hours of gameplay wen't from one day only. Yeah it's a short game, but it's such a ride that i don't have much to say. The gameplay has been improved a lot from the first, so much that it doesn't feel like the same game, but in a good way. The storyline is ♥♥♥♥ing great in my opinion, and much better than the first, but less characters, but it think it works well that way, and better too. The voice acting is better than the first too, and let's be fair, the first game had cringe-worthy voice acting. The game contains much more scary moments and they're used much better, although annoying at some moments, while in the first, it was just the little girl going on a hall and it wasn't very scary, it was usually psychological horror. Continuing, the protagonist is badass. Sorry to say, but this'll get people murdering me and, i think Becket is more badass than Point-Man. And let's forget F.E.A.R. 3, since i don't think it's canon at all to the story. And possibly my best option to prove that this game has a better story is the ending. The ending was considered weird by critics, but i think it's a ♥♥♥♥ing epic and outstanding ending for this ride of a game. So let me tell you the ending. In the end, Becket enters the Telesthetic Amplifier, but as Stokes prepares to power up the machine, she is interrupted by Genevieve Aristide, who explains that she operated on Becket so he would serve as a lure for Alma. Instead of destroying her, Aristide plans to seal Becket and Alma inside the device together, so she can use Alma as leverage against Armacham. Stokes disagrees with Aristide's intentions, and reaches for her gun, but is shot by Artistide before she can defend herself. Stokes collapses, with her ultimate fate left unknown. Alma then appears and blows Aristide away from the Amplifier, allowing Aristide to reach the control panel and seal the chamber as the walkway retracts. Alma pays her no attention, instead focusing on Becket, who she sends into another ""hallucination,"" where he fights off apparitions of a maddened Sergeant Keegan while trying to activate the Amplifier and destroy Alma. As Becket fights Keegan, the battle is interspersed with images of Alma ♥♥♥♥♥♥ him (I don't consider it ♥♥♥♥, but it technically is, so yeah, but it seemed pretty sexy, you have to agree). Finally, after activating the last switch, Becket escapes the hallucination to find himself sealed inside the device. The device is unsealed from the outside by Alma, who walks up to Becket and reveals she is pregnant, having ♥♥♥♥♥ him while he fought off the phantom image of Keegan. Alma takes Becket's hand and places it over her stomach, implying that the child is his. The game ends with Becket hearing the child whisper ""Mommy"" from inside Alma's womb. And my lord what an ending it was. Also, the graphics are great, they were amazing for 2009, and they still are great for 2016. Also, the gore is amazing. There is only one moment in the game where you control a robot mecha, which is a very good moment, which needed more sequences. The game is very glitchy at some moments by the way. So let's go for the pros and cons!A little update, i really loved the soundtrack, although it didn't really have much more and used some of the first game's tracks. Sound design is also amazing. Great gameplay obviously, too.Pros:+Outstanding ending+Great Graphics+Better Voice-Acting+Memorable characters+Weapons+Gore+Badass Protagonist+Insanely Heavy Themes (Alma's ♥♥♥♥ Frames during final boss)+Soundtrack+Sound Design+GameplayCons:-Extremely Short-Not many weapons-Glitches-Some tracks/music was re-used from the first gameOverall, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is an amazing game, and a masterpiece, which is the best example of a sequel in a single video-game ever made.The score for F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is:10/10 ~I knew it was going to be outstanding and amazing, but not a masterpiece!

												Originally posted Jan 5 2012 gameaday-ish.blogspot.comStop me if you have heard this one: mute protagonist known as “Point Man” blessed with psychic/physical abilities to perceive time as a higher rate and plagued by nightmarish visions of a deranged and violent little girl shoots his way to the revelation that the bad guy, Fettlel, is in fact his cannibalistic brother. Both characters are children of the the little girl Alma, who is projecting her younger self from cryo-storage in the basement of a facility. Alma is a powerful psychic driven insane by extended experimentation and apparently, ♥♥♥♥♥ to pregnancy.That, in a nutshell, is the mythology of the original F.E.A.R. Running concurrently to the last half of the first game is F.E.A.R 2 , featuring mute protagonist “Beckett” blessed with psychic/physical abilities to perceive time as a higher rate and plagued by nightmarish visions of a deranged and violent grown woman. He shoots his way to the revelation that Alma wants him to make babies with her, if only in a psychic not physical way.F.E.A.R. 2: Fear Harder is good looking game marred by an annoying choice to run film-grain effect over the visuals. Rather than emulating Japanese horror films this aesthetic makes the game look muddy, especially when I played it on 360. The controls were sluggish as well but on PC, and with film grain off, it looks and feels like the original F.E.A.R. which is not a bad thing.Added to the mix is the ability to operate the once feared mechsuits that terrorized players in the first game. Essentially invulnerable until the power runs out, the mech sequences are explorations in destruction as hundreds of enemies are mowed into pulpy gore. Very satisfying and never outstays its welcome, unlike the main campaign.2 Fear 2 Furious addresses valid complaints about the endless monotony of office corridors that plagued the original by providing larger more open environments that act as funnels into smaller corridors. Industrial design still dominates but there are some massive setpieces that offer real scope, especially in the aftermath of the explosive conclusion of the first game.Fun and propulsive, F.E.A.R 2 The Fear Police, suffers from hindsight that the tricks of the original that thrilled and amazed have lost their sheen.

												Probably the best game from series. Ofcourse It is not just a horror game, I think devs found unique combination of story, action and dark atmosphere. I admire story of the game and mainly the ending, but true power is hidden in multiplayer - brilliantly entertaining gameplay, sadly MP is dead. Farewell.Still awesome enough.			"

												It's overall a very good FPS, but is totally different from the first.They screw up all the funny physic, smart AI and the gun feeling to have a more polished and realistic experience.In my opinion, the game is no more funny as the first, but graphics, level design and animations are very good and optimized (very good PC port).The game is short (6 hours with DLC), but the plot is dense and adds details to the story.Since I prefer the funny side of the game rather than the good looking side, I think this sequel is a deep step backward.

												The best of both games on either side of this release. I personally think this is the best F.E.A.R. overall as it is graphically impressive enough not to be plain to look at, the game story and mood is very faithful to the original. It feels like a modern version of the first FEAR game. The design choices are a little different than the first FEAR which some people might not like. I know a lot of people miss the high contrast lighting that was traded for a more realistic, ambient lighting style, which I think is a fair complaint, as the old lighting was pretty cool. In terms of the overall graphics however, #2 as a whole is far superior.Multiplayer is dead, only purchase if you want to play the single player campaign.			"

												Have you ever experienced the beauty of a ""fine"" game? Let me elaborate: What I mean is a game that is not utterly awesome, but still does everything right. A game you pick up for a second playthrough knowing you will get nothing innovative or mind-blowing, but in spite of this, you'll still enjoy every second. Hell, after finishing, you won't rule out a third run happening in the future.FEAR 2 is this kind of game.Sure, FEAR brought some really impressive new stuff to the table, like mixing horror themes into an FPS setting, clever AI and FPS bullet time. But those were achievements introduced by the first game, and thus, FEAR 2 cannot claim them as its own. Actually, there is really nothing new in the sequel (with one notable exception, but more on that later), and stripped of the hallmarks of the series, Project Origin is a pretty standard FPS:...which is what makes it so great.A big part of why it succeeds is its pacing. FEAR 1 is a great game, without any need for great improvements. But what it lacked was proper pacing, a deficit also found in Condemned 1, another Monolith game. Many sections dragged oooon and ooooon without much variation. It was warehouse after warehouse after warehouse, and later bureau complex floor after bure- you get the point. Its scenarios simply didn't know when they wore out their welcome.FEAR 2 eliminates that weakness. Its pacing is just great. Just when a setting tends to get tedious, it switches to a new one or offers a new enemy or a nice set piece to spice things up. It never, ever gets boring, in my opinion. What's also great is that the graphics still are very good. It's a bit more colorful, but not to the excess of FEAR 3, hitting the sweet spot between the drab first game and the overkill of the third. It's another example of this ""just fine"" mentality I mentioned in the beginning. No, FEAR 2 won't blow you away with a great story. No, your jaw won't drop to the floor every five minutes. No, you won't marvel at game-changing innovations. Will you have a good time all the way through? Hell, yes....but my review would not be complete without addressing the one awesome new feature the game DOES introduce. You probably guessed it: Exosuit battles. There are only two sections in the campaign, but boy, are they fun! Nothing beats the feeling of gleefully raining down destruction with your gatling guns and missile launchers. Also, what could have basically have been just an overpowered reskin of the normal on-foot sections -and strictly gamplay-wise, it is - is helped so much by its presentation. You feel every step of the hulking mech when its lumbering steps shake your view, and the vision has a slight oversaturation combined with grain that completely sell the experience, A part of me wishes there would have been more of this, but on the other hand, its restrained use is another example of FEAR 2's pitch-perfect pacing.

												WARNING: This review will contain major spoilers of this game.Oh boy...Here comes the hate.F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a first-person shooter with survival horror elements which is the sequel for ""F.E.A.R."", a First Person Shooter with survival horror elements too, released in 2005. F.E.A.R. 2 is also made by Monolith. Starting off with this review, i think F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a very short game. I played a few minutes in real life of this game, the rest 8 hours of gameplay wen't from one day only. Yeah it's a short game, but it's such a ride that i don't have much to say. The gameplay has been improved a lot from the first, so much that it doesn't feel like the same game, but in a good way. The storyline is ♥♥♥♥ing great in my opinion, and much better than the first, but less characters, but it think it works well that way, and better too. The voice acting is better than the first too, and let's be fair, the first game had cringe-worthy voice acting. The game contains much more scary moments and they're used much better, although annoying at some moments, while in the first, it was just the little girl going on a hall and it wasn't very scary, it was usually psychological horror. Continuing, the protagonist is badass. Sorry to say, but this'll get people murdering me and, i think Becket is more badass than Point-Man. And let's forget F.E.A.R. 3, since i don't think it's canon at all to the story. And possibly my best option to prove that this game has a better story is the ending. The ending was considered weird by critics, but i think it's a ♥♥♥♥ing epic and outstanding ending for this ride of a game. So let me tell you the ending. In the end, Becket enters the Telesthetic Amplifier, but as Stokes prepares to power up the machine, she is interrupted by Genevieve Aristide, who explains that she operated on Becket so he would serve as a lure for Alma. Instead of destroying her, Aristide plans to seal Becket and Alma inside the device together, so she can use Alma as leverage against Armacham. Stokes disagrees with Aristide's intentions, and reaches for her gun, but is shot by Artistide before she can defend herself. Stokes collapses, with her ultimate fate left unknown. Alma then appears and blows Aristide away from the Amplifier, allowing Aristide to reach the control panel and seal the chamber as the walkway retracts. Alma pays her no attention, instead focusing on Becket, who she sends into another ""hallucination,"" where he fights off apparitions of a maddened Sergeant Keegan while trying to activate the Amplifier and destroy Alma. As Becket fights Keegan, the battle is interspersed with images of Alma ♥♥♥♥♥♥ him (I don't consider it ♥♥♥♥, but it technically is, so yeah, but it seemed pretty sexy, you have to agree). Finally, after activating the last switch, Becket escapes the hallucination to find himself sealed inside the device. The device is unsealed from the outside by Alma, who walks up to Becket and reveals she is pregnant, having ♥♥♥♥♥ him while he fought off the phantom image of Keegan. Alma takes Becket's hand and places it over her stomach, implying that the child is his. The game ends with Becket hearing the child whisper ""Mommy"" from inside Alma's womb. And my lord what an ending it was. Also, the graphics are great, they were amazing for 2009, and they still are great for 2016. Also, the gore is amazing. There is only one moment in the game where you control a robot mecha, which is a very good moment, which needed more sequences. The game is very glitchy at some moments by the way. So let's go for the pros and cons!A little update, i really loved the soundtrack, although it didn't really have much more and used some of the first game's tracks. Sound design is also amazing. Great gameplay obviously, too.Pros:+Outstanding ending+Great Graphics+Better Voice-Acting+Memorable characters+Weapons+Gore+Badass Protagonist+Insanely Heavy Themes (Alma's ♥♥♥♥ Frames during final boss)+Soundtrack+Sound Design+GameplayCons:-Extremely Short-Not many weapons-Glitches-Some tracks/music was re-used from the first gameOverall, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is an amazing game, and a masterpiece, which is the best example of a sequel in a single video-game ever made.The score for F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is:10/10 ~I knew it was going to be outstanding and amazing, but not a masterpiece!

												It's good, better than FEAR 1. Ideally play the original first so you have some idea who the heck Alma is and why everything is happening. I think enough is explained in this game that you could get the story without having played the original, but you probably want to anyway because FEAR 1 is also a really good game.I found this sequel scarier than the original. Graphics are nicer, I got higher framerates than in FEAR 1, most of the guns are better designed (the SMG and assault rifle in the original felt awful, in this installment they're both very fun to use). The developers' aptitude at storytelling has improved from where they were when they made FEAR 1. This game feels like someone made the team from FEAR 1 play a Call of Duty game and they learned about making big cinematic explosion-filled bits and scripted sequences work amazingly well.Some small technical issues, none pressing: the default keybindings are strange and I changed a lot of them; the game doesn't recognise the buttons on the side of my mouse, which is weird because FEAR 1 did (how spooky!); the lowest mouse sensitivity you can set in game is still much too high for me at 800dpi and I wound up turning my mouse sensitivity down to 250dpi in order to get a ~35cm turning circle like I prefer in FPS games.The quicksave & quickload feature is just gone but after about 15 minutes I stopped missing it and started having more fun without it. Difficulty is a little lower and gameplay feels streamlined relative to FEAR 1.Some nice technical fixes too: widescreen resolutions now work properly, some noticeable graphical defects that the original had are gone (in FEAR 1, the decal system kinda fights with the particle system, but I didn't see that happen here), framerates seem better on the same hardware.Didn't pay any attention to the multiplayer, I assume that it probably doesn't work because there's a GameSpy logo on it, but I didn't check, I don't care, I bought this only for the singleplayer game, which is excellent.

												Most of the time, I really didnt know what I was doing. I just followed the storyline. But what the heck, who cares!! Its a lovely shooter, changed by weird moments, and immidiatly followed by action. You give it a spin. Treat yourself by trying it, come buy it.... what are you waiting for... come one, press store, buy or just put it on your wishlist and wait till its cheap, double fun (thats what I always do :)			"

												This review is probably old at this point but here goes -          The next evolution of the F.E.A.R series: A challenging, deep and scary game. F.E.A.R 2, while probably not as interesting as its predecessor, is an excellent continuation of the series. Its a first person shooter with horror eliments, nuff said. Many improvements have been made; combat system is deffinetely more fluid, weapons feel weak though. Overall interesting story, deffinetely a lot of freaky and dissarming moments that really scare the sh@t out of you. Alma is in your face from start to finish....			"

												Building upon the story of F.E.A.R. core story (excluding the expansions, sadly) you pick up shortly before the end of the first title. This sequel is a bit of mixed emotions for me, personally. The game introduces a sprint as well as Iron sight aiming familiar with other modern shooters, and retains the SloMo mechanics. Story begins as a different character who had showed signs of being able to be a psychic commander not unlike Fettel and thus is thrown into a multitude of tests and challenges to confirm it. How I felt this title lost a bit of its identity by switching to another developer, as well as story not quite likable or the NPC's either. Though there are some aspects that really called true to the genre. I would get this if its on sale, a damn good sale at that.			"

												Honestly, probably the scariest of the series; so long as we're only talking about 2 and 3. I haven't played the original, so I can't really say how scary that one was, but regardless; F.E.A.R. 2 may, in my opinion, stand as the definitive FPS horror title. It will never quite be in the realm of the big name horror games like Outlast, but it doesn't need to be. F.E.A.R. 2 provides a great FPS experience while still managing to scare and disturb.			"

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin (F2: PO) is one of 2009's most underrated games and still continues to get a bad reputation even today. It is puzzling as to why since the story is intriguing, the gameplay is solid and the graphics are up to par in modern day gaming. F2: PO's gameplay is similar to the original F.E.A.R. where ""slow-mo"" is still a favored featured that never gets old in its use. F2: PO has one piece of DLC called ""Reborn"" that is essentially a standalone addon that hardly contributes to the story. It's disappointing that the game never utilizes SteamWorks when the in-game setup seems so close to supporting features such as Steam achievements.All in all, the game is a solid shooter with a great horror-like atmosphere that continues the story of Alma.

												A lot better than the first F.E.A.R game. The combat kind of remains the same (slow mo, shoot, end slo mo and repeat) and for that, the combat starts to feel repetitive towards the end of the game.But where the game is better, is in the horror side to it. Yeh its a horror game so expect some jump scares every now and then (but you will still poo your pants). There is a lot more of a creepy atmosphere and there will be times you will get goosebumps (and still poo your pants).Buy the game for a good pant pooing			"

												This recommendation is for the players that finished F.E.A.R. 1.I must admit that F.E.A.R. 2 was less interesting than the first one in many points. Even if the graphics were upgraded, and even if they understood one thing or two about level building (not making compounds too huge so the player doesn't feel like they will never get out of it).The story was less interesting because of the lack of mystery. In F.E.A.R. 1, you never truly understood what was happening, and it was this that make you continue. You wanted to know what was about to happen next. The sequel just makes you wandering throught compounds, outside environnements and an elementary school to find one people or an other. The presence of Alma is fast explained (in my opinion) so you don't need to find out anything by yourself.The horror moments, that were truly horrific sometimes in F.E.A.R. 1, are lacking solidity in Project Origin. It is way more direct, like representations of Alma attacking you, and hardly any shadows on the walls or any moments of chill throught your spine (elements that were doing really great work previously).I am still recommending it since it is a great FPS, the weapons are upgraded and less precise (in F.E.A.R. 1, the weapons were stupidly precise, the pistol was the best weapon in the game), and the environnement are really well done.

												F.E.A.R 2 Project Origin, is a game where fear is really not an issue. Although one of the best shooters around, the fear factor is not the one i would appreciate in a game like this. True there are scary moments, but the game's basic core is the awesome gunfights and the bloodbath that follows. Even a scary sex hungry ghost seems kinda little, when you face her with:1 Lasers (Big deal, nobody is afraid of a big red beam that pierces everything!)2 Plasma Guns (So what if you can explode everyone with a single shot!)3 Apb Turret ( This is the reason why Arnold will hate you...)4 Mecha Armors (Cause if using an armored suit filled with machine guns and missiles cant guarantee you victory, then you are doing it wrong!!!)Also, if you ever feel like the game is really challenging, you get to use super slow motion to help you make the fights easier and more enjoyable (You get to splatter people like that and become a monster yourself ^^).The story is big and kinda generic with an ending that will make you wanna peck your eyes out, but still it was fun to play. If nothing else i got to feel like rambo ^^If you want to buy this game for a spooky ride dont, cause you will be terribly disappointed. If you on the other hand  want it for a pure shooting fest, by all means dont let it w8ing. You will love it!!!			"

 This game was executed pretty amazingly for an FPS horror game.  I thought this game wouldn't be as atmospheric at times in a gun game. But then there were those times where you didn't have a gun.I mostly got this game for the horror. I loved it. The school scene was absolutely the best. However, I find it was a bit too short. Obviously, there are multiple difficulties, but I don't really find any fun in playing the whole game over where the only thing different is rage factor. Of course, you can always come back to it a year later to give it another playthrough.I would definitely recommend this game. Although I did not care for the robots and all (I was mostly for the grudge girl, hehe), I still find this game worth playing if you like the horror genre. The school part was amazing. My favorite part of the game, by the way.			"

The guns are changed this time around to make the game feel easier when in gunfights. The A.I. is not as impressive as the first game unfortunately. It's not bad, but it has been toned down a bit. The grenade particle effects are also gone from the first game :( It's not all bad though! The long cooridor filled levels from the first game are gone. This game is changing it up every level. You even get to control an awesome mech to go down streets blowing up everything. This game is more difficult than the first one, mainly due to not being able to quicksave anymore. It has a checkpoint system this time around, which balances the game a lot better. The scares in this game feel even more terrifying this time around. The school easily has some of the scariest moments I have ever seen in a game. The new enemy types love to pop out constantly when you are least expecting it. The graphics have also got a nice upgrade. The deployable turrets were a fun new weapon, but I wish I got to use them more. The game is about 8 hours long, depending on how much you explore.			"

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin manages to continue on with the achievement that its predecessor began; it manages to nearly perfectly combine horror and action into a single game. Though they keep the two genres seperated by making each segment devoted to one, it is done extraordinarily well and I can't think of a better game than this one to scratch both itches simultaneously.The story is enjoyable and the combat mechanics are well done as well. The variety of weaponry was an entertaining aspect of the game as well, each player might end up with a different arsenal at the end of the game based on their tastes. The horror scenes were enjoyable, and some parts were downright scary (I'm looking at you elementary school). My only real complaint with F.E.A.R. 2 was that the story seemed to get a little slow right around the middle. Once I returned to the game after a short break and powered through another level, it got very exciting, though, and I'm very glad that I kept moving forward.I recommend this game to all fans of FPS and horror. The game was enjoyable on both sides of that. If you are a fan of the original, definitely pick this one up as well!			"

Because it does it right.The music, the atmosphere, the gameplay, everything is great, the difficulty is pretty easy even at the highest difficulty but it's all right, I've seen worse.It's not a strategy game at the same time so let's be fair.I really love this game, both F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 are great games.Unvaluable gems In my opinion, of course, unlike the third one which is a fine game but not so great considering it is a F.E.A.R. game.You should absolutely get this game if you don't already have it, fan of FPS? Horror? Great music? Great atmosphere? You'll love it.This game deserves 9/10 In my opinion.F.E.A.R. 9.5/10F.E.A.R 3 7.5/10 (F.E.A.R. is a good game just not a good F.E.A.R. game).			"

												If there was a neutral instead of negative, this would get it.Where as it isn't bad game, it's mediocre compared to first game. If first game felt like an Half-Life gameplay wise, this feels like Call of Duty. It's also pretty short. Guns don't have much punch in them, and the combat feels boring.Maybe if I didn't play it back to back with first game, it would've been more enjoyable, but only thing that this game does better is the looks. I was surprised when I launched the game that damn these graphics are quite good compared to first  F.E.A.R. But everything else it lacks.If you liked first one, and want to complete the story, play this. If not, it's just a mediocre shooter.			"

												F.E.A.R. 2 is a First Person Shooter Horror game.Also check my first review about F.E.A.R. 1 since this review is not as extensive as usually.This is because my F.E.A.R. 1 review already has most of the aspects in it. Also positive/negative wisely most is just the same.It doesnt continue where F.E.A.R. ended as some might think.It tells the story after the explosion from a different perspective.You are Becket. Just like in the first game you dont know who you are, except your name and your job.You are hunted by Alma again. But why is Alma mostly after you? What does she want from you?There is more than you might think. And why the hell does a guy called Snake Fist contact you?All this you have to figure out in F.E.A.R. 2.Game is mostly the same compared to the first F.E.A.R. except that some gameplay mechanics were updated like your hud. You wear glasses now which display your hud also your flashlight has no limit now. The graphics were updated just like the engine. Actually it looks very fancy. You can sprint now too.Game is still scary, even if some persons say its not as scary as F.E.A.R. 1.Cant really agree with this. The halucinations are even better now. They look amazing.The scene in the school is the best. I dont say anything more, I try to avoid spoilers in my reviews.And now you get actually directly attacked by Alma. You have to defend yourself when she approaches you.But actually she doesnt seem to want to kill you as other persons in the game tell you.Or maybe she is impressed that you are the only one who can resist her attacks.There is something more, something pretty surprising. But you will get this after finishing the actual game.Multiplayer is down because of Gamespy being dead.The actual playtime is around 7 hours for the campaign.There is also a DLC available but im reviewing this seperately.Positive:- Bullet time- Good Story- Big amount of options ingame- Alma is one of the best game characters ever- No health regeneration!- Somewhat good graphics (2009)- Great play with the dark and shadows- More modern feeling- Good and fitting unique soundtrack- Great freaking hallucinations!- Some nice environments, especially more compared to the first game- Good Enemy AI- Shooting is a lot of fun- One of the best and most surprising videogame endingsNeutral:- German Steam store version cutNegative:- Some questionable keys like shift for zooming with the weapon... Changeable- Multiplayer dead, gamespy downReplayability: MediumFor me this game was just as good as the first part. In fact I actually thought its even better, slightly. Mostly because it feels more modern and doesnt have problems with modern systems.I personally would rate it with 9/10 points.			"

												F.E.A.R. was an incredible game with an AI the likes of which had never been seen. It had a decent enough of a storyline that acted as a great vehicle for getting to explore a very Akira-esque underground facility. It's still visually stunning to this day (I played it a few months back). All of those traits are dumped for F.E.A.R. 2. An alarming percentage of the enemies will stand off in the distance as you shoot them repeatedly in the head. If they aren't standing perfectly still, they will abandon cover and run straight at you. The storyline  is much more limited than the first. While I think the J-horror jump scares of the original were pretty dumb, the story was at least compelling enough to create a real sympathy for Alma. Alma plays a minor role at most in Project Origin, with the devs perferring you to have a strong bond with your mindless, soulless teammates while giving you no reason to feel connected to them except by telling you how close you all are. All of the imagination that went into the original facility is gone here. The sense of scale has been scaled down, if you will, to a couple of small buildings and an itty bitty underground lab.Everything about it feels more like an ambitious yet terrible expansion pack than a real sequel. If you adore the original as much as I do, I would definitely suggest you just appreciate it and it's second expansion pack, Perseus Mandate, and leave F.E.A.R. 2 alone as to not spoil your fondness for the original.

												The consolized follow-up to the classic action-horror shooter. It does not live up to the intensity of its predecessor due to its lack of soul and innovation.Pros* High production values for the graphics, the voice acting and the quality assurance* A few urban or underground setpieces are genuinely cleverCons* The horror sequences are not scary and the gunplay is far from being as satisfying as in the first game* The level design is unimaginative and the story doesn't pull you in – you have to wait half of the (short) game's length for anything remotely interesting to happenThe game is less surprising than the two expansion packs for the original game. Even if you are a fan of F.E.A.R. the revamped visual design is so different this game may not even work out for you.			"

												Really average shooter , Which  is a shame because F.E.A.R and its expansions were amazing . The game suffers from a lot of problems . They moved from a manual save to a checkpoint system which is terrible because they  are really badly placed. Enemies spawn out of thin air . The AI isn't any where near as good as F.E.A.R . The enemies often run out of cover , and don't communicate with each other  . The guns feel like pea shooters , and the difficulty is all kinds of unbalanced . Either the enemies are total push overs or they're pulling off crazy headshots from across the map . There an absolutely stupid amount of post processing effects in the game ,so many that actually has a negative effect on the gameplay . The only redeeming feature is the kickass mech  but you only get to play with it in two sections.  Its not the worst fps I've ever played , but Its a poor sequel l to one of the greatest games ever made.			"

												High quality console shooter. Graphics are nice, sound is present, there is even some kind of story. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A F.E.A.R. GAME AT ALL. All they have to do is to copy the first game and polish graphics - bam, another award-winning shooter. Instead of that devs decided that players like being tacticool - press ACTION TO CREATE A BAD COVER. Walking robot parts are plain boring - w+m1, stop to regen. Weapons feel light (probably because of reloading animations, especially sniper rifle which is made of paper. Speaking of sniper rifle - you can quickscope). At least the enemies seem to be as smart as before (on hard). Unfortunately they are just cannon fodder - walking robot and turret parts will make you yawn. Btw right before the last interval you'll be forced to sit behind the turret to shoot enemies while listening to some generic rock music ( Snake Fist (Instrumental) - look it up on YouTube). Oh, and your dudebro ally will be shouting some nonsense - like I am in CoD or something. Lack of manual saving, weak story, short duration, casualisation - all of this killed the spirit of F.E.A.R. The game is good as a console shooter, I cannot deny that. It is just not the game I was expecting.			"

												F.E.A.R 2 is one of those really wierd titles. It doesn't feel like a sequel so much as just a remake of the original with more consolized design. All the maps are more linear, it looks more like Call of Duty and there's a flagrant amount of gun porn.It's gameplay resembles the original superficially but it's style is in stark contrast. With regard to how well those elements are incorporated that's totally up to the player's discretion. Needless to say it's not one of the worst games I've ever played, I just think it lacks it's own identity.			"

												I tried to give it a chance, but still pretty lackluster. The graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is very smooth in comparison to its predecessor--it's also in its own right a solid FPS. The story is almost a joke though, and the fear factor of the original game has been reduced to jump scares. Quite boring as a game. Doesn't even come close to that F.E.A.R. feel that the first game had.			"

												Although this game is a slight step backwards from the first it is still alot of fun, if your a fan of the first game you will find enjoyment here (although little to no innovation) and if your a new comer to the series you can jump in without any previous knowledge of the first games story. The only criticism's i have is the lack of innovation from the first game although some may actually like that and the game seemed alot easier than the first on normal difficulty though that is easily remedied by playing on harder difficulties or not using the games Slo-mo mechanic but despite its ease i still felt scared whilst playing. All in all a solid title worth your attention.			"

												This game is without a doubt a pretty fun sequel from it's previous game/ expansion packs. After replaying it recently I would have to say the levels are much more detailed and not as repetitive as F.E.A.R from 2005 and same time mostly the scares being improved a bit and fighting more creppy enemies in some parts of the game. Now even though I wouldn't recommend this as a true Horror game but instead a well done shooter with some pretty great graphics and some pretty fun A.I to kill compared to other games. Overall I would say if you get the chance and want to try a new fun shooter with at times creepy enemies and moments while killing some decent A.I, I would totally recommend this title.			"

												FEAR 2: Project Origin is a wonderfully crafted game with attention to detail in the many enviroments and an interesting but simplistic storyline that draws you in. This game is quite immersive and most consider it best played in a dark environment. While it's graphics are considered dated by modern standards it is fun and definitely is a must play. Going through the campaign on normal takes the average gamer around 10 hours.  "

												FEAR 2. In some ways, I enjoy this game. It's got elements of the original FEAR that I enjoy, but it's also got plenty I don't. Changes in the health system and the way armor and health works makes the game more artificially difficult because your character cannot carry 10 health kits and cannot take more than a single shotgun blast (From long range it seems sometimes). Which is annoying because FEAR 2 has automatic shotguns. It's AI is also not quite as intelligent, but it does have elements that seem to work with it. Mostly I have to say the story is the main problem with it. FEAR 1's story was well told, through a mixture of speech and moment elements. You got a sense of Alma's motives by exploring the environment, watching her actions, and the like. But FEAR 2 seems mostly about just shaming Armachan and other stupid things. I dunno. It's just not as interesting as FEAR 1 in its story. Ultimately, skip this and FEAR 3: Clive Barker's Jericho.			"

												Had fun with the original? Whether your answer is yes or no, it doesn't matter. F.E.A.R. 2 introduces new players to the series with the flawless combat system and smooth controls perfectly, while still keeping fans of the original entertained. F.E.A.R. 1's combat system was already exceptional, and F.E.A.R 2 only improved on it. Overall the story has a lot od depth and is interesting, the graphics were outstanding for its time and are still comparable to some more modern games. Although it feels somewhat less scary than F.E.A.R. 1, playing this game still manages to be a spine chilling experience for me. Definitely worth a try.			"

												This is the second episode in the F.E.A.R. trilogy, and a bit of a disappointment. If you've played FPS like Half-Life 2 or Doom 3, nothing about the gameplay will enthrall you. The story is even sillier than the first part, F.E.A.R., and ends most timidly and laughably, especially after subjecting you to quite an intense gunplay barely 5 minutes earlier. The game just can't make up its mind whether the chief villain, Alma, is a victim of a secret military experiment, an alien, or a ghost. How in the hell can hallcinations eat away one's health? But they do in this game. Go figure.Just like the first game, you are made to shoot your way through several office complexes, underground research facilities, and subway tunnels. There's nothing to do in the game except kill, kill, kill, the waves of enemies obstructing your progress. The game relieves you of all the brain-work and figures your way forward for you. Enemy AI, while not pathetic, is predictable and makes the gameplay boring after a while. You can foretell 8 times out of 10 where the enemy is hiding, from where it is going to emerge, and your best hiding spots. Environs and locations have dull colors and textures and look depressing. One may wonder what the 12GB download size of this game went into since the game is easily completable within 15 hrs. Background music is grating and a nuisance. During gun battles, it prevents you from hearing enemy chatter & movement, and is best turned way down. The sound-mixing too is completely screwed-up. While in the first game, all six channels of the soundtrack worked well and enabled one to ascertain the direction of enemy's approach from the sound of footsteps or radio chatter, sound in this game doesn't seem to have been configured for multi-channel setup. In my experience, a well-configured multi-channel soundtrack is absolutely critical in clearing major gun battles in any intense shooter by assisting in effectively taking out the enemies sneaking up on you. I hope sound mixing engineer was fired for not doing his job properly. Horror element is childish and the game uses cheap jump-scare tactics to shake you up. Difficulty levels are once again messed up, as they were in the first game. HARD setting is hardly hard and difficult to tell apart from the normal setting except for sniper fire and grenades which kill you in one instance. In fact, I found HARD setting easier than the NORMAL setting, but it may be because I played on HARD setting after having played the game on NORMAL, therefore having the advantage of knowing maps and enemy movement in advance. There are other minor flaws and irritants in the game design that further sour the experience, such as, grenades bouncing around like tennis balls, inability to load only the last save point and not the older ones, etc. Now that I've ripped the game apart, let me mention that the game is not too bad a product on a stand-alone basis, and a typical FPS lover can have fun with it. It's really in comparison to other FPS on the market that it appears dim-witted. Coming from a major studio, one expects a game to deliver a unique and unforgettable experience. Isn't that why we all play video games--because they 'virtually' put us in places & situations where we won't ever find ourselves in real lives? That's why at least I play 'em. This game does that alright, but via an unimaginative design and in a bland style.I know I won't be playing this game ever again. I also know I'd have at least 3x more fun repeat-playing any game of the Half-Life or Bioshock or Far Cry franchise.Game played smoothly without a stutter (except freezing twice during the entire gameplay and subsequently self-correcting on its own) on a Win 10 machine and a GTX 960 OC card.RECOMMENDED to newbie FPS players. For veterans, AVOID. 6/10.			"

												A bit worse for wear than the decade old originals. They polished the game up only to sprinkle little particles of crap on top of it. List of crap1)Snipers2)Armor takes an eternity to whittle down but you can go from full health to dead in an instant. Once you lose all your armor watch the ♥♥♥♥ out. 3)Psuedo-cutscene gemoetry movement that instantly kills you. Don't let the moving car tap you on the toes or you die4) The hammerhead gun is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Enemies can tank 4 of these to the head and still keep coming. ♥♥♥♥ off5) The base shotguns are overpowered and of course the game doesn't give you enough ammo for it to go around6) You get your first sniper rifle, the only gun that grants properly damaging headshots, during the last hour of gameplay7) You can only hold onto 3 guns at once lol. Naturally you only pick up ammo for the gun you're weidling at the time8) No proper final boss9) The last two minutes of gameplay before the credits start to roll. 20 invisible, impossibly fast enemies vs 1 of you, and you don't have enough slomotion or effective bullets to go around and they can kill you in a literal instant anywhere since there's no effective cover.  I ultimately just ran past that screen and pressed the button-of-game-ending rather than combat them a TENTH time QUICK TEAM WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL BOSS JUST SPAWN A WHOLE BUNCH MORE ENEMIES THAN USUAL10) In fact just about every encounter can be skipped if you just run past and are clever enough to see/find the exit11) You can only hold 3 medpacks and a very finite number of grenades/ammo12) No minigun other than the turret13) Terrible mech-driving segments coupled with vasoline-o-vision14) Women in combat roles, let alone the 1st Seargant, AND the only one who survives to the very ♥♥♥♥ing end15) SHE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OUT IN THE LAST SECOND AND DOESN'T KILL THE PERSON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING EVEN THOUGH SHE'S RIGHT THERE WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS CQC AND THEN DIES LIKE A ♥♥♥♥♥ SOMEONE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET BOSS ON THE LINE16) ♥♥♥♥ every semblance of plot this game tries to shoehorn into reality. That's just what I wanna do is read a whole bunch of pdfs with worthless information in between gunbattles. At least the prequel was decent enough to give me phone calls I could listen to in the other room while exploring17) Nearly no incentive for exploring nor nothing to explore. 18) the default grenade is a piece of ♥♥♥♥--good thing there's plenty of alternate ones that are usefulThe game kept getting worse and worse as I progressed. For reference the hospital early on was amazing and the schoolyard about halfway into it was really great. It's just a little too tedious and samey. Thankfully this game improved the abysmal flashlight from the first game. I hated that ♥♥♥♥ so much. Huerp gotta wait in the dark 10 seconds before I can illuminate this dark-♥♥♥ hospital. Screw that.If you haven't already played the FEAR games then don't. You aren't missing anything noteworthy.			"

												First of all a short FEAR 1 review, because it's not possible on Steam to do so apparently. It still runs reasonably well and the gunplay is extremely satisfying. Story is good too and there's not really any other ""horror"" shooter out there, so there's that. The game drags on a bit, however, and the 2 expansions don't offer much new, apart from a few weapons and enemies. The saddest thing about Fear is its lack of environmental variety. Everything is pretty much grey and happens indoors.Now on to Fear 2. Armor and health are still the same, though you can now only carry 3 med kits which restore full life, and armor instantly replenishes it to 100% as well.The gunplay is still satisfactory, but somehow FEAR 1 did it better imho. I can't put my finger on it though.Gun and enemy variety is imho still the same as in FEAR 1, even worse. There are regular soldiers with different weapons, heavy armored soldiers, power armored soldiers and heavy power armored soldiers (mini bosses kinda). Apart from that we have the assassin again, some form of mutant leaper and ghosts. Oh and you encounter a flame thrower guy...twice. Nothing that sticks out really. Weapon variety is the same. There's no new weapon in the game, really. True, you get a sniper rifle, but then FEAR 1 had a similar weapon. And there is 1 new energy based weapon, but that's it.They've also removed some features like leaning around corners. However, you can sprint now, but omg is that spring horrible. Slow Motion is now an automatic cheat mode, because it highlights all enemies and really slows them down. FEAR 1 was fairer imho. I also didn't use the slow mo in F1 quite as often as in this game. It wasn't that powerful imho.What's better is that headshots are finally registered as increased damage. In F1 the first soldier in a group would instantly die to 1 shot, while the others took quite a lot more punishment, no matter if you shot them in the head or not. Enemies still don't die of a single headshot (apart from sniper rifle), but that's ok. They are less bullet spongy overall.On the other hand, in F1 you knew you would come upon a group of soldiers. Maybe a squad of 5 or so. Here you eliminate 5 enemies, all you can see. You move forward, and suddenly you are surrounded by another 5 enemies. It feels a bit like a shooting gallery with enemies constantly spawning. Quantity instead of quality though. The AI is doing ok.Graphics are of course better, but for some reason the sound is really muzzled, even with everything set to max and my speakers louder than usual the game just didn't feel ""ballistic"". Maybe that's why F1 had better gun fights, they just sounded more brutal. The weapons in Fear 2 kinda sound subdued.But at least the environments are pretty different this time around.The game gets very repetitive, however. There are rarely too many different objetives or levels after you're about halfway through and it simply revolves around running from fight to fight. There are also a few collectibles in game that give a bit of background information, but the phone calls in F1 were vastly superior. These are just text documents this time around. Also, no more health powerups, just stamina.Particularly fun are the heavy power armor sections. You don't just have to fight those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, no, you can use one yourself. Twice. Although you are pretty much invincible.There are also 2 on rails sections. Those are terrible. I don't know why they're in. Also the ""tram"" section of the game is just tedious.Oh, and no more manual saving (big no no) and also a permanent flash light now. Does not run out of battery and has to be recharged, which does take away the edge. Also enemies don't seem to really respond to the flash light that much anymore.It's not a terrible game, just not as good as FEAR 1 imho and if you can't live up to your predecessor I have to give a thumbs down. Also over fairly quickly. I doubt you will take longer than 8 hours even on a higher difficulty. The addon is a waste of money, but I think it's included in most bundles now anyway, so eh. It's about half an hour of gunning down more enemies. With the same weapons. And you learn a tiny bit more about Fettel.			"

It has an extremely WTF ending, but in truth, there's little worth experiencing in the F.E.A.R. series beyond the first.  If you're looking for an FPS, you could do a lot worse than F.E.A.R. 2, but it's hardly a must-play.			"

The enemy AI is borderline brain dead.The pistol, once the funnest gun to use, has been made to look like a Nerf blaster and you can no longer dual wield.The story is weak and the writing boring.This game tarnishes the great one that came before it.

												I want to write a review of this game because I think everyone need to know what will get when play this game.I played F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R.:Extraction Point and F.E.A.R.:Perseus Mandate a few weeks ago. I love them. They scared me a few times and I enjoyed it. The story (specially the F.E.A.R. and the Extraction Point) was really good. The mixture between scares and fights was really good, and the notes on the story gave you a good perspective about what was happening. So, with that in mind, I began to play F.E.A.R. 2.Oh, what an error.The game is practically everything shooting, shooting, and more shooting. There are a few little low quality scares in the first half of the game, but the next hours is only bullets for everyone in really big (and boring) combats.The notes are practically irrelevant. Some little details, or things you really pass to know.Also, the story is... not interesting at all.And then, I finished it. So, I played my recently bought (in the Halloween Steam Sales) F.E.A.R. 2 DLC. It couldn't be worse.Oh, yes, it can.There's practically no story. Only more bullets for everyone. There are no scares. Only guns.And the final combat was really boring.Summing up, the only good points of the game were seeing (only a few times in the first half) little Alma with good graphics and the possibility to pilot (but only two times in F.E.A.R. 2 and once in the DLC) an armored robot. No more, no less.That's all about this game.			"

												Dull, repetitive, and uninteresting.I had little expectations when I started playing F.E.A.R. 2, but i had thought the series sounded interesting and wanted to play the first game when it came out. Playing this game was still a disappointment. The levels were dull and uninteresting in design and layout. The characters all dull and two-dimensional, not to mention very stereotypical. What could be claimed as a plot and setting were poorly presented, badly paced and left me wanting it over not even half-way through. There was no scariness, no tension. Jump scares were continually accompanied by violin screeches, and were ineffective. The ending was disturbing, and didn't make much sense until I looked at some videos on youtube after about it. Even then it feels like it was mostly disconnected from the rest of the game. The possible attempt at adding atmosphere by having the HUD flicker was very annoying, bothered my eyes and since it didn't extend to anything besides the player's HUD and flashlight it felt like it was meant to punish the player more than be atmospheric.Playing through on normal difficulty I found there were more than enough health and armor pickups to almost be constantly at full health. Weapons were frustrating because of the number found in game, the limit to the number able to be carried and their blandness, none really stood out for power or accuracy or usefulness beyond what ammo was most plentiful. At least one weapon had no other ammo besides the 5 shots it had when given. Grenades felt weak and mostly useless. (shock grenades were the only type consistently useful).The boss fights were moderately interesting. The AI was interesting, the use of cover was fine, but the randomly running between cover spots, or the often indecisive movement of the AI trying to choose a spot to run to for cover were a pain. The powered armor sequences were even more linear and dull, and there was a greater tempation to not use the armor when available to try and give myself something challenging. I also went through most of the game without using the bullet-time ability very much. It didn't really seem needed for very much. There is also only about 6-7 different types of enemies, most of which are similar soldier types.			"

The very beginning has a few creepy parts, but that is it, and that is basically the only good part of the game. There are only a few different enemies, but they all play the same, just some are more of a bullet sponge than the others. The game is VERY boring. The characters are some of the most forgettable that I've ever seen. Not even Cortana herself could save them(she voices your main partner). The story is complete garbage.

A mediocre game that simply isn't worth the time when there are so many good games out there.  
The shooting is unsatisfying, with boring enemies, dissapointingly vanilla weapons and an over reliance on the Slow-motion gimick to the exclusion of almost anything else.  The level design is completely on-rails and almost exclusively takes place in dark, ruined corridors.  The horror aspect is tame and one never truly feels that a malevolent psionic god-child poses any real threat to them.  The story, what little of it is presented is full of bland, boring characters whose only purpose seems to be to die horribly moments after the narrative focuses on them making it hard to get invested in the tale. Despite this, it's a functional game but one that only too well shows it's console origins and suffers horribly from a lack of ambition.			"

												Take what was the first game, throw some graphics on it, mix in some qte's, make the levels smaller, throw in some weapons that aren't that great and nerfed (cept the sniper), tons of non-interactive cutscenes, shorten the gameplay, some parts where you can control a mech, dumb down the scary sequences, top it off with a lackluster story and an endgame challenge (no boss fights here!) that is as cheap and shallow as what the whole of this game feels towards anyone who has ever played the first game. Sure there's flashy stuff, parts that make you go ""that's kinda cool"" but it ends as quickly as it comes, and in the end you're looking at a flashy corridor shooter that anyone honestly could have made, not the game that defined itself as a different kind of shooter (FEAR 1).Honestly if this is the best Monolith could come up with after FEAR 1 (and after Half-Life 2 had come out ages ago after) then I am not looking forward to playing the third, in which case I only am because I'm backlogging.

												F,E,A,R, 2 is a two steps forward, two steps back kind of sequel. On one hand we have better looking levels, (Fear 1 was just grey office buildings) more variety (more weapons, more varried levels) and better graphical quality. But on the other hand, we have AI that are not as good, this is probably because people got sick of getting lost in Fear 1 because of all the different doorways to an area (which allowed the AI to be more tactical and flank). The gunplay is also lacking, weapons are more varried, yes, but they have much less recoil. However, they still have good impact, bullets ripping through enemies looks arguably better and because they reduced recoil you spend less time in bullet-time mode because you needed to do that A LOT in F.E.A.R. 1.As for the scare factor, it can sometimes be scary but don't let that discourage you if you are interested in this game. The scares serve more as an adrenaline booster than to leave you with absolute horror.This game is one of my favorite FPS of all time mainly because of how varried it is, It has a lot better pacing then the previous games and more variety then I see in most big budget titles. I give it a full reccomendation if you like FPS.			"

												To start off this review I just want to say that I loved the original fear. It is probably my most favorite shooter of all time. But this game is a mistake that should have never been made. In the original fear one of the most amazing things it had to offer was the AI. Instead of the enemies running into you like in any other generic shooter, FEAR's AI was so smart that the enemies will try and flank you and interact as a team so well in ways that will blow your mind. However in the sequel the AI has been dumbed down so much that the devs looked at it and made it work in the worst way possible. The way the AI actually works in this game is that they will camp behind a wall where they've already seen you waiting for you to come back in a room and for some reason deal a RIDICULOUS burst of damage that when without armor and full health will kill you instantly before you even know what the hell just happened. And on top of being programmed so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly some of the enemies become an absolute bullet sponge that will take 4 shots from the shotgun to kill. Everything else in this game is just equally as bad-the new quick-time events, the pistol is now completely useless and never worth using, oh and the story. The story is as much as a joke as everything else exept that the story accompanied with everything that's bad in the game will turn your experience into an absolute mental asylum that will make you go insane and never want to play a video game again. Small little spoiler: One of the idiots in the main plot of the story's name is ""Snake Fist"" that is someone who somehow knows what everything is going on in the setting. If the name ""Snake Fist"" didn't make you gag or cringe or whatever there's still much more brain devoid garbage that lies further into the story. In conclusion I'd like to say that F.E.A.R 2 is an absolute failure and should never be played because of how it will drive you into a mental asylum.

												SingleplayerYeah I just finished the story and I have to say, good job Monolith Studios. This sequel was a worthy continuation of the F.E.A.R. story. People who played the first part (as I did) will feel like they are coming home. If you played the first part everything will be familiar and you know most of the enemies and you will know most of the weapons that are available. The graphics are a bit outdated, but WHO cares when the story is awesome. I have to admit, Almas jumpscares couldn`t get me as bad as in the previous F.E.A.R. game. Because they were basically the same....But yes, I`ve seen parts in the game that made me really smile and think: Holy crap this is nicely done (school part) and some horror-movie directors should take this as example and maybe make better movies. But yes, thats another story. All in all I recommend this to ALL F.E.A.R. fans and people who dont mind about graphically outdated, brutal shooter-action, which this game can deliver easily.

												While the original FEAR managed to make you scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times with just the right amount of visuals, FEAR 2 kind of fails there. Yes, it's scary, but when what I'd assume was supposed to be the biggest random scare moment comes attached to a QTE and pops up again and again throughout the game, you quickly get over the scare factor and just get annoyed at the QTE breaking the flow of the game.Visualy, it looks damn good, the story is decently written and the enemy AI lives up to the hype. However, you spend the early part of the game without the ""Bullet Time"" from the first FEAR, since this is not a direct sewual, but a story that takes place somewhat parallel the the first, so you are not playing the silent protagonist from the first game.Honestly, this game was good when it was released, but now it falls into the ""decent"" catagory. At the current price it's worth it if you're a fan of the FEAR series like I am.			"

												While the original FEAR managed to make you scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times with just the right amount of visuals, FEAR 2 kind of fails there. Yes, it's scary, but when what I'd assume was supposed to be the biggest random scare moment comes attached to a QTE and pops up again and again throughout the game, you quickly get over the scare factor and just get annoyed at the QTE breaking the flow of the game.Visualy, it looks damn good, the story is decently written and the enemy AI lives up to the hype. However, you spend the early part of the game without the ""Bullet Time"" from the first FEAR, since this is not a direct sewual, but a story that takes place somewhat parallel the the first, so you are not playing the silent protagonist from the first game.Honestly, this game was good when it was released, but now it falls into the ""decent"" catagory. At the current price it's worth it if you're a fan of the FEAR series like I am.			"

												A huge pile of suck forced through the typical extremly linear FPS of its generation. It does nothing for the genre and all of its tricks are based in predictable jump scares and occasinally ""oh, isn't this creepy?"" sequences. All the weapons and explosion have a pithy impact compared to the first games (It's amazing how weak a frag grenade sounds like). Nothing here that you haven't seen in a shooter before beyond a couple neat weapons and a disturbing fascination with Alma - I think the overall idea is to make you feel sorry for her for some reason, but thats impossible when she's mutilating everybody and constantly trying to scare and attack you. Don't bother with this unless you get this with a bundle for completion's sake. Honestly, might be better just to stick with the first one if you even do that.			"

												This game has enough reviews already taken its age. So I'll just say this: it's a hell of a game! ... most of the time.I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of it. It had a nice pacing, alternating between an hostile and creepy atmosphere and a normal fps.That last 1/4 of it was... more of an on-rails fps, unfortunately. Very few ""horror-ish"" scenes, which made for a more generic experience. Also, the difficulty spiked, becoming far harder out of nowhere.But, it was definitely worth it for the rest of the game. The designers knew how to get the player uncomfortable, in a very good way. There were memorable situations. There were a few jumpscares, but they were well placed, so that's not an issue.It's not a very scary game, but it had its moments. Quality over quantity. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a creepier fps. But, it falls for some of the modern shooter trappings closer to the ending, unfortunately.Also, sound and visual design was great! This game still looks good, and sounds even better, even after 5 years.			"

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin:Intro:Alma is back in the second game of F.E.A.R. named F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. If you enjoyed the first game this will be worth your money.Do not expect this game to be a better version of the original game – there is no such a thing!This game got some improvements compared to the first F.E.A.R. game, but a lot of downsides as well.Graphic, controls, performance, & sound:Graphic: The overall graphics got enchanted to look shinier and more modern - I especially like the blood which looks a lot more like liquid compared to the first one, plus an added effect, bodies also drop organs sometimes when they explode - however I miss the random body part (like a arm or a leg) that could fly off into the distance from the first F.E.A.R. game. Generally effects like: explosions, bullet impacts on surface or ground and shotgun bursts, looks absolutely terrible in my option, its way to white/yellow and without any detail, looks like something done in a hurry and is very a shame!Controls: All controls can be customized and is a great way to use your own key liking. Also a new thing in F.E.A.R.2 is the sprint mechanic, however one thing I didn’t like is that you cannot toggle it on and off; if you toggle on your sprint it’ll last as long as the sprint meter is up, that can lead to awkward situations where you just need to stop up in a hurry even a half second faster count, if trying to avoid incoming attacks or taking cover.Performance: I haven’t had any performance issues at all running the game maxed out, always on a steady/capped 60 fps even on a low-end CPU and a small amount of ram.Sound: The sound effects work very well to create the dark and creepy atmosphere this game is going for. A common thing in the F.E.A.R. series is a high pitch noise whenever a scare is coming up, if I like it or not is the question, one could say it is hard to be taken off guard with such a mechanic.  Horror:Scares in the world of F.E.A.R. is a great thing, and I like that Alma appeared this much in the second game, however, the same kind of scares appeared way too often which only made it annoying and predictable.Asides from the point on scares (jump scares) this game has a surprisingly large focus on the small and creepy details of the horror genre, if one is to explore around like I did on my second walkthrough. I found a lot of things that I missed blindly first time, simply because I didn’t notice it, and that’s something I admire of a horror game. “You may not even realize they could be watching yah, aye?”Artificial Intelligence:The AI replica soldiers got a lot dumber compared to the first F.E.A.R. (or its expansions), their behavior is too monotonous, which makes killing them a little tedious and like a routine you go through. Their awareness is also not working like it should: Moving from floor 1 and up in the right side by the stairs, the AI’s standing on the left side of floor 2 spotted me, because I had a flashlight on (they yelling: we got a flashlight over here) – even though a wall was blocking their sight on floor 2. Uh makes sense? I think not!Overall:Even though this review may sound rather critical and demeaning, I do not mean any of it in a negative manner, and the game does have its good moments. This review is simply based on my own perspective, from my experience and thoughts about the game and I’ll certainly recommend it if you enjoyed the original F.E.A.R. game or its expansions and couldn’t get enough.The playtime value is about 12 hours.F.E.A.R. 2: Reborn:A very small DLC to the original F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin.I am not very impressed by the DLC due to the leak of new content.One thing the DLC did provide was some missing information for the 3rd F.E.A.R. game, but that alone isn’t worth getting the DLC for, in my option.Very low playtime value, I completed the DLC in less than an hour.

												Worse than the predecessor in nearly every way. Since the armor takes forever to deplete if you even try to take cover, the game is way too easy. The weapons aren't nearly as fun to use as before and cool stuff like dual wielding pistols or the cool lighting gun have been removed. The combat is just meh at best.The Alma scenes have been improved from the predecessor and there are some cool moments but they don't feel as threatening and atmospheric as before. In fact, the game feels dull pretty much all the time. It feels like playing a generic shooter with slowdown mechanic and a random girl walking around.Not to mention that this game plus the DLC took just as much time for me to beat as Extraction Point expansion for the first Fear, and unlike Extraction Point, this game isn't worth replaying because the combat is so forgettable. Just stick to the first Fear and pretend this one doesn't exist.			"

												I just finished it and i think its a good game. the sounds are nice, it has some creepy moments and also some funny easter eggs (During Interval 3, when Becket enters the crane control room where Colonel Vanek is first seen taunting the player, there is a readout on the control panel that reads, ""More dots, more dots, come on, more dots, ok, stop dots.""), the level design is nice. well the graphics are okay. the animations look realistic, exept the animation of shot enemys, they sometimes just dissapear or beam to the ground after bullet impact.the main game is a bit too easy in my opinion - you can just be rushing without dying a single time, on hard difficulty. the reborn dlc has a few more enemys and is a bit more of a challenge.all together its about 7,5 hours of fun and shouldnt be missing in your games collection.

												F.E.A.R. 2 is a big step up from the first game in many ways. It provides a more cinematic look as opposed to the first game's rough, arcade style. It's considerably scarier, shifting some of its focus towards more tangible horrors and fine-tuning its brand of psychological horror. It's prettier, with high-poly models, realistic animations, and a whole range of pretty shaders. F.E.A.R. 2 is a better game than its predecessor. It's a game that has finally learned how to scare you, even if that means abandoning pure psychological horror for a more threatening approach. It's not a game riddled with jump scares either. While the slow-mo takes off some of the horror edge, encounters with the new enemies and navigating the new setpieces is very frightening.As usual, the game's plot seriously sags in the middle, but I think the only real problem with the game is that the ending is so abrupt and disappointing. There's almost no buildup, and the final fight of the game is far too easy and builds almost no tension. And then, it abruptly ends. The game itself is short, which gives the game no room for pacing aside from moving between horror bits, action bits, and story bits. In fact, aside from the very ending, there's nothing new brought to the table here, story-wise. Just some backstory you don't need to know or could have already picked up from the first game.Despite F.E.A.R. 2's lackluster plot, short length and abrupt ending, it's a good game. The combat is as fluid as ever, the game feels more broad with its increased horror and cinematics, and the visuals and sounds have been spit-shined for a nice finish. If plot isn't your thing and you just want a good, tense, shooter, then F.E.A.R. 2 will deliver that and then some.			"

												It was very hard to enjoy FEAR 2 because: level design was very cooridor-like for most of the game same object (e.g. piano - why would there be 5 grand pianos in the same school??) repeated multiple times throughout the entire game, making environments look unrealistic. Where ever I went it felt like the same room with the same furniture arranged slightly differently. same enemies throughout the entire game, with almost no variation bad dialogue transitions between levels was unrealistic (say for example - and this doesn't happen in the game - you enter a restaurant and by the end of the mission you're in some underground prison) combat is dull - slow mo in Max Payne, for example, is a must have skillset, whereas in FEAR it feels unnecessary and cheap The story is convoluted and uninteresting, which then devolves the game into an excersize of just continually shooting at stuff as you move forward for no good reason until the game ends.Was definitely not worth my time.

Luckly I got it with the F.E.A.R. pack, do NOT pay $9.99 for this. It was the shortest mission pack I've ever played! Was quite disappointed. I believe it was barely 2 hours?

Though it's fun in the moment, F.E.A.R 2 ultimately doesn't elevate the series despite its best efforts to flesh out its hackneyed J-horror fiction into something more coherent.

Lemmme finish you impatient ♥♥♥♥♥♥.The first FEAR ends with a huge explosion, and alma climbing into your chopper to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you for one last time and get the final ""Wtf is going on"" from your lips.This game starts off in an APC all casual like and leads you along a nicely done kinda intro area if you will.then it proceeds to kinda make you jump outta your seat a little with a whole new set of tricks to scare the living s**t out of anyone with their eyeballs stuck to the screen.Then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, and turns into a beautiful action/horror game where your kicking a s  s and taking names all across the board. Slo Motion make the action so much sweeter in this game from simple gunfights to full blown wars with whatever the hell you feel like.All the while your taking ♥♥♥♥ from noone on you high horse of dousche baggery, the game places little tidbits of story info and background data alll over the place for you to look at, ingest, speculate about all of the crazy s**t happening to your character. The enviornments are heavily detailed and are able to be interacted with making no two firefights truly the same, and with a huger arsenal of brutal weapons ranging from simple pistols to high penetrating nailguns. This game truly shines in its one of a kind momennts where the action breaks and the player finds themselves isolated in very odd and peculiar places. Then the real fun begins.I give it an 8/10And this ♥♥♥♥ is cheap as dirt too			"

												Shooter mechanics are improved over the first game. Story is more complicated than the first one and really messed up by the end. Due to lack of FOV options and horrible HUD design you feel a little tunnel visioned. Also, this game has the most screen shakes of any other game in the planet, so you won't be able to aim anything properly and don't bother with the sniper rifle. It has pretty cool weapons too.			"

												Not quite good as the original F.E.A.R.. But still pretty damn enjoyable. The graphics are a little more cartoon looking than the original. I liked the audio better in the first game as well. Still, this game is fun. And the 2nd scariest game I've played next to the first one. ALSO, the DLC, F.E.A.R.: Reborn, WAS LAME! Luckly I got it with the F.E.A.R. pack, do NOT pay $9.99 for this. It was the shortest mission pack I've ever played! Was quite disappointed. I believe it was barely 2 hours? Also if the end of F.E.A.R.: Reborn doesn't connect with F.E.A.R. 3, than this DLC is totally pointless!			"

												F.E.A.R. 2 starts about 30 min before the ending of F.E.A.R. 1 and ignores the events of both expantions of the first game. Gameplay is changed drastically compared to the first one and it does feel very different, but still good nonetheless. Graphics are good and very smooth, seems like a good port to the PC. The game has creepy scenes but doesn't really scare like the first one, the ending is pretty disturbing though. Finished the main story in about 5 hours, and the DLC in about 1 hour. Cool shooter overall, worth the playthrough.			"

												F.E.A.R 2 succeeds in righting the wrongs of the original game and gives the series its own look for the first time. Though it's fun in the moment, F.E.A.R 2 ultimately doesn't elevate the series despite its best efforts to flesh out its hackneyed J-horror fiction into something more coherent. The multiplayer on the other hand, is just plain and lacks any of the flavour that F.E.A.R 2 brings to its single-player campaign.			"

												An interesting sequel to the original F.E.A.R., honestly I wasn't sure how exactly I felt about it to begin with because the protagonist has changed. I was quickly turned back into the little girl I was when playing the F.E.A.R., it starts off slow and you think you're in for a different ride, and in some ways you are, still you'll jump so hard that you'll get whiplash and freak out at stuff chasing you that you'll regret opening the game, but you know you have to finish it. Because it's just that good.			"

												FPS in which action runs smoothly for the player is able to slow time.

												F.E.A.R was one of the most terrifying, beatuiful, and technically competent games I had played back when it came out.F.E.A.R 2 pushes the JupiterEX engine to new (beatiful) heights, while at the same time losing some things that made F.E.A.R 1 seem so mind blowing. The environmental destructibility is far toned down. However, there are tons more fluid movements and more scripted ways to interact with the environment. I think this iteration is more immersive, if less impressive visually.Gameplay wise, it is pretty fluid and slick. Very enjoyable for a budget price. The expansion is short and doesn't really bring much to the table. However, the core game expands the story nicely and gives us a bit more insight into Alma. The voicemails are gone, which I find a huge regression/let down. We do have other text documents to read however.Weapons feel good, enemies are powerful, it looks and sounds great. What isn't to love?			"

												F.E.A.R. 2 has a cleaner look than the original, but inferior, console-like gameplay. I played through it a second time, and it's exactly as I remembered. It's not terrible as a stand-alone FPS, but it's a mediocre sequel that underwhelms and will appeal only to avid FPS players. The 'Reborn' expansion is shallow and can be completed in under an hour. Recommended only as a bargain-bin purchase.			"

												Pretty damn good game. Short but sweet. While not entirely bug-free, it's a lot more polished than its prequel. The game also seems to be a bit more clever with its scares, making the scary bits a lot more enjoyable.The level design is on par with the original FEAR, though a little more varied. Paths to objectives are unrealistically complex, but fun nonetheless.Combat is different. The AI seems to be less intelligent but can handle more damage and is more accurate when shooting. Some enemies towards the end can take a bit too much damage to my liking, but not to the point where it gets frustrating. There is no more peeking from cover, meaning you can't fight the same as you did in the original FEAR. On the other hand, it's much easier to flank enemies than it is in the original. While I prefer the original combat and enemies, I don't dislike the ones in FEAR 2. With the exception of fighting monsters, that is.The game's biggest fault, is that they wanted to include more enemy variety and ended up with some complete BS monsters. There's the fast-but-weak creepy-crawly monsters that are just an annoyance because they do so little damage but are hard to hit and the puppeteer monster that takes a ♥♥♥♥♥on of damage, keeps running away and has the most annoying attack in the world. The latter monster is challenging, sure, but also a real chore.The story is pretty fun, until you start to think about it and you discover some things that don't quite make sense (or aren't adequately explained, at least). The original game was the same, though.Both FEAR and FEAR 2 are must-plays.			"

												The game is much maliged by long term fans, though I don't really understand it. The game has all the essentials that the first one did. It  may not seem to push the envelope technologically as its predecessor did, but  FEAR 2 isn't a slouch in that regard either. In all, I enjoyed the act of PLAYING much more with this sequel. FEAR was a great game, and it wowed us all with its chip melting tech, but it also felt flimsy at times, almost like being in a diarama, however beautiful. FEAR 2 is solid, like a rock. It has weight, and more importantly, it has colour. What was excised from the formula has, I think, done more to strengthen the gameplay than weaken it. And it's ironic that critics bemoan the perceived loss of certain atmospheric and narrative elements in favour of increased action. Let's face it, FEAR was never 'scary'. It was tense, sure, but Condemned - THAT'S a scary Monolith game. The FEAR series has always been primarily for the action, and this second game delivers.			"

It  may not seem to push the envelope technologically as its predecessor did, but  FEAR 2 isn't a slouch in that regard either. In all, I enjoyed the act of PLAYING much more with this sequel. FEAR was a great game, and it wowed us all with its chip melting tech, but it also felt flimsy at times, almost like being in a diarama, however beautiful. FEAR 2 is solid, like a rock. It has weight, and more importantly, it has colour. What was excised from the formula has, I think, done more to strengthen the gameplay than weaken it. And it's ironic that critics bemoan the perceived loss of certain atmospheric and narrative elements in favour of increased action. Let's face it, FEAR was never 'scary'. It was tense, sure, but Condemned - THAT'S a scary Monolith game. The FEAR series has always been primarily for the action, and this second game delivers.			"

												Shooter mechanics are improved over the first game. Story is more complicated than the first one and really messed up by the end. Due to lack of FOV options and horrible HUD design you feel a little tunnel visioned. Also, this game has the most screen shakes of any other game in the planet, so you won't be able to aim anything properly and don't bother with the sniper rifle. It has pretty cool weapons too.			"

												As a sequel, this game expands the story nicely, though the gameplay (except for using objects as cover) is weaker than in the first game. This is a very linear, console shooter.

												Personally, one of the first horror games that I've played all the way through. It was definitely a blast and I enjoyed it. I didn't have the lore from the previous F.E.A.R, so I may not have gotten the entire idea of Alma or what exactly happened to her. The graphics were superb, but somewhat unomptimised. The story was well written with some really spooky moments, but not really scary. The story was fairly short, considering I finished it within 5 hours, but still longer than most games nowadays.Overall, I can say I enjoyed the game way more than I expected. Currently running through F.E.A.R 3 and enjoying it as well.			"

												A sequel to the first FEAR which came out in '05, this game picks up almost immediatly after the first game. The 4 year gap gave FEAR 2 a chance to refresh its color scheme, giving the game a new look but keeping the same atmosphere. The game has a great visual design, definitely a step up from the bland grey theme that dominated the first game. Effects and animations are top notch and sound design is also well done. Gameplay is the typical FPS affair with various guns and enemies to shoot. The game changes things up with some turret shooting, mech fighting and a few neat set pieces. Slow mo is back and feels great as always. The story is told through in game cutscenes with good voice actors and cool effects. The plot is ok even though it can come across a ittle cheesy at some points. The haunting atmosphere is great, especially with the lights off. The only problem I can think of is the length of the game. I blew through it in a little under five hours but I was speeding through alot of the game. I didnt even read any of journals scattered throughout the levels that flesh out some backstory on whats going on. Ultimately, this is a great FPS with a effective horror theme. I could recommend this to horror fans and FPS fans alike.			"

												Certainly not as good as F.E.A.R but still an enjoyable experience.The scares were few and when they came they were very dull and predictable.For the majority of the game you are in familiar settings from the first game (and expansions), Offices, Hospital, Subway & Underground facilities.As nice as it was to revisit the FEAR world and story, this whole game was all just, OK.It never really made me say WOW just, ""Heeeey I remember that from FEAR 1"" Its like they took the first game, updated the graphics and took out the originality by duplicating very similar locations from the first.Overall, Id rate this game: 5/10Its alright. But id definitely get it only if on sale, its not really worth a whole lot.I highly recommend FEAR and the expansions (though the expansions were not made by the same people and don't tie into FEAR 2.

There are few surprise scare moments, so those with weak heart beware :).Overall game feels great, but my only negative thing though is how short it is. I finished story in about 10 hours, and I usually expect at least minimum 15 hours of story game play.

												It was very hard to enjoy FEAR 2 because: level design was very cooridor-like for most of the game same object (e.g. piano - why would there be 5 grand pianos in the same school??) repeated multiple times throughout the entire game, making environments look unrealistic. Where ever I went it felt like the same room with the same furniture arranged slightly differently. same enemies throughout the entire game, with almost no variation bad dialogue transitions between levels was unrealistic (say for example - and this doesn't happen in the game - you enter a restaurant and by the end of the mission you're in some underground prison) combat is dull - slow mo in Max Payne, for example, is a must have skillset, whereas in FEAR it feels unnecessary and cheap The story is convoluted and uninteresting, which then devolves the game into an excersize of just continually shooting at stuff as you move forward for no good reason until the game ends.Was definitely not worth my time.

With so many jump scare crap games out there that have flooded the market it's nice to go back to one of the originals I played and am still slightly frightened of today. While the multiplayer no longer is online the single player in and of itself it more than enough for the money this game is worth.It's one thing to be put in a horror world and be told to run from creatures with nothing but a flashlight in your hand. This game gives you all the weapons and ammo you could want and stills scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. Overall a really great game that was followed by a pathetic sequel.			"

												F.E.A.R. 2 doesn't really do anything thaaat new as an FPS.  But it does the FPS thing very well.  The main thing is how atmospheric the game is.  The combat might be relatively fast (even with the slomo powers), but the game beckons you to stop and look around once it's over.  And for such a linear game, there is always quite a bit to look at and take in.  I liked the first F.E.A.R. game because of the atmosphere and level of detail, as well.  But it suffered from a small budget.  The studio was able to make a lot more assets for F.E.A.R. 2, so the settings are much more varied.  So essentially, here, they did the thing I liked about the first game, but more.Also, the game runs really well even on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hardware, despite how good it looks, so that's another plus.			"

												F.E.A.R 2 improves upon the first one in many ways, with the good outweighing the bad. A main complaint is the absence of peek and lean, which is by no means a game breaker, a lesser one is that while the new weapons are extremely fun to use, they could have done a bit more innovating with this game's counterparts to the older weapons - certain are not as fun to shoot anymore. However, things like the laser and the main rifle being much more enjoyable than the rifle in F.E.A.R (assault, not the ASP) make up for it. Great pacing, narrative, production values (although still some things particularly in the sound department are inconsistent but that's something it shares with the first game). The game changes enough to offer a new experience without getting rid of the F.E.A.R feel - the largest improvement being that much of what was previously endless office buildings are now more varied and engaging. I consider this to be the final true game in the series.			"

												Personally, one of the first horror games that I've played all the way through. It was definitely a blast and I enjoyed it. I didn't have the lore from the previous F.E.A.R, so I may not have gotten the entire idea of Alma or what exactly happened to her. The graphics were superb, but somewhat unomptimised. The story was well written with some really spooky moments, but not really scary. The story was fairly short, considering I finished it within 5 hours, but still longer than most games nowadays.Overall, I can say I enjoyed the game way more than I expected. Currently running through F.E.A.R 3 and enjoying it as well.			"

												A sequel to the first FEAR which came out in '05, this game picks up almost immediatly after the first game. The 4 year gap gave FEAR 2 a chance to refresh its color scheme, giving the game a new look but keeping the same atmosphere. The game has a great visual design, definitely a step up from the bland grey theme that dominated the first game. Effects and animations are top notch and sound design is also well done. Gameplay is the typical FPS affair with various guns and enemies to shoot. The game changes things up with some turret shooting, mech fighting and a few neat set pieces. Slow mo is back and feels great as always. The story is told through in game cutscenes with good voice actors and cool effects. The plot is ok even though it can come across a ittle cheesy at some points. The haunting atmosphere is great, especially with the lights off. The only problem I can think of is the length of the game. I blew through it in a little under five hours but I was speeding through alot of the game. I didnt even read any of journals scattered throughout the levels that flesh out some backstory on whats going on. Ultimately, this is a great FPS with a effective horror theme. I could recommend this to horror fans and FPS fans alike.			"

												Certainly not as good as F.E.A.R but still an enjoyable experience.The scares were few and when they came they were very dull and predictable.For the majority of the game you are in familiar settings from the first game (and expansions), Offices, Hospital, Subway & Underground facilities.As nice as it was to revisit the FEAR world and story, this whole game was all just, OK.It never really made me say WOW just, ""Heeeey I remember that from FEAR 1"" Its like they took the first game, updated the graphics and took out the originality by duplicating very similar locations from the first.Overall, Id rate this game: 5/10Its alright. But id definitely get it only if on sale, its not really worth a whole lot.I highly recommend FEAR and the expansions (though the expansions were not made by the same people and don't tie into FEAR 2. They are still great)			"

Great graphics, intriguing and mysterious story, great controls, above par A.I, exceptional audio and unrivaled atmosphere. The attention to detail is astounding. Everything from graffiti to the text on little sheets of paper are clearly detailed. The environments are believable and the placement of signs and furniture are all correct. Nothing ever gets or feels repetitive. The mech sequences are MINDBLOWINGLY awesome. Enviromental destruction was a total treat! The levels are all varied and are definitely some of the best ever created. The game always feels fresh. The guns all feel unique and are quite varied.

												I just finished it and i think its a good game. the sounds are nice, it has some creepy moments and also some funny easter eggs (During Interval 3, when Becket enters the crane control room where Colonel Vanek is first seen taunting the player, there is a readout on the control panel that reads, ""More dots, more dots, come on, more dots, ok, stop dots.""), the level design is nice. well the graphics are okay. the animations look realistic, exept the animation of shot enemys, they sometimes just dissapear or beam to the ground after bullet impact.the main game is a bit too easy in my opinion - you can just be rushing without dying a single time, on hard difficulty. the reborn dlc has a few more enemys and is a bit more of a challenge.all together its about 7,5 hours of fun and shouldnt be missing in your games collection.

												A worthy sequel a few things of note, the game feels alot easier compared to fear 1 and consolised in some ways the save system is a abit of a joke and the slow mo seems to be quite op but as with FEAR 1 there are some really great creepy moments the devs know how to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up if you play the game late at night in a dark room.The weapons this time around are a alittle more interesting my only gripe was I played on medium difficulty so I never really ran out of ammo and ammo was littered everywhere, I would say enemies were still quite smart flanking and taking cover in order to advance to their target (me). This time around you get to pilot a giant mech! gundam fans eat your heart out! xD I really enjoyed that part I wont spoil the story too much but i really liked the ending and genuinely felt empathy for Alma poor girl :( In conclusion great game well worth a purchase especially if you liked the first if I have one gripe its just the game is a little short.

												F.E.A.R. 2 is a big step up from the first game in many ways. It provides a more cinematic look as opposed to the first game's rough, arcade style. It's considerably scarier, shifting some of its focus towards more tangible horrors and fine-tuning its brand of psychological horror. It's prettier, with high-poly models, realistic animations, and a whole range of pretty shaders. F.E.A.R. 2 is a better game than its predecessor. It's a game that has finally learned how to scare you, even if that means abandoning pure psychological horror for a more threatening approach. It's not a game riddled with jump scares either. While the slow-mo takes off some of the horror edge, encounters with the new enemies and navigating the new setpieces is very frightening.As usual, the game's plot seriously sags in the middle, but I think the only real problem with the game is that the ending is so abrupt and disappointing. There's almost no buildup, and the final fight of the game is far too easy and builds almost no tension. And then, it abruptly ends. The game itself is short, which gives the game no room for pacing aside from moving between horror bits, action bits, and story bits. In fact, aside from the very ending, there's nothing new brought to the table here, story-wise. Just some backstory you don't need to know or could have already picked up from the first game.Despite F.E.A.R. 2's lackluster plot, short length and abrupt ending, it's a good game. The combat is as fluid as ever, the game feels more broad with its increased horror and cinematics, and the visuals and sounds have been spit-shined for a nice finish. If plot isn't your thing and you just want a good, tense, shooter, then F.E.A.R. 2 will deliver that and then some.			"

												Possibly the best AAA horror game I've played. With so many jump scare crap games out there that have flooded the market it's nice to go back to one of the originals I played and am still slightly frightened of today. While the multiplayer no longer is online the single player in and of itself it more than enough for the money this game is worth.It's one thing to be put in a horror world and be told to run from creatures with nothing but a flashlight in your hand. This game gives you all the weapons and ammo you could want and stills scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. Overall a really great game that was followed by a pathetic sequel.			"

												Dare I say it? Yes! This is the Half Life of this generation. This is perfection right here. Great graphics, intriguing and mysterious story, great controls, above par A.I, exceptional audio and unrivaled atmosphere. The attention to detail is astounding. Everything from graffiti to the text on little sheets of paper are clearly detailed. The environments are believable and the placement of signs and furniture are all correct. Nothing ever gets or feels repetitive. The mech sequences are MINDBLOWINGLY awesome. Enviromental destruction was a total treat! The levels are all varied and are definitely some of the best ever created. The game always feels fresh. The guns all feel unique and are quite varied. This game is now officially in the top 3 of best first person shooters ever made.Rating: PERFECT!			"

												F.E.A.R.2 was a great game like most people would say, nice combat, cool storyline, tough enemys, and a giant mech suit!The game was really good for me but the problem was, it was a really short game, F.E.A.R. 1 was 14 hours (for me) in the main game with an extra 10 or so with the added on extras so F.E.A.R. 2 being 2 hours long (3 with the DLC) was a bummer. Non the less, still a great game for what it offers with a large range of awards to unlock and if you are a F.E.A.R. fan line me, then you should get it.Although this has nothing to do with F.E.A.R.2, F.E.A.R.3's reviews are really bad but im still going to get it despite peoples opinions and i will review the game on that page when i finish it to give my opinion if it really is bad - like the reviews say - or if its worth playing as a F.E.A.R. fan.

												First FEAR, good. Second FEAR, not so much. The gunfire sounds like someone's eating poprocks near you and there are these idiotic places where you have to jump from place to place where it would've been really easy to just climb up. I'm playing an FPS action game, not Super Mario Brothers. If I wanted to jump from place to place in sections of the game, I'd get an arcade game. The graphics are nice, I'll give them that, but it's not nearly as impressive as the first FEAR was for it's time. The lighting is quite standard and even the dust, which used to be a big deal, is absent.It's not bad. It's just very standard and has more scare value than actual fear value.			"

												Despite having loved the first FEAR, its sequel is a seriously mixed bag.  The weapons are fairly satisfying, although the energy weapon and laser are stupidly awkward.  Gunplay in general still feels right, but the AI lacks the level of skill and more believable squad tactics that made the gunfights in original so dynamic and enjoyable.  Things feel much more scripted now, which while not necessarily bad, certainly makes for less engaging fights overall.This almost goes without saying, but the game looks far better than the original. but it generally lacks the same unnerving tension that FEAR managed to create so regularly.  It definitely has its moments, to be sure, but it's far more sporadic.  Put differently, a lot of the scares (jump or otherwise) felt extremely formulaic at this point, with even sightings of Alma being generally unremarkable.  There were definitely some good (albeit disturbing) revelations--like the purpose of the school, or the extent of the experiments on Alma, the prototypes, and all the would-be candidates for the Program--but a lot of it still felt a bit perfunctory to me.  Maybe it's because a lot of the mystery was gone by that point.I don't want to give it away, but I found the ending totally unexpected, disturbing, but also appropriate to the kind of dark, adult story being told--particularly considering its many troublesome implications.  However, my ""liking"" of the ending and FEAR2 overall was also predicated on FEAR3 finally connecting all the dots in a satisfying and sufficiently harrowing way, which it most definitely did not do.  I'm seriously torn here, but I'm going to have to down-vote this one: I don't regret playing it per say, but I also can't recommend it with a straight face.  Come for the tight gunplay and lukewarm scares if you like, but if that doesn't do much for you then just play the original again and pretend that its progressively less satisfying sequels never hit store shelves.

												Huge fan of the F.E.A.R series. F.E.A.R 2 is defintaly the best out of the 3. F.3.A.R was ok but strafed out of the horror segments too much and was just an all-rounder action shooter.F.E.A.R 2 has a good balance between fright and fight. Beefy accurate weapons with rate of fire options plus grenade types. The graphics are decent enough for a 2009 game and was quite demanding for PC power back in its prime. F.E.A.R 2 has outstanding animation in the enemies such as interacting with the enviroments to provide cover, dashing through windows or vaulting over ledges. Its so detailed if they set on fire near a ledge they will frail over and jump off in a panic or getting a shotgun slug to the chest, stagger back and think what the hell just hit them. Theres also the camoflague assassins that will roll around, backflip off walls and such to try and dazzle you before striking.Then theres Alma. The key character that will stalk and haunt you as you play. She seems to have techincal connections with your crosshair as where ever you look she will appear before you in rigid postions before leaping towards you.However there are things I am not happy with and thats the controls. The weapon selection can be quite messy, the ability to lean left and right from the original f.e.a.r has been taken out and also doesnt seem to be compatible with gaming mice as it only registers 2 mouse buttons which is terrible to say f.e.a.r could register 5.

												 First of all compliments to the great game engine. Its shooting physics and gun play are very well done. The campaign plays just like Half-Life 2, with the story being told in the same way. Only difference is that there's random hallucinations mixed in at appropriate times. These are very well-done and although not scary, they create a great, mysterious atmosphere. The biggest disappointment is that there are no ranked multiplayer matches (2011), with only 1 or 2 unranked servers online at any given time. It's a shame since the multiplayer has potential to be fun and perhaps more polished than F.E.A.R. Combat's. The story is short with a lack of varied environments and gameplay. However, what you do get is of fairly decent quality and there's nothing like it out there. I played the demo on Xbox 360 and on PC before purchasing and it's quite clear that this game was made for the PC judging by the wealth of buttons in this game. Overall it's a decent game but not good value for money.			"

For me this is at best an average FPS with OK atmosphere.  Is it worth $15 CDN? No.  Is the DLC with another $10? No.  If you get it in a bundle play it.  If you can get the collection cheap ... even better.  Take a weekend and just enjoy it.For me it's thumbs down just for the price. $25 CDN for the game + DLC is just too steep. $55 CDN for the collection is excessive.  If the game + dlc drops to $5 or the collection for $15 then I'll go thumbs up. That said.  TY for the Demo.  Every dev should post a demo. "

												All the good things from FEAR 1 remain intact if slightly simplified. The fun to fight enemies are still in (they will shoot an explosive barrel if you are near one, they won't mindlessly run after you one by one, and they have great smooth movement animations), the ""scary"" bits are still there (I personally never thought FEAR was really that scary) and the storyline doesn't take itself too seriously. Overall, a very entertaining and functional FPS.			"

												To sum it up, its a generic FPS thats based off the original but in no way recreates it or really continues the lineage of FEAR but rather takes inspiration from that game in the form of bullets on a powerpoint. Its not bad, I have played far worse but its definetly not good either.It felt like they looked at F.E.A.R. and just made a casualised/consolised version of the game instead of taking the first game and building onto that. Unfortunately it dousn't take anything that was good from the first game and build onto that and feels more like a generic FPS of these days rather than anything like the, now classic, original. The great AI is gone and feels much more basic now while they still attempt to recreate the original they feel much more stupid. The maps have alot more detail but sit at either at being simplistic places to run through or overly complicated areas where you get turned around and confused where to go. The areas though do look nice and the graphics in general are a huge jump forward in fidelity but something is lost in the transfer. The 1st game had a very flat and empty graphical design (either due to intended design or hardware limits of the time) that added towards the atmosphere which is lost with 2.  There is also alot more involvement with NPCs but unfortunately the story isn't exactly the easiest to understand or make sense at all. Honestly with this type of story there isn't much sense to be made and its more of a thriller than a story book. The scaryness isn't really there aside from a handfull of jump and other scares but its not a scary game anymore than the first and probably less so. Its mainly a shooter like the original game, but you end up fighting the same enemies over and over and scenarios reminiscent of the original game. Unfortunately the AI of the old game and feeling of a dynamic shootout escapes this one as the experience feels more canned than homemade.I would only recommend playing this if you just played FEAR and want more of that type of game or if you just want to play a generic style FPS and know what your getting into. The cinematics and writing is pretty good, but if you wanting something super serious all the way through than the writing will fail you from the very start of the game. But it tries to be serious at certain points but its hard to care about the characters in a game where the gameplay feels generic and bland. Its also very easy, for the most part you can either just blaze through areas or take advantage of faults in the AI to get past enemies more easily.Meh "

												5/10 Just another FPS. Has nothing to do with F.E.A.R 1. Don't buy it. Just replay fear1.  It is truely a big letdown in comparison with fear 1. FEAR 1 was very well written, the flow was amazing. I was scared many times and I loved the music, the atmosphere, the story, the constant tension, it was amazing. Fear 2 is just a plain first person shooter with ridicolous ""wannabe"" scary moments. But it is never scary for real. The difficulty settings aren't balanced. Medium is just boring and you can rush trough, hard difficulty is just annoying because the enemies spawn from all sides and without the slowmo you just get eaten alive. It all feels plain and dull. I am not going to finish this game and start with fear 3, hoping it will be anything like fear1.			"

												F.E.A.R. 2 Is a consolified mess of a game. It is worse than the first one in every single gameplay aspect. The scares and ghost parts are unbelievably annoying and not scary in any way, shape, or form. Enemy AI is pretty dumb as is the plot. The shooting isn't terrible, but ""isn't terrible"" isn't a quote you'd see on the boxart.5/10			"

												I'm not going to waste time trying to make this post presentable, so here's a stream of consciousness (all comparisons are held against F.E.A.R. 1):Dirty dirty console port, cell shaded graphics do not fit the theme, aiming feels inaccurate, the AI is stupider, there are no graphics settings other than to change the resolution, spawn points are blatantly obvious and depressingly-purposefully annoying, the game speed is slow enough where you don't even need slo mo (fear1 is so fast you actually need it), overall it's too easy to really get into combat yet I get instakilled frequently by things I can't see (enemies spawn right behind you). FEAR1 had sprawling levels where squads could strategically engage you (or be engaged by you)- FEAR2 is all cheap spawn points in linear, uninspired level design. Ammo is dropped every two inches, it can't differentiate between left CTRL and right CTRL (fear1 could), it bugs out if you press too many keys at once (it often gets stuck strafing right, it often doesn't register keypresses, etc). Moreover the story is filled with cheap thrills and the plot is insanely stupid- they've never heard of ""less is more"". And the way alma is rendered is also less scary.FEAR1's plot wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch; it had some really good and unique ideas in the meat of the story, but the frame-plot / getting to the meat of the story was pretty blatantly stupid. However it was at least *paced*; seems to me like they just wanted to play with some neat horror ideas and didn't really care too much about the rest of the plot- any excuse to get the player alone in some creepy environments would do. The game is about exploring ideas, and it is about exploring Alma's backstory; clearly not a lot of effort was put into leading up to that. Knowing that the plot was largely bad, they interspersed truly intriguing elements along the way and approached the more interesting ideas *slowly*.FEAR2's approach to storytelling is to have some guy call you up and explain just about everything to you. There's no suspense or pacing. It's just... all bad.-------------------------------------F.E.A.R. 2 Reborn DLC-------------------------------------This one really builds you up just to let you down- in the beginning, things look AWESOME. Several huge issues with FEAR2 are corrected! Points in Reborn's favor:- You control a replica soldier- without slow motion abilities- with health given in numbers rather than a bar (both are good but if you have to pick one, go with numbers).- working in tandem with a squad of ally replica soldiers- with a clear, concise, simple objective that isn't stupid- You pursue enemies across sandbox like maps- no jack in the box spawn points! Enemies are actually walking around!- You are actually made vulnerable at one point; you have nothing but your firsts and you must figure out how to kill a patrol of 6-7 enemies often walking in pairs WITHOUT SLOWMO! A challenge! Well not really, there's an obviously scripted opening in which a pair split up and one of them faces his back to you long enough for you to easily kill him, grab his gun and shoot his partner. But hey, better than any given situation in all of FEAR2Then fettel gives you hallucinations in which you shoot at ghosts in self defense. When you get back to reality, you see that you have killed your squad. That is a praiseworthy mechanic and story element- or it would be if it were in a different game exploring the effects of PTSD. Here it is simply a convenient way for the game to start being complete ♥♥♥♥.Now,- you have slow mo- you have no squad, and everything that moves is your enemy- enemies spawn at stupid predefined places as usual- You are never again vulnerable / without plenty of guns to choose from- it is basically just what FEAR2 was likeQuite disappointing. And alma was in her child form again for some reason, trying to kill you. OK, what? To both points. Why is she a kid again suddenly? Why is she trying to kill you? Why does fettel have you kill your squad rather than just instruct everyone that you're going on a solo mission for a bit? He is a ♥♥♥♥ing commander of the entire replica army after all. Why is alma preventing you, both personally and by way of ordering replicas to kill you, from reviving her dead son? Her son who spent the entirety of the previous game trying to set her free?This is really just a jumble of plot points shoved together with minimal effort, providing absolutely nothing new. It's just FEAR2 recycled in no particularly interesting way, and a deliberate ""we want more money!"" DLC.			"

												this game...this game was so so so so disappointing to be fair to anyone who reads this im just going to flag this all as a spoiler cause it's that bad. I really wanted to like this game, i really wanted to like the fear series but the promises and expectations this game promised are commmmmmmmplete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. First off this game should not be called FEAR, it should be called ""scripted events you wont notice but we will make your HUD twitch to tell you it is happening"". Also the smart UI of NPCs is complete trash and it doesn't become more difficult when the damn NPCs continue to ANNOUNCE WHAT THEY ARE DOING ""gernade out!"" WELL I GUESS I WILL MOVE. The story is so thin and tries to give back story to Alma by sending you to her elementary school and trying to showcase how she is a victim of the experiments on her and she was just different. And yeah thats fine i guess if you just showed me like a short cinematic that detailed this instead of making me walk through repetative buildings and terrible outdated combat scenarios i would have appreciated that.but the finale... after everything that game made me walk through the ending wasn't just terrible it was kind of offensive.You get ♥♥♥♥♥ by the ghost of Alma, yup it happens she ties you down to a chair and induces halucinations on you and inbetween the final fight you see flashing cut scenes of her riding you and after the fight she appears before you magical pregnant. after seeing that I was done with the series and have made a promise to never play another FEAR.

The first real sequel to the original F.E.A.R.

Great gameplay/graphics, better characters and storyline although not as scary.
Very difficult enemies like before, with new boss battles which are extremely challenging, SO challenging that it ruins it F*CKING GAME!

You get more weapons to choose from, and finally able to aim down the sights for better accuracy.

The story does the typical scenario(s) where you spend so much time meeting up with your teammates, only to be separated again by random sh*t occuring, then repeat.

Very gorey, and would highly recommend if you like the original F.E.A.R. game!

												This is a surprisingly good shooter. It's got the old school health and armor system but there are always health and armor pickups in plain sight between firefights so you never have to backtrack to find more health. The weapons are really nice. You can hold 4 weapons so you can pretty much grab whatever is lying around and not worry about being poorly equipped for the next part and there are only really 1 or 2 weapons that suck and not worth grabbing. Enemies always drop plenty of ammo so you can just fire away. One thing that makes this game stand out gameplay wise is the slow-motion ability. It feels really nice to use, looks cool and helps to stop the game from feeling like a generic shooter. Then there are the spooky parts. While not necessarily scary they do really add to the environment of the game. The game looks very good at max settings and is very well detailed and surprisingly full of colour. While it doesn't massively deviate from the standard shooter genre at the time it shows that shooters can still be different and fun. I give it 4 brain aneurysms out of 5.			"

												Making sequels is a gamble. You have, on one hand, an opportunity learn from your mistakes and make this an even better game. On the other hand, you might unknowingly alienate fans with unnecessary additions. Sadly, it is within the latter category that Project Origin sits.F.E.A.R. (the original) is a great game and to improve upon it is no easy task. It boasts a tense atmosphere made all the better by its excellent artificial intelligence. One would expect the sequel to build upon, if not at least around, what made its predecessor great. Project Origin instead bolts the other way.Keeping F.E.A.R's weak story and generic gunplay, Project Origin is even less frightening. The fantastic pacing is now replaced with frequent jolts of action sequences. But most unforgivable of all, is the dumbing down of the A.I.Maybe I've become too familiar with the nuances of F.E.A.R.'s computer controlled enemies. Regardless, Project Origin offers neither challenge nor robust campaign.Grade: B-			"

												I saw comments saying this was distinctly lower quality than the original game and its expansions, but I personally found FEAR 2 to be much more fun than the first and it provided a fairly diverse gaming experience in terms of varied locations, a more healthy selection of enemy types (though still largely clones and mercs), and the plot was far more interesting, even a little spine tingling. The level designs featured rich detail and I appreciated that both objectives and exits were more clearly defined. The makers also kept things from getting overly repetitive by staggering sequences where you use Avatar-like power armor and arenas where you're forced to use your sniping skills. However, the character dialogue was stilted and crammed with poorly utilized profanity, and you have no means to alter the progression of events. In the end, I thought it was a mixed bag much like the original, but still a genuinely entertaining experience and with some very impressive visual flourishes.			"

												- Do not think of this as a horror game. Think of this as a shooter with paranormal elements.- Story is forgettable but never gets too much in your way.- Gameplay is fine, too few guns but the assault guns you get are good enough and feel fine.- Enemies never get too much in your way- Ending is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t power fantasy coupled with a weak final battle.F.E.A.R 1 is better but this is playable if you find it on the cheap.

												Fear 2: Project Origin tells the story of psychic soldiers, crazy little girls, secrets and coverups. There are some cutscenes and readable backstory but seriously, that's not why we are here. We are here for some good old ultra violence. So let's look into that.The game tries to be cinematic with it's slow-mo combat but now in the year 2015 it fails. The effects that maybe once were cutting edge are now average at best. To get as much sparks in the air as possible there needs to be a lot of bullets flying and what this means is that all weapons are horribly inaccurate and ineffective. Single headshot with assault rifle does nothing, you need 2-3. Spraying at a distance of say 15 meters you can be sure that you need atleast 20-30 smg rounds to kill an enemy. The sniper rifle is the players best friend even indoors.Project Origin is new enough to have physics modeling but it basically only applies to corpses. Throw a grenade into an office full of desks, books etc. and very little moves. So no redeeming factors there either. Bullet spongy enemies without a proper fireworks display gets old fast. The game has few sections where the player gets to pilot a mech and in those you can destroy a decent amount of the scenery. Why it's restricted only to these levels is beyond me.What suprised me most though was how powerless the sound design is. The weapon sounds and explosions are really weak. The design is also weird: For example if you stand next to and look at something that makes noise (machine, person talking, burning corpse etc.) you hear the sound it makes. Turn 180 and the sound almost disappears. Face the object again and it returns. When that is added to the lackluster visuals there really isn't much for the senses. Needless to say, on a modern machine Fear 2 runs without problems. On top of that it does have a wide range of graphical options to choose from.Fear in this game translates into jump scares and they really are not scary. Some of the most gory parts are ghastly but there is no sense of threat. It's just blood and gore. Levels are made of grey facilities or ruins of a city so no wild set design here. At one part of the game the player has to navigate through a literal monster closet factory which was just silly. Fortunately the AI is really aggressive and they will run after the player like bloodhounds and throw grenades like they have boxes full of them on hand. Only problem is that they tend to come at you one or two at a time so it's rarely overwhelming. On the hardest difficulty the player character dies really easily which is a good thing but it only emphasizes the fact that similarily equiped enemies can take bullets like rain.In todays market, where there are loads of games available and a lot on sale at all times, you can do much better than Fear 2: Project origin. The first F.E.A.R might have some value as a classic or a game that pushed the genre forward and maybe should be played for that reason. This second installment doesn't even have that quality. It's not unplayable or anything, it just doesn't have much to offer anymore.			"

												This is a surprisingly good shooter. It's got the old school health and armor system but there are always health and armor pickups in plain sight between firefights so you never have to backtrack to find more health. The weapons are really nice. You can hold 4 weapons so you can pretty much grab whatever is lying around and not worry about being poorly equipped for the next part and there are only really 1 or 2 weapons that suck and not worth grabbing. Enemies always drop plenty of ammo so you can just fire away. One thing that makes this game stand out gameplay wise is the slow-motion ability. It feels really nice to use, looks cool and helps to stop the game from feeling like a generic shooter. Then there are the spooky parts. While not necessarily scary they do really add to the environment of the game. The game looks very good at max settings and is very well detailed and surprisingly full of colour. While it doesn't massively deviate from the standard shooter genre at the time it shows that shooters can still be different and fun. I give it 4 brain aneurysms out of 5.			"

												Scary as all hell game. Replayability value, too! Not much to say, really, your average FPS, run around, shoot, lean around corners, regular movement is all there. No crawl or creep, however, just crouch. Kinda boring, right? Well... no. This game has all kinds of screwed up ♥♥♥♥ to keep you entertained. You spend much of it witnessing screwed up ♥♥♥♥ happening, or seeing the 'after' side of the picture. Want to nail army guys to walls? You can do that. Want to set them on fire, THEN nail them to walls? That too. Or just blow them apart with shotguns? Oh hell yes. The combat never gets boring. Grenades are good, too, with a very handy five-count GUI. There's a nice amount of different types, too, for an FPS. Standard frag, then shock, then incendiary. I do think there is stun, too, but can't remember. The story is awesome too!

												Dear F.E.A.R 2, Thank you for setting 2 steps backwards in terms of AI and gameplay in comparison to your predecessor: F.E.A.R. The removal of peeking makes the gameplay feels dull and forces me to use slomo in such an excellent way, because the only reason why I would ever need to use slomo is due to the fact I am now forced to be unable to peek from corners. Not because I don't want to, but because apparently it was decided that slomo and corner peeking can't coexist, or I will be inevitably overpowered in the game. Slomo! Anyone? AI's are significantly dumber and scripted, have ridiculously little amount of health, and worse accuracy compared with in FEAR, making those especially with power suit and yellow facial plates look like bulky paper dolls. (and to add to the drama, they explode upon being shot at and blast into pieces.. is that normal?) Even on hard difficulty, in quite amount of situations where I have sufficient cover, it is still very doable to take out the whole AI squat standing kinda in the open without using slomo (can't peek now remember?), making the game feels awkwardly imbalanced and the combat becomes amature and boring because I simply couldn't peek from corners while AI's can - the only thing that makes them seem more intelligent than me in this game. And the guns -- where is the recoil? It makes the shooing feel so plastic and unrealistic with low recoil compared to weapons in FEAR. If FEAR was a pure experience of pleasurable shooter with excellent combat system and AI designs, F.E.A.R 2 is but a bland sequel that takes away most of that pleasure from the previous FEAR in exchange for brilliant ideas such as story log which I can pick up from the game and checking them out by pressing the Tab key accompanied by the euphonic sound in the background consist of the annoying static-sounding beep.Also, many thanks to the try-hard-but-failed scary scenes that mistook the concept of gore with fear. Surely I might fear the gory content, but that should not be where the scare lies. FEAR delivered a better and deeper psychological fear while here in F.E.A.R 2, it's being considerably reduced to the very superficial. Appreciate that. The saddest part, was that the in game music is so original but doesn't feel the same anymore much thanks to such downgrades mentioned above.. Sincerely, Me. If you, someone who reads this right now, own F.E.A.R, let the glory stays with it because that's where the fun is gonna be. Don't bother with this one. It could still be a decent shooter to you if you haven't played FEAR, but certainly not those who did, unfortunately. 2.5h is already a complement, any more than that i shall feel sorry for not using the time to play FEAR instead. You might argue that the lack of peek function is but a different focus the game decide to have, however, to FEAR's own standard, this is unacceptable and a huge shame.			"

												FEAR 2 is the sequel to FEAR (obviously). You play as a Delta Force soldier named Michael Beckett who is sent to capture Armacham (the bad guys from 1) president.There are some dramatic gameplay changes from the 1st game, and they are all absolutely terrible. No more awesome gunfights with smart AI. Now you just fight waves of dumb enemies. AI is really inconsistent. They go from not even noticing you after you've shot two of their team mates in the same room and circling around a grenade you've just thrown to having the reactions of someone who just snorted crack and with aimbotting accuracy. I will also note they have serious trouble throwing grenades.Another change was the removal of peak buttons. This wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ me off so much if this game actually gave you a reasonable amount of health but instead you are forced to hide by corners and pick enemies off. No more running into rooms with slow-motion on. Try that and you better hope you kill all enemies before slow mo runs out. If I really need to manipulate cover, I need more than a press E to flip over a ♥♥♥♥ing table here.To begin with the guns all feel incredibly useless. The SMG sounds okay at best, and the pistol sounds like it's less useful than harsh language. The combat shotgun's sound is laughable and pathetic. Even some of the better weapons like the assault rifle, (semi) automatic shotgun and sniper rifle don't feel extremely powerful. There aren't many new weapons. Most of them are re-skins. Only new are the automatic shotgun, sniper rifle and laser gun which are somewhat welcome additions.The one thing I thought could save the game was the sections where you get to pilot a mech, but some idiot decided that there should be some grainly filter over the screen that gets even worse as you take damage. It absolutely looked horrible and I found it incredible distracting.About the only thing improved from the original game is the fact that there are more varied environments for levels, but that's nothing if I'm not enjoying the time spent in said environments.All in all the gameplay felt like a cookie cutter shooter which needed to give the player one or two more health packs and armour pickups (at least on hard).Story wise this game is kinda like the first. It gets very predictable, especially if you've played the first game. The scares are the same, although I did feel this game was a little more scary than the first, it still failed to terrify me. Most of the jumpscares were fairly predictable, and there was only so many times that seeing Alma and bloody rooms could be even somewhat unsettling.All in all, I'd advise you play the first FEAR game. It runs rings around this game. If you need something else to hit that slow-motion Hollywood badass fix go check out the Max Payne series. The only reason I could possibly recommend this game is if you've played the first FEAR and wish to see how the story plays out.4/10 "

												FEAR 1, simply put, is one of my favorite shooters, not necessarily because of great level design or compelling encounter design, but rather the feel of the combat is phenomenal. FEAR 1 felt like an explosive orgy of boom-booms and men turning into paste while losing limbs and screaming out in agony and fear.So yeah, it was popping off.FEAR 2, in comparison, is a very limp donger, it is a sodden ♥♥♥♥, it is a miserable experience.The first thing you'll notice is the blinding bloom, a lot of people act like FEAR 2 is graphically better than FEAR 3, but I don't think an obnoxious lighting engine that blasts primary colors into your face is ""good graphics."" It follows the late 00s trend of using fierce bloom and excessive colored lighting to hide the fact that the models and textures are mediocre pap.The combat feels lose and weak, while FEAR 1 was a little clunky in its heaviness, and FEAR 2 certainly feels more snappy, you're switching out meaty, impactful combat for what feels like little pop guns weakly penetrating fleshy enemies that seem to melt like popsicles when they're dismembered, rather than the brutal mutilations in the original game.Guns are quiet and feel like mush, enemies glow for some strange reason (enemies weren't difficult to find in FEAR 1, and FEAR 3 does fine without the glowing as well, I don't understand the reasoning for this mechanic) and even though they maintain the aggression of the AI from the original game, they're just less effective, they don't hurt as much, they don't really feel like a real threat, and the enemy variety is still crap.While enemies will now tumble over cover and are generally mobile, they just don't feel satisfying to fight, everyone has some kind of pathetic nerd voice compared to the rumbling, distorted communications in the original game, and the voice acting for them is just flat, it's just not as fun hearing them freak out like it was in the first game.They also took out the lean function, and instead replaced it with the ability to flip over cover, but it's rather pointless, there's absolutely no reason to use cover in this game, enemies hit like hotdogs smacking your face so most of the time you just slo-mo (and by the way the meter is absolutely tiny, even with the reflex boosters, compared to the first game) and headshot, that's it, there's even less reason to use grenades in this game than the last.The absolute biggest disappointments are the shotguns. In FEAR 1 it was easily the most satisfying weapon, here they can't hit worth a damn, do absolutely no damage when they do impact, and feel like someone is mushing ground beef through a sausage maker. What is this weak nonsense?I can go on about the idiotic story, the worthless characters, the annoying melee enemies that add absolutely nothing to the game resembling fun, crappy boss encounters that aren't entertaining in the least, and repeating, samey levels that are either massacres of bloom or dark and dingey crap. FEAR 1 didn't have the greatest environmental design, but I expect a greater improvement than spattering color everywhere.The elementary school is alright, but that's about it.Even the linear mech segments suck and feel unsatisfying, because the weapons for those blow too, the enemies look goofy instead of cool as they did before (what happened to the sweet heavies with the insect eyes from the first game), and the dismemberment is super lame and reminds me of Fallout 3 where body parts just seem to glide off like enemies are made out of wet newspaper.This game is mediocre beyond belief, everything about it is an exercise in misery, it's too easy, feels weak, looks like a complete mess that just wants to stab your eyes with bright lights, sounds like crap, plays like crap, what the hell went wrong?If you can get through it all, somehow, it casts a magical spell on you, basically making you forget everything that happened in the last craptastic 6 hours, since there's literally nothing worth remembering in this absolute turd of a game. Hell, I only recall vaguely being angry at a certain unfun part of the game, and I can't even place it now. I usually remember things that ♥♥♥♥ me off very, very well, but FEAR 2 is such a powerful wizard it somehow even manages to wipe clean whatever atrocity it committed upon me.Even FEAR 3 is better than this abysmal excuse for a game, avoid this junk.

												I wanted to like F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin.  I really did.  As a fan of the original game, I was equal parts relieved and excited at the news of Monolith’s re-acquisition of the F.E.A.R. license.  The masters had recovered their legacy, and I couldn’t wait to welcome Alma back into my nightmares again.  Unfortunately, after finishing F.E.A.R. 2, it became disappointingly apparent to me that in the time between Monolith’s loss and recovery of the F.E.A.R. IP, they forgot what made the original game a genre-defining game, as they have led its sequel into potential-dashing mediocrity.   Immediately, players are introduced to the new player character, Michael Beckett (A.K.A. “Bucket.”  Seriously.), whom we quickly discover that Alma kind of has a thing for…apparently.  But more on that later.  The mainstay of F.E.A.R. 2’s gameplay is the series’ standout action elements, returning in all their bloody, hyper-reflexive glory.  Sporting smooth, polished gunplay and the return of F.E.A.R.’s standout enemy A.I., F.E.A.R. 2’s gunfights will rarely leave players wanting.  The welcome addition of several new enemy types, new combat mechanics, and the inclusion of a few mech-combat sequences help to keep combat fresh, but have a tendency to completely distract players from any semblance of horror for fairly lengthy intervals.  Complementing these features are modernized visuals and several welcome deviations from the series’ previously monotonous environments. Certain set-pieces, especially the series’ hallmark hallucinations, are surprisingly well-composed, lending F.E.A.R. 2’s presentation a certain degree of artistry.  These features notwithstanding, it should be noted however, that while F.E.A.R. 2’s graphics and level design far surpass those of its predecessor, they only just meet the par of its contemporaries, and the same can be said for the game’s decidedly sub-par multiplayer.  Having established those things, I feel like I’ve written the rest of this review before.  Namely, Monolith has made a lot of the same mistakes with F.E.A.R. 2 that Timgate Studios made with the Perseus Mandate expansion pack before it.  From the odd choice of departing from the original game’s art style to F.E.A.R. 2’s nonsensical story, the game just doesn’t really feel like a F.E.A.R. sequel, in appearance or spirit.Relying more upon jump-scares than psychological dread, F.E.A.R. 2’s horror segments are more nerve-wracking than they are unsettling, and this trend infects the story as a whole.  Its departure from Point Man aside, the game doesn’t even seem to remember its own timeline throughout its disjointedly illogical narrative, and many of Alma’s actions throughout the game just come off as arbitrarily forced.   She has no reason, especially early on, to take notice of Beckett, and yet she harries, attacks, and molests him like something out of Navi’s darkest nightmares, keeping many of the game’s would-be horror sequences from feeling more than marginally threatening, and instead lending them an unwelcome atmosphere of uncomfortability.  Seriously, there are segments of this game that are just plain unpleasant to sit through, especially its “twist” ending, which really robs players of any sense of climactic achievement.As an FPS, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a bloody good time, but as a horror game, much less a proper F.E.A.R. sequel, it falls disappointingly short.  Despite its solid action, its neutered horror and vague, paranormally hormonal storyline bar it from living up to its legacy, and its replay value is middling at best after single-player’s completion.  I can’t say that recommendations come easily for it, especially for fans of F.E.A.R., but FPS junkies like myself may enjoy this momentarily dark departure from the usual fare of run n’ gun action.Rating: 5.8Visuals: 6Audio: 5Controls & Mechanics: 7Atmosphere & Experience: 6Entertainment Value: 5For more reviews, articles, and videos, visit LastLevelPress.com!

												A shooter that simply ticks all generic shooter boxes.  Dimly lit corridors? check.  Warehouse/crates? check.  BOO! check,  bullet-time? check, Explodey tanks lying around waiting for you to make them go boom, crawlspaces? check! and let's not forget the bit where you're on a train and baddies keep coming at you from another track... etcEnvironments: Corridors, do you like dimly lit corridors?  I hope you do.  You might be lucky and get some warehouse/crate action!!!  You get released from the tiny outdoor areas a few, all to brief times, then it's back to corridors and subway tunnels (yes, we're back to subway tunnels etc).  There are some better zones later on, big factory settings that at least have some sense of scale, but you wait a long time for them.Shooty Bang Bang: The guns work, not much interest, the assault rifle is pretty much the entire game.  The hammerhead is nice, but no other weapon than assault rifle is necessary for 99% of the game.  Shotguns are cool for the things that charge you like abominations and assassins, but assault rifle is fine for them too.  Weapons that might provide some variety are castrated by lack of ammo.Tank bits are fun, of course, tank bits are always fun.The Story: Spooky bits are pretty much eye candy, there's no serious effect on the game, it's a straightforward shooty game with gratuituous spooky effects seemingly tagged on at the last minute to remind you that this is a FEAR game. Yes it does make you jump from time to time, effective in the same way as a screamer video on YouTube.   The levels are strewed with pointless info drops, saves having to script an interesting game I guess, having your plot all scrawled down on little data pads.  Ignore them. Enemy AI: basic stuff.   You walk along, the game will auto-save to let you know there's a firefight coming, creep, crouch, bullet-time headshot them till they're all dead. rinse-repeat... in corridors.The Ending:  Was that an ending? Ummm. ok...  I guess this was an Episode of something...Overall: Meh, dull, unimaginative, fails to make any use of the IP.			"

Who makes a game where FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE PLAYTHROUGH you have to notice the edges of the screen being some obligatory thing on your character's face.

												F.E.A.R. 2 is an average FPS with poor horror elements that could've been a lot better. Overall, it's not a terrible game by any means, however, I found it boring and couldn't finish the storyline as it had many issues: annoying and ugly frame-like HUD; high sensitivity without an option to adjust it; rather funny sprinting mechanics; highly repetitive combat; some fire particles were often stuck on my screen; giant robots ignored me sometimes; story so far was below average; dialogue seemed to be fanmade, etc.. Despite these flaws the level design wasn't as bad as I thought it'll be and even the repetitive combat had some fun moments that kept me interested for a couple hours. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend buying it.A weak 5/10 "

												I have a reasonably modern system (6-core Intel, Radeon R9 270, 64GB RAM, SSD), and the game simply will not start correctly.It displays the ""detecting system performance"" screen, then goes black and minimizes.  Clicking the taskbar icon causes it to restore and immediately re-minimize.  If I close the app, then every run afterward is the same, although the ""detecting system performance"" screen is omitted.Since there are no log files and there is nothing documenting the one very small text config file, and any changes to it are immediately reverted when the game is run again, I have no hint as to what went wrong.Luckily, I bought the game on a great sale.

												Pretty awful. The scariest thing in the game is probably the consolisation. No quicksaves, huge HUD, somehow less technically impressive than the first. It's just not good. No clever use of space for the horror scenes, or any creativeness for the scares at all. It's pretty much just Alma grabbing you, a specimen jumping at you, or being teleported to some hell swing. I'd say avoid this.			"

												Many claim that this game shouldn't bear the name of FEAR, but no, since the two games are quite similar.There are enemies that come from very limited entrances, and you just slow down the time to shoot their heads until they become ragdolls every time... nothing has changed. Also, the unnecessary amount of variations for grenades and very poorly written story (or, lack thereof) is in this game, too.That aforementioned many also say that this game lacks the fear factor that the first game has. It is an undeniable truth that this is not a good horror game, but the first game isn't, too. Voice of the many bashes this game for only having jump scares, but the first one does, too.Vox populi is also that this game should be cleansed with the righteous fire of PC gamers because this game doesn't have the ability to lean, which the first one has. While it is obvious that the feature is removed for the sake of making the game for consoles along with PC, that feature is completely irrelevant to the first game, to begin with. There is simply no need for leaning, and it isn't even realistic, as nobody trained properly would peek-and-shoot from covers while making entries in as close quarter engagements as the two games depict. There are very few areas that call for leaning in both games, but they are too rare to warrant implementing it.This is FEAR 2, a sequel to that mindless shooter. It's good for what it is.			"

												FIrst two hours in the game. Not a single event scares me. If you are really looking for a good horror game, I don't think this is really for you.I haven't finished the game yet so it is possible that I may change my thoughts.Pros:Nice graphics, considering it is from 2009Alright / a bit weird controlNice animationAt least it has a storyLow specs requirementCons:It can't deliver the horror elementFeels more like arcade shooter where the enemy can absorb up to 15 shotslinear / boring campaignnot-that-great map designrandom frame drop if you are unlucky.weird key-bindings FPS + Horror = can't deliver neither of it. (At least not working for this game)The list goes on and onSummary:Maybe it is alright in 2009 standard, but I do not think it worths £10. You can spend £10 on much better titles. This just doesn't deliver neither horror nor shooting elements. At least it doesn't work for me. "

												Like the first FEAR game, FEAR 2 was slapped around when it came out, ironically, for not being a replica of the first game. The main complaint was the watered-down melee system, which didn't matter to me, because I play first-person-shooters to shoot stuff, not punch stuff. What really bothered me was the weak story.But I got over it.All you need to know is that this game is made by Monolith. MONOLITH. These are the same people who gave us BLOOD, the best first-person-shooter ever made. Monolith is one in the trifecta of FPS giants: Id, Raven, and Monolith. Nobody makes shooters better than these three.Sure, I could go on a lengthy tirade about how the graphics have aged beautifully, the slow-mo gunplay is amazing, the level design is fantastic, the weapon animations are breathtakingly gorgeous, the enemies are compelling, the art assets are top notch, the story is basically a rehash of the first game with a twist at the end, the mech sequences completely crash the flow, and the elementary school level is scary as ♥♥♥♥... But all you really need to know is that it's a Monolith game.			"

												After playing F.E.A.R. and its non-canon expansion packs, I was stoked to play sequel to the amazing original. After having played it... I had a lot of fun with the sequel, but I felt that several things were inferior to the first game. Nonetheless, this is a solid game and I would still recommend playing it. I'm gonna talk about the pros first, cons next and lastly sum up my review.First positive and for me the most notable: the visuals. This game is beautiful. Even for its time in 2009 its graphics still hold up pretty well, especially in comparison to the now very dated look of the first game. Additionally, most locations in the game have a much prettier and vibrant color palette varying from light blues, to orange, to red. Definitely a much more colorful game in comparison to F.E.A.R..Secondly the action of this game was greatly improved. The first game had a tendency to be laggy during intense firefights or boss fights, and the overall combat was a little choppy. The sequel definitely made the firefights much smoother to improve the combat. I have but one complaint about the changes made to combat in F.E.A.R. 2 but I will cover that in a sec. They added a hit indicator when you are firing so it's easier to tell if you score a hit on an enemy, weapons now have the option of an alternate firing mode, you are able to interact with your environment to flip certain forms of cover to aid you in your fight, and the added variety of weapons and special grenades that you can cook to delay the explosion really improve the gameplay. My major complaint about F.E.A.R. 2 is the removal of the lean mechanic in the first game. It makes using corners less effective and instead wants to emphasize the usage of flipping cover instead.These are the two major positives for the game, now for the negatives..Much like the first game, having a silent protagonist works in certain games if the surrounding cast are able to fill in the gaps of dialogue. But a complaint of mine is the lack of any character arcs in the game. Every character introduced is the same when the game begins to when the game ends save for one. While this isn't as major a problem in games as in film it does make the game feel a little repetitive when the characters don't experience any changes aside of a short period of a breakdown after losing a comrade or something of the like.Secondly is the blend of horror and action. I feel this game fell to a similar fate of Dead Space 3, as action is more focused than actual horror. While still definitely scary and creepy as hell at certain moments, action definitely takes a greater hold in this title.Last is the story/ending. While fairly straight-forward and competent the story doesn't necessarily raise many questions during the gameplay, and it overall doesn't make a whole lot of sense while you start to learn more about what is going on, most notably in the character motivations on both sides. But I'm not gonna lie the ending of this game actually made me laugh. No spoilers, but the ending while somewhat intriguing and raising some questions such as my own reaction ""Did that just really happen?"", is just executed poorly and it felt silly what actually happened to end the game. While the answers are brought up again in the following game F.E.A.R. 3, it doesn't necessarily  have the effectiveness of the cliffhanger ending of the first game.Overally this game is a very fun, kick-♥♥♥ shooter with some spooky-♥♥♥ moments, but the story, characters and horror elements I feel definitely faltered in comparison to the original.I'll give it a 7.5/10.

												I played the first FEAR game when it came out in 2005. It was actually one of the last games I preordered it and enjoyed it. Eight years later I finally got around to playing FEAR 2. So what did I think? Overall it wasn't a BAD experience. But there are some BAD things in the game I can mention. I remember the AI in the first FEAR game to be pretty good. Enemies would flank, take cover, etc. In this game they take cover but they'll also run right into the line of fire and do other assorted stupid things. The guns felt really, REALLY underpowered. One enemy took five shots from a shotgun before dying. Really? Oh, another piece of advice, ditch the pistol when you can. POS. Mission variety wasn't there. It was pretty much go to point A to point B and kill ♥♥♥♥ in between. You can walk around in a mech suit and get behind a large machinegun. That was as varied as it got.  There were some good things though. Level design was improved quite a bit. Instead of running around through office building after office building in the first FEAR game, you actually get some different environments. Special nod to the school map in this game, which I liked quite a bit.  The atmosphere was nice even with the obvious jump scares etc. There was a nice variety of weapons and the laser in particular was fun AND effective. The story was okay I guess. Thankfully you didn't have to memorize the first to enjoy this one. Oh, and the file size for the game is 12 GB which seems pretty damn huge for what's here but that's a minor gripe. Overall FEAR 2 gets a recommendation from me. You should be able to get it pretty cheap with the FEAR Trilogy pack during a summer/winter sale. Wait until then. 7/10 for FEAR 2 from me.			"

												An amazing game for singleplayer (Probably cannot even play multiplayer anymore due to the whole gamespy thing now). I wouldn't say it is the scariest game ever, the scariest thing probably being sprinting down a corridor and one of those monkey dog things jumping out at you, or Alma appearing behind you. Solid plot with a kinda confusing ending but it kind of makes sense once you've figured out what happened, still don't exactly know how F.E.A.R. 3 linked to this one but I'm in the middle of replaying this and then gonna replay F.E.A.R. 3. probably 8/10 overall, would reccomend to anyone			"

												Summary:  Like playing an intense, action-horror movie.Details:  Great theatrics and story, exciting and varied combat and locales.  I thought the game started out slow, but as I progressed further, the gameplay and tension drew me in.  Particularly enjoyed chances to pilot a nigh-unstoppable ""powered armor"" mech, which you can get a taste of in the demo.  If you liked the mid-2000's Doom, you'll find less weapon variety here but more atmosphere (also... fewer monster closets).			"

												F.E.A.R. 2 takes place around the same time as F.E.A.R. but played by another protagonist named Beckett. The game no longer allows you to save whenever you want, it uses checkpoints but it makes these at frequent spots so it doesn't get frustrating at all. It introduces great new weapons and at some points you will even pilot a mech.The storyflow, plot development and character interaction is also well done. It makes you feel you're in a real world where you will care what happens to all the NPC you interact with.FEAR 2 - Reborn.In this short add-on you play as a replica clone soldier named Foxtrot 813 who for a mysterious reason is drawn by the ghost of Fettel from the first F.E.A.R. game. The story won't make much sense until the very end. But after playing F.E.A.R. 3, this I have doubts if this story is canon at all. It doesn't fit with F.E.A.R. 3 at all and I blame that game's very poor story for it (read my review there).			"

												Good action game.  There are a few instances where you just may get the CRAP scared out of you during gameplay.  It's a very unique blend of feeling fearful, being alone in the dark (lighting is pretty awesome in the game), and being surrounded by very intelligent 'replica' enemies and mutated psycho beings that are all out to get you.  Some really freaky cutscene AND action segments that are bizarre and eerie involving Alma, the weird little girl, so all in all the game is quite fun, can scare you good, and has great action.  Play this game on highest settings and highest difficulty and you will be challenged!I've always liked the FEAR series so perhaps my review is a little biased but I loved it, it is a great game, and that's that.   In my opinion it's 2 thumbs up fun.			"

												A pretty fun shooter.Is is very similar to the first FEAR game - a tactical shooter with over-the-top action. However, it isn't scary at all. What it has are awesome graphics and design that really hooked me, great voice-acting and stunning visual effects. The ghosts and phantoms are particulary pretty. My main complaint is lack of enjoyable multiplayer and WAY too much Bullettime in singleplayers. You can use it all the time. The game's battles really shine in normal speed, but this is missed due to playing the whole game in SlowMo, becuase you can and have no reason not too.Try the demo first. If that's your style then buy.			"

Because this game keeps all those goodies for sure.- Some movie-like moments will blow your head.

The story is not bad, not as scary as the first part and ending falls flat in the end. Unlike the first FEAR, which gave me goose bumps and a sleepless night. Alma..  has lost her spooky charm in this one, but the game does well  in expanding the aftermath of the first game... get the feeling she's been over done in the sequel which negates the fright factor and mystery surrounding her.Nevertheless... worth playing, now moving on to F.E.A.R 3!Rate this - B+ (Good)			"

												The refined sequel to what is already a bit of a modern classic, F.E.A.R. F.E.A.R. 2 improves on everything and as a result, plays much more smoothly than its somewhat clunky predecessor.Graphics are crisp and clear, comparable to Max Payne 2, which means they are still holding up rather well today.Sound is excellent, much better than the first installment. In particular, the score has seen notable improvement.Gameplay still rewards a tactical approach to combat, though you no longer depend on your slow-motion ability quite as much as you used to in F.E.A.R. Gunfight are often winnable even without resorting to slow-motion, though using it definitely helps.F.E.A.R. 2 provides the same type of scares as the first game, so they may sometimes be fairly cheap. Due to the improved visual fidelity, the gore is much more explicite here, however. This game is not for the squeamish.Any shooter fan should definitely pick this up, even if they didn't like or play the first installment.			"

												This game was a lot shorter than I remember. It's seven chapters long, and follows a pretty strict formula.>battle soliders>creepy ♥♥♥♥>some ghosts>battle soldiers>story progressionthat's pretty much it. you'll know when you're fighting ghosts because the color will drain from your screen and ♥♥♥♥ will get dumb.compared to F.E.A.R. 1, this game doesn't really hold a candle to it. The AI in this game is worse, you can't lean, the flashlight illuminates less (which may be intentional), there is no battery for the flashlight (it's infinite), and there's a lot more run and gun than F.E.A.R. 1. The enemies take a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bullets to kill.Oh yeah, and there's no VK-12 shotgun. The ending was a great porno. Multiplayer is dead too, so if you were looking for that, don't bother.Overall, the game gets a 3/5. It's an average shooter with above average graphics (for it's time), interesting story, and good sound.It doesn't beat the original F.E.A.R. though.			"

												I do not recommend this game. The combat is extremely repetive, unchalleging, as well as cliche. How does a forced stationary mg-on-an-apc battle with uninspiring rock music fit the atmosphere of a horror game? This is a far cry from what FEAR used to be. If you are looking for more of the original FEAR, do NOT look here. Go play Modern Warfare 3, the combat will be more inspiring (if that is believable) and it will most likely be scarier.BTW, I finished the single-player in about 4-5 hours. That is short, but maybe that is good thing, because I couldn't wait for it to end after half-way in.			"

												Now here is the review for F.E.A.R 2 how should I rate this game? I'll start by saying DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY!!!!!Monolith Productions have completely destroyed a great game by turning their backs on what made F.E.A.R a great game you will find that the AI no longer works against you and anticipates your moves before you could hear the squad commander say ""Flush Him Out!"" and another clone would throw a grenade at you to make you move from cover now they don't they just stand in the open firing clip after clip after clip hoping to hit you there is a few occasions where a clone will move something to hide behind but rather getting the rest of the squad to pin the player with suppressing fire or firing his gun over the top or from the side they stand up and shoot making them easy to hit along the same lines when you encountered a clone in the original F.E.A.R if on there on would fall back and find backup before taking the player on but not in F.E.A.R 2 they have lost their sense of danger and mortality I am very disappointed with this game and that is why I rate this game 3/10 a very poor performance Monolith Productions very poor.

												Fear 2 is the weakest game in the trilogy for me, but even with that in mind it still stands above tons of other shooters in terms of quality and story. It's shorter and more streamlined than Fear 1, and certainly suffers from trying to appeal to a wider crowd difficulty-wise, but at least it doesn't have that weird trying-to-get-with-the-times vibe that Fear 3 had. At the very least, the multiplayer for this is basically Fear 1's, but it actually still works because they didn't use a CD key algorithm that limited them to like 3 million keys.			"

												Nice soundtrack, A little bit more story (3 has even more). Gameplay feels a little bit tedious since it is always the same: you come into an area, shoot all the soldiers, now and then a bossfight occurs. In between you run through corridors. They added mech fight sequences. Nice since they just take the right amount of time - not too short, not too long. This is continued in F.E.A.R. 3.. Overall ok. Needs less than half the time F.E.A.R. alone (without the two add-ons) needed.			"

I am no stranger to ''horror'' shooters and tend to stay clear of them (Looking at you Dead Space) not becuase they are bad but becuase i am a pussi ^^ Anyhow! F.E.A.R. 2 I enjoyed the game the controls are pretty solid firefights are fun and its amazing how fast it transitions from a firefight to a dark and eerie hallway I havent played the original F.E.A.R. but i will say that i want to now. The story is fairly long and intristing nice variety of weapons to choose from only real downside...Curse you Gamespy! That and the Campaign is fun and intristing but i dont see much of a point in replaying it other then personal pleasure.			"

												Somehow even LESS thematic than the original, despite improved graphics.  Only one or two scenes had good setting and feel.  Enemies seem a little less smart than the previous, although they dont get murdered by their inability to use doors this time.  They're just more aggressive about pushing forward and not making footsteps when they do.  Fairly easy on Normal, nothing felt very hard to kill.  Horror segments are quite nonthreatening, but the use of light phantasms compared to the previous game's dark phantasms was a great choice that I loved.Instead of answering people's voicemail, this time you read their dropped memos.  People are pretty darn clumsy when it comes to dropping important memos.Game ran well on a Phenom II x6 / HD 6850, no hiccups.  8hrs of gameplay total for campaign + DLC.  Did not try multiplayer.

												F.E.A.R. 2 Pro-----New GUI but intrusive but overall ok , graphics have been updated- more detailed environment and weapons have been reskinned, Have iron sights. Favorite level was in school, can cook grenades- but grenades seem to have strange psychics; always thrown in front or behind enemies. You can create cover by contact sensitive pushing over tables or furniture-but hardly ever used it. Mech combat and turret sections is cool but only happens twice eachCons-------Game is un-optimized, framerate is inconsistent. Hade to play on lowest setting to get it to run constantly but still dripped in frames Shotgun is really underpowered also pistol is weak. Hardly ever used Slow-Mo, Story made little sense. Enemy AI is still decent but fells like a downgrade. No more tilt mechanic. No Quick save, overall feels distant from original. Little enemy variety and levels are the same reused.More wave based encounters but still fight squads. Ghost are annoying to fight, horror is not scary; jump scares and this enemy who used dead enemies to fight for it is annoying to fight, bullet sponged. Melee is weak. Overall not so original and feels like other games. "

												I was always interested in the sequels to Fear, and this, although not as great as Fear 1, was good. I felt it was the Opposing Force to Half-Life, as this is in the same universe, but follows a different character.Graphics:- The graphics were decent, but the colours are strange. Like watching an old cathode ray television with just a slight misalignment to slignal. A very thin veil of snowy vision.Sounds:- Sound effects were great, but music was misplaced. Obviously cued based on when you enter certain areas, but sometimes it would kick off or rev up AFTER a fire-fight had ended.Gameplay:- You can feel this was made for a console. Which sucks, because Fear 1 was such a great PC game. But, I had so many fantastic scares right off the bat. This game scared me, and made me really carefully play a lot more than Fear 1.- It's a longer game than the original and took me 5hrs longer to complete than Fear 1. But I did play on the hardest difficult which probably added some additional time and strategy to my decisions.Story:- Great story, very intriguing. I good addition to the FEAR universe and forms the foundation of Fear 3 (although, Fear 3 is not as good).			"

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is an average FPS that continues the story of Alma Wade and the terror that she unleashed at the end of F.E.A.R. You play a character from a special forces team that is nearly identical to the special forces team that you played in the first game. Game mechanics are largely unchanged and it seemed almost as short as the expansion packs for F.E.A.R. (XP and Perseus Mandate).So is F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin a great game? Not really. Is it as good as the original? No, it's just meh. I still liked it better than FEAR 3.			"

												After playing F.E.A.R. and its non-canon expansion packs, I was stoked to play sequel to the amazing original. After having played it... I had a lot of fun with the sequel, but I felt that several things were inferior to the first game. Nonetheless, this is a solid game and I would still recommend playing it. I'm gonna talk about the pros first, cons next and lastly sum up my review.First positive and for me the most notable: the visuals. This game is beautiful. Even for its time in 2009 its graphics still hold up pretty well, especially in comparison to the now very dated look of the first game. Additionally, most locations in the game have a much prettier and vibrant color palette varying from light blues, to orange, to red. Definitely a much more colorful game in comparison to F.E.A.R..Secondly the action of this game was greatly improved. The first game had a tendency to be laggy during intense firefights or boss fights, and the overall combat was a little choppy. The sequel definitely made the firefights much smoother to improve the combat. I have but one complaint about the changes made to combat in F.E.A.R. 2 but I will cover that in a sec. They added a hit indicator when you are firing so it's easier to tell if you score a hit on an enemy, weapons now have the option of an alternate firing mode, you are able to interact with your environment to flip certain forms of cover to aid you in your fight, and the added variety of weapons and special grenades that you can cook to delay the explosion really improve the gameplay. My major complaint about F.E.A.R. 2 is the removal of the lean mechanic in the first game. It makes using corners less effective and instead wants to emphasize the usage of flipping cover instead.These are the two major positives for the game, now for the negatives..Much like the first game, having a silent protagonist works in certain games if the surrounding cast are able to fill in the gaps of dialogue. But a complaint of mine is the lack of any character arcs in the game. Every character introduced is the same when the game begins to when the game ends save for one. While this isn't as major a problem in games as in film it does make the game feel a little repetitive when the characters don't experience any changes aside of a short period of a breakdown after losing a comrade or something of the like.Secondly is the blend of horror and action. I feel this game fell to a similar fate of Dead Space 3, as action is more focused than actual horror. While still definitely scary and creepy as hell at certain moments, action definitely takes a greater hold in this title.Last is the story/ending. While fairly straight-forward and competent the story doesn't necessarily raise many questions during the gameplay, and it overall doesn't make a whole lot of sense while you start to learn more about what is going on, most notably in the character motivations on both sides. But I'm not gonna lie the ending of this game actually made me laugh. No spoilers, but the ending while somewhat intriguing and raising some questions such as my own reaction ""Did that just really happen?"", is just executed poorly and it felt silly what actually happened to end the game. While the answers are brought up again in the following game F.E.A.R. 3, it doesn't necessarily  have the effectiveness of the cliffhanger ending of the first game.Overally this game is a very fun, kick-♥♥♥ shooter with some spooky-♥♥♥ moments, but the story, characters and horror elements I feel definitely faltered in comparison to the original.I'll give it a 7.5/10.

												You can't have it both ways, FEAR. I'm from ♥♥♥♥ing Texas. You can't give me a gun that feels like an Airsoft weapon and then ask me to be scared of the little dour pale girl, because I'll shoot that little girl in the face! You can't have me shoot ten guys in ten seconds and then try and use a jump scare, because I'm gonna shoot that jump scare in the face!! You can't have a nuke go off in the middle of the city, because I'm going to shoot that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ explosion!!!			"

												This game is... Painful to say the least.In the previous game, they decided that colouring medkits BRIGHT RED and placing them VERY CONSPICUOUSLY would be more than enough.Apparently they're trying to get into the mentally challenged preteen market we all call the COD fanbase.Every time I look at ANYTHING that I can interact with, I get this BIG ♥♥♥♥ MOTHERING ""E"" KEY waving its flaccid ♥♥♥♥ in my face.Oh, right, I almost forgot.YOU DON'T NEED TO PLASTER A SIGN ON EVERY ITEM IN THE GAME, I CAN SEE THAT YOU'VE PUT A MEDKIT ON THE DESK ACROSS THE HALL, BUT COME THE ♥♥♥♥ ON, I REALLY DON'T NEED TO SEE IT FROM THE NEXT ROOM /THROUGH THE GOD DAMNING WALLS/Oh, right, it appears that quicksave is gone, either that or it has been hidden away with the incentive to use stealth.That gets a little bothering too.

												Pretty much, if you liked FEAR, you'd like FEAR 2. You remember what I said about FEAR? Yeah, it's a lot like that. There's some impressive bits like very gory setpiece events, pretty decent voice-acting and a super-weird ending. The shooting is still very good. The guns still feel powerful especially when in slow-mo, and atmosphere is again very creepy. The combination of horror and manshooter is a little bit more cohesive this time, to the game's benefit.If checkpoint saves really turn you off, or if you don't like the idea of (spoiler) piloting giant robots down corridors, having a shootout on a train, manning a tank cannon while enemies stream out of doorways, or other trope-y sights, stay away!

												Honestly I'm not sure how this game has positive reviews.  When compared to its predessor the game feels...lazy.  It starts off with some of the ""spooky"" FEAR moments that I love, but they quickly become repetitive and predictable.  The game seems to switch from scary to first person shooter person as if it's sufferering from a bipolar episode.  A couple of plot points are poorly glossed over as well.The shooting mechanics as well felt poor as the game went on.  Bad guys had a lot of armor, and you basically go slowmo, shoot them 5 times in the face and then move on to the next one.  Just felt bad.			"

General ImpressionsI've originally played the first FEAR on one of my older computers back then and never really finished it because I was too scared. I've also played the rather short-lived Free-To-Play, FEAR Online. Coming over to FEAR 2, there's a lot of things that can be said over game story that show its age compared to most shooters now, but here's a few points that I think needs to be made that stands out from others.What I like about this game:1. This game aesthetically feels like a downgraded Fallout 4; You get plenty of weapons / gear, you get to be in a giant mech and wreck face, there's feral ghouls otherwise known as the replica soldiers. And of course, ragdolls.2. You can literally flip tables.3. You can slow down time. Yes, it's toggleable. 4. You get to see all the horror tropes come before your very eyes.5. Turn off Film Grain and keep on Head Bob to keep things realistic. Turning off Headbob lets you levitate.What I dislike about this game:1. The level design almost feels labyrinthian; if you come back for another session, you'll forget where you have to go2. Lack of Sound. Granted, this is likely for an atmospheric feel, but really drops the immersion from 1st gripe.3. The AI; I can't recall if the original had smarter AI, but these guys literally run at you.""You're like a free pizza at an anime convention"" - Snakefist "

												Pretty decent FPS game with a cinematic feel. A few jump scares in it, nothing that I would really consider ""Horror"". Still, it was quite enjoyable. Took 9 hours to complete(To be fair though, I did a lot of looking around the levels and just exploring things. Playing straight through prob would have been a lot less time). One thing I should point out though, the game while ""Good"", is nowhere near as enjoyable as the original FEAR was. So, if you are expecting an equal gaming experience to the original, you might be slightly disappointed.			"

												This is a really fun game, with an interesting and well-executed mix of FPS and horror. The shooting mechanics are well-done, and each weapon is unique and interesting. The enemies are also unique and varied. The horror element is less 'horror' and more 'suspense'. Nevertheless, I do not view this as a negative. The story draws you in, and the gameplay carries you along - just like any good game should. I have not played the other games in the series, but will likely check those out based on this. Get it on sale for when you need a high-quality filler game.One cavet to all the above: I never managed to finish the game due to a bug that caused half a map to not load in. This does not, however, impact my rating, as I hope it was just a jammy file somewhere. I will likely reinstall and replay the game at a later date, which is something I very, very, rarely do.			"

												Yes,definitely a recommended horror game where you start of as Michael Becket with the squad members to take Genevieve Aristide into custody. Through the game you will find Alma a nightmare,and pretty much the whole story takes place in the game...On the side note,the weapons in the game are pretty ok..SMG,Rifles and some other special weapons??? 10/10			"

												This was one of the games that left a bitter taste in my mouth. After playing the original F.E.A.R., which was an incredible game and ahead of its time, this was a huge letdown. Maybe I'm nostalgic, but I felt that this game took out the best parts of F.E.A.R. and replaced them with jump scares and film grain.Perhaps it is an alright game, but I would never recommend this after seeing the original F.E.A.R. followed by this game.

												Fear 2 is a great atmospheric, explosive and HOT sequel to the original Fear.  You return as a sergeant who was a test subject in some clandestine scientific paranormal experiment.  Just like Fear 1 , the gunplay is excellent and the spooky effects are very well implemented into the game.  Basically, everything is an upgrade compared to Fear 1 without losing the roots which make Fear games great.  Alma, the creepy girl returns now as an adult woman haunting you throughout the game. As you progress, she turns from an old hag to a voluptous lady( partially naked cause covered by hair) and to be honest, I begin to look forward to seeing her as I progress further. ( she is kind of HOT) Well, it is seldom that a female ghost falls in love with you in game instead of wanting to rip your soul off!! And the ending, it is mindblowing and should be rated 18+. Haha, anyway if you enjoy a good fps game with some horror elements, this game is definitely worth buying. I do not encounter any bugs beside framerate drops at water areas. Excellent game!!			"

												Jumpscares + bullets + fighting bots and slow-mo = awesomeness. I would give this game a 9/10, the -1 being due to the fact that it's quite short so it leaves you sour when you've been having great fun with jumpscares and challenging gameplay with ghore. Which makes you wonder, whether this game was released half-heartedly before it was even ready with few levels. BUT The graphics even to this day are quite impressive. gameplay experience is enhanced by the jumpscares and supernatural aspects.			"

												Amazing gameplay.Good graphics.Didnt come across any bugs.Not that kind of scary as the first one though. Tough the enemies are and that i like.Since the first F.E.A.R. the one thing that i liked about F.E.A.R. 2 is the versatility in the levels.Especially the one with piloting the ""mech"" through hordes of enemies.Really enjoyed playing it.

												Second enstallment of the F.E.A.R series, in my opinion is a lot thrilling than the first and third. If you like jumpscares and gore mixed into a militaristic setting then this is a brilliant game for you. The only drawback i can find to this game would be that i did expect it to be more suspensful or to have more horror in it, other than that still an extremely enjoyable game.  "

												Good game, but a crap port.  No options to enable a controller, no option to read the mouse 4 button on my gaming mouse for slo-mo, cause ctrl is a bit awkward.  Monolith really needs to step up on input options, this is inexcusable in this day and age.			"
