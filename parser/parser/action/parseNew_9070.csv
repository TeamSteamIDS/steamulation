												Resurrection of Evil is the official expansion pack for Doom 3, being also developed by Nerve Software and released in 2005, just a year after original. It's a pretty standard good expansion pack, adding new levels, new monsters, new weapons and adds a bit to multiplayer.It also had Xbox version, where it was standalone, had flashlight on pistol and also included classic Doom games.Technical problems are same as Doom 3. If you set up config file for Doom 3, then you will not have to change anything for this addon.Just repeating. To fix game always setting low texture quality and to add widescreen support you have to edit config file manually. As said, I recommend visiting PCGamingWiki site as it has a good example for autoexec file.And yea, I still had same technical smaller problems. Bodies not disintegrating properly. Lighting/shadows breaking slightly after getting to the next level. Stuttering and lag on modern hardware.As for multiplayer, it still looks quite dead. I write this one single phrase too much, playing old games and all. Anyway, expansion pack also would increase player limit to 8 and add Capture The Flag gamemode. Oh, and Double Shotgun, yep.Didn't get to play any match yet so still can't comment on fun or quality.The plot of this game follows that UAC didn't give up on Mars, not to mentioning that they recieved some strange signal from the dig side 1. The research is actually ran by female character about who you could learn in original Doom 3 through PDA devices, as the one to ask for UAC investigation on Dr.Betruger. Your team's job now is to investigate what is going on there, so sure thing you blow a wall up, grab artifact and let the hell break loose once again.And now you have to go and kill the main villian, closing the main cliffhanger for Doom 4 from the Doom 3 ending, dooming us all to wait another 10 years until new Doom game. Good job.And so begins yet another 10 or so level long adventure, coming from caverns and back to the base. This time around it feels less polished on survival horror side. Or at least it has less emphasis on this. Areas felt less greatly done in shadow/lighting, there wasn't as much of darkness. There wasn't as much of atmosphere either. Like, ambience in sounds is even more forgettable. In all honesty, I doubt that putting player into same experience as in Doom 3 would have worked, seeing how long that game lasted in the bases. And it has some interesting scenes, like zombies walking through X-Ray or very occasional spook. Still, it's still doesn't feel as special.Yea, means no new music.But hey, at least now it's more actiony, it doesn't take long to get into parts where you will fight few monsters that aren't just dumb melee zombies.Not to mentioning that I like the way story was given here a bit better. It doesn't spam with as much of useless audio logs. And PDA shows email and logs that actually seemed to be written during the invasion, making it feel more immersive and interesting to me.And just look at all those new weapons that the developers added. It's like they listened to what was cool in 2005 and putted it in.- Double Shotgun, check. Because it was cool since Doom 2. Just like Super Shotgun in Doom 2 it's more powerful than it got to be. I mean, seeing how it can easily one-hit most of enemies and Doom 3 is all about just facing very few enemies it's a bit too much. Still awesome gun. Still menly. Well, fine, at least Expansion isn't afraid to throw more than one enemy at you in same time.- Gravigun, check. Because Half-Life 2 made it cool. Apparently it has some long name and mainly called Grabber. Now, I was laughing at it since Doom 3 had one of the worse implented physics at that time. Enough to be there, not good enough to be actively used. And sure thing, throwing boxes and barrels was wacky at best. But actually, as it immeditly shows you in cutscene, it's made it so you could grab enemy's fireball and throw it back, which is why you have only limited time to hold object. And for fireballs it works excellent, not to mentioning that monsters often die from a single hit, so it's actually cool gun.- Some cool-looking heart artifact that also slows time down, check. Because Max Payne made slow-mo cool. Actually it becomes more powerful as you progress, adding increased damage and invincibility, as if it wasn't enough. While it may feel annoying that when you activate it monsters spawn into room way too long and you often have to kill them all before doors are unlocked, there are so many corpses in the game with which you feed this thing that I felt that I could as well use it in almost every fight.Yea, I felt that I was given too much firepower in this one.It also brings out new monsters, but nothing that can bring enemy side on same level as you. The only two worth noting were much more stylish-lookings variety of imps and this new juggernaut of sorts that is like Mancubus but shoots more often. Eh, actually there isn't much new.At least it got boss fights! And they are pretty good, even if you can just use your heart artifact on them. Actually, I think that they require you to use all these new powers you got, so enjoy, they aren't too weak. Worth noting is awesome final boss who doesn't suck this time around. Because in Doom 3 the final fight was weak and gimmicky once you realized what to do. Good conclusion.Expansion Pack gives player of Doom 3 more of gameplay hours. It tries to amuse them by focusing on less darkness and by adding new cool toys to use. But it doesn't feel as polished by me and less special. Still cool.			"

												If you've played Doom 3, this is more of the same. Not necessarily a bad thing, considering that Doom 3 is a fine game with loads of secrets and engaging combat. The grabber is a nice edition, although I never really liked using it and you can more or less beat the game without it.			"

												Just beat DOOM 3 Resurrection of Evil- getting ready for the new DOOM game coming out. Its a good game, its a nice addition to the DOOM 3 game. I enjoyed playing through this game and thought it was a lot of fun. People say that this expansion was the ""toned"" down version of DOOM 3 with less scary parts in it and less things that pop-out at you, but I thought RoE was just as scary at times. Overall a good game. The grabber (Gravity gun) was awesome to use when playing through this. The grabber is comparable to the gravity gun in Half-life 2-both are awesome guns. I recommend playing through this expansion after beating DOOM 3. 8.9/10			"

												This game is almost as fun as the original Doom 3. The demonic superpowers given to your character in the game did not really make the game any better. In fact, I would argue it made the game worse. The problem with the demonic superpowers is it changed the dynamics of the gameplay. They made the game enemies more numerous and tougher because of the superpowers which normally wouldn't be a problem, but you have no idea when exactly you will need it and you have a very limited number of times you can use it so you have to use it wisley. Some waves of enemies require the superpowers and other waves are so short or easy that usng the superpowers would be a waste of it's limited uses. There is no way to tell which waves of enemies you encounter will be hard and which will be easy making it essentially a guessing game of when and where you should and shouldn't use it.But even with it's flaws, the Doom 3 francise is a classic and always will be. If you are looking for and oldschool survival horror FPS game to play,  you will not be dissapointed wtih this game.			"

												DOOM 3 Resurrection of Evil is a short expansion campaign that lasts 3-4 hours long returning you back to the familiar sites from the original game. There are a couple of new enemies, new weapons (grabber aka gravity gun & double barrel shotgun), and new powerups that make this expansion worthwhile. The levels and enemies are more difficult in this expansion and the use of the new weapons help keep the gameplay fresh and not too repetitive. The expansion does a good job closing up the story from the original game while putting players through a challenging campaign with some new tools at your disposal.			"

												Still suffering the same problems doom3 had: No diversity in the levels, they are all clausterphobic, linear, and look quite similar. The game isnt even scary, so it just feels like a mediocre shooter with linear levels. Its still a decent game though, worth a playthrough if you enjoy doom games at all.			"

												As a biased Quake fan, I found this add-on deliciously entertaining.  ID titles historically have had added fun in their add-ons and D:RoE continues this tradition.  ID fans are after hot and heavy action and blowing up otherworldly foes, which this title has plenty of.  While the graphics are obviously outdated at the time of this review, the gameplay still holds up as entertaining.  Its nice to get nostalgic with this game and not having to pull up DOSbox and my old CD-ROMs to do so.			"

												I am partial as I liked the original game very much. Half Life 2 came out around the same time and I liked it better, however, Doom 3 offered a unique gaming experience. I liked how the protagonist is going deeper down into the territory of chaos. Not to mention the game was very dark and oftentimes quite scary. And the parts in hell were done superbly. Overall, I was not disappointed. Not one bit.Resurrection of Evil was inevitable. I mean, if you played Doom 3 you could draw the conclusion after watching the last cutscene that id has some unfinished business.RoE changed the gameplay a little. We all remember the so-called Cube artifact from the original game; now, RoE offers some new artifacts. For example, the Grabber is a gun similar to Gravity Gun in HL 2; what makes it more interesting is that not only the objects can be grabbed by it but also the demons' projectiles. The weapon comes quite handy when an imp throws its fireballs at you.You battle the so-called hunters; these are boss battles and after defeating each demon you acquire an ability (such as slowing down time around you). If I remember correctly these required some charging before using.One of our favourite weapons from Doom 2 returned: the double-barreled shotgun. Twice the barrel, twice the stopping power! I liked how the developers explain how such a weapon could find its way on to Mars (think about the story of the chainsaws). Resurrection of Evil does its job as an expansion. It offers new types of enemies, new weapons, new plot elements and you'll finish it in a mere 5 or 6 hours. Nothing special, but nothing bad either. At least this game got a decent expansion unlike HL 2's atrociously short Episode 1!You can pick it up if it's on sale or go with Doom 3 BFG Edition which includes this one as well as the original.

												Expansions are hard to come by these days. They're not as popular or profitable than many modern post launch support practices but roughly ten years ago as I write this they were the bread and butter for expanding a current game while working on a sequal or seperate project. Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil features a new campaign which I will be discussing in this review.Now what did Doom 3 RoE bring to the table? Some minor new ememies to fight and two new weapons, the Grabber which is basically the Gravity Gun from Half Life 2 and the Double Barrel Shotgun AKA the Boomstick! This will be your new friend as shotgun ammo is now more plentiful, the gun is hugely powerful and enemies can often die in one or two hits with it. Honestly at times it makes all the other weapons rather useless minor a few moments here and there. I'm also a sucker for the Double Barrel Shotgun in video games, I can't help but enjoy using them. Now the story here is nothing special like the last one, after the events of the first game a new excavation team go back to Mars and explore the ruins and you activate some artifact that actually helps you in the game. It stops time at the start but you can get upgrades for it later on.Nothing much can't be said other than some very minor tweaks. There are less enemies that unfairly leap and spawn right behind you. I forgot to mention in my review for Doom 3 that enemies would often spawn right behind you but I can only count two cases where that happens here. I felt that the game got oddly harder later on in the campaign. Not a huge difficulty spike but enough to notice that the difficulty curve skipped a beat. I think I enjoyed this a little more. The two new weapons were fun to use and the Artifact could really help you get out of some jams. If you're gonna get Doom 3 then odds are you're going to buy Resurrection of Evil in a bundle of some form so there is no harm in trying it out. I give it 6.5/10			"

												I'm a fan of the Doom series, especially since I originally played Doom as a shareware game when it first came out.  Doom 3 was good, but not great.  The same goes for this expansion.  It's good, there is a whole new mission, not just a few levels, a new gun, some new creatures to kill, but really nothing more.  This is more of an add-on to the original game rather than a full blown expansion.  Luckily, I purchased the expansion for very cheap, and therefore I was able to enjoy the game.  It seems that not much has changed here.  It's still corridor fights, and dark environments.  The biggest addition is the grabber gun.  Almost on par with the portal gun, however, the visual that you obtain when using the grabber gun is very confusing and does not create a smooth flow of gameplay.Not a necessary play, but I recommend it because.........well it's fun to kill Demons.

												While it retains most of the elements that made Doom 3 great, like the scary space horror atmosphere and hellspawn enemies, its campaign is a lot shorter, we are talking about an expansion after all.On the other hand the new weapons added were great, especially the double-barreled shotgun (or super shotgun as it is called) from Doom II became my favorite from the traditional weapons, the feeling of getting very close to an enemy and then blasting him with two simultaneous shotgun shells was immeasurable. The Grabber Gun (obviously inspired from Half Life 2's Gravity Gun) and Heart of Hell artifact were nice additions as well.Another advantage was that the final boss fight was harder than the very easy one in Doom 3 (which felt as a joke compared to the rest of the game) and finally tied up the loose ends left in the latter.

												MUCH better than the main game. It plays less like a horror game and more like good ol' Doom! The Artifact, which briefly buffs your character, helps balance the difficulty and allows for a more offensive oriented playstyle. Outnumbered? Low on health? You wanna just blindly charge into the enemy horde? The Artifact's got ya covered!Aside from the artifact, the whole expansion pack was clearly designed with fun first in mind. It's just more fun to play than the main Doom 3. There are fewer corridors, more enemies to fight, the boss fights are more intense and you even get the classic Super Shotgun!If you played Doom 3, but didn't like it then give this expansion pack a chance! You will be pleasently surprised!			"

(The rocket launcher takes 4-5 rockets to kill a hell knight, the double barreled shotgun takes 1-2). The ammo is everywhere, it fits most situations, and is the gun you should be using 80% of the gameStill worth every cent though. If you enjoyed DOOM 3, you'll enjoy this too.			"

												In this DLC, the story is continues after the main campaign, and everything looks just as good.  Now onto the new content.  In this DLC, the developers basically took elements from other popular FPS (gravity gun from Half-Life 2 and slow motion from Max Payne/F.E.A.R.) and added them to the mix.  It felt like the gravity gun was forced.  It was included, and in addition, most levels were filled with explosive barrels just begging to be tossed.  These were a waste of time for me, as you get plenty of ammo for your other weapons, including the best addition to the game: The double-barreled shotgun.  Lemme tell ya, you don't know firepower until you use this thing.  Like, it feels ludicrous to not dive deeper into the slow motion mechanic or the great new enemies.  But this weapon, this thing felt just so powerful.  Even on Veteran it felt like most of the game's challenges could be handled with this thing.  It sounded and felt like the ultimate detructive weapon.  To compare it to another game, remember the first time you fired the BFG in the original Doom?  That's how I felt firing this thing for the first time.  I chuckled as the enemy in front of me was torn apart in one blow.  This thing was a beast, using it was an experience all on its own.  It honestly made the DLC for me, just seeing the game drop larger and larger enemies, larger crowds, and using this thing paired with slow motion to empty an entire room.  It was a magical weapon, unlike any weapon I have used in any FPS in recent memory.  On the surface it is simply two shotgun blasts in one, but in practice it was so much more.So yeah, if you liked main Doom 3, get this DLC just for the double shotty.			"

												Back in its time, Doom 3 was not only eagerly anticipated but consumers wanted more and more of its compelling gameplay. Together with Nerve software, an expansion pack called The Resurrection of Evil was released. This game introduced a continuing storyline, new weapons, items and monsters, and it was quite successful in its delivery despite its comparative shortness to the original.This game was the last “expansion pack” released and advertised as such, from this point the term DLC became a common replacement for it. It was just that however, it was a huge package which changed everything about the game while keeping to the style of the original game.The story tells the tale much better than the original, where after the events of Doom 3 a specialized team of individuals was assembled to investigate the remains of the UAC base. They manage to find a cavity crawling with unidentifiable activity and unfortunately for them they open it up, revealing an artifact of great interest to Dr. Malcom Betruger. Once provoked , the artifact causes havoc reveals that the evil doctor was reincarnated as a demon known as the Maledict, and he spawns a whole fleet of demons to ascertain the artifact.I loved the new monster known as the Vulgar, it was so cool, creepy and intriguing that it really should have been in the original game. The double barrel shotgun was also an incredible and welcome addition to the expansion pack. Overall the game was really good and a lot of fun. It was however a shame that many of the elements in the expansion never made it to the original – I would have loved to play the original with the double barrel shotgun…Great expansion, and well worth the time for what you pay for it!

												More of the same but worse. Resurrection of Evil serves as a conclusion to the plot of Doom 3, seeing as how the main game just sort of stopped on a clumsy cliffhanger when it got bored. The expansion pack, however, is inferior in pretty much every possible way.The encounter design is worse, using the powerup artifact it gives you as an excuse to throw powerful enemies at every alternate step and using the ""jerk's first fan level"" philosophy that the best way to introduce challenge is to just make the player kill a million of something.The scares are worse, especially in the penultimate level where the spooky red filter of doom literally flashes every couple of seconds making it feel like your tram got stuck in front of one of the attractions at a haunted house ride.And the gear is worse, taking away your chainsaw and ""kill-the-thing-and-heal-me"" panic button in favor of that technological marvel that keeps showing up in sci-fi games which revolutinarily replicates the powers of a working set of hands, and the previously mentioned powerup artifact that by around the two-thirds mark of the game gives you bullettime, increased damage, and invulnerability. Which sounds ridiculous, until they start contriving reasons for you to use it in the first few levels, which they eventually give up on in favor of just doing things like ""lock you in a room with a dozen hellknights and mancubi"" because they handed the level editor to their 13-year-old son for a few minutes, presumably.And of course the plot is worse, in that there barely is one. For the first half of the game your job is basically just ""get out of the hole you start out in,"" while three suped-up hellknight-ish bosses take turns to fight you before you Megaman their powers. And the second half is ""get to Delta Labs so you can shoot the villain we forgot to kill in the main game in the face."" Which you do by shutting down all power in the area you're in to divert the energy to teleporting you over to Delta Labs. Because walking is too hard, I guess. Also one of the things you shut down to reroute power is the reactor. I don't think the developers knew how rerouting works. And then you shoot the boss in his silly tongue-face and he dies, the end. Literally, it cuts to black right after he dies and you get one line of dialogue from mission control as the credits roll.Boring, pointless, and literally the only reason I bothered was because I paid money for this♥♥♥♥♥♥so I might as well see it through to the end. Don't do the same.			"

												Not much of a story line and no build-up like DOOM III. It's stiil relatively terrifying and enjoyable to play. This one starts focusing more on the magical side of DOOM though; even though there are still guns. You run out of amunition easily, not sure if it's on purpose to keep you on edge or just bad testing. Honestly seems more like bad testing. I preffer DOOM III and later but this is still worth a play if it's not expensive.			"

												Though I'm a pretty die-hard Doom guy, I passed on this when it was originally released. The lukewarm reception it received at the time was just enough to make me reconsider and let it slip from my radar for years. Since the release of the newest Doom I've decided to give this a chance, and when I saw it on sale I had to go for it. With that being said, only paying two and some change for this expansion is certainly an easy pill to swallow, but if I were to have paid full price back in 2005? Maybe not so much. Maybe that's a harsh way to put it, as the expansion is still somewhat... Uh.... ""Expansive"" with its roughly six or so hours of new story content (among other things, more on that in just a sec). Its the actual quality of what's there, not so much the amount. One of its biggest selling points is this new mechanic that's introduced with something eerily similar to a gun from Half-Life 2. The grabber gun (or... Something) feels awkwardly designed and not overly practical in practice, which is a total bummer considering a few sections make a point to force it on you. The level design leaves something to be desired as well. Props for opening up the playing field in a few sections but overall it feels like more of the same- just less creepy with less ambience and attention to detail. It's not bad despite its faults- it definitely has a few key features that make it worth playing at least once. The double barreled shotgun finally makes a long awaited return and it feels completely at home in Doom 3's domain. Easily my most used weapon on any given play through. The artifact (a strange, demon heart that devours souls and does cool stuff, like slow time for everything around you so you can get strategic with your kills) is a serious contender for best new addition though, and I would've loved to have seen more of the game designed around its powers. Despite the disappointing  decision to have the game set in the same location as the previous chapter, eliminating the need for anything too vibrant and different, it does well on changing the pace up and keeping the action heavy with more enemies more frequently. A huge plus for those who prefer fast and heavy Doom as opposed to the slow approach 3 took.All in all I'd give it a solid 7/10. It has its moments and it certainly doesn't suck, but it has a few flaws that keep it just under awesome. The elements that work really work though and make at least a play through worthwhile. But for $5 or less you can't go wrong if you're a Doom fan.			"

												This expansion for DOOM 3 has a lot more action than DOOM 3 does. DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil has a ton of demons it likes to throw at you. It often gets challenging with how many demons you are fighting at once. I would recommend DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil to people who played DOOM 3 and want more action.8/10(I like this version better than the BFG Edition version. The BFG version took out some stuff)			"

												When people played Doom 3 and either loved/hated it, people did say it was more horror and stroy oriented then Doom 1 or 2.  People felt that Doom 3, despite having somewhat old-school gameplay, felt detached from Doom 1&2 in terms of action.With that in mind, Nerve software released this exapnsion pack for Doom 3. The Resurection of Evil, and it looks like Nerve wanted to cater to those who wanted more action in Doom 3. To sum up this game in short words: This is basically the Doom 2 of Doom 3: Identical in almost all ways, but they add more  weapons and enemies, like Doom 2.The story takes place after Doom 3, two years after the events of Doom 3, the UAC detects a strange signal from one of its Martian satellites, and consequently sends a team in to investigate, under the command of Dr Elizabeth McNeil, an unseen character refered to in Doom 3.  You play as a marine ""Engineer"" when your squad discovers another Martian chamber, holding an Artifact created by the Demons themselves.  Upon touching it, it releases demonic energy that kills your squad, and opens another gateway to hell.  You are tasked with finding a way to analyse the artifact, and then destroy it in hell.  You have also got to track down and kill 3 powerful demons, sent in by the Maledict (Dr Betruger from Doom 3) to collect the artifact, called the ""Hunters"".To be honest the story is both expanded apon, but more irrelevent at the same time, as there is no build up to the demons; it just drops you right into the fray.  The ending also, is VERY rushed, and asks WAY too many questions, with no answers.  It leaves a bad taste in your mouth after a much more satysfying bossfight.If you've played Doom 3, you'll feel right at home when playing ROE, So I'll talk about what's new:There are 3 new weapons: The first being the Double Barrel Shotgun from Doom 2.  It is easly the funnest weapon in the game, able to deal more damage than a rocket launcher up at point blank range, and using it feels like playing Doom 2 again.Then there is the Ionized Plasma Levitator, or the ""Grabber"" as it's called. It funcions a bit like the Gravity Gun in Half-Life 2.This weapon gave ROE some critisism, because it seems that this weapon was ripping off Half-Life 2.  The developers have commented that the tool was originally in Doom 3 before Half-Life 2, and was used to create ""damaged"" rooms; instead of building a ruined room, they would build a pristine room and use the grabber to ""damage"" it realistically, but could not fit it into the game propper before HL2 was released.  Wether or not this is true is up for you to dicide.  One major difference between the Grabber and the Gravity Gun is that the Grabber has a limited charge, and thus can only hold onto an object for several seconds. Additionally, the Grabber creates a distortion effect that can obscure the player's vision when in use, but the Grabber can catch demon projectiles and small creatures like Lost souls, Cherubs, and trites, whereas the Gravity gun cannot.The last weapon is the Hell-heart or ""Artefact"". The artifact has a number of abilities, each collected after defeating a Hunter demon.  The first you get early in the game is slow-motion or ""Helltime"". This effect is notable as this is a key gameplay feature in the game F.E.A.R., later in 2005.   The second is ""Beserk"", which allows you to deal twice the damage you could in Heltime mode. This replaces the Beserk helmet in Doom 3.  The final is ""Invulnability"" which mkes you invincible to all but the final boss.There are a few new enemies, but those are for you to discover.One final thing to note is that ROE adds new features and modes to Doom 3's multiplayer.  Even though Doom 3's multiplayer was unpopular, this is a nice touch to detail.Overall I would recommend that you get Doom 3: Resurection of Evil if you have Doom 3, as it adds satysfying length to a great campaign.

												I can not blame this expansion for the faults of the base game, but I can praise it for what the original didn't have.Gameplay changes drastically once again - still on the same engine, but there are more enemies, more weapons and ammunition and less horror. This is as close to what people have been expecting of Doom 3 as it gets. Instead of the three-step formula of the base game (Go through corridors, go through hell, go through slightly more exciting exciting corridors), this one tips things on its head by actually making the corridors much more distinct.The general goals are a lot less vague. In the base game it was ""go fetch this, but you can't fetch this, because you can not open this thing, so to open this thing you need to go and do something else"" while here it is similar, the game makes it a lot clearer and things make a lot more sense.The Super Shotgun is back and it's a lot more fun to use than the basic thing. They also give  you a version of the Gravity Gun, and although it may be fun to use at first, it's use gets limited to throwing an enemies' fireball back at them.Besides that, there are many gimmicks here and there, which make the experience seriously a lot more fun.Hell levels are less diverse than in the original, but that can be excused with the improved design of the Mars base.Di ent.

												Everything that was fun about original Doom 3 gets dumped on here. A disgusting lack of ammo and health, they want you to use the artifact constantly and everytime you do you feel like you're cheating. Every time you don't, you're overwhelmed and almost dead. The interesting story from Doom 3 is garbage in the expansion, with  bad voice acting, only 1 audio logs and 0 video logs, hardly any storage lockers. The only resolution is killing the final boss, but the cutscene that wraps up the story is *STUPID*. id software didn't make this game, so the qualtiy is a significant drop. I can only recommend this if you liked Doom 3, and even that game is worth around $2.50. This game was just frustratingly bad and even more repetetive than the original.			"

Posted: October 7, 2016
												TL:DR - What happens when the changes from Doom 3 go too far.Full review: Unlike the base game, I find it very hard to recommend this expansion. I already went in depth with what Doom 3 does differently in its review, so I won't repeat myself here. What I will say is that Resurrection of Evil takes the great, if somewhat off-putting, changes to the formula that the base game did [Atmosphere, game pacing, ammo, etc.], and turns it into its biggest flaw, to the point that I am writing this review now, instead of when I finish. The lighting is much darker than the base game, the action and the pacing is much slower, armor and ammo distribution is much more restrictive, and the horror angle is expanded on further... yet, due to how slow the game is, rather than keep me hooked, I find myself tuning out and focusing on going from point A to B, which is the last thing you want happening in a game like this.As far as action is concerned, ammo for your weapons are much further and farther in between than in the base game. Thankfully, you get the Grabber, a new weapon to the game, which lets you grab small props, enemies and their projectiles in the enviroment and fling them at enemies to deal damage. Already, the biggest issue with this is that you are forced to use a slow weapon, as it takes time between release and pick-up to recharge. In addition, solution 1 in my Doom 3 review for the lighting issues in the game (Installing the duct tape mod) will not work, as you'll predominatley have the grabber as your current weapon. Another problem is that this weapon fully relies on your enemies being demons, as human enemies all attack using their fists or their guns, and will be much faster, meaning that you can't get close without being hit by bullets. To remedy this, the game also gives you an artifact [don't know the name, so don't ask]; which, when activated, will let you run around, temporarily in ""hell time"" [bullet time, ""Slow motion"" for the uninitiated]. Not only does this bring the already slow gameplay down to an almost glacial pace, but the game expects you to use it at almost every oppertunity, as not only can you hold up to 3 charges, but you can refill on charges by collecting souls from the dead UAC staff, which are placed everywhere.The most egregious example of these issues in in Erebus level 5. In an end-level segment, you have to run a gauntlet where your helmet has very limited air, so you are running and gunning, picking up air tanks along the way; something that this add-on is not meant for. In this segment, there are a few enemies that you must retaliate to using the grabber. Their projectiles fly very quickly, so you'll need to use ""hell time"" to slow down the game enough to be able to take care of these enemies quickly. You'll need to do this 3 times in this segment, which will use all of your artifact ammo. However, in a case of ""How did they miss this bug?"", Any souls that are in this sement can not be picked up, even if you walk over the body! What's worse is that once past this segment, you transistion to Erebus Level 6... and another air tank sequence! This time it's outdoors, on mars' surface, where you run out of air much faster. There are no souls to reload your artifact in between these sequences to assist you here, so you will need to run from point A to B as fast as you can, or deal with all the enemies with the limited ammo and SEVERELY limited air that you have, at full speed. Pardon my french, but that segment can go fornicate itself with an iron stick.Really, however, I am more bored than anything else. This expansion is not technically flawed [apart from that one example above], and it controls and plays the same as the base game. However, unlike Doom 3, which had a clear goal on what it was trying to do (What if the DOOM ""storyline"" was played straight?), Resurrection of Evil doesn't know whether it wants to be action or horror, and thus fails at both. I don't blame you if you want to give this expansion a try anyway; beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If this expansion didn't try to mess with the delicate balance of Action and Horror in Doom 3, this could've been a great add-on. For me, however, It's just a slow, borderline-mediocre game that doesn't seem to understand what it wants to be.			"

												This is Doom 3 at its core, and it certainly has its moments, but those moments are usually when health and ammo are plentiful. Someone decided that limiting ammo and giving you a gravity gun to bounce fireballs back at imps and vulgars would be fun, but it's entirely tedious. It also keeps everyone's favorite Doom 3 feature of spawning enemies out of thin air directly behind you. There are moments in the game that basically force you to use the artifact (a few seconds of god mode) because they're insane but I enjoyed this and didn't feel it was required for too many parts.It's basically a 4 hour version of Doom 3 with a couple meh mechanics and lighter story.

												Doom 3 resurrection of evil is a mediocre game. If you didn't like Doom 3, you won't like this. If you liked Doom 3, you might still not like this. While Doom 3 was a bit of a slow-paced horror shooter (or tried to be, at least), this leans more towards action, but fails to deliver.There are two main additions to the game: A gravity gun, and an artifact that can be used to trigger bullet time. Both fail miserably.The gravity gun is awkward to use. You can grab barrels and crates and throw them at enemies, and you can grab enemy projectiles and lob them back. However, grab an object for too long (4-5 seconds or so), and the gravity gun runs out of charge and drops it. This means you cannot use it for battle constantly because you don't always have things at hand to throw, and you can't keep an object with you for the next encounter. Even more awkward is that it occupies the same weapon slot as fists (pressing 1 switches to grav gun, then fists if you press 1 again). This is annoying because fists one-shot enemies once you get the Berserk ability (see below), and you'll have to go through the gravity gun first.The artifact is also awkward to use. You have to switch to it (Q by default), activate it, after which you're switched back to the weapon you had before you switched to the artifact. You have a maximum of 3 artifact charges, and the charges are replenished by consuming some special red-glowing dead bodies scattered in the levels.The artifact is leveled up every now and then after defeating certain enemies, gaining certain effects for the duration of bullet time: first berserk (greatly increased damage, fists one-shotting people) and then invulnerability.Unlike the original Dooms (Doom 1 and 2) where most of the monsters were in the level to begin with, monsters typically spawn from thin air. You see a reddish orb at monster height, from which lightning arcs to the ground, then the monster spawns. This is a major annoyance with bullet time because you find yourself having to wait for the monsters to spawn before you can shoot them. That means standing for several seconds in front of the spawn point twiddling your thumbs. Worse, the monster spawn points block your movement, so you can't even go ahead and leave the monsters behind. You have to wait.Couple that with monsters often spawning behind you, blocking your movement backwards. Overall the spawning mechanic is overused and means you never ""clear"" an area. Every time you use a computer or get a PDA/holokey you have to prepare for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t re-sweeping of a previously swept area.The story is bad enough that I don't remember much of it. The artifact, being from hell and all, is drawing hellish monsters to Mars or something. You're trying to return it to hell so they stop coming. To do that you need to activate and use a teleporter, for which you need to shut down some power systems to boot up, bla bla bla. The few NPCs that talk to you and give you missions are forgettable and cliched.Combat is the same as Doom 3, which is not a great thing. I constantly ran out of ammo for some reason, and found the reload times of weapons awkward. There were many monsters in general, and most of my time in fights--when not using bullet time because it's boring--was spent reloading or switching weapons. They also retained the screen-shake effect on getting hit, which screws up your aiming and vision.The ending sees you going back to hell to return the artifact and fighting with Demon-form Kruger from the original Doom 3. The fight is annoying as hell, and once it's done you see a dumb cutscene and the game ends.In conclusion: If you're a diehard Doom 3 fan, get this. If you've run out of single-player FPSes to play, you can try it out. Otherwise don't bother.			"

												How do they expand DOOM 3? Adding Helltime and a gravity gun (DOOM 3 came out weeks after Half Life 2). The gravity gun is fine but Helltime is what the problem is. Basically its slowmo mode so you can shoot enemies. DOOM 3 didn’t need Helltime mode so in this game they have incredibly cheap monster spawns forcing you to use Helltime mode. And I don't suck at the DOOM 3. I beat it on Veteran only saving when I got a beat a level, got a key, or got a PDA (except during Hell I saved after that zombie part cause it takes too long to go through). You cannot dodge 4 skeletors shooting HOMING rockets at you. Helltime is not really a good gameplay mechanic because you see all of these monsters hit the Helltime button and kill them. And it doesn’t work well. Let’s say you have 3 monsters in the room. They are powerful so you use Helltime. When you kill them more mosnters appear but they take a long time to spawn in through the magic portal because Helltime mode is on. You just wait for them to spawn and see that they are just as powerful as the last batch you killed. Then Helltime mode ends and you have to use another one or die.Interestingly they give you grenades in the first half of the game but not in the second half (at least as far as I could make it).So adding to the game=making it impossible to the point where you have to use Helltime mode to cut through the enemies like paper (which doesn’t help when it slows down the incoming spawns too). No thanks. DOOM 3 is great but this expansion isn't.Also with ATI cards there is a glitch where if you use Helltime and the Grabber the screen will flip. The only way to get rid of it is to install ReadonPro and disable Catalyst. But when you do that the framate sinks significantly.			"

												This is pretty much like Doom 3 with few changes, just more stuff. It has a good single player campaign that is similar to the base game, but it shorter in length. The new artifact is better than the soul cube in how you get more powers when you use it and it does feel extremely useful for those tight situations. I know it is a rather old game, but still holds up well. Later on I will try out the Doom 3 BFG edition. If you are waiting for a sale but has the original Doom 3 and expansion, I definitely recommend trying them out.			"

New weapons and enemies are thrown into the fray to keep things fresh and exciting, as well as an assemblage of imposing bosses to defeat, all requiring different tactics for added variety and challenge. This was the perfect opportunity to explore all of the twisting spires and caverns of hell that were absent from the main game, unfortunately, the exact same mistake is repeated; a brief trip through a hell that feels restrained and unimaginative in scope.

												An expansion of Doom 3. In terms of itself, this expansion fixes the issues with level design and space management, adds newer weapons, focuses on it's metalhead thematics and overall feels like what a true ""Doom"" next-gen game would feel at the time.			"

												The dlc doesn't really add much to the game besides an add on to what happend at the end of doom 3. Not much is diffrent either you will actually recognise where you are which doesn't feel like bad thing it's like an old memory. The source of all evil still exsists and you have to destroy it again.			"

												!!Important note!!If you don't own doom or doom 2, you will probably be better of buying the BFG edition, just remember to check the pc requirements for the BFG edition because they are much more demanding compared to the originals.     What I liked about the game •	More Doom. The game play hasn't changed for the worst and it still has a good horror atmosphere, especially towards the end. Resurrection still has top-notch level design, with plenty of secrets to be found.•	New weapons and enemies. The grabber was my favourite new weapon to use. Once you got used to the grabber, it became a very additive weapon. The new enemies in the game were also cool. I liked how the Bruiser had a monitor attached to his head which showed different images. The Vulgar was a challenging enemy. I found the Vulgar more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is a livelier version of the IMP.•	You play as a marine who actually does look like a badass. •	The Artifact you use looks cool and is very useful, especially towards the end of the game.•	Awesome boss fights.•	You can find arcade machines which have mini games like block buster.  •	There weren't many Arch-viles in the game; I only encountered one or two, throughout the whole game.   What I disliked or was disappointed with•	I didn't find the contents of PDA'S as interesting this time round. The emails were very short and most of the PDA'S didn't have audio logs. There were no video disks. •	The game is very challenging.The Vulgar's are a pain to kill, especially when there is more than one.  Conclusion Overall a good expansion pack, I probably would enjoy it more if I played it again. If you enjoyed doom 3 and want more, then I highly recommend you buy this. 80/100 "

												Great expansion. In my opinion, the combat in this game is better than the core Doom 3 game because of the new weapons.			"

												If you liked Doom 3, you will likely enjoy this, if you didn't you wont. Levels do feel alot more cheaply put together.			"
