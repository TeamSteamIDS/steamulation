												At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other. and pretty much all the old players quit, and you can tell kabam only wants money from this.    sad to see that happen to one of my use to be fav games.r.i.p   Realm Of the Mad God(EDIT for those who dont really understand)ok i admit its all 100% a pay to win.its more of a pay to have fun, and make any real progress.pets to heal you, regen all your stuff, and attack for you, gotta pay to make them work.theres, backpacks,potions, item drop enhancers, very powerful items right off from the start. only way you can get any of these is with money. NOW , i wouldnt mind, skins, colors, things like that you know? like the old days of this game.			"

												The game WAS amazing....back then.Before when Wild-Shadow-Studios owned the game the game was made for the players. As soon as kabam took over they completly ruined the game. To explain what they ruined: Ruined Ammys making them scammys, Making UT's untradeable, so we cant make back your ingame currency and finnaly, Making it pay to win-what do i mean by pay-to-win? they have implemented the feature to get items with real money, which makes the game no fun, as newbies will completely mistake the game and over take us long time players.if you dont pay you wont win.Over all if you think im out of my mind, im not, ive played the game for over 600 hours, Im a red star,and ive lost over 20 max stat charecters most of them where 6/8 and gave over 2000 fame. I also own a guild.Before when Wild Shadow Studios owned it- 120/10-------------Now because of Kabam- 4/10------Because of this i do not recommend this game anymore.			"

												Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version.This game USED to be good. It really was. Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game. It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required.Then, a company called Kabam took over. They changed the game into a cashgrab. Skins? Buy gold. Vaults and characters? Buy gold. 1-life weapons or keys? Buy gold. Everything is gold gold gold. Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold. In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with.. you guessed it, gold!!You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction! No, there isn't. The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc. Kabam doesn't care at all. After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother?TL;DR: Stay away.			"

												Used to play this back on Kongregate (I believe it was on there) and a bit when it came on Steam. Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find. Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay. Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it.So I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong...really strong actually. I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam. As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area. Interesting. So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over.I couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago. Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up.....Wow. Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model. No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days. But Kabam really butchered this game. Everything good requires money. Skill is irrevelant. I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game. What's the world coming to....I.Rather.Have.Perfect.World.Own.This.....Hell.I.Rather.Have.Nexon.Own.This.Than.KabamNever again Kabam...never again.			"

												I used to play this game a far long time ago, back on Kongregate. It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal.But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past.So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam. I went into the reviews, and noticed...a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours. I thought to myself, Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right? People love to use hyperbole to make a point. In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again...I regretted said decision.[GETTING STARTED]So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds. Flash games, gotta love'em. I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap. That's not a good sign...I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior. The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account. For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem.[MY EXPERIENCE]When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me. I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas. Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order.Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to love the Nexus! It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there.But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:Bots! Bots everywhere! I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out. I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically. In real life. I was that angry.Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items. Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item. Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value! And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now 51, meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin! Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified.Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though. I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring. Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle. I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did. Congratulations, RotMG; you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees...Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things. I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment. Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped. Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment. Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed. I thought to myself, Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me.How wrong I was.First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man. I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death. Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall...and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him. Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows. And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors. The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in ""#rekt"" about 7 times. Fun times were had..[GAMEPLAY]Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional. The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago. Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much. You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God.You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot. Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons.Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead. Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground.[SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues. Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face. You get your first slap when you boot up the game, and you're being asked to buy crap you don't even need; you get the second slap going to the Nexus, once a sanctum for player cooperation, now a den of botting inequity and a broken economy; and the final slap, rounding this merry-go-♥♥♥♥-yourself out quite nicely, is the afore-mentioned hackers, honing their trolling skills to a weaponized level in the goal of wanting you dead.I have it on word that things have changed hands, and that the game's improved somewhat. I intend to take a look at things again sometime, but for now, the review will stand until I do.			"

												Hoo, this game.  Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours...before the company got bought out by a bigger company.  Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game.  I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out.  The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable.  When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers.			"

												Alright. This game. I used to play it on its website, but I downloaded it on here to review it. Realm of the Mad God used to be one of the games I played the most. However, when the company Kabam bought it, it instantly became a store. Kabam are just greedy, money grabbing rip-offs, and they are the exact reason I have stopped playing this game. The main lobby is just a store, showing off weapons, armor, pets, and other things that can only be bought with coins, which can be bought with real money, or can be earned from dieing with a decent to good character who needs good stats to actually earn the coins.Feel free to play this game, but prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for micro-transactions and updates that only benifit people who love to spend money.

												Oh god, I remember first finding out about this game while it was being made for a competition on TIGsource. It was great fun, and I suppose it still is, but after a while of not playing it and coming back to see so many changes, It has definitely taken a turn for the worst.The basic premise of the game is pretty much a multiplayer 'bullet hell' style game, most of the action (PvE) takes place on a randomly generated continent which is really big and possesses many diverse environments. This means that there's not a shortage of bosses and mooks to kill, and temples  and castles to raid for loot. The item system is pretty easy to understand, with gear being divided on tiers, a higher tier meaning rarer and more powerful items. Initially, you are made to choose a class and dropped off in a tutorial with only a basic weapon and a skill item. The game itself is pretty fun, and you can play for hours without it getting boring or repetitive. Here's where the game starts falling apart. Most of the action that happens later is just plain old grinding. Even for the hardest monsters getting item drops is really hard, as the item drop rate is extremely tiny.The worst thing that's happened to this game was the developers being bought by Kabam. It has pretty much become a pay-to-win affair. Before, you could buy cosmetic items and pets with real money to support the developers. Now you can get the rarest armours and weapons with a few bucks. Like I said before, the item drop rates are ridiculous, so selling weapons and items for real money feels kind of cheap.All in all, a good game ruined by 'freemium'. If you play it, expect to grind a lot, or pay up.			"

												tl;dr The game used to be good but the new company that owns it, Kabam transformed it into a pay to win game rather than having players rely on skill.As an experienced player of this game I cannot honestly not recomend it. Ever since Kabam took it over it has transformed the game from an awesome fantasy rogue like bullet hell, to a generic pay to win mmo. Everytime I play it I feel like it's missing a purpose, and that all I'm doing is running around with underpowered gear attempting to kill bosses, and often failing in doing so because of the way Kabam has remade the game. It is only really fun if you play it with friends, or if you play it for about 10-20 minutes, which really breaks my heart because it used to be one of my all time favorite mmo's back before I ahd a nice computer. 3/10			"

												Fun... one day it was. Not only has the new owner of this company, Kabam, has not only turned this game into a cold-hard pay-to-win, moreover it is extremely careless about anyone who plays this game. The game is infested by many 'hacked clients' of people dashing trough walls and using various other illegit tricks, sometimes just to take away your chances at phat loot, sometimes purposely drag huge mobs of enemies on you trying to get that character of yours killed. Let's not even mention people sitting on the most powerful enemies in the game, taking no damage at all, and calling people to teleport for interesting stuff - instead they teleport to an instadeath. another character wasted.If you would be able to look past all these downsides there is plenty of fun to be found, and i have found it, before this curtain of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t appeared.

Thats why all the servers are 10x emptier now. Nice job kabam... (note that I have little hours on the game because I played on Google Chrome, not steam).			"

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a great game at certain times, but then you can feel like you have wasted too much time on it. Once you get to level 20 the game is going to give you a cookie, then kick you in the shins and take the cookie back. Generally speaking in a neutral point to review, this game will most likely pull you in once you put some time into it and you will grow to hate the game when you die, and then find it creeping back on your a few weeks/months later and have a sudden desire to play again. Once you die there is no way to recover your character or any of the items, which is the most frustrating part of the game. However, you can pay real money (which I'm not a fan of, but in no way would I consider this a pay-to-win game) to get more characters slots so that you can still have the other guys when you die. Play this game if you have a lot of extra time because it will pull you in fast.			"

												Realm of the Mad God, one of the most addictive 2D MMORPG I've played. I've got 3 years of this game on my belt so I'd like to think I know the pro's and con's.The game publisher, Kabam. Money fiends. They take advantage of permanent death. Having the game focused around the age group of  little kids and their parents credit card details. With $20 USD you can purchase 2600 gold coins for in game. However these coins majority of the time will not last more than 2 days if not 1. If you wanted the best items from the beginning of the game (Yes you can buy the best 'tradable' items right away!) for a warrior for example, that'd cost 2360 gold. Once you have purchased anything you are more than likely going to die due to a lagspike.Through my 3 years of playing Realm I've had my fair share of seeing the occasional hacker, however occasional is a bit of an understatement. After contacting Kabam staff multiple times about hackers, I was told to video my gameplay. Staff replied with and I quote, ""Thank you for writing in with your concern.

												Game is decent, unfortunately updates consistantly wipe progress, so expect that. Publishers are known to not give people microtransaction refunds after a character wipe.--(Dec 2015 Edit: Not sure if wipes still happen, however I'm technically locked out of my account and support has stopped responding to me, so for Steam users that never migrated to an email like me, our items are officially locked out, paid or not)--Every time there has been a character wipe, they say they will correct it next time, but they never do and it's been this way for years. It's come to the point that people just accept it and most people don't even complain about it anymore. Unfortunately it's not something you will see listed on the store page or in their microtransaction shop.Recently there is a new issue with this game. Some steam users that didn't link their account to an email are no longer allowed to access their RotMG account. I happen to be one of these users, yet another slap in the face. As far as I know this only is affecting steam users and those affected have no way to play the game through their steam account, they can't even start over.If you are absolutely certain you won't be spending a dime on this game, it might be worth a try if you like dungeon crawlers, it's about as good as dungeonland but with worse graphics. Otherwise stay away, spending cash for temporary items is no fun, losing all your hard work is even less fun still.""""""""Steam account can't connect - 02072900Thank you for contacting us.

												I played the browser version of this a lot. It was plenty fun, grinding pots with friends, maxing a char, dying, crying, vowing not to be overconfident again, then repeat. It would still be fun right now if Kabam actually puts their effort into balancing the classes and dungeons and all that, but noooo they only care about their sweet money.

												I've been playing this game for 5 years now. One thing is for sure, once you get your first white bag, it's like a drug. You want to kill more and more bosses for that chance of getting a beautiful white bag. The loot aspect of this game is very well done. When you get a very rare item it makes you look super pro compared to other players. These items, event items, in particular are honestly a bit too rare. Like I said, I've been playing for 5 years. In that 5 years I've only gotten two of these items. Getting each one was one of the happiest things I've ever experienced in a game, but of course I ended up dying with them, because everyone dies in this game eventually. You invest hours and hours of grinding into one character to have it die and dissapear forever. When your characters are alive it's somewhat fun, grinding for rare items, but when you die it is literally one of the worst feelings you will ever have. After dying over and over again, and then dying with an item I grinded months for, I've decided that this game is truly not worth the time I've invested into it. The game has brought me more grief than happiness, that's for sure. If you want to grind for hours and hours on end and then have all the work dissapear in a micro-second, play this game. Oh yeah, and the community is absolute garbage. It's full of mean people and annoying kids who spam harambe and doge memes in the chat.			"

												I've been playing this game for years (even if not through Steam), and I can say that, through time, it has evolved to provide many unique and exciting features:- Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players!- No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more! - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports!- Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying!- Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable!- Much, much more!			"

												I have a love hate relationship with this game. After dying, you sort of chill (not play) for some time or so depending how long you spent building that character.Usually a 0/8 character is equivalent to a few days of chill, while dying as a 6/8 would be rage inducing to the point of a few weeks of chill. I know, I know, you're probably thinking it's just a game, you shouldn't even rage, yea, yea ""Git Gud"". But, because it's permadeath, you lose everything, everything you've earnt. Let me tell you, when you get attached to one character, you are one with the character, and when you die in the game, it feels like dying in real life.   It’s not a bad game, proof? Well you wouldn’t see people play this game for hundreds of hours if it was a bad game. In addition I played way more of this game on the internet version. Yea it consumed me (not as much as it did for others though). Like I said, I have a love hate relationship with this game, and you’ll begin to understand me when you at least clock up 50-100 hours of the game.			"

Posted: September 1, 2014
												Realm of the Mad God is a top down free to play MMO mouse aim shooter with a simple art style. It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.The controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.There are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.There are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.The maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button. The locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.Normal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.This feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.

												This weird pixel graphic action mmo dungeon crawler with rogue-like elements was created a long time ago by a small company called wildshadow. After years of awesomeness they had to sell it to kabam to keep the game going, kabam kept it going for some more years also, and now finally it's in the hands of Deca(Thankfully being revived by them after kabam's dark era). I've been with this game for so long i keep coming back to it, the 1000+ hours i have here are only with the steam account(had 2 older accounts before this one). I'm mentioning this so you get the idea that this game is very hard to kill, the people just wanna play this ****. If you're thinking about playing this game let me transfer some of my genuine info to you :). The game is extremely grind-based, so if you're not someone who likes to grind for endless hours everyday then this game should be a pass for you before i even go any further. Now for some pros and cons.+ Huge variety of enemies/bosses/events with unique variations of butt-clenching bullet hell patterns and tactics.+ More than big enough player base( very active game)+ Huge variety of items that adds to the already great replayabilty value of the game.+ The game is based alot on team play and as mentioned above there's always people to play along with.+ The game is being properly revived by Deca games and right now is the best time to start playing this game. (Month of the mad god, a special month, will run from 21 july till around the end of august).- The community(Like most gaming communities) can be very toxic at times. Not as toxic as moba communities don't worry :)- Lag in this game can punish you extremely high as it is a perma-death game. You need to take caution from both server lag and your own internet lag as not to lose a month work in a second. If you have a decently stable internet connection you should be safe from a lag related death most of the time though.-  Client users/Hacker/Dupers/Bots love to manifest this game; BUT Deca(unlike kabam) is already showing alot of promise in making this a thing of history(fingers crossed).Conclusion: Definitely a strong recommendation from me, i absoloutely love this game, and you won't have to pay a dime to try it so you should definitely do that. 9/10			"

												It used to be a fun/addicting game, but it Kabaam (the company that bought out the game) is all about stuffing money into their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fat bloody pockets.  It was so much more fun with non soulbounded items, no insanely high tier items in the store, and no stupid pets.----EDIT---- Updated Review as of 5/9/16 12:53 AMSo I decided to go ahead and play the game once again since I flew back home for my 1.5 weeklong summer vacation after college.TL;DR: The game is fun, but holy sh*t, the gold spammers got worse and there are minimal amounts of effort to update the game.  So yeah, it's fun, go ahead and play it for a bit if your internet doesnt' suck.  However, I still can't recommend this game because Kabaam continues to demonstrate a classic example of a company that buys out another company, providing a minimal amount of effort to make any improvements to the game (because, ""why make improvements when you can do nothing at all and still make money off of the 12 year olds that fall for this pay2win scheme?"").------------------------------------------------------------------The game has gone through a laughably minimal amount of updates since I had last played this game, over a year ago.  For a 2D MMO with a lot of potential for interesting, frequent updates, I thought that perhaps some unique new gamemodes, some cool improvements to the hub world, and new classes would be released.  Did I see any of those changes in the game:no, not reallyWhat I discovered in my +25 hours of playing (while on vacation):-USWest3 Server is still just as cancerous as before.  Chat comments fill up half of your screen and text from the advertising bots just spam it so hard that comments whiz by at the speed of f*cking light.  Fortunately there is the handy star requirement filter you can apply to chat (2* seems to do the trick), but it is still incredibly annoying that some bots still manage to whisper me.-Trading still sucks a-hole...  Like honestly, how has trading not been somehow improved in this game?  We have RealmEye which is great and all, but it is still such a hastle to try and arrange trades with other players, especially when you are playing and someone pms you and you go back to the nexus and forget the username of a player that pm'd you.  Every time you go to the nexus, an annoying bot will pm you, making it impossible to reply to the person who had just pm'd you since you can only reply to the last person who sent a pm to you (so the bot overrides the last pm).  Then you get to play the fun waiting game to try and find out if the person who had pm'd you will try and pm you again or not.-Chat....   Related to the first two points I made above.   Why is there no option to add a custom filter to the chat?  If players could filter out the ""WWW"" or "".COM"" sh*t, the issue with chat going bonkers would be solved.  The star requirement filter is nice and all, but I realy don't want to force the req over 2* to filter out the annoying bot that whispers ""Visit blah blah blah.com"" (I am unsure if the star req even affects private messages).  Putting any star requirement is hiding away potential people who might be selling something that I need or players who are trying to negotiate with me.  Hell, just enforce the restriction to post WWW, W W W, COM, C0M, and all other variations by default to stop these annoying bots from ruining the game.-Daily Tasks.  This is a nice addition to the game that is actually pretty cool.  You can get skins and also loot potions which last 30 minutes.  My only complaint would be how long it takes to farm for some of these low tier weapons (T7 usually) which is honestly more difficult for me to find compared to t6 and +t8 weapons.  I am yet to complete the second stage of the daily quest.-A few new dungeons.  OK, at least something was added...  Like most dungeons in the game, these new dungeons don't feel very different from any of the old ones.  Moving along then...-New weapons, armors, items.  Most of the new weapons are situational, but it's still nice to see a variety of UT's added to the game in the last year and a half.-Armor sets.  Pretty interesting idea.  Of course you can try your luck getting these by either running a sh*t ton of dungeons (which I have no problem with) or just paying a couple bucks with a lucky box thing that can make your character completely OP at the cost of your wallet and RNG (I have a problem with this).-T13.  I don't believe this was added before, but I do like the idea of T13 items since they don't appear to be sold anywhere in the cash shop.  This is sort of meaningless though, since the armor sets sold in the cash shop have the potential to include some weapons that are on par -if not better- than t13 weapons.-Ressurection Amulets are gone.  Those things were pretty OP anyways (they had a chance to let your character be ressurected after death.  Players would have characters live indefinitely).-Custom Cursors. Finally :DAnd that honestly wraps up almost all the major changes I have seen in game.  I'll still play it till the end of my vacation.  A game worth trying, but this company is reminiscent of EA.

Bullet-Hell RPG where the wrong step (or lag spike) could end your lifeRealm of the Mad God, a very simple and easy RPG to pick up and learn, but quite hard to master. Bullet-hell like twin-stick shooter games combined with a top-down RPG mechanic where you only have one life. Team up with waves of other players to take down many of the bosses that plague the realm. First you'll learn how to level up to level 20 (the max level) reliably which for a skilled player will take about 10-30 minutes, but that won't be the end of your adventure. You're going to have to learn how to max your stats which requires you to learn many of the dungeons and where to find them which could take several hours or even days. The journey will be hard and you only have one life to do it, but fear not! There are some things available to make your adventure easy. You have a vault where you can store your awesome finds in for your later characters to use. If you're lucky enough you'll find a pet which will stick with you throughout the whole game and all your future characters. Do invest in them, unless you're MLG Pro who don't need no man... uhm sidekick. Pros: Very good replayability It's not Pay2Win. All the equipment sold can be obtained in dungeons. Paying does help you progress a bit faster at least with pets. I spent $0 and I'm an orange star who can get 6/8 stats maxed. Very easy to find other players to play and do dungeons with in-game.Cons: Storage space is very limited, though that shouldn't be a problem until you get better at the game. No PvP, if you're here for that then this isn't the game for youReccomended To:People who enjoy perma-death mechanics. You masochistPeople looking for a fun co-op game to play with their friends. Even if you have 20 of them.It's even free and a small download, so why not try it?Side Notes:If you're going to get into trading, use RealmEye.com very useful way to trade. Just put up your offer and go back to enjoying the game. No I'm not being paid by RealmEye to say this.Turn star requirements on to 2 or 3 in the settings so you won't see those spam bots.Gimme my Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016 Badge, Steam! "

												--- PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW BEFORE VOTING!! ---Realm of the Mad God is a game that is completely unique in how it actually works. I have never seen a game that is similiar to this one. All the items are really cool, all the misc. items are unique, all the dungeons are insane fun. Overall, It is a well-done RPG but I have some things that I do not like in it. Even though the game is Free-to-play, it is also ""Pay-to-win"" if you know what I mean. You can still play and enjoy the game without giving any money, but if you want to play seriously and become a ""pro"" you will have to spend some money. For example, when you start off, you can have only one vault chest, which isn't enough for anything. It holds only 8 items. You need more storage than that. So you have buy more chest, each of which costs 500 gold coins, which are worth about 2.7 Euro. That is cheap, right? Considering you need at least 10-15 chests to store all of your UT's (Ultra Tiers) and all of your Stat Potions, there is no way of that being cheap. You also need more than one character. Each character slot costs 1200 gold coins. You can color your character, which of course also costs gold coins. Dispite the fact that the game is ""Pay-to-win"", I still had an absolute HUGE ammount of fun with this game with my friends. Leveling up, killing gods, completing dungeons etc. The game is insane fun even if you do not pay any money.  I also have one more thing that annoys me. Server-side lag. My internet is really fast and I have no lag on other multiplayer games. But in RotMG sometimes because of the server-side lag I die, losing my character and all my hard-earned gear. That is something Kabam has to work on.Final Rating: 7 / 10Good			"

												Imagine your favorite movie is on TV. Now imagine someone walks into your house and wipes **** all over the screen. Your favorite movie is still on TV, but now you have to watch it with **** on it, and it stinks as well. This is what happened to ROTMG. I've logged probably about 200 hours on the browser version over the course of about 5 years. I've been playing on and off for that time. After about a year without playing the game I saw that it was on steam and since it was free I downloaded it. Like I said earlier it's pretty much the same game I used to love, but it has **** wiped all over it. In the main lobby there are a dozen spam bots all screaming for you to buy high level items from them. You walk past rows of stores with items that can only be purchased with bought in game currency (with real money of course). If you want more storage you have to pay for it, it you want extra character slots you have to pay for those as well. This wouldn't be as big a deal, but $5 will only buy you 500 gold, which will not get you very far at all. Each character slot costs 1000 gold, and the vault chests cost 1000 gold as well. On the server there are quite a few hackers. To conclude this game is P2W, but you absolutely do not have to do so, everything that can be bought can also be achieved through hard work.			"

												I had to play long and hard to decide whether to give this game a positive or negative review, and I have made up my mind. having over 1k hours into the game, I think I can make a very good review based upon my experience. This game is fantastic, it's fast paced, it's fun, and if you don't mind perma death you can have a blast, but there's one thing dragging this game down and down to rock bottom and it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community. They hold no respect for other people, they troll, they spew unfunny and overused memes, and they are generally uptight pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. This game can only be fun if you have friends. I cannot, however, and will not continue playing because the community (in an mmo) is absolutely abysmal. I wouldn't recommend you to play unless you have all chat options turned off, and are playing with friends.There are also some things other people say about this game which simply aren't true. ""It's pay to win,"" is one quote I see frequently, and it makes absolutely no sense. Paying money does almost nothing to make you ""win"" the game. You can't buy stat potions, you can only buy equips which any noob will lose. It's not pay to win, and too many idiots who are unfamiliar with the term throw it around.			"

												I've played this game since the beginning. You won't see that on my profile, because I played on the browser, until I recently went to check it out again. Big mistake. All this game does is♥♥♥♥♥♥me off anymore, and not because I die over and over, that's part of the fun. What pisses me off is seeing a game I used to love being ruined and turned pay-to-win by Kabam. Kabam has done nothing but ♥♥♥♥ this game over completely since they bought it out. It's focused on how much money you can dump in the game, rather than how good you are, and how much time and effort you put in to FINDING your gear. You used to have to hunt forever to get a good set, now you can just slap a few bucks down, and walk out of the nexus like hot♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention how they completely screwed the loot system. Not only did they add ninja, which would be a good idea, if it weren't for the fact that they added a new weapon type, instead of using one of the ones already in the game, but I swear they also lowered the drop rate on gear. For those who don't know about the game, the ninja's unique weapon means that about 75% of weapons that drop are completely useless. Before ninjas were in the game, 66% couldn't be used by your class. This is because ninja weapons drop as commonly as the other 4 types, even though the other 4 have 2-3 classes using them.As for the lower drop rate, I can only assume that's so that they can sell more gear to people.I really wish I could still like this game. I used to play all the time, and I had 3 8/8 characters, full tops/UT, including alt weapons and abilities, and tons of♥♥♥♥♥♥in my vault. The sad thing is that I can't in good conscience tell anyone to play this game, because it's evolved into what I can only describe as a Facebook game.Please, Kabam, I know you must have a heart. Please give control back to WildShadowStudios, they knew how to run this game better than you guys ever will. You are ruining what used to be my favorite game.			"

Then trash your money on this game.I wouldn't say it's Pay2Win. Since getting loot, grinding for items, getting the satisfaction is what matters in my opinion. Everyone buying items, well, have fun. Must be a good type of satisfaction pressing on ""Purchase"".---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***OLD REVIEW BELOW***""This game is pay2win"" Guess where the items pro players use come from? NOT the store, they play, get drops, store them.I love this game. Playing it is like a rollercoaster. You get scared when it gets dangerous, you get alot of satisfaction riding it. But for every char, no matter how good you play, there is ALWAYS an end.But you know what? It's a game, ofc, you lose your items that you were farming for weeks. But hey, now you learned what you shouldn't do at that place you died at.If you're going to play this game for hundreds of hours, read this:Do not buy weapons / armor, any type of ingame item. Do buyCharakter slots, Vault slots. After getting a few of them, you basically bought the game.			"

												Man where do I even start with this game.. I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it			"

												With so many moving parts to learn and a seemingly infinite breadth of options to explore, diving into any new MMO is a major investment of time and energy. It's exhausting, really, which is why I appreciate a game like the free-to-play Realm of the Mad God. This fantasy-themed, co-operative bullet hell MMORPG is beautifully simple, yet deep enough to keep you chained to your PC for days on end. It takes only a minute or so to get right into the action, and, once you get a taste for running around with a gaggle of your fellow pixelated-warriors raising hell and slaying beasts across the online realm, it's hard to stop. Like any of the other thousands of players populating the bustling game world, you've been summoned by Oryx the Mad God to serve as dinner for his hungry minions. Of course, you've got other plans. Venturing out beyond the safety of the hub nexus, your mission is to blast beasties, collect loot, grow more powerful, and then stick it to the evil deity. Spraying magic projectiles around the screen while dodging incoming fire from blocky sumo wrestlers, dragons, goblin wizards, and stranger creatures you encounter takes on a classic, arcade-like quality. The straightforwardness is appealing – move, shoot, collect – and when you weave in exploration, obsessive loot hunting, RPG character growth and the camaraderie of smiting evil alongside other adventurers, sessions grow intensely hypnotic. Even if you never survive long enough get reach Oryx's doom lair, there's a ton of fun to be found in collaborating with other players in battle and unlocking cool new classes to play. Each of Realm of the Mad God's 13 unique character classes are accessed by reaching certain level benchmarks in other classes. Above all, this is what kept me glued to my keyboard playing for hours at a time. You start as a mewling wizard who can fire blasts of magic in any direction, but as you play longer and level-up, you eventually open-up more interesting classes like the necromancer, huntress, mystic, and assassin. Every class has its own set of weapons and items, magic powers, special abilities, and perks. They all play differently, and I got a thrill every time I unlocked a new one to try out. This adds tremendous replay potential too, since unlocking the coolest characters requires you to spend some serious time with each class. Perma-death layers-on an intense roguelike element to the already zany large-scale bullet hell RPG slugfest unfolding on any given server, and it seriously ups the challenge and risk factor. Getting careless will get you killed and force you to re-start your current character over from level 1. As frustrating as it can be, death is sometimes a welcome opportunity to try out another class, since you can only have one character at a time without using microtransactions to purchase additional slots. But when you're committed to keeping your favorite character alive, the threat of losing all your hard-earned experience and loot gently nudges you into working together with other players and forming impromptu gang of warriors to tackle the tougher swarms of foes as a group. Realm of the Mad God's streamlined approach to MMO gaming also changes up player interaction in good ways. Since there's no PvP, everyone in the realm is after the same goals – slay, loot, and level-up. As you come across other players, the desire to tag along and pitch in for tougher fights comes intuitively. You share the experienced gained from defeating foes as long as you hit them once, and there's generally plenty of loot to go around. Typing in chat text makes a speech bubble appear over your hero, and communicating in short bursts is effective for concocting plans outside of the heat of battle. When you do find other comrades you want to stick with, you can highlight nearby players and lock their names to your menu bar, allowing you to teleport to their location instantly if you get separated. It's a simple and easy-to-use system that works well. The realm itself is surprisingly vast, with a diverse landscape that holds more dangerous and inventive foes the further you venture away from your spawn point. Weaker baddies, like scorpions and pirates, populate the sunny beachside. But push through the thick forests, crumbling ruins, and mountains beyond, and you'll find powerful god-like foes capable of slaying low-level adventurers with a single strike. It's these formidable opponents you have to defeat in order to reach Oryx. Thankfully, when you need a break from battle or a quick getaway, tapping the insert key warps you back to the safety of the nexus where you can trade, use fame points or in-game cash to purchase special items, form a guild, and heal-up. It may be vastly different from its big-league brethren, but this stylish indie MMO has loads of staying power to match its unique concept. Realm of the Mad God&#Array;s accessible arcade-style bullet hell action blends with RPG nerdiness in some truly potent ways, and the lovely pixilated world holds an abundance of adventure that&#Array;s ripe for the taking. Easy to jump into and damn near impossible to quit, this unusual free-to-play MMO hybrid is worth every second of your spare time.			"

												Don't waste your time, any fun this game had months prior to coming on steam was very methodically removed by the devs. The very over inflated cash shop prices help drive the point home that this will never become anything awesome either, just a vessel for cash scam.The original concept of the game was a simplistic fun game that allowed large groups of people to collaborate into an army to eventually topple the mad god. People would band together in very large groups to help level each other and take down bosses. A fun concept but due to the simplistic nature of the game, hardly something you want to dole out money for, especially considering the game is built largely from graphics that are open source. Cash shop perks however created the rise of the ""cashing loner"" who could do alone what 50 or so players could accomplish. That also created these loners to corner anyone getting good equipment, creating a large rift in the player base, this essentially leads to 3 options in the game: 1) hack your way to the gear. 2) be forced to cash. 3) spend ages fighting for any progression.Now these 3 routes are actually pretty typical of a free to play. Except Mad god has one more aspect that makes the taste even more sour, permadeath. Again with original concept of the game, permadeath wasn't so bad. The game was very pick up and play again, you didn't mind starting over because you never really had a lot of content to chew through so you never got too invested into any one character and there was other classes to try the game over from a new perspective. Now there is a lot more content to the game so dying for a free player even if they do as much planning as humanly possible, is a major setback, cash players can buy additional storage and even have soul bound items so they aren't exactly starting over every single time, adding to the gap between the players.In all this game was a fun concept that was bled dry for every cent they could get and it shows plain as day.

Sure, You can pay for cosmetics and some useful tools. But I havent spent a single dime on this game and I have collected most items in the game. But I do warn you. Don't start playing this if you don't have a disciplined mind. This game will steal all of your time. And most people don't have the strength to pull away. Help me... Help me now...			"

												It's a top-down Bullet Hell MMO, What do you expect?The same damn song loops over and over and over again and never stops.If you die, it's permadeath, all of your loot and levels are gone unless you stored them.You can teleport to other players which 9 times out of 10 leads to your instant demise.And there's pointless microtransactions, you can buy new skins for your character, but like everything else you lose them if you die, making them completely worthless.If they fixed any of this since the last time i played, good for them, but i'm never going to play again.As a side note, no matter what class you pick and what weapon they use, they always shoot. Got a sword? it shoots bullets. Dagger? bullets. Book? bullets.			"

												This game, being one of the available free to play games on the market, looks nice on the outside as it looks like an 8bit MMORPG, but as it turns out, it's much worse than that.You start with 40 Gold, which basically means you can't do or buy anything useful. There are a lot of fancy upgrades available to the player but you need to pay for them in U$D.It's an open world adventure game like Everquest where you explore places and complete quests, but no one tells you what to do or the goal of the game.You have one of 20 choices of characters to choose from, which is only available without paying. My guess is that its main goal is to survive as long as you can. but the enemies' AI system is just horrible. In the tutorial part you are then asked to defeat enemies with godlike aimbot skills. If you die, you start all over again, with a new character.The music in this game is the very same music you hear from the beginning, and it just goes on and on like a loopbox.The chat box is full of spam messages telling you to buy Gold in order to get fance deals.My suggestions: This game needs more detailed instructions as to how the game should be played.My rating: 2/10			"

												Honestly on the outside this game just seemed like another regular 2D pixel game, but my friends insisted that I try it out. I gave it a whirl and I am glad I did. Let me advise you first this game is no short term game, If you are going to play it get yourself fully immersed in it. It has more enemies than you can count, many dungeons that you can explore, way too many items to count, and a friendly community. At first you will try your best get the best gear you can and get to lvl 20 and you will think ""this game Isn't long term I have already finished it,"" your wrong. There are things called stat potions that increase your stats by 1 - 5 depending on the stat potion. This is when you can max your character's stats although, it can be hard to get there without a pet, you will eventually get one that will help you along the way. Now that I am done just rambling on and on about how great it is, GO PLAY IT (never buy items with real money how ever tempting it might seem, it ruins the experience and the game becomes boring). Also, if you need more help I will be on the server USwest2, and I will willing to give you advice. HAVE A GOOD DAY :D !!!!			"

												To sum this game (me in a skype call); Guys i think i'm actually doing well. I'm finally able to solo this abyss and get some decent loot without putting money into it! *server lags, gets stuck into wall and gets gang banged by 6 demons, then dies and loses absolutely everything*To be more detailed, this game is fun if you survive the constant server lag and other stupid bugs. Other wise your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥against a wall by demons. Also, the community is almost♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's full of children (yes this is basically a childs game) who cry to their mommy to put money into it otherwise they'll cut themselves for having a unfair life. I have picked a few out of it who are nice people and want to dungeon, but the game itself makes it impossible to give a good dungeon experience, unless you somehow  manage to what the community calls ""8/8"" which is basically playing non-stop until you finally achieve being a god yourself. But halfway through this you'll probably die from a wall. Even then, you've gone through the hell of having to rely off yourself since this games mostly Solo until your the best of the best (without dying by a wall halfway to 8/8)  you basically will be put in a guild with either children or adults who have also gone through the hell of ROTMG. So this game is addicting and a waste of time unless your like me and have nothing better to do but die by a damn wall. Also, if you have something for stronghold kingdoms, strongholds and this game share the ""Dying is apart of the game"" concept. So if your reading this and are getting ready to install, you'll regret it.-----------------------------------------------EDITED---------------------------------------------------------------------------So realm is the same after playing again for 3 more weeks, but i finally got a 6/8. What i found more disturbing is the community. Either kids who still say noob just to go jerk for the first time, or grown men who spend money on the game because why not. The real challenge realm has, is trying to ignore the community even though alot of the game is in the trade system, which btw is always changing and full of scammers.I think I'm officially done, leaving my character as a cruddy priest who actually has some decent gear, but even then, a garry's mod rp server has a better community than this game.

												A very addictive, hella fun ""bullet hell MMO"" game.  I started almost 4 years ago with this game and I just can't give it up! No matter how frustrating it can get with the ""perma death"" aspect where you lose everything you worked hard for, there'll alway be friends to chill with you/help ya out and when you get good you'll learn to stock up on potions and items that can make ""remaxing"" not such a pain.  The community is generally really nice but it's also full of those not so likeable people which is the case with any game.  Well the second owners of it, Kabam, finally sold it to DECA Games after having a good run with it themselves but eventually losing interest in it and not updating or fixing issues much.  I must say that so far DECA has done a great job with keeping things lively and updated for the players.  Can't wait to see what they'll do to improve the game and I hope they get around to fixing the many connection issues that sometimes plague this game. Highly recommended! Give it a try, you'll probably end up liking it. :)Take care all and hope to cya in-game,Lex			"

												This was an amazing game. Had lots of fun. I played over 200 hours of it with my friends (Browser version) and played it a bit on Steam.Problem is, this WAS an amazing game. Since Kabam bought it, it had turned from F2P to P2W. And is now unplayable without putting any money into it.R.I.P RoTMG			"

												I have been playing this game for four years now. ( I have more hours logged than it shows because I play on Flash projector now ) I've logged probably around 2000 hours. The game is A ton of fun. But it is slowly and sadly dying because no devs work on the game anymore. I just hope they put a dev or two on the game, or sell it to someone who will. Long live rotmg. Get the game, try it out. It's enjoyable. "

												For people thinking about trying this game: If you like RPG's where you can loot up, play with friends and get amazing items as well as drink potions till you max that class and play many classes and rank up on your journeys this is the game for you, but TAKE CAUTION for if you die, you will lose all the items on that character, you can also put items in your vault to keep for future characters. Upgrade pets and teach them to heal you and give you mana, or attack enemies. This is all around one of my most favorite games and I have played over 1,300 hours in under 2 years.			"

												Overview:Pay-to-win, not fun w/out paying, **** the company who made it this way, could be good otherwiseTo store stuff permanetly you have to use real money. Better gear? Real money. Customization? Real money. You can't farm or grind because the one chest you get to store stuff in is only 6 slots or so. There is no way to get in-game currency without paying, so without using alt accounts as chests, there is no way you can actually have fun with this game, especially if you don't want to bother signing in your alt everytime you need a different weapon. If you want to spend money on this game, then it might be more agreeable to you, to everyone else who at least wants SOME chance at getting better than slightly worse than horrible, don't play this game.

												Before you question my sanity: Yes, I have played this for almost 200 hours, as of writing this review. And I do not reccomend it. Why?Well...Realm of the Mad God is obviously a very addicting and fun game, but not for the faint of heart. Basically everything you do in this game is pointless, as eventually you'll die. It's like all the game is about is preparing for other versions of yourself. Which also will be preparing for OTHER versions of yourself.I never really feel like I make progress in the game. And in fact, I don't. Nobody does. Sure, there are new classes to unlock and get better at but it never comes to a conclusion. The only permanent items you can get are basically skins, and because of this the MMO feeling of ""Hell yeah I got a rare item and it's mine forever!"" getting destroyed, the game becomes boring as hell.Combining an MMO with a roguelike, and adding Bullet Hell to that DOES make this game hell of adrenaline rush, but eventually you start to see all the flaws of the concept. They don't fit together at all.Because of all of this, I simply can not reccomend this game. You'll think it's fun at first, but eventually it gets repetitive and boring. Despite all of this, I am probably gonna continue to play anyway. Because it's SO FRICKIN ADDICTIVE.(EDIT: Also, I should mention this game is pay to win. INCREDIBLY pay to win. Simple things, such as creating another character slot or buying storage space even costs real money. Not to mention, the ""Gold"" Currency, which is what you buy with money, can ONLY be achieved by purcashing it. Yep.)TL;DR: Nothing is permanent, you can't make progressOverall Grade(s):At a point when you feel like the game is fun: 8/10At a point when you feel like the game is boring as heck: 1/10			"

												Review from a White star if it matters to anyone :P-Quit for a couple months now-So okay I have 1000+ hours on it on steam alone and afterwards, went to adobe flash projector for a couple hundred hours, so hopefully this review will help many of you decide whether or not you will like this game.This game is permadeath, when you die you lose all your items, equipped/anything in inventory aswell. Game is very hard to pick up, consider looking up guides on YouTube or steam workshop for reference.Pros:Gameplay is extremely addictive! Dying isnt so bad and you ""usually"" learn from your mistakes! (atleast I do)If losing all your ""Precious"" items will be too much for your heart to bear, this is not the game for you. (Permadeath)All of the classes are worth playing, maybe except for a few. As for the community, its up and down. Mostly filled with children. Rare to see anyone over the age 18, so you can imagine what the chat is like. Not saying the community is bad, people will sometimes help you out, and you can make friends via guild system. But most guilds will only invite you if you are actually good at the game, which is cruel, but w.e.Getting loot is so satisfying, especially those yummy white bags.Cons:Event notifierAmount of bots (inevitable in a f2p game, but bearable with the new feature that can auto- hide the chat from low ranked players)I always have a my chat filtered so I only see ranked 10stars or above basically since I hate seeing my chat flooded from either children talking/spamming, or trolls.I don't know if this is still out there but there was this thing that was out that would notify you via realm if there is a special quest of your interest that spawned in. This-was-the-breaking point for me... The times where I would be chilling in my home realm and see (Sphinx/Hermit) I'd be so hyped, nowadays when the event spews out ""A sphinx entered the realm"" atleast 60 people from from other servers drop in to get the chance to get some awesome loot.So onto the hate for the company Kabam...They started up pets which helped alot of new players, but made veteren players very upset. It was a new system that tries to get you to spend your real money on ""feed"" to feed your pets to make them heal you more or make other abilities better. If you have the bank account, you can make this game so easy, that the only way you die is by being extremely dumb, or getting armor broken, or doing very very hard dungeons. Now I do understand the company has to make money to keep the game running so im not upset about what Kabam is doing. There are packs they release that are understandable and pretty tempting to purchase but of course you dont have to. Now If you understand how the game works this game can be played without using your precious money but the most tempting deals would be chests/character slots. Everything else can be avoided, unless you are really bad and need to get the best items to be able to play the game. (I exploit this and load up on pots to buy top items from kids who use parents credit cards to buy items)IN MY HONEST OPINION, Kabam is not a bad company...they need to make money somehow right? If they weren't releasing these items/keys/deals how would this game still be alive?Overall this game is for me was great when it didn't have the event notifiers, but since they are out, the game has been getting worse and worse. There are probably many more cons than the ones I listed but those are the two main ones that upset me.Rate: 5/10Anyone with questions can ask here, im open to all feedback good/bad.			"

												This game WAS good. Then the Kabam nation attacked. They made it severely Pay To Win. When Wild Shadow owned it and oversaw the game, it was great, there was almost no pay to win elements in the game. Now, it is almost like an IOS game that is freemium. Sure, skill is still involved, but you HAVE TO PAY $$$$ to be good. It is literally impossible to be good at this game unless you spend some money. You cannot be nearly decent at this game until you have a few character slots(you start off with one!!!!), a few vault chests(again, you start off with on!!!!), a good pet, and EXPENSIVE items that upgrade that pet. As someone who has let their wallet vomit a bit too much( >100$ spent in game), please for the love of not supporting this disgusting Pay To Win Freemium game model, don't get this game. And if you have it, dont spend $$. If you do, you are telling developers and cash grabbing companies that these kinds of games are okay to create and release to the good folk of the gaming community.			"

												I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. I'll just say that at first. but hear me out.The game is impossibly dificult to unlock other classes, and unless you buy money good gear is hard to get. You'll get torn to shreads with no hope of unlocking the next class. I'll say that if this game had a better way for better gear I would gladly play it more, but I'm not going to suport it unless it changes in some way.			"

												I know people are going to call me some dumb noob complaining about the game because I'm bad at it or something.. but that's fine. They're the type of people who like this game and that's cool. This game is for a different kind of person. I personally didn't like this game because I felt the amount of time it demands is not worth the fun or sense of achievement it offers. You can play on a character for a full year without dying and the end result is still the same. The most you could hope for is getting on the leaderboards. That's the #1 end result to hope for. The rest of it is looking for loot and obsessively maxing your stats. I just don't think that's worth hundreds of hours. Not only that but the game is pretty P2W and that's kinda lame. The one positive is that this game is quite unique and its simplistic design makes it easy to pick up. Overall I give this one a 4/10. Though I'm sure others would tell you this is one of the best games ever made. These are the same people who will consider me a ragenoob.			"

												I told myself that I would never not reccomend a f2p game, unless given serious reason. I've been given serious reason. This game, as it is right now, is playable and there are quite a few fun aspects of it. However, since Kabam bought RotMG, they bought crappy servers so we would die to lag, causing us to do the following:They made the game HEAVILY based on p2w, as you can buy bonus packages containing a ton of crap, the ability to buy ALL OF THE TOPS(for ridiculous amounts of money, and people do it), and then there are also the people illegally selling earned items and accounts within the game. Plus, someone came up with the brilliant idea of an event notifier so there are a ton of people around EVERY boss like the Hermit or Sphinx. They focused on adding more content instead of polishing the content that they have already put out. They added pets into the game, and if you fully level them at legendary(heal and magic heal), you become almsot invincible. Hackers are everywhere, and i havn't seen Kabam do ANYTHING to fix this problem. This game went from a real gem, to THIS. I still play it because, again, there are definitely fun aspects to the game itself. But, if I had 3 wishes to spend on games, I would use one to give Wildshadow back RotMG.			"

												Okay, before I start this review I have but two things to say:-I have very little hours on this account, as this is my alt account, that was made for Csgo.-This review goes a lot off of my personal experiences with this game.Ahh, RotMG... This game kinda brings me a sense of nostalgia... This nostalgia brings on a lot of mixed feelings; I've had some of my best laughs, met new mates and plain and simple, had something to come back to when I was bored.However, I also have bad experiences with this game such as the permanent death feature - don't get me wrong this doesn't make the game it's self bad, it's just not for me personally - which has made some of the angriest and most regretful moments of my gaming life.There's also the pay to win path that I followed for a short while before realising, ""WAIT! I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥and keep dying, why am I spending money on crap I'm gonna lose in 2 days?"". To be fair I DID know that you could get all these items playing legit, but my low level newbie self didn't know how damned easy it was! Like seriously, $12 or something to get a dagger that one, I'm never going to use and two, would take about 1/2 hour of farming to obtain. So yeah, if you are going to play this game, avoid all the equipment shops in the nexus at all costs ;c;Heres one that I've never really seen anyone but myself complain about; the classes are extremely unbalanced. People only ever play knight, warrior, wizard and possibly a dbow archer, with higher level players - unlike myself - having maxed every class, and still choosing to play these characters. Why? WELL, let me explain...Now, I'm pretty sure the original devs of RotMG, Wild Shadow Studios, never intended the game to be like WoW with full on raids and♥♥♥♥♥♥ However, I'm pretty sure they wanted a teamwork element. These teamwork elements do not exist for multiple reasons:-The two classes that have the highest defence in the game, also have some of the highest dps... WTF?!-Kabam added pets which attack enemies, but most importantly; heal, rendering the weaker defence healing classes USELESS!-Private loot. In other words, the classes with the highest dps - which again apart from wizard, have the HIGHEST defence in the game!? - are the only ones to get drops.-Some of the classes are utterly usless to the player, let alone a whole team.It's because of these reasons that people only play high dps classes which are practically invincible, destroying the whole concept of teamwork.Finally, there's the player base. I remember when I was a newb I had a 3/8 come up to me and give me some hydra skin armor. I didn't know what it was worth at the time and i was playing knight, so I couldn't wear it anyway, and my friend offered me a crossbow - a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥item - for this hydra skin - a legendary item to a newb - and being the newbie I was I accepted - the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ XD. Despite looking back fondly on stories like these, people who create stories and friendships in this game no longer exist. Ever since a RotMG YouTuber by the name of Kalle quit the game - the first real major game figure to leave - the whole veteran community left. By that time I was a mid level player, stranded in a waste land of guildless people keeping to themselves and not talking to anyone. As a result, me and my mates slowley started to quit the game.In other words - the friendly community is practically dead ;c;Overall, I did enjoy and make memories on this game, but that was back in the golden days of early 2013. It's the 3/1/2016 as I am writing this - happy late new year everyone! - and I jumped into the game a few weeks ago to see if any of my guildies still played. To my (sarcastic) surprise, the guild was disbanded. I was left a PM on the RotMG forum:""G'day Eoghann how've you been? How's school been or whatever?You know what, I'll cut to it. We've disbanded as a guild due to the sheer lack of enjoyable community. Most of us are moving onto WoW and we were wonding if you'd like to join us? If so, contact me here: *nopenopenopenopenopenope*~Regards, *nopenopenope*""3.5/10			"

This review is created for  My Curation Page.  Skip to the bottom for my Final ThoughtsRealm of the Mad God has always been one of my favorite games to play. I have to admit, I have spent money into the game. No, I didn't regret my purchase for a single second.I've played the game long before it was on Steam, before the Avatar of the Forgotten King and many, many updates before that (too many to remember).Realm of the Mad God is the type of game where you try to quit, but can't. As some people say, you can never quit Realm, it only quits you.GameplayRealm of the Mad God is a free-to-play, MMORPG, bullet hell, rogue-like (the first of it's kind!).Getting into the game is kind of tricky. It's a ""The hell is this?! The hell is that?!"" type of game to get into. But as you progress through the game, you learn your way around the game. Yes, you will die lots and lots of times on your way to the almighty level 20, and many will quit before ever reaching there. But getting to level 20 at last feels like you were destined to get there.Final ThoughtsIn conclusion, Realm of the Mad God is a game you must play, whether you buy Realm Gold or not, Realm of the Mad God is a great game overall.

												Realm of The Mad God is not a game for everyone, it is a grindy game which i usually don't like in a game but this is an acception due to a few reasons1. the community in this game is one of the best i have ever seen in a game2.the constant trading within the main realm3.the tiny steps you slowly progress on with in this gameI started off dieing at level 5 every time and i quit but a few days later i came back and died some more but the third time i got to level 20 and i was on top of the moon and then thought what now? Then i realized the full depth of the games with the godlands then the dungeons then the tier 4 dungeons and i fell in love with this game. ever since i could not get enough of this gameI would recommend this game for people who enjoy the little things in life and don't mind dieing a bit to get there			"

												I know it may seem like I have no hours, but in reality, I have at least spent 1000 hours on this game in browser. This was one of the best games at the time with variety, but now everything is corrupt. It used to be, play for a while to get good with somewhat good stuff, but now, rich noobs can just buy the highest tier weapon and armor, or even just go on a website that constantly spams to get a maxed out character. With no experience what so ever, they can ravage the community easily and destroy pretty much anything easily. After the update, I wont recommend at all.			"

												Cons about playing this game-rampant spambots-rampant hackers-rampant scammers-nothing done about any of the above-paying to have more than one character slot-paying to have more than 8 item storage-half of the character selection screen is the week's advertisement (WOW! 10 ambrosia for only 90 US dollars!)-inactive company posts on forums-fame (the earnable currency) has literally 2 uses: pet feeding and guild upgrades-its marketed like its not a P2W-highly unbalanced pet system-the only way you can actually start having any lasting fun in this game without spending money is making multiple accounts-most recent update's only purpose was to render an item unusable because it was being exploited (so take that as you will)Pros of playing this game-its crack-literall crack-really the concept of the game is actaully pretty great but all the cons get in the way of truly enjoying itThe reason I am making this review now is that, before, the game was relatively tolerable but now the quality of co-players has just degenerated completely to the point where there are as many hacking players are there are legitamate players and Kabam has done, and will continue to do, nothing about it.

												I enjoyed this game for the very short time I was able to play it.I'm giving a bad review because of a game-breaking bug leaving myself, and many other players stuck out of the game, completely unable to play.The developers are aware of the bug at this point, and after having many conversations with support about the issue, it seems that they simply don't care.The bug in question, is getting stuck on the black screen with the grey 'Loading' ribbon across the bottom. Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.To this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, Kabam, you're only harming yourself through losing potential customers.

												so after Kabam was done with their♥♥♥♥♥♥and finally left, i decided to try this game out again and rewrite my review.well first of all, the Community has changed. A LOT. when i first played this game, it was full of exploiting trolls who loved seeing people die with their 1000 fame or more characters.now theyre just ♥♥♥♥ing gone. i dont know what happened, but for once i can finally play without a troll following me with a thousand mobs behind him.random people may teleport to you when youre low-level and offer you trades, accept them. its free♥♥♥♥♥♥most of the time xDGuilds became much more organized, even though theres still people spamming invites in the godlands.to be completely honest, this is one of the best communities i have ever seen.if you need help all you gotta do is ask.next up, FINALLY a Friends tab was added. since people in-game have different nicknames from their Steam accounts, it wasnt too easy to find eachother on Steam if you want to play with someone again. ive met a few great people through RotMG.the new dev team is trying to make this game as less pay2win as possible, even though you can still buy OP items by donating, you can get sliiiightly weaker items just by playing normally. with the only pay2win thing being Character Slots (you only start with one) and Vault Chests (you only start with one as well, letting you keep only 6 items in the Vault.)in other words, buying gear with real money is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useless since you have to unlock Vault Chests and Character Slots.wait wut? you dont even know this game at all?okay, let me explain.its a Perma-Death game. you lose EVERYTHING when you die. except pets, skins, unlocked Classes and gear you store in the Vault.the Gear in this game is divided by Tiers, you start from lvl 1 by killing weak mobs, getting T1/T2 stuff, then moving on further into the island where theres harded mobs that drop T3/T4 stuff, etc.theres an Ultimate Tier, which doesnt always mean that its better than the normal tiers (max normal Tier is 12). Ultimate Tier gear has special abilities with it, such as shooting Presents instead of Magic Bolts, or a ring that upgrades 2 different stats instead of 1.there is a TON of different classes, each player to their own. there are close/medium/long ranged classes. each with their own abilities, my favourite being the Rogue and Sorcerer.previously id give this game a 4/10, but now i give it an 8.5/10 for the huge improvements.look, i know the game's graphics and animations look simplistic as ♥♥♥♥, but trust me, thats one of the reasons that make it great.

												This has got to be one of my favorite free to play MMOs of all time. It has great coop gameplay which relies on skill to stay alive, and staying alive is very important because it is a PERMADEATH game. It runs in Flash, so its compatible with almost all systems. The graphics are a retro pixelated masterpiece and will definitely bring on the nostalgia. The game has no ending, making it very addictive. This game is still being updated regularly and new content is being added all the time. There are 14 classes to unlock, loads of items to be found, dungeons for all skill levels, and a guild system to help encourage cooperation.This game is also full of bugs that are difficult to fix, given the nature of the coding. The bugs aren't game-breaking but can get annoying at times. There is an unsolvable issue with memory leaks that will force you to restart the game every hour or so. Spambots advertise for websites that sell items illegally. Do not buy anything from them. The items they sell can be farmed in the game without spending any money. There is a trading system which you can use to buy, sell, trade, or gift items with other players. Do not spend money on items, it is a waste!Some people, including myself, experience a bit of lag when playing the Steam version of this game. If you have issues such as input delay, I encourage you to give it another shot by playing it at its home, www.realmofthemadgod.com.With all that in mind, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and support its development by buying extra vault space and character slots. I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill based shooters and MMORPGs. Did I mention its FREE?!Update: Since I quit playing RotMG regularly, a lot has changed. The old management is out and new people have taken their place and seem to be doing much better. They seem to make much better use of their resources and have their priorities in a much better order. The game and owners/developers are making much needed progress and deserve a little recognition.			"

												It's a fun game , it's permadeath , but you have a vault where you can put stuff for your characters if you die. Only one chest if you're F2P like me. The game itself is hard and requires some getting used to. Dying is normal in the game, every character dies eventually, even if you have the best armors and weapons and you're maxed and have a legendary pet.So buckle up for this 2d bullet-hell farmfest , where you farm for gear and potions, which you will lose eventually.

												Meh. They really need to have ""meh"" as an option. After playing this game for 6 hours I still have no strong feelings or opinions one way or the other.On the bright side this game is fast and frantic, you're not held down by all the tedious things that most games will bog you down with. There's pvp, co-op, all that stuff as well.The down side? 200% pay2win. Most games will have two forms of curreny: An in-game system and a ""special"" currency you have to buy with real-world money. There's absolutely no way of earning any money in this game, none, no monsters will ever drop so much as a single coin for you. Buy, buy, buy. That is the ONLY way of making any money in this game.Oh and just to make things more ""fun"" (for the game devs) it's perma-death pay2win. Let's say you spent $500 on your character and then die? Sucks to be you, everything is gone, buy it all over again. Whatever fun I may have by playing this is balanced out by my unwillingness to invest any real money into this game. The end result is me being perfectly neutral towards this game. I can easily just give this game a thumbs down right now, but I'm feeling generous.By the way this game has nothing to do with Legends Of Yore or Hack Slash Loot, I made that mistake too. The graphics are just public domain or something. (Probably a game making engine.)			"

												2012 review:AMAZING game!!! First ever truly FREE game, where supporting the creators doesn't give you an unfair advantage. Very good game!2016:So yea.. that was awhile go wasn't it? Alot has changed.... for the worse.The game is not truly 'free' anymore, there are numerous pay2win factors in the game. The game is still good and fun at times but it has some serious issues.I pretty much quit, I come online now and then to run a couple dungeons and then I'm off. Sometimes I go for longer when I decide to stream abit.I feel like this game does not deserve any players and should just die off already. What kabam is doing to the players and the game is horrible. From reading the forums you see alot of people that are done with the game. They either want to quit or ask questions about the longevity of this game. And there's certain people that keeps feeding the community this idea that as long as you support the game (buy gold) it will not shut down.Now maybe this is correct, but I dont think we should promote and feed such a company.They have literally done nothing for the past like year?No new content or adaptations of dungeons, no promised changes. And dont even bring up the 'that was another team'. If they trash ideas, communicate this.It's ridiculous how infested with cheaters this game is. I bet over 50% of the players are cheaters or have cheated at one point to build up their accounts.Not to mention the game being overrun with multiboxers.I think people go easy on kabam because of their love for this game. The game is good and enjoyable. But it is also an MMO, and such games require maintenance and regular updates to keep stuff fresh and exciting.I'm getting the same vibes when hacking first became visible widely and people just basically ignored it because it did not hurt them. And look where we are now.Yes they have put on some sort of fix for event notifiers. But not after ALOT of complaints, we can wake them up if we really want them to.I'm truly amazed at the people that can still religiously play this game every day. How do you not become bored after an hour?Is it because you are addicted? Have nothing else to play? Because trust me, there are ALOT of great games out there with developers that DO care.Of course we do not KNOW what is up with kabam, maybe they are rewriting the entire game?But the fact remains, there is no communication whatsoever. And they've basically let the game run on autopilot.So if you want to play a bullet hell, permadeath mmo then by all means play this game. The game is still good and you can do fine without buying gold. But I will also tell you to not get invested in this game, it honestly does not deserve your time. Once you've reached the endgame stuff will become stale rapidly. If you can endure the cheaters and multiboxers and lack of communcation/updates from the developers that is.DECA has taken over from Kabam now.So far it seems to be going in the right direction. They have fixed a duping exploit fairly quickly and made some additions to the game suggested by the players. Let's hope they keep this up.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is both one of the best games I've ever played and one of the worst. I first started playing the game in April of 2012 with a couple of friends. Initially, I wasn't hooked—pixel graphics, permadeath, MMO, bullethell...none of them exactly appealed to me. I drove the game from my mind completely. But a few days later, in a bout of extreme boredom, I decided to hop into the game. Gave myself a name—Nathansbud—and hopped into the fray. And by God, it was FUN! Sure, I was horrible, but that didn't stop me from having a great time running around the lowlands. After that point, I was hooked through and through. I played the game for nearly a year without really getting ""good"" in the least, until I finally maxed my first character (which can be accomplished by drinking enough stat pots to hit the max, items which drop from a variety of enemies and dungeons), an Archer. I had this character for months, and it ended up being my first character to hit 5 Stars, or 2000 fame (experience, essentially). Fast forward to now, 4.5 years into playing Realm of the Mad God (with a year break in between). The game has had its ups and downs, good times and bad, some overtly P2W features were implemented at times, but all in all, the game is certainly worth picking up and playing. And if you do end up giving it a shot (which you should, as the game is free), shoot me a PM. I'm Nathansbud in game.Overall: 9/10			"

												This game has been my favourite game for the past 5 years and still to this day has been able to keep me intertained and in love with this game. Even after losing the best charecteur you've had yet, this game can and will bring you back to it. There is never a dull moment and always has room to improve. This is a massive game that has survived for many of years and it will be obvious to see why that is. Whether you just died on your by far best charecter or have just started playing for the first time, this game will always give you the need to come back and play. This is an amazing game that I would easily recommend to all types of gamers.			"

												RotMG is an MMORPG where the player is thrown into a wide world where everyone just wants to hurt you. Why? No idea. I was too lazy to read the lore that we have posted on our lovely site of RealmEye. However, the overall game is a great concept, where you slowly get better, pick up items, drink potions to increase your stats, and then.. well.. die. If permadeath games trigger your anger senses this game isn't for you. But, if you love grinding (stats that is) and watching yourself get better slowly over time, then this game is a great choice.With a new company in place, we are going to be seeing a new era as the game changes to their views. It's a great time to start playing as Month of the Mad God, a celebration of the game's release, is in place.			"

												Of course I recommend this game, no really, join us in the game where you die, over and over. And over. And over.And over ∞Yeah.But really, for a game where you lose your character and their items on death, it's somehow a great game, and you keep playing, suffering, farming, and dying on the inside every time your pixelated character gets sent to their grave.So yeah, all that and stuff. But here's the thing I wanted to say:Realm of the Mad God went through a time when it was new and great, owned by... Wildshadow? Correct me if I'm wrong... but anyway, after that it went through stages and then wh-KABAM. (The game was bought by Kabam, literally) And so then the game went through a time when it was still 'okay' but a great deal of players were not liking the money-grabbing Kabam people, and the changes they were making, so the reviews went a bit sour.But this year (2016) it was handed over/bought (However you want to put it) to DECA GAMES, which plans on 'making RotMG great again!' and I think they just might. [Almost] Anything's better than Kabam!So yes, there are nasty reviews still left over from the Kabam age, and changes yet to be made in-game.There has never been a better time to join than now! And I know, because I started playing during the Kabam age on Kongregate. It's only getting better!#MakeThisGameGreatAgain @DECA GAMES			"

												Kabam rigged this like a demolitions expert.Let me elaborate. This was a nice local resturant, with a speciality meal hardly seen before.It was a mix of rogue-like and bullet hell. There were bullets everywhere and if you couldn't handle the heat, it was back to the start. But starting over isn't all bad. You got fame, a currency that could be used on goods to get yourself running hotter. You could also unlock new classes for a spin on the taste. It was a nice resturant, filled with a jovial atmosphere.But then the owner handed it over to a rather greedy man.Now it is a pit of money and shame, filled with people looking to scam and the food reminicent of a fast food resturant.Nobody was happy, but the owners.

												I played this game a year or two ago without much interest for it. After being away from home for the past month, I decided I would give this game another try.When I started playing again I never saw myself sitting down and dedicating 12 straight hours playing this game. It's simple, fun, and an amazing time burner to play with friends that still requires some skill and hard work. In one day I burned through 10 new characters in frustration from my own mistakes, but I kept coming back again and again to try and set a record for myself. This easy to play hard to master game had me strategizing with friends, each death and fame earned a lerning experience for me to improve.In the past two years the community has changed drastically. Yes, you will always find that one or two guys arguing and causing problems between eachother, but collectively the attitude has improved. Before, it was rare to find help unless you had things to bargain with. Now, right from the Nexus people are giving away free T5 weapons and armor to help new players make their way.Overall, this game has my respect. For whatever it's worth to you, I highly reccomend you give this game a shot.			"

												{Rant} Game used to be one the most fun games I will ever have played but new developers have ruined it to its core. Too many micro-transactions and a lot of focus on paying to win basically. Pets are the key to survival which are insanely hard to get up to speed without farming trench's or etc. for a long time without paying money. And all new dungeons, and items, and in general game updates are focused around spending money for top tier gear whether it be the mystery box with a low chance for an extreme payout, or buying ""tops"" straight up. 8 ""8/8's"" no longer feels like I earned it since anyone can buy tops and farm fairly easily (but most likely die and give me a good laugh), UT's drop frequently and the game just feels like a massive, overpowering player base with no challenge any longer (especially with pets) and is just a waste of time to farm.{Summary}Large changes such as UT's being non-tradeable or the disappearance of amulets is not what ruined the game, it's the most recent p2w schemes, aka mystery box of profit that tear away from the core point of farming and finally having the RNG in your favor for that moment when you've achieved a great set after good work, not having exclusive items in the mystery box that won't be in a dungeon for 3 months...{Suggestion}I love Warframe and League of Legends, for some reason a LOT of RoTMG players left for league, not sure why but I was hooked also so check them out, realm is just not worth the time any longer. And Warframe gives a perfect feel for the payout for time you put in farming, very Face of Mankind esque but updated constantly and very satisfying to play unlike another great games downfall.(The Big Lebowski)Has the world gone crazy?Seen too many games go to♥♥♥♥♥♥...

												Seeing that this game had no kind of formal review by anyone seemingly experienced. I decided I'd take it upon myself to do one. I don't know if you've noticed but I've put more than my fair share of time into this game.To start the controls are as simple as they get, they typical moving, shoot by clicking the mouse (there is an autofire button if you're lazy.) and aiming. Simple enough right? Wrong.The whole charm of this game is the fact that it is permadeath. You spend a lot of time with one character just to have him and all of your hard earned items flushed down the toilet as you look at the death screen with your jaw dropped. I cannot tell you how many times I have done this myself. Just because you made one little mistake. And in this game there are plenty of mistakes to be made. But the whole thing that makes it great it the fact that the better you are. The more time and resources you put into your character the more devastating it is. But the whole point is the game doesn't baby you. It's quite comparable to Dark Souls or Demon Souls in this aspect. You run through a quick tutorial and are put in the middle of everything where you have no idea what to do or where to go from there.People claim there are some pay to win elements in the game, which quite honestly yes is slightly true. But if you wait to get good at the game and enjoy a game that isn't babying you through it, you won't mind shelling out $10-20 for a few chests or character slots.Skins, Items, Keys, and the newly added Mystery Box are a different story however. (I typically buy these with gold laying around after I buy chests and whatnot.) Anyhow to sum it up. This is a great game. There is always something to do. Always something to challenge you. And nothing there to baby you. And please to avoid starting off bad with the veteran community. Don't beg for items. Good luck.			"

												Ive played this game for years on kongregate, and when I saw it on steam, I downloaded it immediatly. This is a great RPG game that makes you collect, and better yourself with quests and loot. However, this is a game where you may need friends to make it an enjoyable experience. You can lock onto your friends and teleport to them so you never lose them. I strongly suggest getting this game, if you have a friend or two to play it with.			"

												Don't get me wrong, at the early stages of this game it was great fun to run around with your friends, loot, clear dungeon, and kill Oryx. However, since late 2013 when Kabam came to ownership the game became extremly P2P.  If you want to ever get anywhere in the game you have to buy multiple character and vault chests so that you have backup characters and loot. Vault chests only hold 8 items and cost 5 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars a piece. Aswell as making most legendery loot hard as ♥♥♥♥ to obtain, they took out trading of UT items, So once you get the legendary loot if its not for your class you're SOL.  My reccomendation is to avoid playing this until Kabam lifts their P2P hammer.			"

												It's my favourite. The graphics are very well done; so well done, my eyes were baptized upon seeing the amazing quality this game has provided. Along with graphics, the definite story-line was amazing. The final boss was so well designed using his amazing powers such as shooting rectangular and circular pixels. The difference between the bosses and normal monsters is that bosses shoot more and do more damage. I thought this was a well-thought and creative attribute, providing originality. The characters produced were also fantastic, not being the most generic characters at all. Characters such as ""mage"" and ""knight"" were concepts I wish other games would use. The characters were 100% unique and never before seen in any other game. Overall a very creative game.  5/5 stars for sure, without a doubt.			"

It's not a ""play-to-win"" game, you can get those items like ever (via trading/grinding). If you spend money, I recommend something useful, like chests/character slots.			"

												Ive played this game for years on kongregate, and when I saw it on steam, I downloaded it immediatly. This is a great RPG game that makes you collect, and better yourself with quests and loot. However, this is a game where you may need friends to make it an enjoyable experience. You can lock onto your friends and teleport to them so you never lose them. I strongly suggest getting this game, if you have a friend or two to play it with.			"

												Seeing that this game had no kind of formal review by anyone seemingly experienced. I decided I'd take it upon myself to do one. I don't know if you've noticed but I've put more than my fair share of time into this game.To start the controls are as simple as they get, they typical moving, shoot by clicking the mouse (there is an autofire button if you're lazy.) and aiming. Simple enough right? Wrong.The whole charm of this game is the fact that it is permadeath. You spend a lot of time with one character just to have him and all of your hard earned items flushed down the toilet as you look at the death screen with your jaw dropped. I cannot tell you how many times I have done this myself. Just because you made one little mistake. And in this game there are plenty of mistakes to be made. But the whole thing that makes it great it the fact that the better you are. The more time and resources you put into your character the more devastating it is. But the whole point is the game doesn't baby you. It's quite comparable to Dark Souls or Demon Souls in this aspect. You run through a quick tutorial and are put in the middle of everything where you have no idea what to do or where to go from there.People claim there are some pay to win elements in the game, which quite honestly yes is slightly true. But if you wait to get good at the game and enjoy a game that isn't babying you through it, you won't mind shelling out $10-20 for a few chests or character slots.Skins, Items, Keys, and the newly added Mystery Box are a different story however. (I typically buy these with gold laying around after I buy chests and whatnot.) Anyhow to sum it up. This is a great game. There is always something to do. Always something to challenge you. And nothing there to baby you. And please to avoid starting off bad with the veteran community. Don't beg for items. Good luck.			"

Posted: July 28, 2016
												RotMG has had something of a checkered past. From it's storied inception at the hands of indie dev Wildstorm Studios to it's dubious sale to Kabaam, and now this latest chapter as the game is once again sold to Deca Games. Let's be clear. The time with Kabaam were some dark days. But it speaks to the resiliency and devotion of the fanbase/community that so many players soldiered on through the bad times and stayed with this game for so long. Kabaam's handling of bugs and duping was poor. Really poor. One of the biggest issues when I last player the game about two years ago was that the ""Amulet of Resurrection""... the only item in the game that could save your character if it was ""killed"" was normally a very expensive and difficult to acquire item. But so many people were duping them that the in game economy was flooded with them and no one was dying. Turn and churn is a really big part of this game so when no one dies the game stagnates. Kabaam handled this complex issue with a sledgehammer turning all the amulets into ""Amulets of Zombification."" I personally felt violated. They went into my vault inventory and took items I had earned and replaced them with something far inferior without asking me or discussing it with me. I was already furious. Then they completely botched their communication with the community. Telling us that this new amulet had a 5% chance of turning your character into a Zombie and thus... failing to save it. When your character is dead in RotMG it's dead. Nothing is saved.  So when you lose a maxed character with great gear it's a big deal to a lot of players. And it turned out that the Amulet that was supposed to only have a 5% chance of letting us die was in fact about 95%. Everyone started dying and turning into zombies. I lost a maxed 8/8 Huntress that turned into a Zombie and I was furious. I walked away from the game and hardly looked back despite having three other maxed characters. Time passed. Kabaam eventually created a pet system to replace the Amulet. No your pets can't save you if you die. But by grinding and grinding you can create a pet so powerful that bosses and dungeons that were super dangerous are far less so. But other than the introduction of a lot of new dungeons and content that seems to be the end of Kabaam's major changes. And bugs and duping have persisted this entire time.For example there's a bug that if you try and drag an item into your inventory and someone else snags the item (often with the reviled ""auto pickup"" programs that many players now must use to compete with multi-boxers and hackers) before you get it all the way into your inventory it creates a ""ghost"" of that item. This ghost will not disappear. And it can block and make useless as many as four inventory slots. And with only 8 slots on the base character that can really hamper your ability to pick up items. What's worse the ""ghost"" cannot be dispelled without reloading the program entirely. Merely going to the Nexus, your vault or changing realms works. The item ""ghost"" even persists in the loading screen. And while I understand this was done to fix a duping bug a better solution SURELY should have been found in the two years that have passed since I first encountered it. But despite these issues RotMG is one of the most consistently fun and addicting games I've ever played. And with the sale to Deca games there's hope that their profession of being fans and devotees of the game themselves will lead to long needed fixes and improvements. For example, there's no way to play fullscreen. The game was originally designed to play on a small computer monitor inside a web browser and that initial design has never been improved upon. Despite the game being years old and being passed to it's 3rd developer and losing a lot of its playerbase there is still no way to play it full screen. In Steam you can stretch the window to make it bigger than the tiny default window... but beware, because if you don't keep the aspect ratio correct... and there is no way to constrain it, you can throw off the way the game is presented to you. The best case scenario is some menus will only present half their information and some ads may block your inventory. The worst case is thinking there is a monster in a certain spot when it is actually a bit closer to you and to the left. It can get you killed if you aren't careful.Another issue is the HP and Mana Pots. Not the stat pots but the blue and red potions that you use to replenish lost HP or magic power while in a fight. Initially Kabaam, in a rather blatant money grab, made it so when you ran out of these pots and hit the hot key to use one the system would automatically take five ""Gold"" (the in game currency that is purchased for real world money) and sell you the pot instead of telling you that you were out. After much furor from the community Kabaam implemented an off switch for this in the controls. However I have found that if you do shut off auto purchasing these pots and then hit the hot key when you are out of them and in a fight a large UI box pops up, covering much of your fighting area, and asking you if you want to buy the pot for 5 gold as you are out. It's horrifying. It almost got my 8/8 Knight killed twice in a five minute period. Really freaked me out and it's a really poor implementation. Additionally I'd say there are issues altogether with the way these pots are sold. Mana and HP Pots are super easy to get. A high level character is so powerful that the low level mobs that drop them get mowed down like bowling pins by maxed out characters. Yet it can be time consuming and annoying to be farming baby mobs just so you have a bit of healing and magic replacement for the dungeons and big fights you actually want to be doing as a maxed character. And purchasing these pots at 5 Gold is a ridiculous and usurious price to charge for something so easily obtained and unimportant to the game. It's like charging a person for putting air in their tires. Sure there are coin operated air compressors but I have yet to run into a service station that doesn't simply turn it on for free. Because while we all realize you need air in your tires it isn't something of great value or scarcity. The same goes for these pots. They are neither valuable nor scarce but you need them. And high level players wasting time scouring the land for them is sort of silly. My hope is that this new owner, Deca Games; in addition to making many other improvements and bug fixes, sees the wisdom in reducing the price for these items and encouraging their use at the same time. For example you can carry up to six of each of these pots for a total of twelve. Can you imagine how much more gold Deca would sell and how more often these micro purchases would be made if they simply offered to top your inventory off for one gold? Imagine... you're going out to the realm and you want to head to the god lands or someone is opening a dungeon in the Nexus. You hit a button and for one gold you get your HP and Mana pots inventory filled up. I'd do this at least once almost every time I played. Probably for multiple characters. Right now gold is roughly 100 to 1 in real world to in game value. So one dollar US is equal to 100 Gold. So at the current rate buying HP and Mana pots to fill your inventory of six each would cost a staggering sixty cents. More than half a dollar for something so unimportant. Thus I and most players have NEVER purchased them. But if it was 1 gold to fill er up. You bet your♥♥♥♥♥I'd use it. Deca Games is doing a lot of giveaways and has proclaimed this and the following four weeks the ""Month of the Mad God."" There's a lot of celebrating and they've done an excellent job of energizing and motivating the community on social media. Lets hope that energy carries over to improvements and new content for the game. But even if it doesn't. RotMG is crazy fun.			"

												A narrative review of such a memorable game...Realm of the Mad God or ROTMG combines a bullet hell experience with loot galore, infused with an retro 8 bit art stylew ith the soon to love repetitive theme tune... Your thrown straight into to ""realms""  of the game after a stress free tutorial. Free to roam around the games enviroment being spawned into a beach type enviroment. One either treks inland or finds the function of teleport on the map and clicks towards the center of the map. Then the first grey screen hits you. You have been killed by...(insert reason here, most likey gelatinious cube or dank oh no its a tree). Then one is probably gripped onto the fully realised experience of perma-death mechanics within the game and perhaps either addicted/hooked to the progression that one can achieve-the mighty challenge. Or straight out ""I quit"". Although the idea of returning might come apparent.After a few hours one will aqcuire the knowledge of peer to peer trading, the meeting of the varied community presented, ""beggers"" who play the game to ask for items, and the meeting of the grim reaper ;) and the surface of the ROTMG experience. Digging below that surface will come the  many dungeouns and events and of course facing Oryx-the mad god.  Or throw your wallet at the screen and buy the gold purchasable items for real money...but the satisfaction of such would be nill. Pets also fit under the pay to win section in some essence as your realise bringing up a pet is new entire game in itself. Vaults and character slots will need to be purchased with gold as well. So non-buyers may struggle. The game is frustrating, annoying and depressing after death. Yet dancing in the ""Realms of the Mad Gods"" is seen super fun, especially in those naive exploring stages. I think many past and present players will be able to relate and agree. Who knew death could be so gripping.			"

												I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games. They took charge and started working on the game again. Here's what they've done so far: 1. Spam bots are completely gone, and some of the multi-boxers and hackers are gone.2. Brought back life into the game by bringing the community together for a big celebration of Month of the Mad God.3. Gave out free rewards to those active in the community. With Events and such.Pros: 1. Very rewarding, Challenging dungeons give the better loot.2. Good community on reddit and mostly in-game too.3. A Star ranking system based off how many class challenges you've completed by hard earned, long lived characters.4. DEATHLY addictive. (sorry)Cons:1. P2W, buying (gold) will allow you to get some of the best gear.2. Difficult, hard to get used to dieing. (Even thought its part of the game)3. Until recently, the game had a bad owner, Game is recovering.I recommend this game, 7.9/10 :^)			"

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is an incredibly addicting game which features perma-death. Whilst many dislike losing everything upon death, it's also a very rewarding game. When you start up it is quite difficult, but the more you play, the better you get. You eventually learn tactics and figure out the best course of action for you and your character. It's important to focus both long-term and short-term, as anything could happen at any given time. Being reckless is one of the main reasons why people lose characters, so it's important to always stay calm. Don't let your greed for loot get in the way of your character's safety. I personally enjoy RotMG because it allows me to do whatever I want. If I want to feed and upgrade my pet, I do that. If I want to max a knight or a mystic, I do that. If I want to do dungeons, I do that.			"

												i like this game alot and i would spend more time with it if it were not a pay to win game. that being said it removes the need for actual skill and effort if you will just throw a few dollars there way and if you dont oyu can sit there and grind for hours. in the tow hours i played i got about 30 gold and to get new charecters its around 900 gold a charecter. i wish i could love this game but i simply cant im not spending money on a free game that isnearly impossible to progress in without spending money.

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is an incredibly addicting game which features perma-death. Whilst many dislike losing everything upon death, it's also a very rewarding game. When you start up it is quite difficult, but the more you play, the better you get. You eventually learn tactics and figure out the best course of action for you and your character. It's important to focus both long-term and short-term, as anything could happen at any given time. Being reckless is one of the main reasons why people lose characters, so it's important to always stay calm. Don't let your greed for loot get in the way of your character's safety. I personally enjoy RotMG because it allows me to do whatever I want. If I want to feed and upgrade my pet, I do that. If I want to max a knight or a mystic, I do that. If I want to do dungeons, I do that.			"

												To be honest if there was an option of recomending it and not, i would choose that. I mean this game is just that to me, 50/50. See, let me start off by saying i played this on Kong back in  October of 2011, loved it. A few laggy moments but that was because of an overloaded server (which is very unlikely to happen). Than summer of 2012 came. And oh boy, did it start to change. I have been noticing the monoplizing of the market place, everything was very steeply priced, and i couldn't afford it. So i played as a noob for about a year or so. Left ROTMG, left Kong. And came to steam. And then i found ROTMG, i was exstatic. It was very nostalgic for me. But then i noticed the market, it got HUGE, little portals to smaller markets, eggs, food, and dungeon keys, it was very surreal. And then i finally gave in, and bought some vaults (because i started getting good and had little to no area to put my loot). Big mistake, that was when Kabam milked my steam wallet dry. I mean it was my decision, but my back was against the wall, the game that i loved back then, or other games. And that is why i don't recomend ROTMG, it started out play to win, now its just pay to win. 4.5/10			"

												Boring top down shooter meets mmo hybrid.At least it's not a point and click hitscan game, but it feels like there's almost no design to the gameplay (either in the maps or the random enemies, whom you all fight pretty much the same). The combat doesn't even feel like a shooter, as it often rewards just staying away from enemies rather than skillfully dodging and weaving through enemy attacks.Like all MMO's it supposedly gets better, but even people who have stuck with it tell me that it's ultimately more of a WoW style loot farming game than a true action experience. So if the ""shmup mmo hybrid"" got you excited, you might want to check your enthusiasm in my oppinion.			"

												I know everyone is Upset with the Pay2Win mechanics of the game, but I assure you the game is still fun. Most people who pay for their gear arent the greatest and will eventually die with it anyway. Playing through the game and getting better with each dungeon will tone your skills. I have only ever spent money on some extra vault space and character slots with the Noob pack, 200 hours of Game play and I am using the top tier loot and have leveled my own pet up without paying. Don't blame those who Pay2Win as a reason for ruining the game. I do think Kabam should remove Tops from the store though.			"

												I am a very old payer of this game, ever since WildShadow owned it and there was the old forums. This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus. It's ♥♥♥♥ed up.Unless you're rich as ♥♥♥♥ and don't care about money, don't get this game.			"

												One of the most greedy companies out there, Kabam, has FINALLY sold this game to a new and much more promising one: DECA games. This is somewhat of a godsend if you ask me, as Kabam had given up on the game a while ago and weren't active at all. In the short time that DECA has been at the steering wheel, they have already made miracles happen and shown that they aren't afraid to take the game down for a day while fixing a few things. This proves that they're capable of changing things Kabam didn't care about and that they are quick to act when crisis strikes.Due to Kabams inactivity, they game had slowly began to die out and lose most of its dedicated players. With DECA, the game has been revived, and A LOT of players have returned. The future is bright for the Realm.			"

												I'm gonna make this short. I sadly can't recommend this game on the basis that it's a P2P (Pay to Play) disguised as a F2P (Free to Play). Most of the good items in this game are in the store, which you can only buy with gold. But the only way to get gold is to buy it with actual money from your account. And no, there isn't anyway to earn gold in the actual game. If you aren't the kind that's willing to spend money to get the good items, then chances are you won't enjoy this game (or at least not as much as you should).			"

												I'm gonna make this short. I sadly can't recommend this game on the basis that it's a P2P (Pay to Play) disguised as a F2P (Free to Play). Most of the good items in this game are in the store, which you can only buy with gold. But the only way to get gold is to buy it with actual money from your account. And no, there isn't anyway to earn gold in the actual game. If you aren't the kind that's willing to spend money to get the good items, then chances are you won't enjoy this game (or at least not as much as you should).			"

												Okay, this is a tricky game to review, so bear with me.     The people think that the game is just ""pay to win"" now aren't exactly right.  Of course there is still buying items and you can't get some items without buying them with USD or other currency, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have to buy the items to have fun in the game.  You can have just as much fun without buying items.      Second, you can't just play this game for 5 minutes, die by a sumo wrestler and review this game bad.   You cannot be good at this game in a whiff, practice is needed       Some people seem to forget the difference between a terrible game and a really hard game.  This is not a terrible game.  Kabam has not ruined this game, they have just tried their best to make a profit on Realm of the Mad God, because they bought it, you think it's going to be cheap buying a popular game?       Anyways, it has mindless fun.  Once you become good with this game, it gets fun doing the events like the Lord of the Lost Lands, and see the new dungeons like the Ice Cave and the Puppet Master's Theater (yeah, you like those dungeons don't you guys, they were from KABAM!)  And the most satisfying moment is when you go to a dungeon hoping for something rare and   you get what you want.   It is so satisfying.    The features of the game  Vault      In this game, when you die, you die forever, and you have to make another character, and you know what that means.  Anything that your character died with, goes away,   FOREVER    The vault, is a place where you can safely store your items so when your character dies, or has a full inventory, they can put the items in the vault.  The vault is the same size as the character's inventory (8) and each account starts out with one vault.   Pets      This sometimes gets some hate.  Pets are little creatures that hatch from  Pet Eggs [www.realmeye.com]  Each pet has different abilities, some being able to heal your magic power or health points.  Some people say that it makes the character Paladin render useless.  You can feed pets, and the more feed power the weapon, the higher level abilities they gain.  Pets' tiers are common, uncommon, rare, legendary, and divine.  It is extremely hard to even get your pet to legendary without buying pet food, which has a lot of feed power for money.   Character Slots      If you're playing this game, and you're tired of playing the same character, but you don't want to kill your current one because he has good loot or he has  maxed a stat. [www.realmeye.com]  Character slots are right down your alley.  Character slots, (for realm gold, which requires money) allow you to have more than one character alive at the same time.  Each time you buy a slot, the price goes up a little bit, so don't waste all your money at once! The bottom line      Realm of the Mad God has a lot of great gameplay and features, but it has lost a lot of players due to Kabam making the game supposedly ""pay to win.""			"

												This used to be a fun game back when it came out but it is showing its age now.Realm is a bullet hell game with perma-death! Mess up once and you are done for my friend, it is all the way back to the beginning with you, or is it? Well yes it is but let me explain. You can go anywhere at anytime and reaching the level cap is not very difficult so end game revolves around maxing your character via potions that increase your stats.Get enough potions and you will max all your stats and that is it, nothing left to do. Or at least it was until pets were added and pets last between deaths so that was a welcomed addition but honestly the game is solely about min-maxing and once you have done that their is nothing left to do. This is compounded by the fact that not only does maxing your stats take a very long time but the dungeons you run to get the potions to max your stats are usually pretty lethal so you will rage quit quite a few times when your 4/8 character dies. I had fun with the game originally but I used joy2key to make the game playable with a controller and that was very imperfect but I found it a step up from the default control scheme and that is a big reason I don't recommend the game.The screen is extremely zoomed in so you are normally attacked by things off-screen before you even have a chance to see them so you are dodging many bullets while guessing where they are coming from. Increasing the screen resolution does nothing to help (it doesn't scale) and enemies can come from any direction so you need to be on your toes often which can be fun when you first start out but when you are at the stage of trying to actually not die, it is just plain fustrating. Why controller support hasn't been added yet is mind-blowing. One of the appeals of the game is that you can play with other players too, you know like an MMO but this is a lie. Other players exist but whoever does the most damage to a monster gets the loot it drops if it drops anything at all (low drop rates, of course) so naturally you want to be in the front line performing lots of damage right? Well yes you do but go look at the screenshots for this game and you might notice something which is all the sprites are flat and 2D and nothing seperates your characters from all the 100s of others so other players will actually be your biggest cause of death many times, rather than something you want to actively seek out since you can't even tell where you are when a 'omega death blow' homes in and kills you with a dozen other players just blocking your view.Overall its a game you can jump into and enjoy but as soon as you try to really take the game seriously you will realize how shallow and fustrating it really is and the fact it hasn't improved over the years really doesn't help.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Pixel artsy bullet hell top down shooter. One of the most frantic bullet hell shooters out there. Despite the large P2W themes, I believe that you can easily earn your way up, with a small amount of panicked grinding. Even the grinding is frantic, as once you die, YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.Both pleasure and pain, I highly reccomend this game.			"

												So it goes like this:Once upon a time, there was a contest for something or other, and so some people started making a game for said contest. They won, of course, and so emerged from the depths of a volcano in some land somewhere...Realm of the......MAD GOD.A good game, yes, indeed. No pay to win, no lag...When one day, a terrible thing happened to the realm! It was purchased by none other than...JACK M. CRAZYFISH! er i meanKABAM!No you imbiscle, not like the comic book guy getting punched, the game company. Stupid idiot.Lag, pay to win, and much, much, worse. A slight delay in spells, just enough to mess up the timing. Harder enemies, more (hard) events, more ways to die.Soon it became filled with trade bots, TRADE BOTS EVERYWHERE! (gasp)But what made it pay to win? Well, I lied. It's not pay to WIN. It's pay to save you MULTIPLE HOURS. I have obtained items such as T5 Cloak of Endless Twilight (one of the best cloaks currently in-game) The T10 Staff of some-fancy-word-I-can't-remember, and the T11 Robe of the ditto-from-the-staff-before.Anyone complaining that this game is P2W is wrong, wrong, and WRONG. It's very fun if you have a couple friends to go adventuring with, but I do not recommend for kids under age thre- I mean, people that have no friends.6/10			"

With a massive amount of money grabbing from corprate run devs, you will be bombarded with it. However, with enough skill you can get passed the money aspect of the game, and simpily buy items with player made currency. It's beautiful if you think about it. Oh and if you die, prepare to cry.

												Pros:Not to sound biased but... None I can think of.Cons:- Permadeath. In an RPG. With inventory loss.- Awful graphics, even for me - and I love pixel graphics.- It's pay to win. Enough said.- Most of it is just going around the same areas killing different enemies.- You get almost no help whatsoever.- The gameplay is so simple its just boring and repetitive.- Skill won't help you win. It's mostly relies on luck.- Hardly any content. How do I know? The entire game literally took 3 secs to download with average internet.- Much like WOW, you have to pay real money to anything. Even changing your name. - Speaking of names, you can only have a name 10 characters long.So, overall, my opinion of this game is that it's terrible. I recommend you find a good rpg instead, like Neverwinter. Even though that's pay to win too, it at least gives you a chance to actually play the game - and enjoy it.			"

												This game is very enjoyable, its been able to entertain me for 72hrs so far... and others more.. yet they go on about how microtransactions ruin the game; you don't even need to buy anything.  You can earn all the things that are being sold by just putting some effort in the damned game and feel better about it too.  Although, you can buy things to advance yourself without putting much effort into the game, which is, of course fine.  But anyhow, the game is very fun.  It's extremely lengthy.. you can play it for virtually forever lol.  Going around, starting over, killing, farming, getting your character to maxed level which is 20 then going and getting potions to upgrade your character is quite an experience; you have to invest lots of time into the game; and its worth it, because in the end, you feel like you accomplished something especially since some people just quit because it's ""too hard"" or ""frustrating to lose everything when I die"", when its fixed to the point you lose everything when you die.. it makes it more intruging, you actually have some insentive to not just say ""♥♥♥♥ all"" and run around like an idiot without a care and to actually play smartly and do things correct... The game isn't for all, but for the some who it is for, you'll enjoy it greatly; just as I do! :)			"

												I can only find two problems with this game. Unfortunately, both problems make the game virtually unplayable.1. Too much Pay 2 Win. Seriously. This is the WORST pay 2 win I have seen in ANY game. EVER! Even EA is shocked by the excessive Pay 2 Win (Fun Fact: I actually like EA.). Half the game's content needs the coins, which it's hyper hard to get any unless you're shelling out money for them. Without coins, you have a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game with very little content available.2. The controls are UN-RE-FREAKING-SPONSIVE! I disabled shadows, I set the game to windowed, I disabled text bubbles, and I even closed everything off except for this game, and the controls are still barely managable! My character, for no reason, decides to go left when I want him to go right. sometimes, he doesen't even move at all! Literally ALL of my deaths recently was because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor controls.This game isn't a bad concept. However, these two problems are both equally bad, and bad enough to turn the game into a complete mess.			"

												Work of art-10/10This is almost better then Dota 2. Pretty tough choice to make. In Dota 2 (check my review for Dota 2) I stare at black screens all day and in ROTMG I go pew pew. I love the fact that these kids pay tons of money for gear they will lose in the next day.			"

												I played this game for more than 3 hours to get a character to max level. Upon reading some guides, I realized that the game is quite broken because of the training methods in god realms. Even a level 1 could not only survive but reach max level in less than an hour without shooting, and you even get rewarded for that. I actually enjoyed playing this game, good for short breaks.			"

												If you can get passed the micro-transactions that allow plays to become maxed immediately, then there is tons of content and gameplay time you can get out of this. It is not pay to play, every item you see in those shops are obtainable from playing normally and it's really fun once you start to get the hang of the game.Pros-Can be played in a massive group or solo.Several weapons/armours/abilities/rings to farm for per class.Large community for help.A steady learning curve, you will get better.A pretty fair game when it comes to the permanent deaths, you shouldn't have many unfair deaths that make you ragequit.Cons-Spam botsHave to pay to unlock more character slotsHasn't been many major updates for a very long time.This game just isn't for everyone, but it's free and definitely worth trying out. I'm not that into games with 3rd person view but I have hundreds of hours of this game on the ROTMG website.			"

												Don't be fooled by 68 hours, My main account most likley has several hundred hours of gameplay. This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game ""potions"" are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons.  To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.			"

												Realm Of The Mad God(RotMG) is one of my favourite games is steam right now.You willl be facinated of what classes to unlock and what items the game Has in store For YouAt First, you will feel Bored but when you get to lvl 20 your life will be change forever.This game is a retro 8-bit style game.It has Alot of classess to be unlocked and lots of items.It is a perma death game too. so if u die then u must create a new character again.But this is thetype of challenge that we want in the community and it will be rewarding after you kill Dungeon Bosses toget Soulbound bags.What are Soulbound Bags? Well they are loot that are in a specific bag color. The colors ranges fromPurple , Cyan and white. White Bags Are the hardest to get but has good stuff inside and you have pets too who has alot ofabilities which can aid you in battle. the places you should avoid unless you have better equips and at least lvl 20 which are Godlands(glands).You can die Pretty much instantly by some gods like Medusa(Snake Head Lady),Leviatan(Blue Creature) and Djinns(blue creature that shoots snowballs) and more.Whenever you feel your screen shaking, its time to meet Oryx.Oh and expect death whenever that happens because he is the hardest boss in the game and alot of players die by him.so i recommend you to nexus or die a brave person.Whenever you die, dont be sad just think about what your next character is gonna be and start over again.Remember Guys, EXPECT DEATH!!-StxofDark(RotMG Username0			"

												Permadeath game warning!  If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.The combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.Equipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.  Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's up to you.When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal.  +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet.  It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website realmofthemadgod.com (not on steam), to see if you like the game.  If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account.  Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game.  You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots.  They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you).  Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.I play this game almost exclusively(through the website).  It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush.  I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone.  Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.			"

												Insanely addicting game! May get frustrating at time as you die over and over and over again. But it is worth it! And there are perks to dying as you get fame to use in game! Also the pets system is amazing, you can level your pets up completely with in game currency, but if you want to get a legendary or divine pet, it is definitely easier for paying users.Overall great game, it's free so why not try it!

												I love this game. However, it definitely falls into the love it or hate it category. It is accurate to describe it as a bullet hell RPG. Some people can't get past the art style alone, but again that's something I love about it. There are 14 character classes, which gives quite a bit of variety. You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game. It's a rare game that you can have a lot of fun with by yourself or with a group of friends or even with random strangers.			"

But I bet you 2,000,000 dollars when deca games takes over it wont be so pay 2 win as it is now, but the community is AMAZING, graphics are, well, pixelated (as they should be) and the permadeath aspect of this game makes it competetive and fun, it makes it so when you die, you loose all your stuff, you cry for a bit, and then you realize that you want to get that stuff again and continue to play.7/10 currently, but still recommended.

												Great game to try for fun.  I love the ""you only live once"" style games, and the fact that this is an MMO makes it all the more epic!  Can you beat the boss and laugh as the noobs around you die?  Or will you join their pile of corpses?  Haha fear not, you can save most valuable items in your ""vault"" and those items carry over from character to character.  Once you become hardcore though, you will invest heavily into the stat lines of your main characters maxing out their stats so they are tougher, and fight a lot better.			"

												(Disregard however many hours steam says i have. I have what is probably well over 900 additional hours on the web version.) Nothing in this world has addicted me quite like Realm. I love it for many reasons and will probably never be free of it and to be honest i probably wouldn't stop playing it even if i wanted to. It has one of the best free to play models i have ever seen and stands to be the only game outside of tf2 i was genuinely happy to pay money for (and my first purcahse of 10$ was about 350 hours into the game). The action is fast paced and exciting like nothing else, nothing else in the world makes your heart pound quite like an O2 fight with a melee class. And the permadeath, while being the cruelest mistress you can ever imagine (along with her partner: lag), keeps the game interesting and has been taunting me with that elusive 8/8 for years bringing me back for more every time. This is my most played game of all time by a massive margin (minecraft dosn't count) and has good reason for it but if you're looking to pick up this game know that it's a very deep rabbit hole you're falling into, one with plenty of pain along the way. And video games shouldn't be painfull, please find something else. (Side note: The general community in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and i would be happy if i learnt that most of them died IRL. That and lag can kiss my♥♥♥♥♥)			"

Where am I? Where is that? What's going on? Oh look more enemies. (WHO NEEDS A MAP?!)-Party system is horrible.-level 100 butterfly has slain you. (Not at all epic for a monster, only Monty Python can get away with this. :P )-classes locked unless you go through different tasks to unlock them.-dear god, the lag, the horrible unoptimized lag! (Look, if i can run plenty of recent games at max then it's not me)-communication is difficult.-Hope you don't like fullscreen.Neither pro or con:= Sprite art is okay.= Instant action.= Simple-------------------------Take this review as you will, it's just here to give you perspective before you hop in, not for those expert super pro players who are already at the top of the scoreboard and have 500+ hours of the game, what are you going through reviews for anyway? It's not a popularity contest and this is what i really think about it, and that's the purpose of reviews. Shoo!Hope this helped you. :3			"

												I am going to be dead honest with you: there is a reason why this is a free game on steam: there is no way you can charge anyone to play this game. It bet it ringed a bell in your head and you either got caught by it being free, the graphics(welp) or the gameplay premise of a MMO/bullet Hell hybrid, or all of them combined.the result is quite far, far from even being remotely interesting. randomly generated terrains that cause enemies to get stuck in the middle, input delay(in a bullet hell where you're meant to have precise controls) the overall CHAOS that is the enemy spawning and the utterly UGLY artwork of this game -and by ugly i mean look at that promo, and see how it doesnt reflect AT ALL what this♥♥♥♥♥♥is about-This piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥is nothing but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of your average flash game poorly ported as a standalone, lacking elements as basic as a proper fullscreen mode, good controls or at least, something to do beyond the first tem or twenty minutes of holding M1.

												I enjoyed this one way more than I was expecting to, and so did everyone else who tried that game out (that I know of)What you have is a bullet hell MMO, the max level is 20, and is easy to reach within a short amount of time, after that, instead of exp you accumilate fame instead which can be used to buy a few in game items. And leveling up characters is how you unlock other classes, so you could play for a while before unlocking them all. It's just jolly good fun, really. Also when your character died, he's dead forever. Not that it matters since you can have another one up to the same point within the hour. it's free, so give it a go.			"

It isn't as good as it used to be (with the addition of a large number of pay-to-win aspects) it is still at its core, a fun game. I recommend trying it out and sticking around to see what DECA (the new owners) will do to improve it. Also, play on your browser or with flash projector, Steam is far to laggy.			"

However, the sheer intensity of the combat is honestly too much for my sensibilities. But hey, if you like the idea of experiencing a fantasy-themed  'bullet hell' -- or perhaps 'Magic Missile hell' would be more apt term -- then jump right in. The controls are straighforward enough even for a dexterously challenged player like myself. But the pure volume of stuff that's out to kill you makes this an ideal experience for more competetive types.			"

												I see a lot of reviews not recommending this game because they say it's ""pay to win"". I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win. With that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game. Like I said above, I've put many hours into this game because, put simply, it is a lot of fun. It's a fast paced bullet-hell permadeath shooter mmo that also just happens to be free, and there's no risk in trying it out.			"

												There's a lot more to this game than an average run of the mill run'n'gun. While there are features that can be irritating like the fact that you have to start from  scratch every time you die overall it is a good game. You just have to ignore the blatant money grabbing schemes they employ in there.			"

												Deca made the game slightly better, but it still sucks.I've heard reports that Deca Games was going to fix what Kabam did to this game.So I played it again, and I hated it.I lost a 6/8 huntress because the game deleted my extra character slot, and I was left with a rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1/8 wizard. First off, the Nexus. It still is as horrible as it was, spambotters everywhere, tier 8 equipment for 51 gold (You have only 50 gold when you start) so you have to pay more just to get an item you can't keep, and then glitchers.. .I went to the highlands because I had some decent UT equipment, and encountered a strange creature with eyes all over. Many say that creature is infamous for causing major lag, so I heed their warning and run away. A few seconds later I lagged out. I quickly rejoined, and my wizard was gone.Pros:Still addictingVisually stunningExhillaratingCons:Pay2Win stillPermaDeath (It's part of the game, but...)Glitches everywhereHackersSpambottersLAAAAAAG!!!!!4/10.It's barely refurbished from its Kabam updates, still has the pay2win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and fame still doesn't have a use after all these years.

Slightly disappointing because the general concept was such a great idea, but hopefully they'll be adding new content in the future. In the meantime, it's just fun enough to warrant giving it a try, plus it's free with a cash shop that doesn't ruin the game.			"

												Great game to try for fun.  I love the ""you only live once"" style games, and the fact that this is an MMO makes it all the more epic!  Can you beat the boss and laugh as the noobs around you die?  Or will you join their pile of corpses?  Haha fear not, you can save most valuable items in your ""vault"" and those items carry over from character to character.  Once you become hardcore though, you will invest heavily into the stat lines of your main characters maxing out their stats so they are tougher, and fight a lot better.			"

												Ah yes, isn't it fun to play a bit of games and get totally freaked out when you're about to die. Well, this is the game for you. It pictures 14 different classes (for now) and each one has a different abilities and statistics. You can play as the super sneaky rogue or the super tanky knight. You get to decide which role you play. There are many different enemies and you must know when to take risks or not. Pros:""Exciting"" 8-bit formatDifferent roles to playEasier gameplay in the middle of the realm for beginnerA lot of realmsCons:Some in-app purchases are totally not worth itThe fact that you have to start a new character when you dieSometimes a bit laggy and can affect gameplay "

												Realm Of The Mad God is one of those rare fast paced, RPG, Bullet Hell games. The games has an old fashioned pixel art style to it, which suits it, there is a good variety of classes to choose from and many bosses to fight and items to collect to strengthen your charcter(s). I personally think it's best play this with friends for it's more fun that way, and part from the having to use real life money to get in game money to buy like anything, this game is really fun and addictive as hell.

												Simple yet magical, this game is pure evidence that small games are sometimes the best. How do I know you might ask, well (your name) have you ever imagined a world where you can choose to be a ninja/rogue/wizard etc. yet kill a god? This game reveals that world to you one peace at a time as you slowly unlock new characters by slicing or exploding your enemies. In the end we can all agree that Realm of the mad god is never to be called a bad game (if someone does please torture them until they confess their crimes).			"

After playing this game, you feel inclined to purchase things, instead of forced to. You can easily have a fun experience without spending any money.			"

												This game is one of the most fun and unigue games out there. However, it is kind of pay2win since people with a lot of money can just buy realm gold and other stuff. It also sucks that you can't trade almost all the UT items. I'm 13 now; stopped playing this game on Kongregate when I was 9 and came back to try it. So many things have changed and I'm not even sure whether it was for the better or worse. If you like a game that is kind of pay2win but still fun and can put up with that, this is your game.			"

												I love this game. However, it definitely falls into the love it or hate it category. It is accurate to describe it as a bullet hell RPG. Some people can't get past the art style alone, but again that's something I love about it. There are 14 character classes, which gives quite a bit of variety. You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game. It's a rare game that you can have a lot of fun with by yourself or with a group of friends or even with random strangers.			"

I've played it 4 years on and off and have 700+ hours (on steam alone). When you die with a character youve had for a long time it may make you quit, but you will probably still come back.			"

												The game, surprisingly, has many layers. There, of course the spam when you first log in, the people trying to pedal you items for real money, all of which you will eventually lose. Which is actually one of the things i like about this game. You're going to die, otherwise, what would be the point of those leaderboards? You don't want to die? Too bad, Oryx says you have to. The first time I logged on was when the entire server was being ported to Oryx's castle, and, needless to say, i died instantly. I just laughed at myself a bit afterwards, and stopped playing for a while, but picked it back up anyways, when a friend I had introduced to the game wanted me to. It still held that first aspect, but my friend opened my eyes to the more, i will say ""MLG"" side of it, for lack of a better adjective. It gets very fun, yet frustrating at times, especially when that character you got really lucky on suddenly dies because you lagged while fighting a big boss.			"

												The game is great fun and an amazing game to play with friends. Tons of room for progression and customization isn't half bad either (Through the use of dyes/skins).One downside is the presence of micro-transactions. While they are there, they are not obtrusive and pay to win is kept mostly to a minimum, almost every item you can buy with gold can be gotten in-game for free. Some exceptions include backpacks, xp potions, pet food, and loot tier potions.			"

												I see a lot of reviews not recommending this game because they say it's ""pay to win"". I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win. With that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game. Like I said above, I've put many hours into this game because, put simply, it is a lot of fun. It's a fast paced bullet-hell permadeath shooter mmo that also just happens to be free, and there's no risk in trying it out.			"

												Permadeath game warning!  If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.The combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.Equipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.  Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's up to you.When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal.  +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet.  It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website realmofthemadgod.com (not on steam), to see if you like the game.  If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account.  Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game.  You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots.  They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you).  Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.I play this game almost exclusively(through the website).  It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush.  I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone.  Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.			"

Also the pets system is amazing, you can level your pets up completely with in game currency, but if you want to get a legendary or divine pet, it is definitely easier for paying users.Overall great game, it's free so why not try it!

												I can't even describe how annoying this game is. You spend 20 minutes grinding to the point where it's actually kind of fun and challenging, and then sometimes within 5 minutes of that, you die, lose everything, completely reset, and you're back to having to grind with a new character. What's worse is the death is almost always do to a massive lag spike caused by the server dumping everyone into a final boss battle before resetting the map. This game takes almost zero skill, just luck and endless patience.			"

												Permadeath game warning!  If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.The combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.Equipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.

But then again, it's not free to play, it's free to play, but expensive as you want it to be.It's still fun, but weird at the same time.it has no mercy. When you die, you start everything from the beggining. You have ONE character slot. Means if you wanna try another, you have to let your other one die. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'll rate this game 6.5/10 out of a f2p experience. Probably 7.5/10 with a 20$ thrown in.			"

I've played it 4 years on and off and have 700+ hours (on steam alone). When you die with a character youve had for a long time it may make you quit, but you will probably still come back.			"

This game not only has an amazingly unique play style it also has a great community! There are now new owners of the game (DECA) and they have already put out new content, Kabam the old owners didnt do much with realm for about a year before Deca bought rotmg. These new owners will hopefully breath new air into the game giving it life again. If your still reading this review why are you still here? Jump on realm and play you wont regret it!			"

I just wish the developers were more active and relased more updates more ofthen.Also hopeing for some feedback on this, I know you can link your steam acount to the browser version, but is there a way to link the browser version of the game to your steam account?EDIT:Every thing looks good now thanks to Deca <3, I have seen way fewer multie boxers and hackers, so good job.

												As a player that has played on and off for more than 4 years, I can safely tell you that RotMG's best days are already gone. Kabam, the owner of the game, neglected the game for years. The player base was shrinking, and many duping/hacking exploits where being used everywhere. This could all make one turn away from this game. However, times are changing. A new company called Deca Games has bought RotMG and is striving to breath new life into it. They have already established a connection with the community and have worked long hours to patch the exploits that made the game unplayable for the honest man.Because of the fact that RotMG seems to be going in a very positive direction, I would highly recommend this game.

												Hello guys! I have played this game for 500 hours now... that says alot in itself right?Okay heres some info about this gameYou should have atleast 17 euro for this game which will give you 2600 gold. I would reccomend to buy the starting pack which will give you extra char slots (that are infinite) a pet (which is infinite) and chests (which also are infinite) (YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME F2P but it takes alot of skill you just have to run around get items find an egg and youre started) heres why you should buy these. You will need character slots later on when you max and you have nothing to do. Because you will be able to make another character you can play even more. The chests will give you a place for saving items because when you die you loose EVERYTHING except pets character slots chests and items in chests. A pet will help you ALOT in this game you CAN play without buying stuff but i would recomend paying the small amount of 17 euro.Now to the game Its a bullet hell MMO and it is NOT EASY this takes alot of time to master! and alot of practise. When you are playing you will be going around killing monsters and as you go longer in towards the middle of your little island harder monsters will come. You will sometimes find monsters that drop portals and you can learn what these portals bosses drop of items. I would recomend playing this with a friend since alot of these dungeons and monsters are hard but you ARE playing with 84 other people on the server which makes the big event portals easier since the other players will be there to help.This is basically a game about running around killing bosses getting loot leveling up improving your pet dying then doing a little better everytime by improving your skill and your pet.I would recomend looking up guides on the internet quickly like 15 minutes of your time to find out how you get to lvl 20 easily and get to godlands begin to get loot and slowly learn the game.

Really fun game with friends, kabam sucks, its not pay to win because everything you can pay for you can just find later in the game but chests and character slots are necessary to get into this game. oh and finally if you play this game dont be a begger, everyone was in your position of having nothing once before and they all were able to pull themselves out of poverty by themselves.

												I like it :]it's fun and addicting, i love the classic pixel stylings and i love how challenging the game is.Note: i call this game Realm of Rage Quit so those of you who get angry over dying on games i would advise to not play this as dying is a part of the game, you will lose stuff and you will feel like the game is out to get you o-o.............. other than that, ENJOY :D			"

												i have been playing this game for a little bit over 4 years now and i have done pretty much everything there is to do in it. and here is a little pros and cons list of this gamepros:-one of a kind (it's the only game that is a bullethell mmorpg)-a lot of different classes-great communtiy-a lot of diffrent skins and dyes-gameplay is very fun (figthing is very simmilar to a bullethell )-being bought from kabam to a new and fresh company deca games-trading items-servers are okay-drop rates are very good and dungens have a garunted drop -almost every pc can run this game good or bad depending on your view point-perma death -pixel graphics (some like it others don't)-weapon and monster sounds are beeps and boops ( like froma nes game)-it's  very haveliy based on the grinding on pots (late game)cons:-very basic to almost no story-hacker, bots and multi boxers (which they are working on and it seems it will get better)-very badly ported on steam ( it crashes 2 to 3 times on a 3-4 hours gaming session)- some items are account bound (would have really liked it if they could make them tradeble a couple of times a year)- very short leveling time (max 20 lvl which can take 5-20 mins)-very bad soundtrack  ( it's one song and it plays over and over. i'd recomend to turn it off)i like this game i have recommended it to most of my friends and i would say that it is most fun playing with friends 7.6/10even with this rating it is still one of my favorite games			"

												Hello guys! I have played this game for 500 hours now... that says alot in itself right?Okay heres some info about this gameYou should have atleast 17 euro for this game which will give you 2600 gold. I would reccomend to buy the starting pack which will give you extra char slots (that are infinite) a pet (which is infinite) and chests (which also are infinite) (YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME F2P but it takes alot of skill you just have to run around get items find an egg and youre started) heres why you should buy these. You will need character slots later on when you max and you have nothing to do. Because you will be able to make another character you can play even more. The chests will give you a place for saving items because when you die you loose EVERYTHING except pets character slots chests and items in chests. A pet will help you ALOT in this game you CAN play without buying stuff but i would recomend paying the small amount of 17 euro.Now to the game Its a bullet hell MMO and it is NOT EASY this takes alot of time to master! and alot of practise. When you are playing you will be going around killing monsters and as you go longer in towards the middle of your little island harder monsters will come. You will sometimes find monsters that drop portals and you can learn what these portals bosses drop of items. I would recomend playing this with a friend since alot of these dungeons and monsters are hard but you ARE playing with 84 other people on the server which makes the big event portals easier since the other players will be there to help.This is basically a game about running around killing bosses getting loot leveling up improving your pet dying then doing a little better everytime by improving your skill and your pet.I would recomend looking up guides on the internet quickly like 15 minutes of your time to find out how you get to lvl 20 easily and get to godlands begin to get loot and slowly learn the game.

												So far Deca Games has been nothing but accommodating and interesting. Actually making some progress into the disaster that was Kabam. And even trying to atone for them with some free gifts (which were not overpowered or lacking, btw). I have a few things to suggest, however. 1. Fix or remove the Alchemist please. It saddens me that I can't use my tarot cards to get Alchemist rolls with the Tinkerer anymore. 2. Find a way to efficiently deal with multiboxers. Either with account numbers viewable from right clicking a players name, or by just hiring some community mods. 3. The steam version of Realm doesn't scale pop-up boxes appropriately. When you are in fullscreen (And only fullscreen as far as I can tell) and you talk to the Tinkerer or go into the options menu while in the nexus it generates improperly, can be offscreen, and is sometimes impossible to close/makes certain buttons unclickable. This is quite annoying and hopefully fixable. The most annoying instance in which this occurs is right when you enter the nexus after starting the game. You get an ad for Ambrosia almost every time. If you are in full screen when that happens the pop-up ""X"" button generates offscreen and makes it so that you have to restart the game. It's a small detail, but after many hours me and my friends agree it has to be one of the most annoying parts of the game, especially when you are trying to rush to that Candyland portal after the game crashes.4. Fix game/server crashes to some extent. I'm no computer scientist, but try to find any type of fix please. Maybe set up a bug report system that feeds system information, the way microsoft does? Improve the server load capacity? I don't know, but anything would help. I hate, and I'm sure many others do as well, getting kicked in the middle of an Oryx run.This is all I've got for now, but I'm going to do some inquiry into what my friends dislike about the game and paste it here as well. Thanks for all you've done so far Deca Games. Keep up the good work. I believe in you.  : )			"

So. when we leave  a dungeon we should be able to go into the castle,chamber or wine cellar without having players wait about 3 hours for the realm to close again, it would be fair to most players. My idea is they would go into chamber if everyones in chamber, castle if everyone is in castle,or wine cellar,if everyone is in the cellar, it would be cool cause us rotmg players know how annoying it is to do all the lvl 11 quests (the only good thing abt it is the qot) and we only get thechance to go in the castle...

												Seriously, I love this game. It's really fun ! But all this game is an argument to spend a lot of money for a compagny ! What a shame ! Could be fun if the game design is not all about money... I sum up : money could be spend to have some game coins, and this coins could be used to buy some weapons or other good stuff. When you begin the game, you think that it's possible to play the game without spending any money. But it's not. If you don't buy, you can't defeat powerfull monster ! And the only weapons you could find on the game for free are bad compared to them ! So, after the level max (20), you die, you don't have a choice... yeah, die again and again and being stuck quikly without seing a lot of the fun of RotMD, or pay and play the real game.A false free game ! Don't fall on the trap !			"

												Hello, my IGN is KillazaI have loved this game for about 4 and half years now, and to be perfectly honest I don’t think I will ever truly become bored of it, Although for me it’s not the greatest game in the world and it doesn’t win awards for art or anything, It’s uniquely brilliant ! When I first started, I have to admit that it took me about a year and a bit too actually get anywhere, this was before obvious labelling of item tiers and so on came into play and I never knew about pots and maxing. But that issue has now been resolved. One adjustment I’d make here is that it’s more made more obvious for new players that potions are something that you will need to obtain within the game to be able to succeed!I have to admit that this isn’t a game I play all the time, but it is one that anyone can always come back too and with the shining of a new era players of experience and lacking of shall bear witness  to newfound joy.There is so much potential with realm (such as bringing in new higher tier equipment) and it isn’t like it is difficult to make art and or code such a game for realm, which is why I HOPE Deca has some great idea’s, but more importantly take into account what the community offers and possibly create another thing for where they can propose art, and idea/concepts for this game to implement because I truly do want this game to strive. What makes RotMG so fantastically addictive and great?+Right of the bat there is this idea of perma-death which although it can be unspeakably infuriating, it is oh so very essential, Without it there is no tension, fear or care, This is why after hundreds or even thousands of hours of play, people still remain aware and attentive regardless of how skilled they are or how insanely powerful their pet is.+ Huge variety of enemies/bosses/events with unique +However there should still be a way for people to resurrect such as bringing back the ammy.+Another, greatness for Realm is that it is unique and special, with so much potential as I’ve said   previously!+And now that Deca (The company that has just bought the game from Kabam) has taken over they have already achieved more in a week than Kabam has for the past year)What it falls down on:+Like Minecraft realm doesn’t truly have an end and it’s what you make of it!+Lag is unimaginable punishing for this game+This means that people can get bored and only people who can stand for nonsensical repetition can play for thousands of hours and still have fun+There has been no major updates for such a long time, But that can be about to change+There is a cap to both equipment and stats (which is needed but it can be a hindrance)+Lastly UT’s and some other items are pointlessly soul-bound, because if they were tradeable they would just be very valuable so there really isn’t a point to making them soul-bound!Conclusion: Like marmite you’ll either love or hate this bullet-hell but if you give it enough time it I can guarantee you’re going to have such a blast! HIGHLY RECOMMEND 10/10			"

												Realm of the Mad God is an amazing game. I could leave the review there but I won't. This game might appear to be one of those games that you play once and then forget about but if you actually give it a try it is ridiculously addictive. It is easy to pick up and heaps of fun to play with friends. Realm is a perma-death game with some things that carry over between lives. These things being a currency which is only earned when you die, your pets and any items that you leave in your vault. With a change of developers and lots of free stuff and new content coming in NOW is the perfect time to start playing. Hopefully with DECA (the new developers) running the show we can expect to see a whole lot more cool stuff being added. This game is one of my favourite games to play. My steam client says I have about 60 hours on the game but my main realm account runs on a different platform and that one would show you over 100 more hours. This game is easy to pick up, great to play with friends, and is lots of fun to play over and over again. Give it a try!			"

												Used to play this game all the time- then Kabam came in. Rarely touched the game at all after that. DECA games has now stepped in and great improvements have been made. The game seems to be going in a great direction, and I can't wait to see what new content DECA will be adding. The game is a bullet-hell MMO, with perma death. This makes the game very intense (if you are a new player, that is. Kabam added in pets and once you have played for a year or 2, just by simply having a good pet nearly everything in the game is no longer a challenge) and fun to play with friends.			"

												Don't usually write reviews but with the new takeover from DECA games, things seem to be improving. No major changes yet, but this game was going downhill under the ownership of Kabam.ROTMG is overall a fun game, the permadeath keeps things interesting. I'd suggest giving it a try, especially now that it has a new owner who wants to see the game do well.			"

												This is a very simple game which involves lots of grinding, learning through death, and losing everything in your inventory when you die, so why is it such a good game? That feeling you get when you get the loot. When you see a white bag for your first time, or get a Blue bag from a hard boss, they are what keep everybody in this game. That indescribable feeling of overwhelming excitement and happiness has kept me into this game for a long time. It's a very relaxing game, very little competition, but tons of fun!			"

												This game is getting a lot of bad reviews because people see it as ""pay to win"".I'm here to fix that. In the game ""Realm of the Mad God"" there are thousands of micro transactions you can do to get better gear that would take a legit player longer. The only difference is, when you get the items from actual bosses in the game you learn the value of them, and how to use them instead of starting off with 20$+ of gear and dieing at level 15.At least they don't sell stat pots in the nexus for real money, that way someone who paid 100$ is still not better than a legit maxed character. tl:dr You can not pay and get a more rewarding experince!

												Personally I enjoy this game despite all the reviews of this game telling it off. Spending money in this game is not required, but they definitly want you to feel like that. Kabam does not seem to be coming back to in my opinion one of their best games, which is really saddening because this game is great. Permadeath makes you want and care not to die and I do my part of rageing in this game but still it is very enjoyable. Whenever I quit due to a rough death I feel like coming back. I am a relatively new player though and have spent money on this game and I do feel the boundraries of paying and not. Still worth the time and it is still a FREE game at the base of it.			"

												I have been playing realm for almost 4 years now (I have quit a few times for a couple months) but I really still love the game. I am mainly concerned with the crazy amount of hackers and bots, I think the  best way to get rid of bots is to get rid of the unnamed accounts feature. It may not let you get that dream NPE but it will end a LOT of hacking (mostly just multiboxers, notifier bots, and spam bots). Once the hackers are beat this game will be great again!			"

												In this case less is définitely more. Simple and addicting gameplay.Only 8 spots in inventory and 8 spots in vault which seems like it's gonna be horrible at first, but then you realise that's exactly why it's so easy to trade and find stuff. People don't pick up what they don't need and give everything away when they find something better. It's actually a pretty social game, because teamwork is greatly rewarded.Pretty amazing. In-game currency is way to expensive, but if it were 6 euro's I'd say it would be worth it. You don't need to buy in-game currency to get the best gear by the way. Doesn't seem to be Pay 2 win.Edit:Nowadays you need to enter an e-mailadres and password. The login-button is dead though so I can't play. Very common problem. Maybe playing via browser works, but then I can't use my characters.Edit2: Months later it all works again.			"

												(Disregard however many hours steam says i have. I have what is probably well over 900 additional hours on the web version.) Nothing in this world has addicted me quite like Realm. I love it for many reasons and will probably never be free of it and to be honest i probably wouldn't stop playing it even if i wanted to. It has one of the best free to play models i have ever seen and stands to be the only game outside of tf2 i was genuinely happy to pay money for (and my first purcahse of 10$ was about 350 hours into the game). The action is fast paced and exciting like nothing else, nothing else in the world makes your heart pound quite like an O2 fight with a melee class. And the permadeath, while being the cruelest mistress you can ever imagine (along with her partner: lag), keeps the game interesting and has been taunting me with that elusive 8/8 for years bringing me back for more every time. This is my most played game of all time by a massive margin (minecraft dosn't count) and has good reason for it but if you're looking to pick up this game know that it's a very deep rabbit hole you're falling into, one with plenty of pain along the way. And video games shouldn't be painfull, please find something else. (Side note: The general community in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and i would be happy if i learnt that most of them died IRL. That and lag can kiss my♥♥♥♥♥)			"

Once all of Oryx's minions are killed, he sends the whole server to his castle. The game also is completely free to play, and won't force you to spend hundreds on enjoying the game.			"

												I have played this game for many hours and i can proudly say it was not wasted. ROTMG has brought me together with many friends that i respect and play games with regulary. This game not only has an amazingly unique play style it also has a great community! There are now new owners of the game (DECA) and they have already put out new content, Kabam the old owners didnt do much with realm for about a year before Deca bought rotmg. These new owners will hopefully breath new air into the game giving it life again. If your still reading this review why are you still here? Jump on realm and play you wont regret it!			"

												Deca, the two things that I would recommend to make this game better besides hackers and multiboxers is fix spawn rates for Dungeon drops from Quest bosses in realms and fix the loot table for everyone. Even if the game seems to be fun, it wouldn't make sense if you cant do the dungeons you love without having to spend money to get dungeons, or work really hard in dungeons you risked your character's life for only to get scammed and get a purple bag or nothing at all. I am sure we, the community, would really love that effort from you guys. Please #MakeRealmGreatAgain. Good Luck Deca.			"

												-=WARNING THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE DYING=-This game is extremely fun, but you will die ALOT. This game is permadeath..sorta. You see when you die you lose all the items you had equiped but there is a vault witch keeps your stuff between characters in the chest. Witch means you always dont want to equip your best gear because your afraid of dying.i have only just finished getting to lv20 for the 3rd time and after that dont go running to gods rightaway you want to stay back do enough damage to get loot. Players in RotMG have a thing called 8/8 it means 8 out of 8 of thier sts are maxed. To max a stst you have you get sts potions witch drop from gods yet since your not 8/8 its very difficult to do. If your new to this game dont go asking people for stuff or YOU WILL BE YELLED AT.Overall this is a very good game but very difficult to ""beat"".I give this game a 8/10 for its very fun gamplay and the community that comes with it.

												Gone to complete♥♥♥♥♥♥shortly after Kabam acquired the game. Should have expected it, judging from all the other terrible games it published. If you decide to play and ignore all the money grab the game, then its fun enough for a while but having 1 character slot gimps you a lot, especially for new people who die a lot. It also sells you highest tier gear in the cash shop, which lures in new players who buy and then instantly lose $10+ from dying. Also, having a good pet costs tons of money, so be prepared to spend lots of time grinding out fame or paying for better pets. Its not necessary to have a pet but it makes everything so much easier and increases your survivability, which in a game of permadeath, is very important. A maxed divine pet is $500+. The game has perma death so dying is pretty devastating. If you decide to buy anything, stick to character slots and vaults.			"

Once you have gotten pixelized enough, you can start setting out to fight other pixels with your new, stronger, and improved pixels. After all, this IS pixel warfare. So, you have set out with your pixels, along with your friend pixels along a pixel map passing pixel trees and pixel rivers. Surprise MUTHA ♥♥♥♥A! The Mad God has summoned the server, but♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pixels ain't jack compared to these mutha truckahs, everyone around you fires their pixels frantically in a mad dash so as to not die like a ♥♥♥♥♥.

												This game is not a very forgiving game in any form. Those that take the high risks get the High rewards, but in a perma-death game, the rewards are easily gone with a simple mistake. After 60 hours of playing thi\s game, you hope to have a clan that will back you up, you get some of the best gear, and don't die by a Night Elf. Micro Transactions will get you the best gear in the game, but that takes more of the fun out of it. If you spend your coin (real life cash) then unly by from special deals, and make it storage or extra character slots, things you can keep after death.			"

It's in the making of being revamped right now and many people are beginning to rejoin. Browser account migration to steam account is bugged and will hopefully be fixed soon.10/10 would die again			"

												I only recommend this game to anyone who has to much time to waste. Really fun game with friends, kabam sucks, its not pay to win because everything you can pay for you can just find later in the game but chests and character slots are necessary to get into this game. oh and finally if you play this game dont be a begger, everyone was in your position of having nothing once before and they all were able to pull themselves out of poverty by themselves.

												Seriously, I love this game. It's really fun ! But all this game is an argument to spend a lot of money for a compagny ! What a shame ! Could be fun if the game design is not all about money... I sum up : money could be spend to have some game coins, and this coins could be used to buy some weapons or other good stuff. When you begin the game, you think that it's possible to play the game without spending any money. But it's not. If you don't buy, you can't defeat powerfull monster ! And the only weapons you could find on the game for free are bad compared to them ! So, after the level max (20), you die, you don't have a choice... yeah, die again and again and being stuck quikly without seing a lot of the fun of RotMD, or pay and play the real game.A false free game ! Don't fall on the trap !			"

												A CO-OP Bullethell-Pixel-RPG Game. Where you have to fight monsters, gods, run dungeons with varying of difficulty. The dungeons and gods can drop potions which boost your stats. These stats are eventually maxed when the player drinks enough potions. The dungeons can also drop gear which the player can either wear, store or sell to other players. To increase the difficulty, this game has perma death. This is when the player dies, he loses all the gear and stats the character had. This game is very addictive to people who like a challenge. Recently this game has been taken over from Kabam to DECA Games as Kabam were not making any progress into the game. Hopefully DECA Games would restore the game back from the dead.Personally I enjoy the game as I find it fun and I am very addicted to it.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a great game with hard Challenge like permadeath,debuffs and more but this is what makes the game fun the feeling of doing a hard dungeon or get a high tier items it's tiny thing like that is what make me love it but it's not perfect it can have some problem with lag also the game has microtransactions but they are not need to win the game/get best gear it only speeds things up if you think this is bad remember Deca need some way to get money also PERMADEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												While it may not look like it, I have spent thousands of hours in this game through other platforms such as Flash Projector and Browser versions. This game has had me addicted for the better part of 3 and a half years. While this game is extremely difficult and rage inducing, it is also incredibly fun and addicting.On the other hand, this game is very P2W (Pay to win). You start off having one character slot to make 1 of 14 classes and a single vault chest that holds 8 items that will not be lost upon death. It is almost necessary to purchase more vault chests and character slots as you begin to get better at the game. Not to mention pets. Once you have leveled up your pet, (Common -> Uncommon -> Rare -> Legendary -> Divine), it is virtually impossible to get past a maxed legendary pet without dropping some cash into this game. That being said, your pet, vault chests, and character slots cannot be taken from you, and will be on your account forever.Overall, this game is hard to get into, but offers some incredible game play that can last you for years.

												I have around 800++ hours on the game, but none of it is on steam, but I feel that the game could use a bit of tweaking *cough* necro buff + necro wis mod *cough*. Also, the game does have a very high percentage of people using modified clients, to either have an unfair advantage over others, or just to improve their performance in game. I personally think that one of the main problems right now in the game is performance, as even with good internet and a good pc, you will still have fps drops and internet lag.			"

												I have put a lot of hours into this game,and i have to say one thing before anyone gets into it,if you acnt stand permadeath and losing everything when you die,dont play it,its not worth the time,if you can get over permadeath or not die easy get into it,it is very fun,but dont plan on advancing in the game unless you have the money for chest,and character slots,in the end very fun game but not worth the permadeath.EDIT: This game is getting reborn by a new company.

												Used to play this game all the time- then Kabam came in. Rarely touched the game at all after that. DECA games has now stepped in and great improvements have been made. The game seems to be going in a great direction, and I can't wait to see what new content DECA will be adding. The game is a bullet-hell MMO, with perma death. This makes the game very intense (if you are a new player, that is. Kabam added in pets and once you have played for a year or 2, just by simply having a good pet nearly everything in the game is no longer a challenge) and fun to play with friends.			"

												(Disregard however many hours steam says i have. I have what is probably well over 900 additional hours on the web version.) Nothing in this world has addicted me quite like Realm. I love it for many reasons and will probably never be free of it and to be honest i probably wouldn't stop playing it even if i wanted to. It has one of the best free to play models i have ever seen and stands to be the only game outside of tf2 i was genuinely happy to pay money for (and my first purcahse of 10$ was about 350 hours into the game). The action is fast paced and exciting like nothing else, nothing else in the world makes your heart pound quite like an O2 fight with a melee class. And the permadeath, while being the cruelest mistress you can ever imagine (along with her partner: lag), keeps the game interesting and has been taunting me with that elusive 8/8 for years bringing me back for more every time. This is my most played game of all time by a massive margin (minecraft dosn't count) and has good reason for it but if you're looking to pick up this game know that it's a very deep rabbit hole you're falling into, one with plenty of pain along the way. And video games shouldn't be painfull, please find something else. (Side note: The general community in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and i would be happy if i learnt that most of them died IRL. That and lag can kiss my♥♥♥♥♥)			"

Kabam does not seem to be coming back to in my opinion one of their best games, which is really saddening because this game is great. Permadeath makes you want and care not to die and I do my part of rageing in this game but still it is very enjoyable. Whenever I quit due to a rough death I feel like coming back. I am a relatively new player though and have spent money on this game and I do feel the boundraries of paying and not. Still worth the time and it is still a FREE game at the base of it.			"

Likes: I love this game because it's fun and a good challenge, it's also surprisingly fun to play with a friend. The guild system is well designed, and easy to use/run. Dislikes: While their are a few faults with the game there are _ main problems. Number 1: It's very flashy and in your face, especially in the Godlands, so if you've got epilepsy, I wouldn't advise going to the godlands if you want to get this game.

												This game is by far one of my favourite new games. I recently discovered it and was amazed by how addicting this fast paced game is. If you have ever played the original Zelda game on NES, this is like that but an MMORPG. You have to dodge enemy attacks in an 8bit world, while getting new equipment and fame. However, when you die it brings back another dreaded moment of NES gaming. ""Game Over"", you lose everything, character deleted, and your keyboard smashed out of frustration.I rate this game 8/10.

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a side scrolling shooter that is amazing for being a browser game. It plays like an arcade game adapted for more accurate play with a mouse. It keeps up the challenge with the risk of dying to enemies and having to start over, encouraging players to fight alongside eachother and even includes a teleport option to any player in the region. The game as multiple classes to keep interest in the game.			"

												This game is a highly addictive, fast paced MMORPG with tons of items, features and capabilities. With an intense difficulty level and never-ending combat(Of course you can go take a break, but in order to progress, you HAVE to fight), this game is easily one of the best MMORPGs on the Steam Marketplace. You can play with dozens of friends and team up to kill major bosses. And to top it all off, it's free! If you're into fast-paced MMORPGs where you can team up with friends and go through countless battles, this is the game for you.			"

												This game has changed me quite a bit over the few years that i have been playing this game. This game has taken over my life for the past few years. Its a very addictive however this game does have a big learning curve, Expect to die... a lot... You can't get very far in this game without spending any money at all. You will need to spend money at some point due to the limits you have with 1 vault and more importantly 1 character slot. If you haven't played this game, go try it out. Its free! You will start this game not knowing anything (unless you've watched a lot of videos) and you will die a lot even if you do watch videos. Expect raging and jealousy if you play this for a while. Thats all i have to say. Overall amazing game. Keep realming!			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a great Free to Play title, and the community sometimes can be very helpful in terms of experiences and your overall enjoyment of the game. But the community is also highly critical of the game. It isnt as active as it used to be years ago, but this is mostly due to lack of content being added to the game. Hopefully in the future the game may be sold to somebody who can keep up with the community, but is still a great fast paced perma-death game. You should be able to get hours of enjoyment out of it till you start to get higher up in the ranks where things seem more and more repetitive. The community overall though is very passionate about keeping the game alive and letting it blossom. Sometimes talks of its pay to win aspects discourage new players, but you can definantly survive in the current meta without dropping any money in the game.			"

												Realm of the mad god is an interesting game in the fact of how it can bring people together this is proven in multiple ways but one example is how people have guilds. sure some are all about ""pros"" in specific guilds while others are just for friends to be in. This game is about community and that is what Deca is trying to do, get communities together. Some things I think they could do is add more endgame content and make name changing cost less or free because 10$ (U.S.) is so not worth it. all in all tweaking that can be done and communities that can be woven together this is a great game.

												Alright ladies and gentlemen, time you tell you a decently okay story (Review) of Realm of the Mad God.Now before we begin I would just like to say somethings: This game is Perma-Death but you can keep some of your items if they are in your vault. Don't be decieved by my measly 30 play hours, I probably had 10x this amount before I started playing through steam and not the RotMG website. PROSVery entertainingSimple learning curve if your new to the genreFun community and you make friends quite easilyControls are simple yet perfectHigh replay valueMany different classes to choose from with there own unique items and skillsYou get to run in hordes of players you don't even know exploring a dungeon (and I mean TONS of people)There's a server specifically for tradingFun playing solo or with friendsDepending on how you view it: Very rewarding but also very punishing (Perma-Death)Extremely fun boss fights. I mean legit your fighting a GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING PUPPET thats like hella op with you + 50 people and the fight still takes a couple minutes.---CONSMoney. All they want is your money. Basically your bombarded with ads and ""deals"" everytime you open the game. Also, the hub is legit full of items to buy but cost like $1-$15 EVEN THOUGH you can easily with the right tools earn them IN-GAME. Don't worry, you don't need to buy these items at all/spend money in general. But one thing I'd recommend buying if you enjoy the game is the New Player Starter Pack. To sum it up, new players have 7 days (1 week) to buy this starter pack or you won't get the offer ever again. It's definitely worth getting it. It's $20 but if you were to buy all the items/vault chests/coins each, it would cost you around $80. So it's worth a buy.The game was abandoned. The developers do not update the game anymore, so no new content will be added to the game.Scammers. ""But wait, you just said RotMG had a great commu-"" Shut up. I know what I said, and it really does have a great community, But everyday more and more scammers come to the game so it gets a little hard to trade with someone when your like ""I'll give you 8 Defence Pots for 1 Life Pot"" and they're like ""Nah dude big scam big scam, you give me 16 Def Pots and I'll give you 2 Mana Pots"" like that ♥♥♥♥♥ gay.But overall, if you are planning to spend money on this game, I don't recommend it. But, if you are going to f2p this game like it was originally supposed to be, sure, give this game a quick try.			"

												Imagine yourself climbing a mountain. You've been training for a long time to finally scale this behemoth. This is your leveling and maxing your character in ROTMG. Now imagine you are about to reach the top of this mountain and max your character. Then, oh no. Randy Orton slythering in, WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT. RKO OFFF THE CLIFF OUT OF NOWHERE. Not only does your character die, but you also die inside. This is the endless emotionally degrading cycle that is ROTMG.			"

												Fun fast-paced multiplayer shooter. Just don't expect any deep story or lore.Can get very grindy at mid-late game like most MMOs. Cash shop is available to speed things up, but player skill is required to last in the game. Expect to waste a lot of real money if you spend and play without practice.			"

												***I have decided to get back into Realm once again (through the web/client version) and it is a very exciting game. So I have decided to come back from my extremely old review (with no reason to recommend) and have completely reworked and rewritten the review.***With constant imaginative enemies fighting you ranging from cute but deadly bunnies to Oryx the Mad God himself. This game is a bullet hell - and god damn is it a crazy bullet hell. Missiles flying in every direction imaginable, enemies releasing missiles in every direction adds the challenge to RotMG as you really have to learn how to use the controls effectively before being able to imagine the higher levels. But those higher levels are extremely rewarding if you reach so it is absolutely worth the time doing dungeons.There is a natural annoyance with the business model, it has very expensive ""packages"", being sold  which can be bought with the in game payed currency ""gold"" or just money, with just the ""beginner package"" being sold for $20 for a new account and $60 after. However, none of the packages in RotMG actually need to be bought, you can achieve the same as anyone else without paying - it is harder, yes, but it isn't like it's quicker if you pay, it's just easier if you do.Overall I would recommend this game from the point of view that it is F2P so you're not wasting anything by buying it.

												Personally, I love this game. It is one of my all time favorite games, and I find myself coming bak to it time and time again. It is easy to get into, the controls are simple, and take little time toget used to, and the game is not complicated. The perma-death aspect to the game can be frustrating at times, but it makes the game unique. I would definity recommend this game to everyone, and as it is free, you can try it out before spending money on additional storage or charecter slots. Wildly addictive. 9/10			"

												Seems like it is going to suck at first. But get in a realm with your friends and start picking up loot at the beach, for you and your pals, and they will do the same. From that point the game is only getting funnier. This game is RNG-based, meaning that you will always be excited trying to get the item you've always wanted, and sometimes rage! This game has just been sold by Kabam to Deca Games, a new company that I can assure you will fix everything that is wrong with this game, and turn it into a better one. In fact  players like us can help bring new content to the game!			"

												This game is a highly addictive, fast paced MMORPG with tons of items, features and capabilities. With an intense difficulty level and never-ending combat(Of course you can go take a break, but in order to progress, you HAVE to fight), this game is easily one of the best MMORPGs on the Steam Marketplace. You can play with dozens of friends and team up to kill major bosses. And to top it all off, it's free!

												Solid game to pick up and play. As you walk through the world it's easy to see that is 2d top down shooter isn't the most graphic intensive game out there. There are however redeeming factors such as the helpful attitude player show toward eachother and the competitive high tier gearing progress. If you can see past the confusing interface this game is a blast for a few hours and maybe even more if you want to be the best.			"

												I belive that this game is absolutly crap. here is a list of reasons why you should not play this game: Sticky keys your keys seem to be stuck but they arnt the game is just crapily designed, You shoot stuff your only way to attack is to shoot stuff with any type of weapon like swords, You get booted off all the time, The only way to close an add is to click buy, The game barely ever loads the map, Lots of people spam chat, The game is very laggy and rubbish although I have an  amazing computer, A macintosh could run this game and not get any lag that is how crappy it is, It is never updated, and it is so unoptimized it will just drag a lot that is how rubbish it is.

												This game used to be very enjoyable to play with friends and farm for epic loot, but now Kabam decided to make this game pay to win. If you want a fun mmo with great dungeons and a fun community get this game, but be warned: if you die you will feel like quitting. Overall it is a game I will come back to every now and then but there simply isn't enough content for me to keep playing since this is a VERY repetitive game. It is fun for a few hours once you get the hang of it but you will become very bored after awhile. In the end, it is a decent game but i would nto recommend it for the average mmo gamer.			"

												This game was perfect, great gameplay, great community, all around amazing.Then this game hopped on the P2P train when the new company bought out this game, it says free, but if you want to get anywhere without grinding for 20 hours then doing 1 quest then grind for another 20 hours then... you will have too shell out money, money upon money upon money, and trust me, people did, some people dropped 100's of dollars, also, you can't fight them, they will win every fight.People shell out a lot of money just to PLAY a FREE to play game, and best part is, if you die, you lose all your♥♥♥♥♥♥ then you gotta pay more, it's a loop. Gameplay: 5/10Community: 1/10Market: 1/10PvP: 3/10PvE: 4/10------------------Overall 2/10Who would this game be for? Rich people that can't afford a $20 dollar game so they blow $100 dollars on a ""F2P"" game.			"

												I have WAY more gametime then it says. I play web version and don't know how to convert account over but!This game is easily one of the best co op bullet hell's out there. And if you look past all the overpriced stuff you can purchase, Its a great game. (I'm assuming no one buys them but... There might always be that one guy.)Pros.+14 Classes, each giving an interesting spin on how you play the game.+Permadeath system, Makes you feel on the edge and think about risk vs reward before you attempt a dungeon/boss.+People still play the game.+Somewhat unique progression.+Several dungeons and bosses, appearing at random times to keep the game interesting.+A nice feeling when you get rare lootCons.-Permadeath (I personally like it but I can see how it can be a con to some.)-Kabam trying to make it pay to win as possible. (Good thing is its a PvE game. And you can't buy Untiered items which are some of the most sought after anyways)-Pet system needs balancing. (Could be personal preference.)-That feeling of a heart attack when you die/almost die and lose your chara/loot-KabamPersonally. I love this game. It is so much fun and I really hope one day they decide to change their current model. If you look past it you can find an amazing game. In the end its not that big of a deal that it's PvE, or theirs people using hacked clients. (Hacked clients does not mean godmode or free loot. From what I see its mostly autoaim, auto nexus) I'd give it a try, maybe play with some friends.Final thoughts:A good game like no other. with a company trying to milk it for all its worth. Ignore that fact and you can have fun.			"

												Stay calm... stay calm... OHHH♥♥♥♥♥♥AGAIN!!This game is just hardcore! You have to level up to get stronger, but if you die you have to start over again. You have to be very careful in this game, but on the other site you should get better weapons and armor so you can survive a lot easier. Later you have to farm some dungeons or mobs to get stat pots wich inrease your stats. You can trade, join guilds or cry because you lost another charakter. It is realy challenging but a lot of fun if you are a patient person. You can unlock a lot of classes and decide if you want to play a healer, damage dealer or tank. There are even classes which combine 2 of these roles. You should totaly try it out if you like the ""retro-like"" graphic and rogue-like ""shoot 'n' dodge"" games.			"

In the beginning it's pretty hard to stay alive and survive for longer than an hour, but when you played for some time and learned how the game works and how to farm stat potion's, the real fun beginns.

(At least for the most part)Nice pixel top down shooter overall.Cons: Despite the music being good, it can be a bit reppetitive.Not many updates. (Been a while since there's been a new dungeon added.)The community on steam. Everyone on the website version of ROTMG is more lively and communicate more. You go up to almost any wandering player and ask to team up and they'll say 'sure'. Very few players here even talk.

												This game is by far one of my favourite new games. I recently discovered it and was amazed by how addicting this fast paced game is. If you have ever played the original Zelda game on NES, this is like that but an MMORPG. You have to dodge enemy attacks in an 8bit world, while getting new equipment and fame. However, when you die it brings back another dreaded moment of NES gaming. ""Game Over"", you lose everything, character deleted, and your keyboard smashed out of frustration.I rate this game 8/10.

The game is a fantasy rpg with a perma death feature, thats what makes it interesitng, check it out, it just got a new owner and its getting updates weekly. you will not be disappointed			"

Posted: July 27, 2016
												I woke up this morning to play my favorite game of all time. I logged in to my computer to find I no longer had windows XP, and that windows 10 had taken over even my delicate machine. I was infuriated, and in my rage smashed my computer into a million tiny bits. Without any way to play the best game ever made, I was distraught. I ran 3 miles to my workplace, only to find that I would not be allowed in to ""simply play a video game."" I quit at that moment, the thought of working alongside such inferior beings made me want to cut myself. Once I returned home I turned on my phone to try and call my friend and see how she was getting along in the game. I was dialing the digits for her phone number when a sudden realization came over me. I ran to the remains of my computer, impaling my feet on countless bits of machinery and legos to grab my keyboard and mouse. I plugged both the keyboard and mouse into the usb docking multisplit thing my grandma had given me for my birthday 6 years ago, and then plugged that into a usb to micro usb converter. I then proceeded to plug the micro usb converter into my phone, where I now had full access with my keyboard and mouse. Grinning at my excellence, I began to open the game in the browser of my phone. Finally logged in and ready to begin the day, the clock in the upper right reads 11:00 PM, and I regretfully realize I must sleep. Excited to begin tomorrow and continue the grind of a lifetime, I happily set my alarm and lay down to sleep. My dreams are haunted by visions of dying, lost items, and legos, but I sleep well enough. My alarm blares at 3 AM sharp and I snap to attention, already dressed in the clothes for the day, and I continue where I left off the previous night. Sitting on the floor by the remains of my once operable computer, I log in and begin playing. After a bit of warming up, I decide to venture towards the end goal of my quest. While on my journey, a message pop's into the middle of my screen - ""H0W T0 GET THE BEST L00T IN THE GAME, GAURANTEED TO WORK EVERY TIME"" - it's a message from my friend, included with a video. Excited to become the best player, I can't click the link fast enough. After 14 minutes of introduction in the video, the unthinkable happens. I got rick rolled. I couldn't think clearly anymore, and in a haze I left my house towards the address my friend had given me. I met her online, but we lived near eachother and we had told eachother our addresses in an attempt to meet up once before. I reach her apartment in record pace, and kick down the door screaming. I search every room, eventually finding a dark room with only a singular source of light. I flicker on the lights, and a fat girl in her late teens turns to face me. I recognize her instantly from the pictures she had sent me, and I steeled myself for what I was about to do. I began to sprint towards her, hand's reaching for ********************.************************************************************.********************************************************************************.********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.************************************************************. The walk home was enjoyable, I had forgotten my shirt but the sun was bright and the breeze was cool. It took a few hours to reach my house again, I had decided to take a scenic route back home. I open the front door quietly, I didn't want to alarm my dear aunt sally. Please excuse her, she just isn't as good looking as she used to be back when I was a young teenager. I slowly approach my phone laying on the ground in the middle of my room, and notice that I have been logged out from my game. Completely reasonable, considering my time spent away, I log back in to my account. I'm very uncreative and forgetful, so my username is always my first and last name followed by a few numbers. I always make my password 'incorrect', so that when I type it in wrong it just tells me how to type it in correctly. I am very clever. Logging in, my immediate thoughts are ripped away from me, replaced my a low groan that originates in the depths of my very being. It quickly rises in pitch, into a powerful crescendo that shatters the windows in my neighbors home. I had died while I ventured on my crusade. My extremely vaulable character, with hours of work and effort, vaporized in a mere instant because somebody had the audacity to rick roll me. My dear aunt Sally joins me as I scream, and together we reach a magnifient climax. My cry of rage dies down, replaced by a powerful sense of vengeance - the one responsible for this would pay, and with my grandest battlecry I charge out the door towards the apartment of somebody I used to call my friend. I break my previous world record pace by half, and I kick my way through the remains of her door. Remembering where her room was, I move in quickly, and lock my eyes on her shivering form, huddled bare in the corner of her room. My battlecry strengthens, and begins rising back to a glorious pitch. I move in, eager to claim my revenge on her broken form, my previous efforts from earlier aiding as she lacks the resistance to refuse me. Throwing her on her back, I glare into her eyes, and notice the fear, causing my scream to raise higher than it ever has. I *****************. ****************************************. ****************************************************************. ************************************************************.****************************************************************************************************.************************************************************.************************************************************. Finished, my scream dies down to a mere grumble, and I hear a shout from outside her apartment. I realize this is probaby a bad thing, and charge towards the wall, breaking my way through. I took an interesting route home that day, I didn't change my course for anybody - or anything. As I enter my home, I hear my dear aunt Sally upstairs, her medications must not be working as I hear her moans of pain echo. Crouching in my room at my phone, I laugh to myself. I had logged into the wrong account. Sometimes I use an alternate birthday to reflect the generation I wish I was born in. Logging in, I scream happily as I notice my characters existence, and begin to play again. Glad to once again have my level 3 wizard, I continue onwards to fight the evil chicken god.Overall 8/10, would play again.			"

												What am I supposed to say about one game in which I´ve already spent 500h? Of course i DO recommend this game, despite its faults, bugs, and all that kind of things its an awesome game full of content, harder than dark souls and really addictive. More than that, its free, so we could honestly say its worth the money it costs :PThe community is amazing, huge to be an indie game and even though we´ve got some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s the rest are really kind people. Thanks to DECA it´s getting updated and its problems fixed. Hope we can get the game (on steam) optimized soon.My IGN is DjmikiPD:You are going to die tons of times, there is not any problem with that, use your vault, its there for some reason. And best tip ever: DO NOT GET ANY CLOSE TO AN ORYX BRUTE. NEVER.PD(2):DO NOT DO SHATTERS.			"

If you get the game, don't quit after your first death.  Unlock all the characters, see what you like best, and max out your character.  there are plenty of videos on youtube to help out new players, and if you ever need anyone to play with, I'm here.

												A while ago this was one of, if not the best online flash game I had ever played. You would be so engrossed in grinding items with the one fear of losing it all because your computer would lag when you spammed your ""Escape to Nexus"" key.However once Kabam took over, the game has lost its touch. Although there are many new aspects that have been added to the game, such as new dungeons, weapons, pets, I feel that the cons outweigh the pros.Too much stuff has become purchasable, enemy and item spawn rates have been dramatically decreased. Worst of all the highest tier weapons have become untradable. The only way to get them is to grind them (which now takes 100 times as long) or use your money to get them directly, or speed up the process. This of course is stupid as you will probably lose all the items anyway, resulting in a waste of money.All in all this once amazing, rage-inducing, time-wasting game that 99.99% of people who played it enjoyed has gone from F2P to P2W. I'm sure 99.99% of people who play it now would agree with me that this game has become worse since Kabam took over.			"

												Okay. Realm of the Mad God...What do I say about this? well...I quite enjoy it. It's a fun addition to the Non-♥♥♥♥♥♥ selection of F2P games...If you are looking at review and haven't played the game...why haven't you played it yet? There is loads of fun to be had (Even more with friends though...we will get to that later). It's a permadeath game where you have to select a class and battle enemys around the nicely sized world (Some get really powerful and hard to kill so watch out for that) Including but not limited to, Pirates, Snakes, J-Jelly Cubes???, Balls that shoot more balls and there are even more. Now...There are also bosses aswell and this is where the game will take you down at your first couple times. Every once and a while a quest will appear with and arrow pointing to the area on your screen...This is where the bosses are. Bosses range from easy to HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THIS IS HARD quite quickly if you don't grind for levels. but this is where the lock and teleport features come in -Ahem- Okay it's time to introduce (Enter black and white television mode) Teleportation and Locking! If at any point you lock a player they will stay at the bottom right of the screen for you unless they leave the world or enter a portal (Find them out for yourself) and you can lock your friends to keep with them. You can also teleport to locked or unlocked people that are close to you. If you are ever in a tight spot or need to catch up to your friends you can teleport to locked or unlocked people like I said before! (Oh yea and there is a trading system but find that out from yourself) -Leave black and white television mode- The game does get slightly tedious at points it is still a soild experience you should definately give a go.Final Score--------------9.5/10			"

												Recently, Kabaam has passed the rights to Deca games and we will be getting consistent updates because of this. So it's a great time for old players to come back to the game and new players to try out the game due to the events and freebies we are currently getting. Although there are some issues and suggestions that I want to point out such as:-Hackers, multiboxers and bots although theres not alot of them anymore compared to before but I've encountered some that ruinied runs and event bosses for some people including me.-Higher resolution or proper full screen since maximizing the game stetches out the window or game making it tedious.-Make deaths less devastating and give the fame currency more application other than pets and guilds-Workshop items maybe such as character skins encouraging people to make a great looking skin and vote which is the best looking skin and release a set of character skins every month.-Make some old skins accessible or buyable other than the lucky box for newer players or players who missed them.-More fun and balanced classes and items or tier-More fun dungeons and events-Less devastating deaths or more rewarding deaths (form of progression).Overall the game is a fun RPG with permanent death death especially when you meet some people that would help or join you and will make you want to play more and get more white bags or get a white bag.

												So, first of all, I would like to acknowledge the quality of gameplay this outstanding game has brought upon me. Because of this game, it has made me want to kill myself on a daily basis, has given me the thought of joining the KKK and has made me want to vote for Donald Trump. The feelings this game has given me has opened my eyes about how cruel this world is and how better off I am becoming a stripper. Games like this have given me such unforgettable memories that I will unfortunately cherish forever. Moments that I still remember after starting this game one year ago. Where I died as an archer to a Scorpion King with its very OP family of bratty scorpion children, and the first time I've gotten a white bag, in which I lost right away after some monsters came in from the other room of an Undead Lair dungeon. After all of these overwhelming events, I reccomend this game to any toxic kids from XBox Live so they can feel just how we feel when they tell us to drink bleach. 10/10 Game.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a great Free to Play title, and the community sometimes can be very helpful in terms of experiences and your overall enjoyment of the game. But the community is also highly critical of the game. It isnt as active as it used to be years ago, but this is mostly due to lack of content being added to the game. Hopefully in the future the game may be sold to somebody who can keep up with the community, but is still a great fast paced perma-death game. You should be able to get hours of enjoyment out of it till you start to get higher up in the ranks where things seem more and more repetitive. The community overall though is very passionate about keeping the game alive and letting it blossom. Sometimes talks of its pay to win aspects discourage new players, but you can definantly survive in the current meta without dropping any money in the game.			"

												I have played realm of the mad god for about 6 years now (IGN: Jaimz btw ;3). Although I didn't end up playing for 6 years straight, I can say for certain that this game continues to bring back its audience time and time again.  Whether it be for nostalgia, curiosity, the community, or a renewed sense of determination for the game, ROTMG has been a jewel in the eyes of all who have once seen and played the game for themselves.  So I end with a simple question: Should you play Realm of the Mad God?  Try it for 5 days with all your might, and I believe you'll get hooked in no time.  The game may feel a bit tastless here and there after some time, but the game always finds a way to peak your interest once again; especially with the transfer of ROTMG to ""the new comer"" DECA Games.  A little off topic but, OMG I MET REXAAAYYY AFTER SO LONG ON REALM AGAIN, AND EVEN HOSTED A TOMB FOR OLD MEMBERS OF THE ONE AND ONLY RAGNAROK AND MET ONE OF THE FOUNDERS, ISRAPHIAL, AND ALSO SHURP. *clears throat* Well, enough of the fangirling.  By that little comment I mean to say that older members of realm have been coming back into the community to see what DECA games has in store for our great and adored game that is, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO THIS CANNOT BE""                                                                     -REALM OF THE MAD GOD			"

The game is a fantasy rpg with a perma death feature, thats what makes it interesitng, check it out, it just got a new owner and its getting updates weekly. you will not be disappointed			"

												I woke up this morning to play my favorite game of all time. I logged in to my computer to find I no longer had windows XP, and that windows 10 had taken over even my delicate machine. I was infuriated, and in my rage smashed my computer into a million tiny bits. Without any way to play the best game ever made, I was distraught. I ran 3 miles to my workplace, only to find that I would not be allowed in to ""simply play a video game."" I quit at that moment, the thought of working alongside such inferior beings made me want to cut myself. Once I returned home I turned on my phone to try and call my friend and see how she was getting along in the game. I was dialing the digits for her phone number when a sudden realization came over me. I ran to the remains of my computer, impaling my feet on countless bits of machinery and legos to grab my keyboard and mouse. I plugged both the keyboard and mouse into the usb docking multisplit thing my grandma had given me for my birthday 6 years ago, and then plugged that into a usb to micro usb converter. I then proceeded to plug the micro usb converter into my phone, where I now had full access with my keyboard and mouse. Grinning at my excellence, I began to open the game in the browser of my phone. Finally logged in and ready to begin the day, the clock in the upper right reads 11:00 PM, and I regretfully realize I must sleep. Excited to begin tomorrow and continue the grind of a lifetime, I happily set my alarm and lay down to sleep. My dreams are haunted by visions of dying, lost items, and legos, but I sleep well enough. My alarm blares at 3 AM sharp and I snap to attention, already dressed in the clothes for the day, and I continue where I left off the previous night. Sitting on the floor by the remains of my once operable computer, I log in and begin playing. After a bit of warming up, I decide to venture towards the end goal of my quest. While on my journey, a message pop's into the middle of my screen - ""H0W T0 GET THE BEST L00T IN THE GAME, GAURANTEED TO WORK EVERY TIME"" - it's a message from my friend, included with a video. Excited to become the best player, I can't click the link fast enough. After 14 minutes of introduction in the video, the unthinkable happens. I got rick rolled. I couldn't think clearly anymore, and in a haze I left my house towards the address my friend had given me. I met her online, but we lived near eachother and we had told eachother our addresses in an attempt to meet up once before. I reach her apartment in record pace, and kick down the door screaming. I search every room, eventually finding a dark room with only a singular source of light. I flicker on the lights, and a fat girl in her late teens turns to face me. I recognize her instantly from the pictures she had sent me, and I steeled myself for what I was about to do. I began to sprint towards her, hand's reaching for ********************.************************************************************.********************************************************************************.********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.************************************************************. The walk home was enjoyable, I had forgotten my shirt but the sun was bright and the breeze was cool. It took a few hours to reach my house again, I had decided to take a scenic route back home. I open the front door quietly, I didn't want to alarm my dear aunt sally. Please excuse her, she just isn't as good looking as she used to be back when I was a young teenager. I slowly approach my phone laying on the ground in the middle of my room, and notice that I have been logged out from my game. Completely reasonable, considering my time spent away, I log back in to my account. I'm very uncreative and forgetful, so my username is always my first and last name followed by a few numbers. I always make my password 'incorrect', so that when I type it in wrong it just tells me how to type it in correctly. I am very clever. Logging in, my immediate thoughts are ripped away from me, replaced my a low groan that originates in the depths of my very being. It quickly rises in pitch, into a powerful crescendo that shatters the windows in my neighbors home. I had died while I ventured on my crusade. My extremely vaulable character, with hours of work and effort, vaporized in a mere instant because somebody had the audacity to rick roll me. My dear aunt Sally joins me as I scream, and together we reach a magnifient climax. My cry of rage dies down, replaced by a powerful sense of vengeance - the one responsible for this would pay, and with my grandest battlecry I charge out the door towards the apartment of somebody I used to call my friend. I break my previous world record pace by half, and I kick my way through the remains of her door. Remembering where her room was, I move in quickly, and lock my eyes on her shivering form, huddled bare in the corner of her room. My battlecry strengthens, and begins rising back to a glorious pitch. I move in, eager to claim my revenge on her broken form, my previous efforts from earlier aiding as she lacks the resistance to refuse me. Throwing her on her back, I glare into her eyes, and notice the fear, causing my scream to raise higher than it ever has. I *****************. ****************************************. ****************************************************************. ************************************************************.****************************************************************************************************.************************************************************.************************************************************. Finished, my scream dies down to a mere grumble, and I hear a shout from outside her apartment. I realize this is probaby a bad thing, and charge towards the wall, breaking my way through. I took an interesting route home that day, I didn't change my course for anybody - or anything. As I enter my home, I hear my dear aunt Sally upstairs, her medications must not be working as I hear her moans of pain echo. Crouching in my room at my phone, I laugh to myself. I had logged into the wrong account. Sometimes I use an alternate birthday to reflect the generation I wish I was born in. Logging in, I scream happily as I notice my characters existence, and begin to play again. Glad to once again have my level 3 wizard, I continue onwards to fight the evil chicken god.Overall 8/10, would play again.			"

Its a very addictive however this game does have a big learning curve, Expect to die... a lot... You can't get very far in this game without spending any money at all. You will need to spend money at some point due to the limits you have with 1 vault and more importantly 1 character slot. If you haven't played this game, go try it out. Its free! You will start this game not knowing anything (unless you've watched a lot of videos) and you will die a lot even if you do watch videos. Expect raging and jealousy if you play this for a while. Thats all i have to say. Overall amazing game. Keep realming!			"

												Seems like it is going to suck at first. But get in a realm with your friends and start picking up loot at the beach, for you and your pals, and they will do the same. From that point the game is only getting funnier. This game is RNG-based, meaning that you will always be excited trying to get the item you've always wanted, and sometimes rage! This game has just been sold by Kabam to Deca Games, a new company that I can assure you will fix everything that is wrong with this game, and turn it into a better one. In fact  players like us can help bring new content to the game!			"

												This game is amazing but there is some things I must tell you before playing.1: You will die and consider quitting.2: You will love the sensation of finding dank loot.3: You will see people cheering for Deca games... And you will join them.4: If you play the game for more than 24 hours you will no matter what become addicted.We belive in you Deca games... We do.			"

												Alright ladies and gentlemen, time you tell you a decently okay story (Review) of Realm of the Mad God.Now before we begin I would just like to say somethings: This game is Perma-Death but you can keep some of your items if they are in your vault. Don't be decieved by my measly 30 play hours, I probably had 10x this amount before I started playing through steam and not the RotMG website. PROSVery entertainingSimple learning curve if your new to the genreFun community and you make friends quite easilyControls are simple yet perfectHigh replay valueMany different classes to choose from with there own unique items and skillsYou get to run in hordes of players you don't even know exploring a dungeon (and I mean TONS of people)There's a server specifically for tradingFun playing solo or with friendsDepending on how you view it: Very rewarding but also very punishing (Perma-Death)Extremely fun boss fights. I mean legit your fighting a GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING PUPPET thats like hella op with you + 50 people and the fight still takes a couple minutes.---CONSMoney. All they want is your money. Basically your bombarded with ads and ""deals"" everytime you open the game. Also, the hub is legit full of items to buy but cost like $1-$15 EVEN THOUGH you can easily with the right tools earn them IN-GAME. Don't worry, you don't need to buy these items at all/spend money in general. But one thing I'd recommend buying if you enjoy the game is the New Player Starter Pack. To sum it up, new players have 7 days (1 week) to buy this starter pack or you won't get the offer ever again. It's definitely worth getting it. It's $20 but if you were to buy all the items/vault chests/coins each, it would cost you around $80. So it's worth a buy.The game was abandoned. The developers do not update the game anymore, so no new content will be added to the game.Scammers. ""But wait, you just said RotMG had a great commu-"" Shut up. I know what I said, and it really does have a great community, But everyday more and more scammers come to the game so it gets a little hard to trade with someone when your like ""I'll give you 8 Defence Pots for 1 Life Pot"" and they're like ""Nah dude big scam big scam, you give me 16 Def Pots and I'll give you 2 Mana Pots"" like that ♥♥♥♥♥ gay.But overall, if you are planning to spend money on this game, I don't recommend it. But, if you are going to f2p this game like it was originally supposed to be, sure, give this game a quick try.			"

												Imagine yourself climbing a mountain. You've been training for a long time to finally scale this behemoth. This is your leveling and maxing your character in ROTMG. Now imagine you are about to reach the top of this mountain and max your character. Then, oh no. Randy Orton slythering in, WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT. RKO OFFF THE CLIFF OUT OF NOWHERE.

												Simplistic Roguelike with suprisingly large open worlds where it's easy to find yourself in challening areas. The loot in this game is very situational, with most drops containing items from other classes, which are utterly useless unless you have friends or a group with you, but with the large amount of drops, it's easy to just ignore the useless ones. The game is also flooded by spambots advertising a WoW ""pay for gold"" system, which is also easy to ignore. For the simplicity and quirkyness, it's worth the money to buy this game ($0 is quite a bargain) but it's great to pick up and play for a few minutes in your spare time.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a great Free to Play title, and the community sometimes can be very helpful in terms of experiences and your overall enjoyment of the game. But the community is also highly critical of the game. It isnt as active as it used to be years ago, but this is mostly due to lack of content being added to the game. Hopefully in the future the game may be sold to somebody who can keep up with the community, but is still a great fast paced perma-death game. You should be able to get hours of enjoyment out of it till you start to get higher up in the ranks where things seem more and more repetitive. The community overall though is very passionate about keeping the game alive and letting it blossom. Sometimes talks of its pay to win aspects discourage new players, but you can definantly survive in the current meta without dropping any money in the game.			"

												I have played this game for many many... MANY hours and here is why you should get this game and try it out for yourself. And from the guy who has been in this game since Wild Shadow was owning this game (Which is in the Late Wild Shadow Era) you SHOULD take my review as a good one. Thx and luv ya.The Pros:1) It is just plan fun in anyway. You would basically never get bored of this game. It has in store many FUN quests and places to fight bosses.2) The people here are helpful, fun, and most of all, important and needed. This is an MMO game. If there was not many people helping you in this game, you would have a REALLY tough time playing this game. This community is HUGE (Not as huge as Team Fortress 2 Sadly...)3) Perma death. Now some people would HATE losing there powerful chars. in the game. However, for me I think it is a wonderful idea. For someone who plays PLENTIFUL amounts of Fire Emblem. This teaches you to be more careful with your character as your journey continues and when you die, it is a lesson on next time avoiding that problem (unless it is lag then I can not help you out there)4) Always getting some sort of update to it in the game. This game has fun updates to it. From adding pets to it to adding new weapons to just redoing or reskining the old ones. This game gets updates like crazy. And there is always something new to the table.The Cons:1) To get stronger in some cases... requires money. Ok so I do not do this per say. But in order to become stronger for some people you NEED money in this game to get the full experience. They do not have to even try playing the game. Just spend a few bucks and BAM (get it?) you get maxed out character with the most powerful weapons. I perfer some people to not do that unless they really need it.2) Stronger and long time members of this game could steal your loot. When you fight boss quests or dungeons. People who do the most dmg. get the loot. And if you are just starting off small and working your way up. You are probably gonna have a long time before you can actually get to were the stronger people are.3) Pets. No offense. I LUV pets with all my heart. But it just makes the game easier in every way. Sometimes when I make a character i would probably never use the pet at all since it brings more difficulty to the game. It makes some classes useless in some cases like Priest and his healing ability because the pet could heal A LOT for you.Note: If I missed anything please tell me. I will add it with your name as credit. Thx.Conclusion:In conclusion, I love this game with all my heart. Even though I kind of stopped playing it when I started playing TF2. I do perfer you try it out for yourself to have the kind of experience I had when I had played that game. Who knows I might come back to it someday. COME ON! SMILE FOR ME! :)			"

												Fun if you play with friends, but boring if you're by yourself. Positive things about it include the fact that it takes a couple of minutes to learn how to play, it's not faceroll easy as there is a constant struggle to survive, it's free, there's a lot of different classes to choose from, it has a unique system for maxing out a character's attributes, and it's a very small installation.Negative things to say about this is that there's no actual currency and trading is always really annoying because of all the autotypers everywhere, there is an excessive amount of microtransactions obviously due to the game being free, there is no variety in the realms (they're all the same♥♥♥♥♥♥but with different names), and it's just overly repetative. The realms should all be different terrains with different mobs... and  it'd be nice to have something to look forward to achieving other than fame-whoring for high scores or collecting potions to max out attributes.

I guess it plays mostly like a SHMUP with some RPG elements, and you better don't take time to get attached to your characters, because they're about to die. Often! Well, it's entirely free so why not go for a round, bopping around the landscape up against millions of critters, along with a group of other unfortunate souls who you just so happened to run into.

												Edit: I don't have 4.3 hours on this game. I have 4.3 hours on steam, but around 360 hours on the game on the web browser.This game is mostly great! It's a truely great Perma-Death MMO experience. From the monsters to the bosses, everything seems to line up and make some sort of pixely genius of a game! There are some cons of course. First of all it's pay to win to the max. You can buy max level gear and dominate throughout the game. Another problem is that it contains urgles... The laggiest thing I have ever seen in a game to date. It shoots out these orbs that make more orbs. This causes you to often die because of how much it drops your frames. Another thing is that it's Perma-Death, so if you have problems with losing all of your gear when you die, I don't recommend this game. If you add up all of the pros and cons, I think that this game deserves a good review!			"

Some of these ideas are so good that they are more polished than dungeons that are already in the game. But you guys are already doing such a great job getting straight to work fixing duping and still being able to interact with us and host fun events. Keep it up :)To any new people looking at this game it is worth playing if you can get past the constant death at the beginning.			"

												This is a great MMO to play for long and short periods of time. It can be either pay to win, and play to win so i think it's quite balanced in that era. I have seen alot of negative comments about how people have spent money on the game to buy equipment and then lost it due to deaths and are now complaining about it, perma-death is a large part of this game and when you pay to buy new stuff, you should think about how you could lose it before getting mad about it, Although I do understand the stress.All in all, the game is quite fun, is well updated and has a good amount of challenges and characters to keep the players happy.

												Honestly, this game would be fun, if it wasn't pay2play and super laggy. I just stopped playing it when I was walking to a dungeon and I hit a lag spike. Then a few seconds later, It said I died and I had to restart.3/10(I gave it a few points because the game itself is kinda fun when its not lagging like crazy)			"

												Realm of the Mad God... where to start? **SPOILERS**  ~DUH~ This game is one of the most popular MMORPG games out there and is definately a must for any patient and persistent player. It features numerous characters that you can play as and every time you log on, new surprises await you. You start off as a weak character, with really nothing good. Although as you keep at it, and gain more experience in the game, you not only level up but you get amazing weapons and power ups. Now we are getting into the deep parts of the game...There are numerous places you can travel, such as Oryx (I think thats what its called) and other portals that you find. Now the hard bit. This is the most challenging bit of the whole game... THE GODLANDS!Yes, you heard it. This place is where all the pros hang out. Here is where you can XP farm and stuff and level up, get fame and SUPER COOL ITEMS YO!Anyways, in conclusion, you need to get it if you like pixelated games and leveling up in the name of fame.TL:DR - Its a really good game and if you look to kill stuff, download it (its only like 50mB or something).

												Don't do it. I was like you, a innocent bystander, trying to play a game. this game ruined my life for the first hour I played it.Im telling you, don't do it. I was playing, until I had gotten kidnapped by the jack in the box man. He had taken me to narnia were I batled pixelated ogres and had a magical staff the shot pixel turds of doom. I had done this for an hour, I had all the stuff, I was the richest guy in the game. But then...It happend. Mom woke me up. I coudn't go back to narnia, no matter how hard I tried. I found love in narnia, had kids....I had a life in narnia.Then I played this game and hated it.			"

												This game is very good for an indie but can get a bit boring at times, but most of the time is very enjoyable killing a variety of monsters and bosses while collected interesting and creative weapons and miscs. All in all, a good game that is definetely worth a try even if its not for you. This can either be very addictive and want you to play more all the time or you will hate it. But, in my opinion, a great and adverturous game. Give it a try.			"

												Edit: I don't have 4.3 hours on this game. I have 4.3 hours on steam, but around 360 hours on the game on the web browser.This game is mostly great! It's a truely great Perma-Death MMO experience. From the monsters to the bosses, everything seems to line up and make some sort of pixely genius of a game! There are some cons of course. First of all it's pay to win to the max. You can buy max level gear and dominate throughout the game. Another problem is that it contains urgles... The laggiest thing I have ever seen in a game to date. It shoots out these orbs that make more orbs. This causes you to often die because of how much it drops your frames. Another thing is that it's Perma-Death, so if you have problems with losing all of your gear when you die, I don't recommend this game. If you add up all of the pros and cons, I think that this game deserves a good review!			"

												A good game. There are a lot of bad reviews about it and about how Kabam has ""ruined"" the game. In all honestly, all they did was add the ability to buy items (which can ALL be obtained by a little hard work), take away ammys, and add pets. This game is also very anti care-bear... When you die you loose all loot on your character and all the stats of that character. So be careful, I suggest you find a good guild to join who can show you the ropes if you really wanna get good. But overall, its a good game. If you like high stakes games, then try this out! You might just like it,			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a massively multiplayer online shooter video game created by Wild Shadow Studios (acquired by Kabam in June 2012, and later sold to Deca Games in July 2016) and Spry Fox. It was in public beta from January 2010 and the browser version launched on June 20, 2011.[2] On February 20, 2012 the game was made available on the digital distribution platform Steam for Microsoft Windows and OS X.[3]The game has been described as a ""massively-multiplayer cooperative bullet hell shooter"" with an 8 bit pixelated art style.[2] Players control characters who have been transported to the realm of Oryx (the titular Mad God) to become food for his many minions and abominations, which the players must dispatch. Central to the design of the game is the fact that character death is permanent. Upon death, the player's character is lost along with all carried equipment, although the player may store a number of items for safekeeping in a limited capacity vault away from danger. Different character choices in class also help make the game more diverse and help to support teamwork.The game is free-to-play with optional in-game micro-transactions. Items which can be bought with optional transactions include in-game equipment vary from high-level equipment, pets that provide aid to the player (by attacking enemies, paralyzing enemies, healing the character, restoring the character's magic points, and acting as a decoy) increased storage space, and aesthetic features such as skins, cloths and dyes.[4]This game client is written in Flash and can be played in-browser on the official site, on Kongregate, or it can be downloaded from the Google Chrome Web Store. Realm of the Mad God is also available on Steam.[5]Contents  [hide] 1	Gameplay2	Development3	Reception4	References5	External linksGameplay[edit]The game consists of players shooting projectiles from their weapons and destroying enemies to earn experience, fame, and equipment. A character moves around using the WASD keys (though other controls can be chosen) and uses the mouse to aim and clicks to shoot.[6] Contrary to usual practice in MMOs, the experience for killing monsters is awarded in full to each player present, rather than split. This, along with the possibility of teleporting to any player on the map instantly and a cooldown of 10 seconds to teleport again, makes it very easy and attractive to team up.After a certain amount of experience has been earned, the player levels up and their attributes are raised, allowing them to fight more powerful enemies and unlock more classes. The maximum level a player can achieve is level 20. The player can then gain ""fame"" on their character, which eventually grants permanent stars that indicate accomplishment and may entitle one to a place on the game's leaderboards upon death. Character death is permanent, meaning that the character's items and statistics are lost.Players begin their game sessions in the Nexus, a safe haven which can be teleported to at any time. In the Nexus, players may buy consumables using gold purchased with real-life money or they may trade with another character. Another currency is fame, gained when you die. The player enters realms (i.e. game map instances present on the server). Each of these realms are named after powerful monsters in the game(i.e. Medusa, Djinn, Cyclops, Beholder). The capacity of each realm is 85 people at once, and a full realm cannot be entered until a player in it dies or leaves. However, if many players enter a realm at the same time, it can exceed 85.Players fight a monster in game. HUD elements such as the inventory can be seen on the right-hand side.During gameplay, the player is directed to ""quest"" monsters indicated by a red marker at the edge of the game window. As they level up in the realm, they are guided from the ""Lowlands"" areas at the edges of the map, through the ""Midlands"" and ""Highlands"" to the more difficult ""Godlands"" in the center of the map. The Godlands hosts powerful monsters known as the Gods of the Realm. Completing certain quests allows ""event"" bosses to spawn, which can be killed to obtain higher-tier loot and open portals to the rarest dungeons.Killing high-level monsters can grant the player permanent stat boost potions, which are rare and exist in eight variations that correspond to the major attributes(life, mana, vitality, wisdom, defense, dexterity, attack, and speed). Consuming stat potions allows the player to improve their characters stats after reaching the highest level, which can be done until the attribute is maxed out (indicated by its text turning gold). Upon death, the size of the grave left behind corresponds to the number of stats maxed. Items could previously be retrieved from graves, but this functionality was removed as it led to players luring others to their doom to loot their graves.The 14 classes currently available are Wizard, Priest, Archer, Rogue, Warrior, Knight, Paladin, Assassin, Necromancer, Huntress, Mystic, Trickster, Ninja, and Sorcerer. Players begin with only the Wizard class unlocked and successively unlock the remaining classes as they gain experience with each class.[7] There are 8 main stats, defense, attack, speed, dexterity, vitality, wisdom, mana, and life. Each class has its own weapon, armor and ability specifications, base statistic averages and statistic caps. For example, Warriors, Knights, and Paladins have high defense and are the only ones that can use swords and heavy armor, while the Assassin, Rogue and Trickster have the highest potential movement speed and dexterity (rate of fire) statistics and can only use daggers and hide armor.Items are classified into tiers, with higher tier items having better stats. Tiers range from T0-T12 for weapons, T1-T13 for armors, T0-T6 for rings, and T0-T6 for abilities.[8] Some items are un-tiered, giving them a special classification. These items are typically unique, with examples including limited use items, powerful weapons, armor, rings, abilities, and April Fools' Day accouterments. The best items appear in special bags, known as White bags, Purple bags, Cyan Bags, or Potion Bags. These Bags will only drop for players who have delivered a certain percentage of the monster's damage, and can only be seen and picked up by the player it dropped for. Un-tiered (UT) items are currently ""Soulbound"" which means it is unable to get picked up by any other player or traded to another player.The game features guilds, each allowing for a maximum of 50 players. A guild costs the founding player 1000 fame to name and create, and has a guild hall which can be accessed by members of the guild. Upon a member's death, guild fame is earned proportionally to the amount of fame that the player earned. Guilds can buy upgrades such as larger guild halls and cosmetic features with the guild fame.[9]Development[edit]The game was originally created by Alex Carobus and Rob Shillingsburg, founders of Wild Shadow Studios, for TIGSource's ""Assemblee Competition"" in October 2009, which limited the competitors to a very small sample of art resources.[10] The developers described the aim of the game was to ""shake things up by breaking as many MMO ‘rules’ as we could""[11] It was noticed and received a good response from players,[12] prompting the developers to work on a full game. The game was finally launched in a beta stage on January 10, 2010.[10]Following the initial launch, Spry Fox joined the development team, helping bring the game to a full release out of beta on June 20, 2011.To help fund the game's development, optional microtransactions were added to the game, drawing a mixed response from players.[13] The developers defended the microtransactions, saying ""they seemed like the most convenient, customer-friendly way to pay for the game... those that passionately love the game, can spend as much as they want, helping us to grow the game over time.""The game has been			"

Or Kabam so-called making this game ""P2W"", because implying a game is P2W. Means you can be the ""best"" within' 5 minutes using, money. But, you can't, Realm takes skill, if some noob comes around and buys full nexus tops, he's just going to die with it. And honestly, Kabam has to make money some-how.			"

												Lmao if anyone says this game is Pay to win then they are just trash at the game. I used to have only 1 character and I could do everything that people who payed money could do in game minus getting the cosmetics but those are not mandatory to having fun in this game. It is true that spending money to buy more character slots does make the game more fun but it is not needed. Most skins can be bought with items you get in game but it will take time or luck to get them. The game is really fun but you have to watch out of the lag spikes. When you die you do not come back. Rip character and you gotta start again but that is what makes this game fun.			"

												1000+ hours on Browser... 1000+ Hours on Steam.  Once had one of the best Ninjas on the Leaderboards.  Played in the back of Computer Class WHILE taking a ♥♥♥♥ing test. (which I failed, soloed Oryx though!) (wurf).  Realm of the Mad God was by far one of the best games of all time for me and after over four years i'm still kickin it.  If you want a game with Rogue-like elements involved that isn't Tales of Maj'eyal that you can sink a LOT of time in, i highly reccommend RotMG.   The pay to win elements of the game honestly don't matter.  You don't have to buy top Tier gear to be successful in this game.  Just git gud scrub!  Four + years and i still haven't spent a dime on Gear, Keys or Pet Food.  Vault Space and Character slots go a LONG WAY if you get good at the game however.  Beware of Hackers. They are a nuisance.  Play legit and be Proud of your accomplishments.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a massively multiplayer online shooter video game created by Wild Shadow Studios (acquired by Kabam in June 2012, and later sold to Deca Games in July 2016) and Spry Fox. It was in public beta from January 2010 and the browser version launched on June 20, 2011.[2] On February 20, 2012 the game was made available on the digital distribution platform Steam for Microsoft Windows and OS X.[3]The game has been described as a ""massively-multiplayer cooperative bullet hell shooter"" with an 8 bit pixelated art style.[2] Players control characters who have been transported to the realm of Oryx (the titular Mad God) to become food for his many minions and abominations, which the players must dispatch. Central to the design of the game is the fact that character death is permanent. Upon death, the player's character is lost along with all carried equipment, although the player may store a number of items for safekeeping in a limited capacity vault away from danger.

It's a pretty fun game, you unlock classes, fight, level up and play online. If you rage quit to when you loose your stuff, I don't reccomend this game. If you die you loose your characters level, items and other stuff. That's the only down side. That's why I reccomend ""Realm of The Mad God.""			"

												Where do I begin?Rotmg is a addictive fun game that I have spent countless hours playing.  People claim Rotmg is all p2w but it is not.  Istarted fromthe bottom and a now very wealthy in the game with only spending a small amount of money on the game let alone any at all.  The starter package is all you need in order to be set forever on the game.  Great game for those who are patient.			"

												1000+ hours on Browser... 1000+ Hours on Steam.  Once had one of the best Ninjas on the Leaderboards.  Played in the back of Computer Class WHILE taking a ♥♥♥♥ing test. (which I failed, soloed Oryx though!) (wurf).  Realm of the Mad God was by far one of the best games of all time for me and after over four years i'm still kickin it.  If you want a game with Rogue-like elements involved that isn't Tales of Maj'eyal that you can sink a LOT of time in, i highly reccommend RotMG.   The pay to win elements of the game honestly don't matter.  You don't have to buy top Tier gear to be successful in this game.  Just git gud scrub!  Four + years and i still haven't spent a dime on Gear, Keys or Pet Food.  Vault Space and Character slots go a LONG WAY if you get good at the game however.  Beware of Hackers. They are a nuisance.  Play legit and be Proud of your accomplishments.			"

Or Kabam so-called making this game ""P2W"", because implying a game is P2W. Means you can be the ""best"" within' 5 minutes using, money. But, you can't, Realm takes skill, if some noob comes around and buys full nexus tops, he's just going to die with it. And honestly, Kabam has to make money some-how.			"

												A good game. There are a lot of bad reviews about it and about how Kabam has ""ruined"" the game. In all honestly, all they did was add the ability to buy items (which can ALL be obtained by a little hard work), take away ammys, and add pets. This game is also very anti care-bear... When you die you loose all loot on your character and all the stats of that character. So be careful, I suggest you find a good guild to join who can show you the ropes if you really wanna get good. But overall, its a good game. If you like high stakes games, then try this out! You might just like it,			"

												All you Kabam haters: I feel you, I've been playing this since some of the early public builds and I've seen a fare share of stupidity on the part of Devs. Build 7-9 was the last time I played Co-op Dungeons (they took stat pots out of God Lands) and learning to solo dungeons with any character was a game changer for me personally.Play to Win? No, all the cash you spend isn't gonna get you any better at the game despite all the loot you purchase, we've all seen newbs die horribly with tops. A Stock newb with purchased tops won't hold a candle to a maxed character with mid-tier gear, and they don't officially sell stat pots/UT items in game so that swag is up to the player, not the wallet.After Lvl 20 with any character your top priority is Stat pot acquisition. Yes it can be a grind, and perma death is real, but this game would be junk without perma death. My advice: Lay down the 10-20 bucks on a extra character slot and some storage chests. You will Die lots, you will crap Keyboards sideways, and you will quit, perhaps even forever. But you could also kick♥♥♥♥♥Pets made this game so easy anyway that I will agree with some people: It was a better realm under WildShadow, but I still recommend it to anyone wanting to flex their skills and strut their gear.

												What a great game this is. It's similar to WoW just that it isn't much of an RPG and that it is more of a 2D game. You fight monster, complete quests, gather rare loot, and become a powerfully maxed character. Basically the goal of the game is to max your character - each character has a max stat number, and there are 8 stats in the game. When you have maxed a stat it will appear yellow(gold). Once you have maxed all your stats you will be 8/8 maxed. If you only have 2 stats maxed you will be 2/8, and if you have 3 stats maxed you are 3/8, and so on... I reccomend this game for those who like MMO's and those who just want to be very powerful. There is also trading in the game and price guides which use the currency 'def', which stands for 1 defense potion. There is also a bad guy in the game whos name is 'Oryx the Mad God', and you have to kill him as well :). Good luck realming!			"

												I wasn't an old player in this game - I started playing this game when my friend introduced me to the game.I didn't like it much.First of all, there are constantly people crowding around the nexus, spamming messages like ""EY BUY MY STUFF ON THIS RANDOM WEBSITE!"". Not just one person either; imagine a whole army of people, afk, just spamming useless messages using bots.Second of all, really good loot is hard to come by. You play for a long time, and if you're really lucky, you MIGHT get T3 or T4 items. I once played through for three hours, but not get any items above T4. Good items? They're all in the shops, and all of them are super OP and great. Free to play? B*tch please, this ain't no free to play game. People who pay killsteal you at boss battles, and the others, the freemium players, they won't get anything because the mob of P2Ps cleared everything.If Kabam stopped owning this game, I would play it more.Otherwise, it's (almost) a complete piece of sh*t.

												I dumped at least 2k hours into this game on the browser version. I played for about 3 years before quitting out of boredom. This game is great, and very well made... but VERY poorly managed. Anyone that has been playing this game for at least 2 1/2 years will tell you all about how they hate Kabam for screwing up everything. This is true, however the game is not bad because of the mismanagement of Kabam. Kabam bought this game from Wild Shadow Studios, who were the original makers of the game, and started taking the game in a direction that the community was not too fond of. Before that, the game was very fun and spectacularly addicting... and it still is. The point is... don't get caught up in all the people telling you this game is terrible because of the mismanagement. If you like roguelike MMORPGs, this is one of the best, and easily my favorite.

This game was built to be the first stepping stone to ruining your life. HOWEVER.I enjoyed it thoroughly on my first 100 to 200 hours. It was fun. Unlocking each class was really fun. However, it gets dull and boring with repetititivity.			"

												I wasn't an old player in this game - I started playing this game when my friend introduced me to the game.I didn't like it much.First of all, there are constantly people crowding around the nexus, spamming messages like ""EY BUY MY STUFF ON THIS RANDOM WEBSITE!"". Not just one person either; imagine a whole army of people, afk, just spamming useless messages using bots.Second of all, really good loot is hard to come by. You play for a long time, and if you're really lucky, you MIGHT get T3 or T4 items. I once played through for three hours, but not get any items above T4. Good items? They're all in the shops, and all of them are super OP and great. Free to play? B*tch please, this ain't no free to play game. People who pay killsteal you at boss battles, and the others, the freemium players, they won't get anything because the mob of P2Ps cleared everything.If Kabam stopped owning this game, I would play it more.Otherwise, it's (almost) a complete piece of sh*t.

												What a great game this is. It's similar to WoW just that it isn't much of an RPG and that it is more of a 2D game. You fight monster, complete quests, gather rare loot, and become a powerfully maxed character. Basically the goal of the game is to max your character - each character has a max stat number, and there are 8 stats in the game. When you have maxed a stat it will appear yellow(gold). Once you have maxed all your stats you will be 8/8 maxed. If you only have 2 stats maxed you will be 2/8, and if you have 3 stats maxed you are 3/8, and so on... I reccomend this game for those who like MMO's and those who just want to be very powerful. There is also trading in the game and price guides which use the currency 'def', which stands for 1 defense potion. There is also a bad guy in the game whos name is 'Oryx the Mad God', and you have to kill him as well :). Good luck realming!			"

												I dumped at least 2k hours into this game on the browser version. I played for about 3 years before quitting out of boredom. This game is great, and very well made... but VERY poorly managed. Anyone that has been playing this game for at least 2 1/2 years will tell you all about how they hate Kabam for screwing up everything. This is true, however the game is not bad because of the mismanagement of Kabam. Kabam bought this game from Wild Shadow Studios, who were the original makers of the game, and started taking the game in a direction that the community was not too fond of. Before that, the game was very fun and spectacularly addicting... and it still is. The point is... don't get caught up in all the people telling you this game is terrible because of the mismanagement. If you like roguelike MMORPGs, this is one of the best, and easily my favorite.

												Great game! 400+ Hours of gametime for me... i would rate 7/10.Kabam bought this game from Wildshadow Studios, then Kabam took developers off the game leaving currently 2 developers working on this game... Ive written the review on July 10, 2015. Using that time im not expecting any updates for the next 6 months, but honestly if Kabam doesnt pick up their brain off the floor there will not be a Realm of the Mad God anymore. In my opinion we have to buy more ""realm gold"" so they can realize Realm of the Mad God actualy makes them money, this will also support the current developers. I love this game and i would hate to see it fall, it has a great community and amazing gameplay! I would recommend this game to anyone who is into ""CS:GO"" or just likes skill based games(this game takes skill). It is pay to win in a sense, but you can obtain almost any item in the game by playing it.			"

												I used to play the Realm of the Mad God online before it was cool, jk, before I had a Steam account, and I still love playing it with friends. It is a very addictive 8-bit fast action RPG which I play from time to time.Here comes the piece of advice about the gameplay: don't get too attached to your characters, you are gonna die, a lot. Even if you have managed to reach the max level with a class and have your inventory full of overpowered items, you'll eventually die and lose everything. Save high level items that your class can't use in your chest so when you die, because you'll die, you can try a new class with high level items from the beginning.Moral of the game: spam the shot click, get cutty pets, do random♥♥♥♥♥♥with random players along the map, defeat Oryx and overall don't get this game too serious, play it when you are stressed and want to unwind yourself.

Currently I refuse to play the game, not because the game is bad (I do want to play it) but the current issues sorrounding it makes it hard to enjoy the game since it may take 10 hours to be where you want to be and 1 second of server lag or delay to lose it all.  With more content and server maintenance I'd happily play this game again. Until then, I hope any new players enjoy it while they can.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a Free to play MMORPG.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It is a 2D Bullet Hell shooter game with RPG elements.  The artwork is 8-bit pixelated.  The game has Permadeath, you die you have to start over.   There is CoOpative gameplay with other players on each server.  The theme of the artwork is Fantasy.Try it if you like arcade bullet hell shoot em up.For more info:

												After 3 years of crapshoot and torture, a great company called DECA Games have taken ROTMG into their own matters and has done more to satisfy and help the community than Kabam could ever do, with Kabam being completely ignoring, ungrateful, and oblivious to the community. Many loved events ROTMG has showcased were ignored and never brought back, but instead adding more pay 2 win features as a result. I have the courage to believe in DECA games to make ROTMG another major game that experienced and newbie players can enjoy.			"

												This game is fun..only after you put a couple hundred hours into it after you get bombarded with offers about stuff to buy. This game is definitely something I now think of when I hear ""pay to play"". It's only fun if you have a perfect character but then that ends up dying and you're basically screwed. But don't worry! You can get another character slot! ...by paying real life money. This game is really unique in the fact of how many classes there are. But there's also the fact that the classes are unbalancedOne person can just be a knight and possibly camp because they're so tanky which could prevent others from getting loot.If you get into this game beware, you'll eventaully end up spending money on one of the various packs that are shoved in your face cause you figure ""Why the hell not?"" but I'd advise that you absolutely do not spend any money on this game.For one thing, you're eventually going to get bored of this game and soon find out you have no reason to play it anymore, as did I find out after realizing how boring and unfun/unbalanced it is to get a good character, without paying of course, which is why my hours for this game is considerabley lower and or higher than others who reviewed this game.I honestly used to think this game was fun, me and my 2 other friends always used to play it. Then one of my friends eventually got bored of it because his best character died. Me and my friend were still doing fine so we continued. I eventually got 2 great characters that both ended up dying due to the unfairness of this game. I tried to start up again with another character but after a week I couldn't bring myself to do it, which is how I eventually quit the game. My friend still plays and I honestly don't get how he does. This game is also heavily relied on luck through what items you get. You may have noticed how I've been complaining about character deaths and there's one word to explain why: permadeath.This game, has permadeath, once you die, no matter how good your character is, no matter how good his equipment is, no matter how many much you claim you pressed the nexus button, you will start all the way from the beginning with a level one character with basic default equipment, what makes the permadeath unfair is that even the items you pay ACTUAL MONEY FOR, you still lose when your character dies. Which is why I advise you to not spend any actual money on this game because you will eventually die and lose the items you paid for which essentially means you lost and wasted money.Another thing that makes this game unbalanced and even more P2W is the pets.Like others have stated there's a pet system in this game that can do various things (heal you, attack, etc)But to make your pets good, you have to feed themAnd you do that by using food, either high tier items (hard to get) or by paying money just to satisfy some pixels on a screen.Here's some pros and cons to sum up those couple paragraphs;Pro's:Fun (by yourself or with friends)Unique class systemGood guild systemRewarding when you actually get lootCons:EXTREMELY pay to playPermadeath not executed that greatlyUnbalanced to a great degreePet system reliant on payingEssentially a time wasterI find it very hard to recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a free game on steam that is very heavily pay to play. If you do decide to play this game I heavily advise you  to not spend any money on it because you will eventually get bored of it and the money you spent will be gone into the toilet. This game used to be more fun before Kabam made as pay to play as it is today.			"

												Realm Of The Mad god Is A Pretty fun game! But it has its drawbacks. Living/playing this game feels like we have a hated dictator that EVERYONE hates. Kabam. Although I do not play on steam i have around 2000 hours on the Chrome browser ( www.RealmOftheMadGod.com) and i have seen the changes that kabam has made. First they implemented pets, Seemed like a good idea, UNTILL IT GIVES YOU 100 HP EVERY 5 SEC (Extremely OverPowered, you never die) Witch is cool! if you earn it. But Kabam has made this game Pay-To-Win. So there can be a 5 yearold who Grabs his moms credit card and just Buys boatloads of items and buys an OP pet and whaddya know? Hes Equal to Henez Or Kalle or Any of those skilled players (Charactar and item wise ples dont H8 , btw henez and kalle ROTMG legends). This is aggrovating to see. Overall i think this game is amazing, simply incredible, how much it is skill and luck based, the grinding, the glory of getting a item you have been hunting for, the "" NOOO, THIS CANNOT BE!"" of Oryx 1 and Oryx 2 dying, is Amazing. I Have to say its even kinda fun when your charactar dies ( Unless its unfair, such as server lagg, R.I.P 6/8 knight) so overall this game is amazing, and it has the potential and the community (Shout out to all them guys on youtube twitch kabam fourms and even the players.) But the fact that a company is driving this game into the ground to get EXCESS money is Ridiculous. Hopefully another company will buy this game, And then , I will feel happy to come back home.			"

												This game was the first steam game I got, because I had no money and could only play free games. I was very pleased with this game, and I was glad this was my first game within the bullet hell genre unless you count Contra. although I must say this game is extremely frustrating in that if you die, you are dead forever much like in a RogueLike game and have to make a new character. I was especially frustrated when I was about to get my first level 20, then he died. I also find it almost impossible not to go after enemies much stronger than me in hope that I get the plentiful amouts of delichious Exp they give me. Needless to say I died almost 99.75+25.11-.1% of the time, not good odds.			"

 Great F2P Game  Great Bullet-Hell MMO , which is F2P. It offers alot of classes, items , realms , dungeons , monsters and gods. It got prema death , which  made me better player overall. When u die there is no way to retrieve your character. U lose all your items and gear u had on this character. If u find good stuff u can save it in the Vault and later use it with other character. Great leveling system and ranking system. The leveling system is simple: U kill an enemy and u get XP , u got 20 levels , when u reach Level 20 , u dont get anymore XP and instead u get FAME . The fame is for the ranked system. With every class ,when u earn FAME , u complete your class quest. Every completed class quest gives u Star. When u get alot of stars , for example : 28 u get  Red Star  Which is your rank. Thats how the level and ranked system work. Alot of people say the game is P2W. Well the answer is  NO . Yes u can buy all the items from the start with real money , but if u play alot and try harder , u can take these items  from the dungeons and stuff. So the game is  NOT P2W .  There is a few bad things in the game  There is  ALOT OF BOTS AND HACKERS  , and the developers dont do anything about it.  The servers sometimes stops or lags alot Theres alot of spammers on the Nexus ( Spawn ) Overall i recommend this game , or atlest try it. Its good F2P and alot of fun.  EDIT: The game is now acquired by DECA GAMES. They promise to fix all the hackers , bots and server issues. I hope they finally fix the game and continiue expanding it !  "

												After 200+ hours on steam and countless on the web i have come to the conclusion that this game is wholly not worth it.One main thing that has finally sent me over the edge on this opinon of my personal fav dungeon crawler is that THIS GAME HAS ZERO SUPPORT, now one may say had they been playing for a while ""Stan! Stan! come now deca answer Support tickets reguarding bannings very quickly"" And while these people would be right about that, Deca (The current dev team) seem to be absent when it comes to game lag, input lag, loot and economy balancing and unjust player death, to name a few. To elaborate on the lag this game faces on both ends Stems mostly from the game being coded in flash thus limmiting the game heavily. On the front of economy,loot... the sale of end game items only effects the economy (GOOD ITEMS DOES NOT A GOOD PLAYER MAKE) Driving prices down, but who cares! as the most glaring problems apper in this game when you realise That this game has no progression in the end game and no reason to be better. IE in a game like chess you play to be better at the game than other players, or like quake as you get better at the game you are clearly better than new players and you have the skill to show for it. Now realm of the mad cuck does have skill as better players can dodge duck and dive like the best of em but that doesn't matter in a game like realm as the loot is random meaning no matter how good you are you will never be rewarded for your skill save for being spared for the crule hand of death, Oh wait going back to the lag this game faces Skill will not save you from the lag no matter how hard you try in this game the lag will get you at some point. This brings us to the crux of my little rant here Skill does nothing in this game and means nothing therefore the question is begged!WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME WHERE YOU ARE NOT REWARDED FOR SKILL, PUNISHED FOR THINGS OUT OF YOUR CONTROLL AND THEN NOT EVEN GIVEN AN ANWSER AS TO WHY?(Although i can not find the total ernings of realm (mostly from lack of trying) i can say that there are currently positions ranging 20k-80k per year, they have to money to remake realm and then some. And while they're at it put in a better guild/party system and make class varitey an actual thing please)			"

I've been dedicated to this game for four years and i've witnessed 2 owners and i'm about to witness my 3rd. This game is worth trying out if you are into MMO's and Dank communitys, there are some toxic players but how would this be a good game without some ♥♥♥♥ers am i right?

												""Pay to win, pay to win, pay to win... waa waa waa"", seems taht's all people say about this game. My question is, when exactly does this game end and you ""win""? what the hell are you guys talking about? this game never ends and your not battling against other players so... yeah. Here's the deal, you do have to pay but only for chests for your character to keep loot. How many is completley up to you and at $5 a pop, it can get pricey. I, myself, have only have about 6 chests. Paying for weapons, armor, speacial attacks and other crap is only if your an impatient punk (no offense to anyone just my opinion). Never purchased any of that and i've done fine ....kinda HA! One more charcter slot will help out too. Another charcter not in use can also double as a makeshift chest. See, I'm an old school gamer, definetly played Gauntlet on the NES more than this game. Thats another thing that got me with this game, kind of a modern gauntlet but played online. So having that background and just the type of gamer that I am, I don't mind the grind. The blood, sweat and tears type♥♥♥♥♥♥ Most people will just start the game, try to rush in, die and say this game sucks when in reality its quite the oppisite. You can not, i repeat, YOU CAN NOT just rush into this game. It takes time to really get to know the enimies and their tactics. Not to mention the types of areas in the game AND how to play as the character type your using.  CHARACTERS: I'm not gonna get too into the types and stuff but just run it down simple. Alot of people are impatient and just want to go head first into evrything. YOU CANT... unless your a ""tank/battle"" type character. Knights, warriors and paladins are the type thats more up close and personal. Bottom line, you have a sword type weapon, up close and personal. Staff or bow, keep your distance. This does have some variances with character types. Remeber this and you wont die ...... as much HA!  DEATH: You die, thats it. its fustrating and horrible. Lose your character, his/her level and everything it was carrying and start all over again after choosing another character (same class or not and whatever you have available via unlocking)  REALM ITSELF: For beginners, you definetly want to stay on the outskirts of the map. The beaches and lightly wooded areas. The further/deeper you go, the harder it gets. Pretty plane and simple, keeping it short and simple.  CHARACTER LEVELS: It just goes up to level 20 and thats it. When you first start getting to level 20 can be challenging. Once you reach 20 ""pots"" collected in dungeons, dungeon bosses and certain other enemies can increase your stats as they're locked at LVL 20. You can also save them instead of consuming and use them as in-game currency. Which leads to my last point...  POTS: This can be consumed to increase your current characters stats once they're at level 20 (can be consumed before that tho, if you want, idk). They can also be saved (this is where those chests come in handy for sure) to be used with another character later in time. They can also be used as in-game currency to buy weapons and such. Prices for these tend to change here and there (i go online to check current stats). So doing this, while does take some skill and time, can help to get things without buying them with real money.  OTHER STUFF: Pets and stuff.... idk, figure it out. Play the game.            Bottom line, it's a good game. Just a modern, online Gauntlet i think. ""Pay to win"", not really. Only if you cant wait and don't want to do the grind. But then whats the fun, i ask. I feel better about starting from scratch and making personal. If you do want to buy weapoms and crap, i recommend waiting till your pretty familiar with the game and can get arounbd ok, that way you wont die right away and lose your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thats pretty much it. Dont forget to try different servers and switch thing up a bit.          Oh and not to mention this game does not require you to play any amount of time. I find it good to kill 10-20min here and there.			"

												Do you remember when this game was a browser based free to play game? Do you remember playing it for your first time years ago, when all players were equal and skill was required to rise in the ranks? I do, I remember when this game was first released, I've been around since the beggining, and I miss it. Anyone new to ROTMG you've missed the time when the game was in it's prime, before it became heavily pay to win.  The game has definitely retained it's difficulty, and some of the new changes are cool and fun, but in whole the community that this game built was shattered when it was bought out. Many people left, veterans and legends in the games history alike.Aside from the past, the current ROTMG I would not reccomend for anyone who is looking for a casual experience, this game takes some time to progress through, and one screw up will send you hurtling back to square one with nothing to show for your hardships and time. It's one of those games where you have to persist and if you really want to move forward quickly you'll have to learn how to speak ROTMG slang and get in with the community, join a guild, make a group, farm. Their will be a lot of farming once you reach the level cap.			"

												Perma-Death really is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in this game. I love the concept, the graphics and gameplay are fun and smooth but other than that I don't reccomend it because of Perma-Death. I like having the same character, and having many levels and skills to unlock. In this, there's only a few levels per character, and there's only so much to explore. If they remove perma-death, and increase the amount of levels and skills, I would reccomend this game. Until then, I don't reccomend this game.			"

												""Pay to win, pay to win, pay to win... waa waa waa"", seems taht's all people say about this game. My question is, when exactly does this game end and you ""win""? what the hell are you guys talking about? this game never ends and your not battling against other players so... yeah. Here's the deal, you do have to pay but only for chests for your character to keep loot. How many is completley up to you and at $5 a pop, it can get pricey. I, myself, have only have about 6 chests. Paying for weapons, armor, speacial attacks and other crap is only if your an impatient punk (no offense to anyone just my opinion). Never purchased any of that and i've done fine ....kinda HA! One more charcter slot will help out too. Another charcter not in use can also double as a makeshift chest. See, I'm an old school gamer, definetly played Gauntlet on the NES more than this game. Thats another thing that got me with this game, kind of a modern gauntlet but played online. So having that background and just the type of gamer that I am, I don't mind the grind. The blood, sweat and tears type♥♥♥♥♥♥ Most people will just start the game, try to rush in, die and say this game sucks when in reality its quite the oppisite. You can not, i repeat, YOU CAN NOT just rush into this game. It takes time to really get to know the enimies and their tactics. Not to mention the types of areas in the game AND how to play as the character type your using.  CHARACTERS: I'm not gonna get too into the types and stuff but just run it down simple. Alot of people are impatient and just want to go head first into evrything. YOU CANT... unless your a ""tank/battle"" type character. Knights, warriors and paladins are the type thats more up close and personal. Bottom line, you have a sword type weapon, up close and personal. Staff or bow, keep your distance. This does have some variances with character types. Remeber this and you wont die ...... as much HA!  DEATH: You die, thats it. its fustrating and horrible. Lose your character, his/her level and everything it was carrying and start all over again after choosing another character (same class or not and whatever you have available via unlocking)  REALM ITSELF: For beginners, you definetly want to stay on the outskirts of the map. The beaches and lightly wooded areas. The further/deeper you go, the harder it gets. Pretty plane and simple, keeping it short and simple.  CHARACTER LEVELS: It just goes up to level 20 and thats it. When you first start getting to level 20 can be challenging. Once you reach 20 ""pots"" collected in dungeons, dungeon bosses and certain other enemies can increase your stats as they're locked at LVL 20. You can also save them instead of consuming and use them as in-game currency. Which leads to my last point...  POTS: This can be consumed to increase your current characters stats once they're at level 20 (can be consumed before that tho, if you want, idk). They can also be saved (this is where those chests come in handy for sure) to be used with another character later in time. They can also be used as in-game currency to buy weapons and such. Prices for these tend to change here and there (i go online to check current stats). So doing this, while does take some skill and time, can help to get things without buying them with real money.  OTHER STUFF: Pets and stuff.... idk, figure it out. Play the game.            Bottom line, it's a good game. Just a modern, online Gauntlet i think. ""Pay to win"", not really. Only if you cant wait and don't want to do the grind. But then whats the fun, i ask. I feel better about starting from scratch and making personal. If you do want to buy weapoms and crap, i recommend waiting till your pretty familiar with the game and can get arounbd ok, that way you wont die right away and lose your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thats pretty much it. Dont forget to try different servers and switch thing up a bit.          Oh and not to mention this game does not require you to play any amount of time. I find it good to kill 10-20min here and there.			"

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!although it is suposedly P2W it's really not as bad as people think it is.people who spend money on this game without playing for at least half a year first will LOSE ALL THEIR OP STUFF TO A BEACH MONSTER.(the lowest lvl mobs in the game). well they won't really but they will die much sooner than a person who has played a lot longer with less gear will.the path to greatness is very long and hard but if you take risks, have a few deaths and play a lot you will definitly get better stuff and skills.if you think a long review like this coming from a person with less than 10 hours may be futile and wrong but i only got it on steam recently and have other accounts.if you want any advice about things such as how to max, look for me in game on the asia-southeast server as nommomnom!have fun!!!

Kabam gives no ♥♥♥♥s about cheating, scamming, pay-to-win unfairness, level-grinding bots, the community's every-man-for-himself strategy when facing Oryx, or message/advertisement flooding by spam accounts. Seriously, join the server called ""USWest3"" and count the number of spam accounts you see before you lose connection.If you think this is Kabam's first screw-up, send a bug report to the tech support of ""Kingdoms of Camelot: Battle for the North,"" and count the weeks before they reply with no recollection of what you stated in your report.With all of that noted, it's a fun way to waste time at school.

												Realm of the Made God is tough.  Especially if you aren't used to this kind of game.  It is an MMO with pixel graphics, a fairly active player base with quite a few servers, oh and perma death.  Did I mention that before?  No?  Well, that's a thing.  You start out with one class, the Wizard.  Play the game, and most likely die a lot, before eventually earning more classes.  The longer you live, the more...""Fame makes a man take things over!  Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow!  Fame, puts you there where things are hollow!  Fame!""  Sorry...the more fame you get.  Fame can be spent on a number of things, mostly related to pets and dungeons.  If you're just really bad, then head over to the EUWest2 server, and teleport to the fame train, where you will reach max level in only a few minutes if you are careful enough, and can stay to earn fame too.  As for combat, never stop moving.  Ever.  Bullet hell.  The only place it is safe to stand still and do nothing is Nexus, which if you're about to die is also a good place to teleport to to save yourself.  You have one attack skill, 4 equippable slots, a small inventory, possibly a spell or something, eventually you can find an egg and get a pet, and that's pretty much it.  No complex builds.  Just go out there, and get your butt kicked over and over.			"

												While I completely agree with people noting the lack of balance in classes and dungeons, bots overrunning the nexus, hackers overrunning the everything, and every possible marketing ploy trying to get you to spend your money, the game really can be a lot of fun. It's really a game you need to try to see if you like it, and if you do, you'll have a blast. If your stick-to-itive, you will play, learn, loot, learn, die, cry, and learn some more, but persistence to start anew will keep you going with this game (and hopefully not get you addicted, trust me, that's not a good road).Most important thing of all, if your going to start playing this game, understand that the things that♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and drive you to hell should be ignored or acted upon, if you can't handle that then DO NOT play this game, for the sake of your mental sanctuary.UPDATE:Scratch literallly everything I have said, I wish I never found out this game existed or that Kabam never ruined it.

												I used to adore this game when it first came to Steam. I was always suggesting it to people, made a group and was playing around with different classes and equipment. The odd person in my gaming group even spent a little 'real life' money on the game. Then, after a while, it went down hill. Between people multiboxing, selling items via Paypal for 'real world' cash and the game changes it had become 'pay2win.'You were always able to buy 'starting' items... but high tier stuff is just insane. In the end the game became unplayable for those with the starting weapons.Buy making it so heavily 'pay2win' I uninstalled. I will no longer be recommending this game to anyone I know.I enjoyed the game so much I was considering buying things in game, I was just trying to work out what I wanted. I couldn't decide between an extra character space or storage space. As it stands I'm glad I didn't put any money into this game.I really hope that this game becomes more balanced.			"

												It is a good game. Nice graphics and storylines. But there's one thing that I would really like to complain. ""Quality"". The graphics quality is a huge problem to me because we need to switch it to Low, Medium, and High. But I cant switch it to medium which is causing a really bad lag problem for a Low-End Laptops like me. It's ok in my PC but I would really like to play this in my laptop. I'm really sorry but I can't recommend this to other's unless you update it and add the quality settings.			"

												Hello Fellow Warriors,I'll recommend Realm of the Mad God. It's overall a very good idea, and it's free. The eight-bit style really brings back a classic arcade feel to the whole massively multiplayer online genre. It never particularly interested me as it just wasn't something I was into at the time that I tried it, but looking back on it, it is a pretty good game with lots of variety. I won't lie, though, the game was awfully dull without someone to talk to verbally so that you could travel together, so I strongly recommend that you play this game with a friend on most occasions. That's just my take on it, however, I know plenty of people who were happier playing the game alone and finding people along the way. Overall, I recommend it mainly because it's free, if it had cost me money, I wouldn't have. The game itself is extraordinarily good for what it was trying to achieve, though, so it's definitely a great game! Give it a shot!-Kyle James			"

												The best thing about this MMO is that you can totally ignore other people and play it as a single-player game. This may also be it's greatest drawback, as there seem to be few opportunities for the social interactions that give other MMOs a sense of story and belonging. The most stand-out ""feature"" of Realm of the Mad God is it's perma-death system, but once you get deeper into it, it turns out that it doesn't actually have perma-death. Rather than building up the character you are playing as, Realm of the Mad God is actually about leveling up the little Pokemon who follow you around.The really good Pokemon (""pets"" whatever. we know they're all actually Pokemon) are the ones that heal you, and the best class to play as would be the Necromancer, whose attacks not only effectively damage enemies but also effectively heal your character. Once having unlocked the Necromancer, why would anyone play RotG as any other class? RotG's class system suffers from the same problem as Final Fantasy V's Job System: there are a few kickass jobs you max out before too long, and then a whole bunch of useless jobs you don't really need to bother with because what they offer is either too similar to what you've already got or else so specialized that they can rarely be utilized effectively.Anyway, I can't recommend this as an MMORPG. But I can recommend it as a casual game. If you've got an audiobook to get through and want something mindless to grind away at while listening then Realm of the Mad God is the perfect MMORPG for you. Just ignore other players, get some healing Pokemon and be a Necromancer.			"

												Extremely boring. I ran around with 3 or 4 different characters dieing a few times and exploring. Then I realized that there was nothing else to the game. Litterally all you do is walk around forever, hold down left trigger to shoot enemies and level up to 20. After that you go fight bigger stuff but the gameplay doesnt change. Shoot badguys, find new badguys, repeat.			"

												This game has sooooooo much potential. It has the versatile feel of old-school console games, with the new concept of MMORPG interfacing with online friends and strangers. The system is simple, the game itself is fast paced, there are multiple opportunities to unlock achievements and a nearly bottomless system for weapons and armor.My ONLY complaint is that, outside of the initial two or three classes, the only way to unlock further classes, is to spend real money. While the game bills itself as a ""free to play"" experience, in order to get any real development out of the game content is to spend cash. The game also likes to drive that home by (1) making the bulk of the achievements revolve around things that you can only get through cash exchange, and (2) frequently dropping cool items that are only usable by the pay classes into the hands of mundane players.While I can recognize the validity and necessity of having games be ""pay to play"", I neither think it is fair of a company to present a ""pay to play"" game as anything but that, and I dislike games that stunt the growth and exploration of the player through monetary contingencies. As a compromise, the game could have an in-game mechanic that allows for the  gradual accrual of real money, much as is seen in Loadout.It is a shame the game is so impacted by the requirement of real cash, because that really prevents it from becoming a hugely popular game. But even so, I rate this a 7 out of 10. Check it out, but be ready to either break out your wallet, or get irritated that the game only lets you go so far.			"

												So you've decided to start realming for the first time. You pick a class, go through tutorial, enter nexus and... WTF is going on here? ""Blah-blah cheap gear $$$"", ""Best gear for $$$"", ""fri itens ples"", ""i died 8/8 gime fre ring, iten, armar"". You've probably figured this out: from bullet the game turned to bot&beggar hell.You could choose to ignore them by setting chat restrictions or even turning it off completely (inevitably hurting social aspect of the game) but hackers aren't something to ignore so easily. You're going to encounter every possible hack from relatively harmless to game-breaking exploits.Sudden deaths, lags and disconnections will accompany your playing. A particularly nasty player could ruin your tomb or shatters, a leecher could steal your loot. Someone will inevitably want to scam you.If you're looking for a welcoming game, you'd probably better to look somewhere else.Or you can neglect everything written above, accept the game as it is and enjoy the advance from a noob to skillful player. This game is still able to send shivers down your spine, and sense of accomplishment from masterfully conducted fight (occasionally rewarded with a white bag), perfectly performed rush or skillful run will keep you playing.Will RotMG be an abomination or an entertaining experience, is totally up to you.Perhaps for appreciation you'll just need some dzen.

												Free to play accounts extremely limited. In game items are too expensive to justify, considering it's permadeath feature.Examples: ($10) 1000 Gold for a different character slot. What if I don't want to use my super OP character and just fool around for a bit? 10 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars.($5) 500 Gold for 8 extra storage spaces.($1) 100 Gold for a dungeon key. Which is over in a couple of minutes.200-800 Gold for top tier weapons/armor/abilities. That can be lost because durr permadeath.""Why don't you go to 3rd party sites to buy armor/potions?""The prices aren't as cheap as I'd like still, and there's the (albeit unlikely) possibility of it being a scam website. (I'd just do more research into the websites themselves). I've seen prices between $30 and $70 for a maxed out character, which is odd, considering that they should be the same items for the character.Last Complaint: You can't transfer your old account to the steam account, so prepare to start fresh.

												This game is absolutely horrible regarding steam version.Decided to come back to bring some nostalgia, what I witnessed was devastating experience.Cannot replay the tutorial, because had to quit it to change the unusual delay.Did everything I could, but it still didn't help.Beliving I could live up to not knowing how to play and the lag I decided to go to the basic Realm.I was very wrong.The lag was so big it registered to change the direction I was moving after even 10 SECONDS, basically making bullet dodging impossible, not to mention I had to aim and shoot at enemies with the delay as well. When I tried to ask players in the lobby for any sollution it told me I need a name first, struggling to find the right NPC for 10 minutes due to key delay and no mark where to find him. I had to write a name, tried to write a name that I had about 7 years ago. It said it was already taken so I knew there's no dead account removal system. After huge struggle I ended up with a name that was near-gibblerish. Wrote a message asking for help about the lag and an option to replay the tutorial. Soon realized my message was already gone before anyone would even finish reading it, chat was flooded with bots advertising their site on lobby to scam people for money.Deciding there was no help I went back to combat. I soon realized I wasn't taking damage, my hitbox was somewhere else because game couldn't register, again the lag. Tried mini-bosses, they were easy if you somehow handled the lag and they couldn't damage you. Occasionally I got a drop, trying to walk to it was just pain, I was basically passing it thanks to delay, making other players take it from me or it just despawns. There are way too many faults on Steam version caused by the lag. Tried searching the web, but all it said that I need to play on web version, creator of the game won't just fix the issue. Why? They want to get money from the ads on their site. After a while trying to play more of it it drove me to insanity, repetetive music gave me headache, even main menu music was earrape on the start already. In final words, don't play this game on Steam version unless you wanna have a ride with your sanity.In case TL;DR here's the problem:1. Extremely delayed experience2. Unreplayable tutorial option3. Name choosing near impossible4. Chat is flooded with self advertisement5. Music brings headache.I am done with this game.			"

												way too many botters and cheaters. You ban people for using cheats that you catch - but what about all those people obviously chat spamming at the nexus? I watched people in the wilderness shoot thru walls, clip thru walls, and otherwise break the rules, yet none of them have been banned yet. I think the development team needs to take a look at this notorious OryxRape client, and learn how to defend against it.To anyone thinking of playing. Save yourself the time, and download something else. This will just test your patience, and reveal how mad you truly are on the inside. (maybe thats how its supposed to work?)My rating:1/10The game concept is cool, but they need to refactor nearly everything. Especially the part where you need to pay real money to pretty much do anything, because you will never get there legit, being pushed out by botters and spammers.And i cant wait for the responses saying - oh well just mute the spammers - gee thanks never thought of that. there are more spammers in this game than any one person can count to in a lifetime. so yeah - not recommended.

												10/10 ruined my life. Ok now onto my actual review of the game. In the category of f2p it (of course) has a microtransaction system. However to avoid spending actual money IS possible. Now it does take some effort in the sense of making some mule and/or storage accounts, but it can work. The game has quite an expansive community but to get to the nicer more casual players you need to put time and effort into getting better. This basically means don't beg, be polite, and work hard. If you stick with it you will be well on your way of loosing your life er having fun. WARNING: some people will be rude regardless; these people exist in all games and places so you just have to deal with them. I suggest that at this point you spend some money on the game (20$ will get you some more characters and vault space to store loot).  This basically removes most of the hassle of mules. Now the game does have some problems including in some ways perma death. Perma death turns away some players from the game after only their first few deaths. For me after more than a few hundred you get to the point where dying is a very rare thing and death only occurs from carelessness or being unlucky. The dev team is also always putting out new skins and retextured items which are basically for decoration and aren't needed to play the game. Now of course the microtransaction system does bring with it people being able to buy top teired gear, although it is not permanent, and a bad player and good gear does not mean a swift death will not come to them. Learn to play, and find your place amongst the world of guilds, or die trying. This has been a review by the one and only Sheepdawg. Good luck and have fun!			"

												I see many people complaining about the game being pay to play. Now, I won't lie here, it indeed is. It is still possible to play this game without putting any money on it, but then you will have to put a lot more of time on it, because the grinding will become much more intense and needed.Other than that I think this game is really nice, enjoyable and addicting. If you really do get into it, be warned: at one point you will die, and you will get frustrated, but then again death is part of the game if you really want to progress in the game.			"

												First of all, I'd like to say that while there are certainly those who are more qualified than me to judge this game, I feel I have played it enough (and over a long enough time span) to write an accurate review. And yes, I only got it on steam so I could review it, meaning that I've played for quite a bit longer than 0.2 hours using the browser version.Next, I give this a *very* tentative recommendation, since this game is great for some and hell for others.Now, for the actual review:Before you read the rest this, just know that in order to really enjoy this game, you're going to have to fork over some cash. As many wrote before me, the “second” developers (who acquired the game some time ago) have made this a micro-transaction based game, in which “realm gold” (which equates roughly to 100 = $1) can be used to buy many items, as well as things like storage space and the ability to have more characters in your account. Since you start out only able to store 8 items and have one character, (I have ~8x the storage and 5 characters, and still feel I need more) the latter are VERY important, assuming you actually want to become somewhat good at the game.It didn’t always used to be quite like this. The original developers, Wildshadow, were, to the best of my knowledge, not bad devs. Sure, the pay-to-win aspects were there, but when Kabam bought ROTMG, it became all about squeezing as much money as possible out of this once great tube of  permadeath toothpaste. In fact, it seems almost as if Kabam thinks our lovely toothpaste tube is near empty, because certain aspects of the game are starting to fall apart (which I’ll cover in a bit). Like another reviewer said, in ROTMG, your greatest weapon is your credit card. And every time someone uses the best weapon in the game, Kabam’s breath is freshened with the minty green toothpaste known as money. If you don’t want to buy into any pay-to-win/micro transaction games, look elsewhere.Another problem: Everyone hacks. Well, not everyone, but so many do that I’m not even sure people are banned for it. It’s gotten to the point where people can admit it openly and people don’t really seem to care. If you like hacking, I suppose this might be a plus, but for those of you that like to play legitimately, you might be frustrated that others have an unfair advantage.The game also sometimes likes to disconnect you. While bugs aren’t terribly common, one very annoying one involves kicking an entire realm of people back to the menu with the error “Load error, retrying...”, and not letting them back on for maybe 5-10 mins. It’s not a huge deal, except I’ve seen reports of this bug going back into 2013. Something as irritating as this should have probably been fixed by now, especially since it’s not like many huge releases have been taking up the developers’ time.One last thing that ROTMG lacks is a compassionate community. In this game, everyone is out for themselves. And if you want to be a successful player, selfishness is a quality you should exemplify, as well. As such, don’t expect to have very many friendly interactions with others.After all these negatives, you might be wondering why I actually recommended this game. The truth is, it’s still very fun most of the time, and offers something few MMOs do. Namely, permanent death. This isn’t really a positive or a negative, since everyone seems to have their own opinion on the matter. While it does help drive the economy, as new gear/”stat potions” (which increase a character’s statistics, like how fast they move or how much health they have) are always in demand. However, people tend to invest a lot of time in a good character, so losing one is never a fun experience.Despite these warnings, if a more open MMO is what you’re looking for, I’d recommend at least trying out ROTMG. While it’s less fun if you’re just starting out, the longer you spend, and the better your characters get, the more this game will latch onto your mind, demanding you play it over and over again.

												Don't even bother, just thinking about what this game represents makes me sick to my stomach. It may have had a salvageable concept in it before it was converted to a money pit, but even then it was less fun than drawing in Paint. It has only gone downhill from there, due to a complete change of owners and design philosophy.Expect a frustrating, grindy, low drop-rate, laggy, dungeon crawler with inconsistent, one-shotting, unfair monsters that move at the land speed record and a gigantic money grab store full of temporary, easily lost items best described as pay to advance, since any significant character gear evolution past the first 20 minutes is minimized to a 1 in 10000 chance of a drop from a monster that can and will insta-kill you.Spending more than a few paragraphs reviewing this ""game"" would only serve to validate it. Disgusting from start to finish.			"

												I probably spent over five thousand hours on this game outside the steam client. I'm here to tell you why you shouldn't.This game used to be absolutely fantastic; it was a grindfest, sure, but it was a grindfest inside a tightly knit community, a small but lovely world of people learning the game's mechanics together. It was fun at the most basic level, and it was great.Then the devs sold everything to Kabam. They introduced thousands of new players, a bunch of content, and ingame mods that would host entertaining events on the regular.They also introduced pay-to-win. In a co-op only game. This led to massive amounts of players buying out the literal best gear in the game and steamrolling everything in their path. The food for the pets which are overpowered when maxed out was also available for purchase via microtransactions. Did I mention they expected people to pay equivalents of 5 dollars and upwards for items that died with your character?This all led to a major disproportion between weak and strong players/characters, where the maxed out ones would steamroll everything, not allowing the weaker people to even qualify for the loot.The new content is bland, generic. The mods don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game and just hand out free loot to pacify people. The game died in a matter of days.Do not waste your time on this cadaver of a once beautiful game. I know I won't.			"
