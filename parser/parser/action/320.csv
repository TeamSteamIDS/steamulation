												Are you seeing this because you are intrested to buy it on a sale? Don't even read further and get it right away for these few $ it is worth. Still curious? Let me explain why my hours for this game are so high.This game has a very active modding scene who created a variety of different gamemodes. Unlike the name deathmatch tells you there is plenty of other things to do making it fun for everybody. The community is great and in many places very helpfull. They will sort out bugs you have or simply teach you how to play the game. You should definately buy this game! Expand the review to learn about its gamemodes.(Team) DeathmatchServers : CommonSub Types : 1v1 , Matches , Bots , Variety of gravity's , KillBoxAs the name of the game indicates this is the original gamemode of the game. There are many different kinds of maps. Killbox is mainly a box where you can hit about everyone with some stuff for you to mess with. Other maps can involve a variety of sceneries (Mappers like to use there own themes instead of just City 17). There is still an active competitive scene so if your up for 1v1 matches dig around and you can surely find them. Some servers often killbox like to turn the gravity down for some low gravity fun.The gunplay is what i call ""Unbalanced"". This means that some guns are clearly superior over other guns and you will have to focus on getting better weapons from the moment you spawn (Quake style but not as extreme). If this is not your thing just continue reading because there are plenty of modes for you to find.The most populair frag video from a well known clan :

 Cooperative Servers : CommonSub Types : Exclusive maps to some servers, Multiple gravities, Exclusive Weapons to some servers, Dual CoopThis is my personal favorite mode. Infact i like this mode so much i built an entire server[www.bouncyball.eu] around it.In cooperative maps you work together with your team to destroy the aliens of the singleplayer game (Combines are broken). Additionaly some of the maps give you challenges similair to the physics puzzles in the original game or allow 2 teams to mix cooperative with the deathmatching (Both examples are rare as most maps are normal cooperative).Here is some uncut gameplay from my server to give an incidation of what the gamemode is like :

 Puzzle Servers : CommonThe name says it all. You are put in a map where you have to complete a set of puzzles in order to beat the map.The puzzles you get a very varied and can involve anything from finding a path in a minefield , driving airboats along a track , building your way to the exit or hitting targets with a specified gun. Puzzle map creators are very creative in the challenges they think up so each map will have its own unique challenges to beat.Puzzle map gameplay :

			We were reminiscing over the good old days of HL2DM puzzle maps when we thought we'd download one and give it a try. It was as fun as we remembered.		

 Roleplay Servers : CommonRoleplay is another fan favorite for many people of the game. It is cops and robbers style gameplay where you buy and sell your items and on alot of servers you can even buy and decorate your own house. Personally i did not play it much so my review would probabbly fall short of the possibility's in these servers.Probabbly not the best vid : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54-ZKvVP8A Surf Servers : RareSub Types : With or without weapons (With is more common)Surf is something adopted from the counterstrike community. It all involves trying to surf down a track of slidey walls and not falling of the sides. On most maps depending on where you failed you get placed in a deathmatch box with a better weapon then those who failed before you.Surf Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuexNobUAS0 Trick Jumping Servers : Medium RareThese maps are similair to Surf in the way that you are trying to get from A to B. They mostly do not involve gunplay of any kind. Instead of sliding along walls you have to beat jumps of increasing difficulty. While fun on its own this is also often used to train for better movement in the deathmatches.Hard Trickjump Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEeuAHpI9l8 Zombiemod Servers : RareSub Types : Hybrd with zombie survival , Straight up killingWhile there are zombiemod servers they are not always around as these servers run different modes and the type of zombiemod also depends strongly on the server you play it on. Other servers usually have a bigger deathmatch focus and no npc's but since i only play it on mine i will tell you how it goes on our server.The round starts with everyone as a survivor where you fight unlimited npc zombies in a set time. Once someone fails and greats beaten he will join the other team and only have a crowbar. Zombies are slower then survivors by default but are the only team that can use the spint ability. Survivors win by surviving long enough while zombies win by making sure all humans are dead.In case you want to play it and no other servers are running zombiemod you can join our server bouncyball[bouncyball.eu] and vote for one of the zombiemod maps using !jb. Deathrun Servers : RareIn deathrun one team tries to run from A to B and the other sets off traps to stop them. There are a vareity of maps all with there own set of traps.Gameplay from the most populair deathrun server : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYEpKmfEAz8 Scripting / Cheating / Building Servers : RareSub Types : Cheating , Building using server commands onlyWait what? Cheating? Hacking? o.OWhy would anyone want to do this?The answer is simple. Using cheats and ""Hacks"" very cool stuff can be done in the engine. Do not expect these servers to be overrun with aimbotters (although some people will kill your godmode protection off). This is all about creating great things with the cheats in the game or your own custom addons.Sadly all good videos of this have been removed but a quick summery of some stuff i saw : Giant Mechs (Working) , Space invaders remade , Dokuman attack , gm_flatgrass turned into a forest , Gigantic volcano jump challenge that will explode in a cool manner when beaten.The possiblity's are HUGE! Conclusion I probabbly missed alot of gamemodes as these are server experiments. Think about FreezeTag or extremely modified servers.The server in this video has been remade entirely and most of the things shown are no longer there but it is a good indication of how crazy the game can get : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCmgRmg92Yo.It is also worth mentioning that as you can see in the above vid servers have a lot of control over the gameplay as they can program new features themselfs using the addon support for the game. Think about things such as statistics , jetpacks ropes and hooks , teleports , midget mode and many more.I hope my insiders view gave you a good insight in why this game is so well loved as the steam store page simply does not cut its job. The game has its drawbacks that in the past it has been ruined by valve quite a bit (And then fixed by valve and the community for the most part). Because valve does not look at this game very often the description and screenshots on the storepage are simply acient and you can experience some bugs and crashes. The more populair servers will do anything they can to provide a sollid gameplay experience so no worries.			"

												This game is a hidden gem among the deep heart of steam's heart.Half Life 2 Deathmatch throws all the HL2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in.This game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games. You either kill, or be killed! No hiding like games nowdays. You are the man, the badass, the ♥♥♥♥. Skill is everything, not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars.Half Life 2 Deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level. You get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss.Sadly, the fans of deathmatches aren't as popular as the past. So recommend this piece of badassery to your friends.10/10 Can shoot toilet bowls			"

												Main attaction here is the gravity gun. Pick up whatever you please, and throw it at the enemy.I just hope you don't buy the title for itself. Get it in a pack, so things are a little understable. Servers aren't common, as a few hours of thowing things around is good enough.I don't really feel like giving this title a rating, as it should be purchased in a pack with HL2...7/10 - Solid game for being a ""chuck that object at that"" simulator.

												Since you're reading this review ill tell you a quick summary about the game and what it has brought to me.[STORY]I first started playing this game back in 2010 first game I ever bought I didnt think it would take all my time, but WOW is this game still much fun packed! When i first joined and played there weremany and many fun servers to join some deathmatch, puzzles,coop, and TDM. I met the majority of my steam friends here... and enemies. The noob i was helplessly getting killed over and over wanted me to just leave the game but something inside of me some power hiddentold me not to quit and keep playing and boy was it right![Quick Game Summary as of 2016 Feb 5th]As of now this game still has plenty of servers to join and are still much fun to play make sure you filter in the settings to Users playing in servers to have a better chance of finding Actual People in servers playing. The community of this game is very small now but everyone is nice, and helpful if you stick around long enough you will get to meet everyone , and become a regular  and make new friends. The type of game modes which are still around are Team-Deathmatch, Co-op, Puzzles,Deathrun, and Role-Play. HL2:DM still has much potential in it but the Developers just left it in the dust luckily we have very talented modders in the community who still make Beautiful maps, and amazing Pluggins for your enjoynment. For the Price of $5 this is a get right away game and play! You will need all Skills for this bad boy game no hacks,  practice on servers with bots and you will improve much more speed and accuracy for Deathmatch . Just like the good there is always the BAD you have to be careful when you play on specific servers, you will have the players and the Admins who will kick and ban for being better than them at the game. The game can be very fast paced or very slow paced for you campers depending which servers you joinsome have the fast kill one shot and others have the stock settings which take a few bullets more to kill. I honestly would say i put a lot of hours into this game,  and heck? i dont think i will ever be done playing this so I urge you to buy this game and try it out for yourself It is truly a ""Classic Jewl of a FPS game.""

Imagine Valve had a boy genius. 
He had excellent results, got his PHD and for a time was its favourite son.
Now this guy works in a corporation, and he is barely remebered for his genius by his coleagues. 
Valve, tell your son you love him, give him a big hug and don't let him waste his talent - he deserves a better job!This game is AWESOME, it's fast paced (try to play COD and then go back to HL2DM and you'll see what I'm talking about).Also the ONLY game that lets you kill your friends with a heating radiator! 10/10See what I'm talking about:

												Great game, definitely one of the better games of my childhood and still the best around. Has Fps action + the ability to ""sprint"" with the games physics allows it to be a fast-er point and click shooter if not the fastest and the props/objects effecting it even more make it unique requiring good senses, reflex, smart reactions, coordination with just about everything to play at a decent potential. Where else can you Yoyo a grenade to keep it from 'cooking' it's fuse out before propelling it on it's last fuse reset that you can time for distance and height in coordination with how fast you are moving and your target's speed and the force of the 'gravity gun' you use to propel it with, no where else but hl2dm. Has different kinds of unique weapons like the gravity gun propelling a object to a person to kill them with, or propelling that object against another object to move that away from a distance. And to block a path with many objects or stack objects to reach a platform. Also the crossbow is an example of unique weapons with how it fires in a arch and hard to aim with even with it's scope but can kill a player instantly and with correct positioning can bounce of the floor walls ceiling terrian etc. and with enough practice can be well aimed to kill a player half the map away behind 2 corridors and a room. That is a taste of the Uniqueness of this game, after overlooking it's default multiplayer team vs team worth, there is it's booming in vast unique options to how to play the game with it's community's modded creations, there is co-op themed maps where you can fight with teammates against hordes of aliens, zombies, monsters and cyborgs getting points with the ability to use them to unlock server abilities to costumize your character with a deferent apearence, both in model skin and size, lights that glow on your model, lights that follow your model and more, then there is puzzle maps where you may enter 1 of 12 parts of the map at a time with your team or individualy and complete tasks like finding the exit in a labyrinth or placing and freezing a pile of crates to build a terrian leading to a exit floating high above in the sky or surfing on long slides without falling into abyss to reach a exit or jumping over ditches, climbing and avoiding obstacles in a temple like area to reach another exit to collect all exits and unlock the last portion of the map to complete it. Then there is Roleplay... a blend of multiplayer fps combat with gta style like the need to Purchase weapons or health or armor. Earning money by the minute with the wage given by your level or killing others for their pocket money, then saving that money to invest in a faster method of earning money like growing drugs to sell or printing money both to us on getting more guns or to purchase a home to hide in and to keep your drugs or printer safe, from other players or other players playing as Cops... who may not only steal your illegal possessions but will also place you in jail for some time so that they too may earn the points they need to progress faster and easier in that server. You may also invest in a home to hide from all players and keep your possessions safe, and to meet with your group of friends to prepare for a war against another gang, or to meet with your gang to prepare for a war against the police in alliance with other gangs for fun or for an event to earn more $. Also events are constant and include situations where a monster is spawned in the map similar to the any/many of the ones found in co-op maps that drop money on death. Another situation would be looking all over the map to find an object or player hiden with more $ $ $ that is given to the winner that finds it first. Or when admins just decide the server is full enough for a mass money drop in the middle of the map including weapons and item drops. There are also many more mods but I just thought to name a few of the ones that have me so adicted to this game. This game is worth the very low ticket price for all the fun is has to offer and is very much Alive, if not so is still rich with creativity you never know what's next. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars * * * * *.			"

												I like this game. It's pretty fun, and you get it when you purchase EP1 so you can have a multiplayer experience.I don't get everyone calling this game empty; It feels somewhat empty, but theres about 20 servers to play on with real people and almost no bots. I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.Also, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun. Also, DO NOT BUY IT HERE. Go buy HL2 EP1. It comes with EP1, Deathmatch and Deathmatch Source. You'll truly get a bang for your buck. "

												After 10 years still a good game with nice physics engine. Slowly the community is almost dead, but some good players and servers you can still find. At deathmatch its better than CounterStrike, at teamdeathmatch not as its not so high tactical game. Maps are also many nice ones around made by the community. Some servers use funny mods or settings. The community itself could be a bit more friendly, as some players flaming around a lot. But in other games its mostly the same. About gameplay... it takes a while till you get involved with some tricks and the physcannon, but after a while you won`t miss that game. Cheaters are also some around, but not as much as in CounterStrike. Try to learn nade-throwing with physcannon and good jump techniques beside your aim, than you have a lot of fun. check out hl2dm.net, tsgk.com, half-life-gaming.net, bloodsuckers.de.			"

												Multi-player arena, based on the Half-life 2 backgrounds, skins and weaponry. It used to be fun - right after the HL2 hit the shelves - but now, it's all quite boring, unless you have some tradition to meet up and make fun with friends there.The community is vanishing - the most of all servers are empty 4life. And even while there are still some people playing, if you haven't got there until now - then you can easily forget about this issue forever.What's good about HL2 Deathmatch - is all about physics and gravy-gun, and the ability to flood the server with multiple Freemans running around. Or cooperative maps, where you fight through some location filled with respawning monesters, hoping on the backup from the rest of your team.And now comes the bad part. For one, there are no (absolute zero) chances to find yourself a good team. There are no skilled players, as there are no application for their skills. The weaponry, that were so good in the single-player, aren't really any good for multiplayer arena FPS. That means totally random gameplay. You can die every second, or dominate with dozens of kills - it's not matter anything.So no, if you're not having some friends who will play with you there, I don't recommend to starting this one. Other Valve products, like Counter Strike and Team Fortress, are much more capable to entertain, and provide decent gameplay.Mark 5/10. Engine's good, the game at this point - not.			"

												Valve has a history of making famous Deathmatch games, and thats beacuse they don't bother over complicating the concept of Deathmatch. Tihs game along with Day of Deafeat Source and Counter Strike Source are simple and yet have raked in players by the thousands upon millions. It's a simple Deathmatch experience but it's not anything new. 2 Teams pitted againnst each other with your usuall Team Deathmatch action, nothin to complicated but it is still fun.			"

												This game is a classics.No doubt at all.I remember i receive this game when i was 10.i dont know why,but this game seems to be really attractive to me.when i turn on the computer,i start my hl2dm,and i just play it for a whole day.Day after day.when i grow up im still playing this game until 16,it helps me get through all the depression and sad moment in my life.when i feeling upset,i sit on the computer desk and start playing hl2dm,after a couple of hours and im just pull myself together again and i can get ready for the next test.I remember those old days on puzzle map and coop map LOLThis game is surely my precious childhood memories,i hope valve can remaster this game but i know it wont come true because i know halif life 3 will never release too.So Sad.Only recommend this game if you have a friend to play with,compare to few years ago,there are many active player before,but now there are just few player left.Recommend Coop map and Puzzle map for a lot of funChildHood. 9/10			"

												Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is the official multiplayer component to Half-Life 2. It released about two weeks after the singleplayer and is stand-alone. It is the successor to the immensely popular and addictive multiplayer to the original game. Although it didn't have the same legacy and lasting appeal as it. The game includes two multiplayer gamemodes. Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Along with a handful of multiplayer maps that were portions of the singleplayer. When I first played Half-Life 2 Deathmatch I remember being a little disappointed since it lacked content and felt like a bit of an afterthought compared to other games at the time like Counter Strike Source and Unreal Tournament 2004. Indeed the game is mostly known for being full of hackers. Which is unfortunate since it did improve after release with mods like CTF. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch's legacy is now seen in the modifications that were based upon it, like Garry's Mod. If you want to play it today I'd suggest downloading a mod for bots and a few custom maps. It's a relic today, but a playable one. And at 5$ it does give you what you paid for. Nothing more, and nothing less.			"

												No achievements, no markets, no DLCs or any other BS that is an essential part of many games these days and is fairly pointless. Pure old-school (not so old tho, but old enough) with flying toilet-bowls among other moveable objects thrown in yo face that can be used as a weapon thanks to the gravity gun. It's a shame not many play it these days, I wish it were 2004 again with hundreds of servers full.			"

The weapons is just the standard Half life 2 arsenal, not many but the ones that are there are great. many people say this game is death, wich isn't the case. Maybe there are less servers than other more populair games but there still are plenty with a reasnonable amount of players. Even if you don't like Half-life I still reccomend this.

												All of the robust movement and physics of Half Life 2, along with the gonzo combat of the gravity gun. What's not to like? This is the next level up from the classic Quake-style competitive gameplay. It can range from realistic combat to cartoony violence, with well-balanced weapons and nicely tweakable variables. I have been playing HL2DM for years, and it can still be as challenging as you want to make it.Why is there still a community around this game after years of borked updates, minimal support, and no publicity? Because it really is that fun. It might get little love from Valve, but the participants are hardcore.			"

												An older game, as it's essentially an extension of Half-Life 2. Even though it's aged now, it still is a blast to play with friends. The Gravity Gun is what makes it so unique to many of the other shooters out there, even today in 2014. Similiar to Quake, it doesn't have a sprawling community to it any longer as Half-Life 2 is well beyond it's years now. If you get into matches you tend to get into an older community that is generally very friendly and results in some of the best games of Deathmatch, or other matchmaking playstyles. All it takes is about 5$ when Half-Life 2 goes on sale, if that even, so I'd recommend anybody who is into shooters to buy this game. I guarantee you'll have a blast in a server that is full of 6+ people, and even less in some situations.			"

ALOT. first you should learn bunnyhop. second you should get a better mouse and a mouse pad for better accuracy. third you should improve your accuracy by alot (while playing this game you will improve your accuracy 5x times). and fourth you have to be very very fast. like catching a grenade or a prop with the gravity gun when somone throws it at you.I recommend this gameBut it's not for short tempered people (especially if they're new).

												Half Life 2If you don't have the Half Life 2 game, or any Half Life game for that matter, your missing the corner stone of the Valve Corporation, (aka STEAM).  The Valve Corporation is a video game developer and digital distribution company known for the Half-Life game and others such as Counter-Strike, and Team Fortress.  I was fortunate enough to obtain HL2 for free as a promotion of Steam at its infancy.  HL2 reminds me allot of my old favourite UT game.  Way ahead of its time then.  As a FPS game, HL2 has some very wild and strange world maps.  The game physics are awesome, and the graphics for what is now considered an old game, are still amazing!  To truly enjoy the game, look into the history and trilogy of the characters and story line.Beyond tournament mode, the game has plenty of community mods, and it offers something for everyone.  Some multiplayer servers have wonderfully modded roll playing games too.  Others, puzzles and coop modes.  To play one HL2 game mode on one server, is not enough. You would be missing out.  There are endless customization's of the base game and plenty of maps.  Some of the games you play today were probably based in some way off of Half Life.  I highly recommend this game, HL2, as part of your game library.			"

												The very first game that I played on Steam. It brings back many memories of learning how to play fps games on PC and introduced me to VALVE in general. I promptly got the VALVE Complete Pack and have loved all of their games since.This game is litterally just HL2 but instead of playing through a story, you play as a rebel or combine, and fight the other faction. It is simply a Deathmatch game, but there is team deathmatch. All the hours I have put into it were mostly from long ago, but every time I launched the game I had fun with friends, and even made some new ones. I have no idea how popular it is now, but if you still have a group of friends that like to play it you can host your own server and play, or even find one of the empty ones to join.			"

Oh, and there was alot of Roleplay servers. Now theres only 1, at least there was only 1 in 2015. I started steam with this game. I had a limited user account and i couldn't add people. I met someone, he bought me Portal 2. I really owe him now and i dont know what happened to him. I played Portal 2 and finished the game. Then i started to play coop and i met someone, guess what?

												Greeeeat game. Idk why people dont play it anymore but you can always find servers that contain lots of different gamemodes. This is a great game if you want a break from cs:go or etc because of the fast gameplay and the maps included or downloaded from comunitty servers. Also for some unknown reason i got it for free so meh...			"

-Quick Review-Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is basically Half-Life 2 multiplayer, with custom made maps in Source SDK and a few members within the community still playing.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Now, this is the story all about how. Atratzu life got flipped-turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became a red splat on the side of the wall.Half-Life 2: Deathmatch suddenly appeared in my steam library, I believe it was recently added to a bundle that I've purchased (specifically, with my past purchase of Half-Life 2: Episode One). Half-Life 2: Deathmatch used to be a very large FPS community which started after the huge success of the Half-Life 2 series. But because Half-Life 2 is only single player, the community asked for a multiplayer competitive game, and valve delivered.

Gameplay: Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, controls EXACTLY like Half-Life 2. Which honestly I always thought I would be alright at a Half-Life multiplayer FPS, but it's been a long time since I played through all the Half-Life 2 games, so my skills were quite rusty.You have the same weapons, but the maps/servers are customized. I joined and played a Free for all, and a team death match. There is still several active people playing the game, at the end of one game people were actually congratulating the person who got first!I'm not sure if it's because so few play the game that they're all a tighter knit group, or I just found the one small patch in space time where people are still friendly, but it was nice to actually play a few rounds with some people who aren't screaming little kids swearing and speaking profanities they cannot comprehend.

Conclusion: To be completely honest, I haven't been on a FPS craze for a long time, the game has aged the same way as Half-Life 2. If you ever wanted to play a multiplayer FPS of Half-Life 2 there are plenty of servers, many are empty, you could even figure out the technical know-how to set up your own server and own maps.

I actually probably have used source SDK more then Half-Life 2: Death Match. It's a shame to see a community shrink so much, but props to those of you who keep playing one of your favorite games, don't change and keep on shooting!			"

Now I know this is old for writing a review, but I really don't care what anyone thinks because I'm DIFFERENT, and I'm proud to be, so if you're starting to dislike me I really don't care. Now back to the review shall we? -Gameplay:There is not bugs to offer in the game and gameplay is pretty smooth so I'm happy with this game-Graphics:The graphics are great for two-generation old textures.-Score:Now I know that my review is realitively short because a deathmatch game is just deathmatch so there's not really any features, but the score is 9.1/10. I'll give some room to improve.			"

												This review will be incredibly short as I have next to nothing to say about this title.Half Life 2 Deathmatch is a multiplayer add on for Half Life 2, but it's very similar to every early MP attempt Valve have made. I haven't played much of this game due to the simple fact that this game is completely dead. I played a few rounds of deathmatch but that was it.Recently I wanted to play a bit more, but all servers were empty so getting into a game was next to impossible.I'm guessing since it's like every valve MP game that's dying or dead, there's a ton of community events or people that  play it all the time.I can't recommend this game due to the fact that it's completely dead, so there's no reason to play it.

												Half-Life 2 Deathmatch has the distinction of being miles above what the old Half-Life 1 Deathmatch was due only to one single addition. The Gravity Gun. This little device turns what is and otherwise fairly mundane multi-player experience into many hours of high powered fun. Killing people with toilets never gets old.It is however, Half-Life 2. So if you own Half-Life 2 Deathmatch you already have access to literally hundreds of free multi-player games, many of the using the gravity gun or similar devices and in much more interesting ways than the basic Deathmatch you got here.So while it is by far more entertaining than what was included as a multi-player mode in the original Half-Life it is just the basic Half-Life 2 multi-player and not really worth much.

												Ahh, I remember playing this game back in 2006 when I was 6 on my old Steam account. I was playing alone on dm_runoff, grabing the RPG and killing myself and flying until the ragdoll falls on the earth on a funny position. I found it funny (I know, im a weird guy).Of course I played this game normally on servers (there was a lot of servers back then). And 8 years later I finally bought this game on my new account. When I play it I'm feeling so nostalgic.Half Life 2: Deathmatch is a fantastic Game. The gameplay is really good, the graphics is excelent, The maps are great. The only thing about Half Life 2: Deathmatch that disappointed me was the fact that a few guys play it. But when you do find a Server with players, you'll love it. A fantastic multiplayer experience, one of my childhood's games			"

Well, it clearly wasn't, but I kept trying with it. I have joined to several different servers and none of them seemed to be good, for me this game is a big dissapointment. Without your own server this game is not fun, and making one is hard due to errors. The worst thing is that, the game is forcing you to be a combine soldier, I know there is a way to change it and that worked fine, but after every team deathmatch my player model changed back, it was so annoying.

												Basically - OH COME THE F*CK ON, HOW THE F*CK IS REVOLVER INSTAKILLING IS BALANCED?It's probably best of Valve's MP shooters. Half-Life 1's deathmatch is still a lot of fun, and you probably will prefer the HL1, but if you got Source Multiplayer Pack - you can try the game out. Ever since it's Half-Life 2 it's physics based. You get the gravity gun - one of instakill weapons - and it's pure fun, if you know how to press buttons fast. Why i can't stand this game in a moments? Because of maps. Most servers don't host official maps (which are balanced, by Valve's logic), they host bullsh*t like Killbox (in HL1 it's great, but in HL2 it's basically like castration). Bots are not implemented, but you can find great bots online and practise your gravity gun skills.online is low, so find company to play and come on 4 plr server7.2/10 as a game9.2/10 as HL MP Game10/10 as valve's multiplayer game			"

												Two words: Roleplay. Servers.  What was once an amazing deathmatch-type game has steadily devolved into a hub for horny little children to roleplay, and for stoners just to be stoned.  In the servers that Aren't for roleplay, you won't really have too much fun unless you joined early, as you can guarantee everyone else will have gotten the RPG, full ammo, and have memorized every spawn location, meaning the moment you spawn, you get bombarded with rockets.  If you're lucky, you'll get 5-10 seconds before they take aim with their crossbows.  Either way, this is a game for the lucky, and for the cheap, so pick up your one-shot-kill guns, take down noobs, and feel unwarranted self-importance over your fake skill until karma catches up!  Ultimately, the appeal of the game is ruined by the overzealous try-hards who don't understand their ""skill"" ultimately ruins the game for everyone else.2/10, but only because you can throw toilets at people.

												When you first go into a server, and you see the title screen, you'll see how this game would be very crazy at first. Using the Half Life 2 weapons, and bundling it up into a game is probably an amazing way to do Multiplayer, however I noticed that this game feels like it should be a gamemode in Garry's Mod, or just an add on to the original Half Life 2; not just a game by itself. Besides that, if you had the time of you're life killing the Combine with your weapons, esepcially the nototious crowbar, you'll have the time of your life killing other players.I'll give this an 8/10			"

The deathmatching is fine, but the roleplay can also be just as fun as DarkRP on GMod if you find the right server.

												This is just like the original Half Life 2, but it has an addition of multiplyer. You can choose from a variety of maps and a few customly made game modes(keeping in mind that this is suppose to be just a Deathmatch game). This is very similar to Counter Strike Source, so if you ever played that one, you'll feel right at home. You can get it for free instead of wasting 5 $ through this link if you own Nvidia: http://www.steampowered.com/nvidia/ ATI users go here: http://steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/Edit: 2014 the Nvidia offer seems to have closed down in the recent years. But the game still can be taken for dirt cheap on sales. Although by now I'd probably get a Free to Play instead or even Counter Strike considering how good the offers on Steam tend to be lately.

												  What can I possibly say that hasn't been said abouth HL2: Deathmatch? It's all good, classic, old-style shoot-everything arena style fun. Though I must say it does tend to drag after about an hour or so playing straight. If you're gonna get this game, make sure you either find a good server or some friends to play it with because sadly this little gem probably ha slittle online life left. Whenever I get on, more than half the servers have nobody on them and another 1/3rd is way too customized or geared towards veteran players. Provided you can get some people to play with, this game is awesome. Throwing toilets at your friend's heads at 80 miles an hour has never been so fun. It's cheap and definitely worth the price- get it of you have some minor cash lying around, during a neat sale or just getting the whole damn Valve pack!			"

												This game used to be offered for free to users of NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards in promotional bundles. I think this was the first real game on my Steam account, thanks to the GeForce in one of my old laptops. The promotions aren't going anymore, unfortunately.The game itself is pretty much what it says, although there are a number of roleplaying and puzzle map servers. Released shortly after Half-Life 2 itself, it retains the sprinting system and all of the satisfying weapons, including the Gravity Gun, which makes this particular deathmatch game rather unique as well as fast-paced. My understanding of the community is that it's not very big and mostly comprised of older players like with Quake, since this game is more than 10 years old. I haven't played this in a while, to be honest, but it was pretty good for me back in the day for what that's worth.There are two new weapons introduced in this game: the Combine nightstick and the SLAM mine. The former is slower but more powerful than the crowbar, the latter can be used as a tripmine or a remote explosive. The default maps are quite good, but there's quite an arrangement of custom maps as well.I'd recommend it, but on sale. If the community were larger, I'd recommend it at full price. Fortunately, Valve games go on sale regularly with the annual major sale cycle, and if you can get a couple of friends to buy it as well you're probably in for a good time. You don't need to own HL2, but if you buy or have bought HL2 you might already have this.			"

PROS:+ really fun gameplay+ active community+ lots of modsCONS:- can get repetitiveComment:Unlike Half Life Deathmatch and Team Fortress Classic this game has enough active players to have plenty of games to join. The gameplay is fun, easy and whacky. Just the way it should be. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I played it a bit. In a summary this is a classic deathmatch style with HL2 weapons. Nothing special but surely cool multiplayer matches with a variety of weapons. Though I haven't played that much this seems like a cool old-school type of multiplayer game and I'd recommend it.			"

												This game used to be offered for free to users of NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards in promotional bundles. I think this was the first real game on my Steam account, thanks to the GeForce in one of my old laptops. The promotions aren't going anymore, unfortunately.The game itself is pretty much what it says, although there are a number of roleplaying and puzzle map servers. Released shortly after Half-Life 2 itself, it retains the sprinting system and all of the satisfying weapons, including the Gravity Gun, which makes this particular deathmatch game rather unique as well as fast-paced. My understanding of the community is that it's not very big and mostly comprised of older players like with Quake, since this game is more than 10 years old. I haven't played this in a while, to be honest, but it was pretty good for me back in the day for what that's worth.There are two new weapons introduced in this game: the Combine nightstick and the SLAM mine. The former is slower but more powerful than the crowbar, the latter can be used as a tripmine or a remote explosive. The default maps are quite good, but there's quite an arrangement of custom maps as well.I'd recommend it, but on sale. If the community were larger, I'd recommend it at full price. Fortunately, Valve games go on sale regularly with the annual major sale cycle, and if you can get a couple of friends to buy it as well you're probably in for a good time. You don't need to own HL2, but if you buy or have bought HL2 you might already have this.			"

												Hello Fellow Rebels,A great game for deathmatch! I strongly recommend it! I mean, come on, a deathmatch game using Half-Life 2 weapons! Some of the greatest weapons brought together to give you one of the greatest deathmatches of all time. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has played Half-Life 2 and liked the weapons used in it. However, it's just like any other deathmatch, so, really, I wouldn't say it's the best deathmatch ever created, but it's definitely good! Definitely worth the money if you liked Half-Life 2 and mastered the weapons!-Kyle James			"

												This game used to be offered for free to users of NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards in promotional bundles. I think this was the first real game on my Steam account, thanks to the GeForce in one of my old laptops. The promotions aren't going anymore, unfortunately.The game itself is pretty much what it says, although there are a number of roleplaying and puzzle map servers. Released shortly after Half-Life 2 itself, it retains the sprinting system and all of the satisfying weapons, including the Gravity Gun, which makes this particular deathmatch game rather unique as well as fast-paced. My understanding of the community is that it's not very big and mostly comprised of older players like with Quake, since this game is more than 10 years old. I haven't played this in a while, to be honest, but it was pretty good for me back in the day for what that's worth.There are two new weapons introduced in this game: the Combine nightstick and the SLAM mine. The former is slower but more powerful than the crowbar, the latter can be used as a tripmine or a remote explosive. The default maps are quite good, but there's quite an arrangement of custom maps as well.I'd recommend it, but on sale. If the community were larger, I'd recommend it at full price. Fortunately, Valve games go on sale regularly with the annual major sale cycle, and if you can get a couple of friends to buy it as well you're probably in for a good time. You don't need to own HL2, but if you buy or have bought HL2 you might already have this.			"

PROS:+ really fun gameplay+ active community+ lots of modsCONS:- can get repetitiveComment:Unlike Half Life Deathmatch and Team Fortress Classic this game has enough active players to have plenty of games to join. The gameplay is fun, easy and whacky. Just the way it should be. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I played it a bit. In a summary this is a classic deathmatch style with HL2 weapons. Nothing special but surely cool multiplayer matches with a variety of weapons. Though I haven't played that much this seems like a cool old-school type of multiplayer game and I'd recommend it.			"

												I sincerely love Half Life 2: Deathmatch. Half life 2: deathmatch is a PVP First Person shooter that uses a Half Life 2 system. Half life weapons, sounds, playermodels, etc. There is also maps created by other people that are fun to play on. This game is the BEST shooter I have ever played. I have never had this much fun playing a FPS. This game is severely underrated. The game may look bland to the eyes, but this game is tons of fun and it has action. Using half life 2 weapons means you also have the gravity gun, which you can use to pick up objects and throw them at people to kill them which is awesome. There are also the exploding barrels. There is lots of variety in this game and I highly-highly recommend getting it.			"

I knew a peice of ♥♥♥♥ like myself didn't deserve a painless way like a gun shot to the head ol' Kurt Cobain style, so this game came as a great alternative. I later realised that I didn't want to die alone so I bought my friends a copy of the game so they could kill themselves to.

												This game is one of the best FPS's evermade.Really hard to get into if you want to become decent at it, but that's whats fun about it, it's really hard to get good at but at the same time fun. The only problem is that the game is basically dead and no one plays it anymore, it was way more active 2011 than it is now. Some servers are good but others aren't because they dont allow the skills that comes with this game such as Bhopping, knowing spawns, gravity-gun tricks and other stuff. Im pointing my finger at you JKAL.Solid game that sadly has been abandoned by people.One of my all time favorite FPS's with in-depth mechanics which takes hours to master.Score 9,5/10 Worth every penny.

												A lot of people say the original is always better then the sqeual. I have to disagree. This is a game who does it right when they say ""Alright god dammit we're gonna make a second chapter of this game and where gonna do it right!"". There is so much to say about this game, the massive cult following it's gain to it's various RP servers it's spun off in GMOD. It's massive amount of lore to it's amazing combat system. It's nothing but amazing! There is so much to learn, so much to enjoy, so much to love! I know I sound like I'm kissing ♥♥♥ when I say this but this game makes me love valve more than anything. Either being the same badass scientist that crawled his way out of that hell hole known as Black Mesa smashing Crowbars into the ugly guls of Alien Monsters now into the Gasmask of Metro Police Officers that opress a civilian populace under a Universal Union Banner in the name of ""Civil Status"". Or riding around in a scrapped sports car with a rather attractive but at the same time a TRUE strong and independant female character Alyx. You feel like a badass actually doing something for a resistance, no, a revolution for mankind being enslaved by a Alien Empire. This game is perfect. This game is art.			"

												Pretty fun game its similar to the first HL deathmatch, with the addition of the HL2 wepons on other players. The maps are open ended and theres alot of room for all out battles in any part of the map. Taking from arena shooters like the previous game, items are scattered around the map some in great places to abuse the re-spawn, others not so much but you get by. The majority of the games servers however are saddly empty. When getting a server list youll find that it will only get about 20 servers of wich 90% of them are empty. You will still find 2 - 3 servers with about 5 - 10 players at most, if youre lucky youll find a server with about more than 10 people. Said players also use voice chat and help out new  players but be warned that these people are the same players that have been on this game since the old days when the servers on this game were populted, so going against them will seem very tough. Still its a very nice deathmatch game, if you are a fan of the HL series and like deathmatch games this wouold be a nice addition to pick up. Keeping in mind the points that ive previously mentioned theres always the chance there are still players in quite a few number of servers.			"

												I remember first playing this game about 8 years ago.  I went under the name ""Sharp-Shooter"" at the time, and it was my first experience playing an FPS with other players.  Unfortunately, that experience would turn out to be a bad one.Many of the weapons in this game require little to no skill to use, or have a secondary fire that requires no skill.  With many of them, you can be very vague with your aiming and yet be rewarded with ridiculous damage (usually an instant kill at full health).  An example of this would be the secondary fire for the pulse rifle.  Anyone who has played singleplayer Half Life 2 knows that this is a fairly large orb that rebounds off of all surfaces and instant kills any target it hits regardless of current health.  Well, in Deathmatch it is no different, but this is a problem for two reasons.  The first being that there are other weapons, such as the primary fire for both the SMG and pulse rifle, which have been nerfed considerably in this game compared to the campaign game.  The reduced damage meant that you had to keep your aim on target at all times for the best effect which requires concentration and practice.  The orbs having no reduction of any kind therefore makes this unfair as anyone could take down someone skilled at using the primary fire with no effort at all.  The second is that the orb's ability to rebound everywhere means that there is little chance of avoiding it, and the user could get kills without so much as seeing their targets, or even knowing where they were at the time.But that's just one example.  And yet the majority of the community somehow convinces itself that every weapon in this game is equally as hard to use as everything else.So do I recommend this game?  Well, not really.  If you are looking for a fair and skill-based game, this is not for you.  It forces you to play in a way that requires no effort,  which if you refuse to do as I did, will leave you with the stress of losing constantly regardless of how hard you try or how skilled you are.  Then again, like with anything, it is still up to you.			"

I may only have less then 25 hours playes, but before steam could document hours played, i prolly racked up 300+ hours.The game is great, the gameplay is fun, and the maps can be insane. the only thing it lacks is a community now a days.also if anyone has dm_starwars I want a copy of it please.

												Man I love the Half-Life series.I bought this game because:1) It was on an off sale week.2) I wanted to play some type of ""Half-Life 2 Shooter/Free play/Deathmatch"" kind of game and I haven't found that in Garry's Mod.And oh boy how I'm disappointed.I wanted to play Half-Life 2 Deathmatch Vanilla, and i failed to find one with good connection (which is hard as i live in Brazil). Almost ALL of the servers are flooded with these annoying mods like explosive crossbow, intense weapon reskins, annoying kill sounds. I would accept at maximum that gravity mod and other really simple mods.Even though this game has a little quantity of weapons, they are INSANELY unbalanced. Rarely you will spawn without getting killed in 3 seconds with rocket launchers or one shot kill crossbows.Or you join a server expecting to kill some people, or more probably get killed, and you end up in a roleplay server. I thought a paid for a shooter.So I had enough of multiplayer, and I went try singleplayer with bots. And guess what? There was no singleplayer bots, and I had to download an addon. The mod was annoying as hell to use, as I needed to write a line of code to spawn only 1 bot (meaning i had to spam that line to max up). Also, the bots were constantly getting stuck and flooding my console with errors. But in the end, I had more fun playing with these broken bots then in multiplayer.The game also feels abandoned. Servers usually had 3 dudes playing on it and there was no dedicated servers.Though many of these problems are not the game's fault. It's more the people who use it, and the terrible country I live in. I had an awful experience with this game, though you should still try it out.			"

												Hi Community,HL2DM was the first game you have to have Internet to create an account, the game ans so on. Only for this game i got an it connection. I have plyed the game almost for TEN years and in my opinion it is one of the best Multiplayer online Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch game, if you have learned the advanced techniques like fast orb, fast nades etc. it will bring you alot of fun, believe me. Alone with the Gravity Gun was a great thing to have in the game. I am pretty sad about, that this game seems to be dead! But hey, maybe a new DM version comes along with HL3, that would be awesome, when the game comes out at all. Summa Summarum it`s to say that this ""mod"" of the genuine Half Life2 game is the best i have played so long. I personally give this game a 8.5 from 10. I wish you all the best and god may bless you.Greetingsﮎмąçқ			"

												The Half-Life 2 gameplay style worked really well in singleplayer but I also really enjoyed in a multiplayer setting too. I don't know if I'd recommend this over HL1 MP but for the price (I got this game for free back when Valve had that promo a long time ago.) it's really worth checking out.			"

												Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is the multiplayer version of Half-Life 2 and is a fast-paced First-Person Shooter.You are provided a lot of ways to kill your opponents, such as shooting SMG's, Shotguns and pistols, throwing grenades or using the gravity gun to launch props at enemies. The game doesn't have a big community and there are a lot of empty servers, but there will always be enough players to fill at least 9-10. As a new player you will die a lot, the skill ceiling of the game is big and people with thousands of hours still play and wreck newcomers. The psysics engine is good and the players have made many maps. Also, there are a couple of servers with mods.Whichever prop you launch, the kill icon will always display a toilet. Cause, why not?

												This is a multiplayer game that is active and kicking today with a nice community. It feels like the community just wants to have fun instead of just run, gun, and kill each other. There are alot of custom maps to choose from. I found a map were you could play on Quake III Arena maps but with the Half life weapons. There are bots to play with or human players. This game is strictly multiplayer but has a single side if you just want to kill bots. The sounds of the weapons really have that pop to them. The graphics are just like Half Life 2 which are great. The whole game is really well done and brings you back for more. I have really enjoyed this game and if you like multiplayer games then this is definitely one to pick up.			"

												Half Life 2: Deathmatch is definitely my favourite source for a fun multiplayer experience to waste many hours, get some gibs, and probably be gibbed much more.I find the simplistic nature of it, similar to Quake days, but with the unique flavour of Half-Life with the Gravity Gun, to be a much funner experience than that of what Team Fortress 2 brings. Less can be more, and HL2:DM excels in what it tries to do.Before TF2, there was HL2:DM for me, and 9 years later, it still feels great logging into a server, hearing the screams of all of those around me that endlessly kill one another, and try to survive in it all, so that just maybe I can make it on the top of the scoreboard by the end of the round.Rating: 5 Thrown Toilets / 5			"

												Recommendation for this game? No. This game is extremely fun in my opinion but it's dead. People have tried getting it popular but they have failed. If you're going to get hl2dm you mine as well not get in and get hl2 instead. hl2dm is dead period. It has less than a population of 200 and doesn't provide much content(since it's old) and isn't updated frequently because Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game. I've seen a lot and Im thinking the game is going to die(as in 10 players tops everyday) somewhere next year or the year after that. The game can be fun and all but the only I reason I would get this at this time is play RP servers and socialize. Other then that there is no point in playing this game.Conclusion: No, only if you want to play a good game that is populated + this is a multiplayer ""accident"" game.   But for RP? If you like RP then try it out and try a decent populated RP server.EDIT: lol wtf was in my mind making this lol this sounds ♥♥♥♥ing stupid atleast i made this was when i was 14 but i mean... has much changed? prob not			"

												I'd be recommending it if it wasn't for the following: The 2010 Orange Box update that ruined the game for most of us, resulting in many leaving the game. Most techniques were simply not working anymore. The SteamPipe update deleted my files in the <username> folder. Lost a lot of work. The community. This has to be a problem. Some servers are really good, with a good community, but what destroyed the game is the russians. I'm not going to put a capital letter on it because they're not worth it. They cheat themselves and ban legit players (like me for example), who are accused of cheating. All that's happening is that they want to monopolize the game. Stay away from match servers hosted from russians. Sometimes, when fragging them in public, they are going to ask you for a 1on1 just to prove themselves, just ignore them. Cheaters. There is a cheat going on, ruining everybody's fun. Until this is fixed, stay away from DM servers. "

												What's the point of this game? It's nothing but spawn campers insta kills and it's hard to move any where without getting INSTA KIILED! I launched the game for the first time thinking it will just be last man standing, but then I saw the title screen and there were rebles and combine, so I thought ok so it's team deathmatch and I joined a server with a decent amout of people in it and the first thing I saw was a player flying straight twords me and one shot me with an smg. I was starting to get confused because the description of the game says ""Play straight deathmatch or try Combine vs. Resistance teamplay."" But it doesn't say anything about spawn camping or insta killing. So I tried another server and the same thing was happining people camping every where because they knew if they moved any where they would die. So really this game is the devil in disguise, don't get this game unless you want to be that guy. I'm lucky though, I didn't spend any money on this game, it came free with half life 2 episode 2.

												In my Opinion Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is not very fun. From the fact that there's no weapon balance, and with jerks who throw props around aimlessly, this Game is not recommended by me. The worst part about this game is the amount of Chaos at one time. Don't get me wrong, Chaos is not a bad thing, but when everyone's in a room picking up Toilets, Boxes, Explosive Barrels, Furniture, etc; then it's an awful thing. This game is just ""Half-Life 2"" put in Multiplayer format, and It seems like a good idea, but ultimately fails in the end.			"

												Where to start? This is probally my favorite game of all time, not because of the amount of content in it, because if that was the case I would have moved to GMOD a long time ago. No, I love this game because of the community, you really get to become great friends with people in it, i've been friends with loads of people for years because of this game which makes it so much more unique to gmod because the communities are far less toxic or filled with squeakers that complaine about everything.Now with the game mechanics, this is pretty much like any other Quake arena based game, you speed around the map to get health, suit and better gun pickups, the guns are pretty balanced and to be a master at this game it takes not only a good aim and reaction time, it takes map awareness and bhoping, that's right bhoping is what makes you good at dm, not your aim. Another curveball in the game is definitly the unique ""gravity gun"" where you can pick up objects from a distance away weather that means guns in hard to reach area, extra hp in a pinch or even a prop such as a toilet to kill people with, it is truely a one of a kind weapon which takes a long time to learn how to use it to the fullest potiental. With all the differnt ways to play a map, what weapons to go for first, if you should get that extra 45 suit over that magnum, or if you should bet it all on that rpg in the middle of the map, this game will surely leave you busy trying to master it, most likely taking years of practice if you are just now starting out to Quake arena styled games and HL2.Now, the real reason that keep me around here all this time (adding onto my first paragraph), is the roleplay servers of HL2. Especially sylesrp. It really is a great gamemode, not nearly as much as the gmod dark rp, but the huds are much more organized and the gameplay is simplisitic making it in my opinion a better version. The rules are more laid back and everyone in the communitys are useually a lot more chill about things such as getting killed and such. I've been with this specific server for about 6 years now, and I have to say it's really the only community I've ever felt a part of, not only are almost all the people nice, but most of them you see everyday, one of the most dedicated communites I've seen, some logging over 10k hours in the game, and most of it dedicated to roleplay. Now, even though this game is one of my favorites, I've had loads of fun, and I know a lot of others have, it just isn't worth buying anymore, the player pop is extreamly low and most of the communities are dead or dying, and the game should be empty from servers probally before next summer.

												Honestly, the multiplayer is dead.  It is hard to find a normal server.  If you like 1 shot kills, pretty lame RPs, or just servers that you mess around on, this is for you.  If you have a large group to play it with, I do recommend it.  Other wise, it is pretty dead.			"

												I am a huge fan of Half Life 2 (And its episodes. And the first game. And its expansions). I am also a huge fan of Valve's other popular FPS games (TF2, CS:GO). But, I am not a fan of this game. In fact this is one of the worst (Valve) games I have ever played. It is very, very unbalanced and not very optimized. It was hard for me to play at all on their servers. Plus, there would always be people running around with the .357, which, if you didn't know, is an instakill to the head. The items that you start off with do very little damage, and the gravity gun is practically useless. If you wanted gameplay featured in this game, just play Half Life 2: its got the same weapons, but its much more balanced. Please, save your money, and buy a different game. This one is too unbalanced and not friendly to new players.			"

												There is no point in playing this today. I regret ever downloading. You run around with all the guns you get in the HL2 campaigns and shoot other players with no objective, it's like a dumbed-down version of arena shooters like Unreal Tournament, Quake, etc. However, Half Life Source Deathmatch is of historical significance, as some of the greatest ever multiplayer games, like TF2 and CS:GO, started off as mods of it. But like seriously, don't waste your time and go play those aforementioned shooters instead. TF2 is free and CS:GO is $15, that's great value.			"

												My review for Half-Life 2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/220I personally enjoyed Half-Life deathmatch a great deal and had an amazing explosive online experience. While Half-Life 2 surpassed the incredible Half-Life singleplayer it's multiplayer did not thanks to the lack of interesting weapons and time itself. No one is playing this. The physics are neat but Half-Life 2 weapons were not the best part of Half-Life 2. They weren't bad or anything but when all your doing is shooting the problems HL2's arsenal had start to show. It never had a lot of support and the maps on offer are quite dull compared to HL1's which is a shame. The year is 2016 and I can think of no reason to play this as it doesn't even have bots (Mods don't count and the bots mod for this is hard to find and hard to install.) meaning that you would be spending 5 dollars to move around an empty map thinking sad thoughts like ""Will I be alive to see Half-Life 3?"".My review for Half-Life 2: Episode 1 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/380My review for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/420My review for Half-Life 2 Lost Coast can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/340 "

												I loved HF2 and really wanted to like this game, but I was very dissapointed. Very few servers had players and the two I did try were dominated by pros who decimated new players. WIthin 5 minutes, I was so fustrated by the one-sided battles that it stopped being fun. Honestly, if you dont mind dying a lot and  rarely making a kill, the guns and maps are fun> however, for most players, it will be aggrevating. Trust me, go TF2 instead.			"

												I like this game. It's pretty fun, and you get it when you purchase EP1 so you can have a multiplayer experience.I don't get everyone calling this game empty; It feels somewhat empty, but theres about 20 servers to play on with real people and almost no bots. I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.Also, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun. Also, DO NOT BUY IT HERE. Go buy HL2 EP1. It comes with EP1, Deathmatch and Deathmatch Source. You'll truly get a bang for your buck.			"

The problem I had during my game was the lack of games with players and the fact that online multiplayers like this do not age well. If you need more ingoing description then I suggest looking at more reviews but would you really buy an old online multiplayer game?			"

The game itself is dead anyway and the only servers that may have one or two players are russians one (more likely with an 18+ warning too). Waste of money.			"

												I dont remember buying this so i must have gotten it free with something else from valve.Before buying this game i would recommend to ask in the discution if it dying, dead or not and in the worst case scenario you will need to find friend to play it with before buying it.But it is so old that i cannot recommend it, there are way more recent and better game with DM out there.

												This game sucks now.  It gets filled with pestering little brats that use Aim Bot.  VAC can't detect it.  They claim to be skilled and heckle people that claim they are using aimbot (which they are) and then they just keep doing it.  Stupid gamers in this game now.  Years ago it was great.  There were hacks but Valve swiftly banned them.			"
