												Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders is a fantasy First Person Shooter by Raven Software that came out in 1994 and uses Doom engine. Yes, it's Doom-like shooter set in fantasy. Awesome mix. Plus inventory.Shadow of the Serpent Riders is a special patched release of a game that brings it to 1.3 version, thus adding two more additional episodes. No new game content like weapon or monsters or textures, just new levels. Think of Ultimate Doom.Now, let's tip apart the way that game was handled on Steam. Well. At least they brought the most full version of the game here. And it uses DosBox, which is usually a good thing until you find out how badly id Software configures them for Steam.The game will lag at full screen, so you want to go to game directory and edit heretic's conf file to make it use ""opengl"" for ""output"" setting.Game's option like music device and controls is once again isn't easily accessed. On good side, they didn't remove Setup.exe this time around, unlike Doom games on Steam. So you have to open game directory, drag setup.exe onto dosbox.exe and then configure it as you want.Storyline of a game is quite simple. Well, it has a lot of written in manual, but main idea and amount of plot in game is minimal.Your hero is elven hero, who's name is Corvus. Elven race, guardians of the Pathoris world and keepers of Tome of Powers, were proclaimed as heretics, when Dragon Riders came to conquer this world. With two Dragon Riders leaving for the other worlds, the remaining Dragon Rider, D'Sparil, unleashes horde of monsters through portal after Elves manage to wipe out all of the human armies of the world. Most of the elves were killed, monsters took Tome of Powers for themselves and you are one of the lone survivors. Your journey will begin at the City of the Damned.Somebody will get murdered in the end.The additional episodes 4 and 5 have excuse plot of ""portal didn't lead you to home, so enjoy the world destroyed by Dragon Riders and the home of D'Sparil"".Presentation-wise the game is quite awesome looking and sounding for it's time. Yes, Doom engine. But art-style-wise, Heretic presents the world that is dark fantasy yet very colorful, with great contrast. Setting is awesome, you get to wield a magical crossbow that is equalient to shotgun. While Episode 2 is a least interesting looking one, taking place in brown caves with lava, until it gets less dull with inclusion of ice in later level, Episode 3 brings an original setting of a underwater shrine and buildings. Even water in this game has that artsy look to it.Music is great too. With medivel feel, it's not afraid to use modern instruments. Well, instruments of MIDI and Soundblaster. Most of them are melodic and catchy. Cathedral track will send chill down your spine for sure.Gameplay itself is, surprise, Doom-like. You search and explore mazes at the running speed, finding keys and opening lcoked doors, pressing switches and discovering secret areas, shooting down monsters or rather rushing past them.You will shoot down red flying gargolues, mummies, armor knights that throw axes at you, and dark wizards of D'Sparil, who will turn your blood cold with their backward speach that sounds like silly phrases. You will also deal with respawning ""explosive barrel""-like things, will push yourself against streams of water and wind and will encounter bosses. Which are your standard FPS bosses. Being tough enemies that you will start encountering more often in later episodes. So not too amazing.Though, unlike most FPS, it does do something good: There are no enemies who use hitscan against you. What it means is that any damage in the game can be avoided, giving it more arcade-like quality. If forget that it still makes you run over damaging acid like Doom does.There are seven weapons of magical nature. Shotgun-like crossbow, Rocket Launcher-like Pheonix Rod, Plasma-gun-like Hellstaff. With most of them shooting projectiles, they feel slightly too similiar to each other in use. But thankfully, game introduces Tome of Power.Tome of Power is a item power-up that you will find through levels. By using it through inventory you will power-up your weapons for a limited time. It doesn't just make them stronger, it also gives additional properity for them, making them even more amazing. For example, mace, the final weapon, stops sucking hard. Hellstaff will make a hot magic rain appear over where the projectile collided. Gaunlets, the game's chainsaw, will start to heal you as well.Inventory is another addition to gameplay. You will get to collect various helpful items that you can use it anytime. It could be Hourglass who work as timed bomb and aren't much of use, or healing potion, or invincibility ring, or, as said, Tome of Power. Not related to inventory, you also will sometime find armor, but it's quite a rare thing.There is one important thing to be said about inventory: When you move to the next level, you will retain only one quanity of each item. You will also lose item that allows you to fly around. I am pretty sure that it may sound like a bad thing for some players. But I think it was a good idea. Most of us are used to stockpile tons of items so we could rush bosses down. With system like that, you should feel free to actually have fun using additional items during normal gameplay, you will lose them for no good otherwise.Last thing I should note is difficulty of additional episodes. Yes, episode 4 and 5 are harder. They are also more of same. And yes, the final level has eight Maloutaurs. But first levels of each of those two episodes deserve a special mention, as they will require you to think fast, use items effectively, avoid enemies you don't want to fight with in order to survive. It was really fresh challenge, at least on Normal difficulty. Got simpler after that though, as you gain more items in process.But with all the positive things I said, I have to be honest, it didn't become favourite FPS. It's hard to explain why. But you see, the game just doesn't ""click"" like Doom does. It just doesn't. I am not sure what it lacks. There is something in game feel that it doesn't have. Perhaps there should have been more common enemies that die bloodily. Or maybe it's the projectiles nature of weapons not being comparable to shotgun and rocket launcher. But yes, it lacks something, hard to say.Heretic is an awesome FPS and yes, it's a Doom clone. But it's an awesome Doom-clone, perhaps bettering Doom itself for some people.			"

												This game is not for people who have only played DOOM-cubed.  This game is for people who played ClassicDOOM on DOS.  Released during the same era of gaming, rather than being stranded on Mars with only a space-pistol, you're a Heretic, cast out by your fellow man for daring to see the enemy for what they truly are.  After D'Sparil's armies wipe out your town, you creep back in with only a Wand, helltbent on revenge.  Like ClassicDOOM, this game originally came packed with three episodes, complete with frightening enemies, awesome weaponry, and amazing powerups.  Unlike ClassicDOOM, you also had the ability to look up and down and even fly.  Shadow of the Serpent Riders added two additional episodes, but as far as I can recall, no new enemies, weapons, or powerups; just new levels.The game itself is froxen in time; the graphics have not been updated and I doubt anyone will attempt to do so.  As such, it is somewhat difficult to see in the distance on the better-developed machines of today.  However, this is my only gripe, and there's nothing that can really be done about it.  I bought this pack for one reason and one reason only: to return to my childhood.  Nostalgia.  To remind myself why I got into gaming in the first place.  And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.People looking for ""new and exiciting machanics"" will be sorely disappointed.  But if you remember the 90s, and ClassicDOOM, and Wolfenstein 3D, you need this in your collection.			"

												I first encountered Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders  as a shareware game, when we bought a new computer featuring Windows 3.11. Although Shareware (the first level, The Docks, was all that you could play) it was one of the games I enjoyed playing, although it regularly gave me frights, with monsters popping out from behind pillars, and only the unidirectional roars to tell me that they ""might"" be lurking around a corner. I played it enough to warrant a full purchase via an unlock code, and the game proved to have a great deal of longevity. The stats at the end of each level, gave you feedback on no. of monsters killed, secrets discovered and items found. This lead to a great deal of replaying and backtracking to try and find each little hiding place. I never really read the manual, and the plot is really inconsequential anyway, this is by no means a narrative driven game, suffice to say your elven race was slaughtered as they refused to believe in the deity of the ""Serpent Riders"" and were slaughtered as Heretics. You, the sole elven survivor are out to seek revenge.Today it's legacy is questionable. The genre of Fantasy FPS, is non-existent, instead we have a modern warfare or sci-fi bias that the greater legacy games, Doom, and Quake popularized. Heretic is of course from the same  period. (It uses the Doom Engine). Yet has had far less overall impact on the trend of FPS fantasy, which is rather something of  a pity, as in an oversaturated market, this genre has potential. The only games that might have built from this core concept is of course Dark Messiah of Might and Magic (includes more brawling combat) and the recent Lichdom.It has not aged well, the lack of resolution (it runs out of DosBox), poor textures and flickering lights may lead to eye strain, but the overall feel of the game is still enjoyable. It has none of the complexity and strategic gaming that later titles show, but it does sport excellent level design and exploration/puzzle mechanics, that aren't so common in modern FPS, as well as gothic interiors, and smooth gameplay.(Definitely a game to settle down to with some Death Metal on the side!)

												I like old shooters a lot. Enjoyed hours of Doom and Shadow Warrior, and found this game some days ago.Well, needless to say, I bought the whole collection hahaSo, at first, I thought I made a mistake, Heretic seemed to have only 5 stages. No no, those were 5 chapters, each of them with lots of stages. The game is indeed good, lots of secrets and has this dark ambient, creepy monsters, and awesome weapons.My only complaint is that it wasn't configured to run on newer systems, so you should probably end up downloading ZDOOM to better customize the controls.Anyways, incredible game, totally worth playing if you enjoy old games			"

												While at first you might write it off as another crappy Doom-clone, it takes the initial formula for Doom, and then expands on it.The chainsaw might be replaced by a pair of lightning gauntlets, but those gauntlets can be augmented by an item for a short bit to sap health from enemies.Although not appealing to casual audiences in the slightest, fans of old school shoot em ups can get past the ""press a button, something happens somewhere"" flawed level design and enjoy the high-challenge arenas and the subtle nuances of this fantasy-themed Doom-engine fps.

!!Important note!! To have the best experience with heretic, I would highly recommend you download a launcher called zdoom, which is free. By playing the game through gzdoom, you are able to customize the controls. I played this game on a windows 10 laptop and the game worked perfectly fine for me. There is a link below to zdoom. What I liked about the game •	I thought the monsters in the game were pretty cool, especially the Golem. •	Throughout the game there are many secrets to be found. •	There were some very good levels, especially in the first chapter.•	Some cool weapons. •	I like the idea of having an inventory, so you can use stuff that you collect later on•	In the first three chapters, at the end of each level, I like how it showed you a map telling you where you have been and where you are going to next. • Cool death animations.   What I disliked or was disappointed with •	I thought the music was quite repetitive, I know they reused some of the songs in doom, but they got reused a lot more in Heretic. •	Killing enemies in heretic wasn’t very satisfying. I didn’t feel like a badass like I did in Doom.•	The last two chapters aren’t really anything special, I like to think the story ended on the third chapter. The final         bosses in chapter 4 and 5 aren’t very interesting. •	Chapters 4 and 5 were quite hard, it was a shock because the first three chapters were very easy.•	Secrets were too easy to find.   My conclusion If you liked Doom, Quake or Hexen. I would recommend this game to you. It is a good game with some good levels and weapons. Plenty of secrets to be found as well. You get a lot for £2.99, well worth the money.70/100Zdoomhttp://zdoom.org/Download "

												One of the finer “Doom Clones”.  A medieval-fantasy based FPS from the early 90’s, consisting of 5 episodes with 8 levels each so you are looking at a 15 hour + gameplay value. It has a great atmosphere with almost non stop action all the way until the end. The levels can be maze like at times but this was purely due to technological limitations of the time. I recommend running this game with a source port (GZDOOM/Zandronum) through steam. There are several steam guides which explain how to do this. In addition I recommend using the Ketchup mod to add more blood and gore. Heretic holds its place in time as one of the great FPS’s from the late 90s.Final Score 85/100			"

												Very fun game and can be kinda of a challenge at some parts. I'd recomend that if you play this game that you get the doomsday source port since it allows you to take advantage of your current hardware and also you get to use your native resolution. I think what makes this game so great is the amazing level design that is accompanied with great enemy design will always be a great combo. Although I did not grow up playing this game and I was born after the game came out I did play hexen on the n64 growing up so I kinda knew what I was getting into and the graphics are just fine in my eyes I dont really see the need to install those stupid 3d model packs they kinda look like they ruin the the feeling of the game. If you are looking for a great classic fps this is the game to go to 10/10 would play more than a thousand hours.			"

Heretic: Shadow Of The Serpent Riders		*8/10Developed by Raven Software using and improving id's DooM engine. So this essentially is another FPS with significant new elements, compared to DooM standards.This title puts us in the role of Corvus ( posthumous name given in the sequel), one of the last elves hunted by monsters from other dimensions, headed by D'Sparil, one of the Serpent Riders. Ok, like any other FPS of those times the story is completely useless, but in this case it's a very useful excuse to give the game a strong fantasy atmosphere. So there won't be zombies or devils, but Gargoyles, mummies, mages and minotaurs. There won't be guns but ther will be wands, ethereal crossbows and other magic weapons. There are more news compared to DooM: items. They're not just health powerups but they're proper items you may carry and use at your own discretion. These are the likes of health, damage powerup, teleportation in disguise of quartz flasks, Tomes of power, Chaos device... And many other items with different use. This kind of system seriously improves the gampeplay from DooM's standard, adding that creative spice to the classic ""shooteverythingthatmovesandfindthekeyfortheexitdoor"".As in DooM, Heretic has three episodes made of 9 levels each. I was quite surprised to see that this release includes the other 2 expansion episodes from Shadow of the Serpent Riders edition which is a free upgrade I never heard about until now O.o (my bad).As usual this game is released with DosBox to launch with. Fortunately they didn't even try to clumsily implement any mouse configuration as done in the horrible DooM releases.+++PROs+++ FANTASY. Clearly the prettiest innovation of the game is the fantasy atmosphere giving a creative new look to FPS. You explore buildings, which are not stations but castles or fortress with mosaic glass, while outside you find water and terrain. The settings obviously force the use of new type of weapons: magic weapons (my favourite are the necromancer gauntlets of course, the chainsaw equivalent... XD). And of course the implementation of new and innovative items. GAMEPLAY. Besides the ability to look up and down, there are other innovations and most of them can be grouped inside the new inventory system. Now you can pick up items to be used in other moments at will, and they range from simple health replenisher, damage bonus and other disguised as perfect fantasy items. One of the most useful and innovative are the ""wings of wrath"" a big name for a flying device, a new and important powerup considering you can't jump in this game. Another interesting is the Hourglass, which is just a powerful proximity mine. More possibilities means more fun. MUSIC. I have to point it: it's not as bad@$$ as in the DooM games, but it's very nice, and suits the atmosphere. I've made covers of some of these tunes too in Youtube... B-) MODS & COMMUNITY. You can find mods, levels and so on. But most importantly custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with tricks and advices on replacing DosBox with better ports and implementing the Steam Overlay.---CONs--- STEAM OVERLAY. As usual, like on every other old steam release running on DosBox, there's no Steam Overlay. "

												Heretic was released in a time when Doom clones were thick on the ground and PC gaming was a bleak wasteland reserved for the few bold souls that dared to brave it... and what a time that was! I might wax nostalgic, but I miss the endless days of my tender youth spent in front of a CRT monitor, trying to harness the power of DOS shell commands while racking my brains to configure IRQs, DMAs and tame those elusive 640k of conventional memory just so I could play something.PCs aren't that clunky anymore (for the most part!) and a lot has changed in the gaming industry in the past 20 years or so, but I still find Heretic a much more engaging foray into first-person-shooting than Doom. Don't get me wrong, Doom was, has been and will always be a genre-defining game that paved the way for the many CoDs and BFs of today, but Heretic has always been better at immersing players in a much more fantastical world and journey with its D&D-esque aesthetics and references, while pitting you against otherwordly creatures such as manticores, armored skeletons and warlocks, to name a few. Creatures that can easily be disposed of with your arsenal of fantasy-inspired weaponry that range from extremely powerful sceptres and crossbows to spells that can multiply your power manifold or turn the most-frigthening enemy into a puny chicken that can swiftly be ripped to shreds.Heretic is definitely worth buying not only for its place in history, but also for its extremely enjoyable mechanics and overall tone. Those belonging to a younger generation with a penchant for retro-gaming should overlook its flaws and  appreciate it for what it represents in the pantheon of 1990s PC gaming.			"

Types ""IDDQD"" (doom's cheat code for invincibility), sees result. 10/10.It's ""medieval Doom"", deffinetively not what most gamers are used to nowadays - thus why you should get it. Excelent game to spend hours on. Play that, then beat the sequel, Hexen, Beyond Heretic (I assume that's a sequel, sorry) and other Hexen games. That's what I'll do whenever I beat this.(You can also create maps for it with DoomBuilder. Awesome)			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys old FPS games like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, etc. Great game!Edit:This is an aside, scroll past this paragraph if you want to get on to my actual review:Whenever I first had this review I definitely wasn't out of my shell as I am now with my opinion and how I word things than I am now, so I think that I'll write a better review now that I can fully explain my thoughts without fear of someone not liking what I have to say about this game or any game whatsoever. People should consider the fact that whenever people review a game that's just what they thought of the game and it shouldn't actually dictate whether they liked the game or not. For instance, there was a game called Alone in the Dark which came out in 2008 and I absolutely loved this game. While I loved this game, the public seemed to not care for it whatsoever. I think that if you're able to get into a game that not many people like but that you like for some reason for another, that's wonderful because then you've actually achieved the ability to discern whether or not you like a video game based upon your own experience and not necessarily based on public opinion. It's nice to just think for yourself, you guys! On to my actual review of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders. So this is the first installment of a series which is also excellent called Hexen. You should definitely look into Hexen if you find this game to be interested. I'm sure that you're aware of Hexen if you've done your research on this game and you've played this game, etc. But Heretic is a DOOM-esque game (The reason why I describe it that way because that is a common ground that most people can understand) and it is primarily based around you being a magician or a sorcerer of sorts just killing baddies. It's like Shadow Warrior, Doom, and all that. Except this is more for people who enjoy fantasy games.Now with all this I personally don't think that there are many drawbacks in this game, because at the time this game was pretty top notch, whereas now people might look at this game and laugh. I don't, despite the fact that I did discover it past the 2000s. About this game, I would say look into gameplay videos to see what it's about, check out when it was published, and do research on it before buying it. I know that impulse buying is a vice of mine so that's why I say that in practically all of my reviews.This game is definitely a change for more modern gamers and maybe you woudln't even be able to adjust to a game like this, and I totally understand that. I wouldn't blame you for not really wanting to get into something that modern gamers may consider ""a step below"" the dynamics, graphics and level of gaming that we are at now. Heretic does hold a special place in my heart and it is a pretty neat game. Look into it. Have fun with it.			"

												I make it no secret that DOOM is my favorite game ever. I guess it's because it's the game I grow up with it and I find all the games of the series to be good. While I do love it, it's nice to see some people look at that game and not only make a good DOOM clone, but decided to add to it and make it better. So yes, I'm saying this is good already. Now let me explain as best I can.StoryIt's a 90's shooter so there not much to talk about. From the synopsis from the DOOM wiki, three sorcerers called the Serpent Riders came and people started to worship their awesomeness. except for the elves who find the powerful monsters very suspicious. When two of the riders left, the remaining one gets his cult to hunt them down. As the world gets destroyed, one man decides to stand up and kill the wizard. At least it's a fantasy setting and not with massive guns for a change.GameplayIt's DOOM with a few new things so lets talk about those: For starters you have an inventory to store items like health packs or invincibility rings, which allow to use them when you need to, unlike DOOM when it's used when you touch them. The weapons are mostly the same from DOOM except no shotgun or BFG, but one power-up called the Tome of Power allows you to use a secondary firing mode, such as turning your lightning gaulents into a life draining weapon or turning you chaingun equal into a weapon that shots multiple mines on impact. So we have a inventory and weapon modes. What else is new. Oh, you can FLY!! But it's only used to find secrets.The enemies are also a step up from DOOM. These guys are designed to kill. We start with some flying imps and golems that just scratch you, then we meet guys that throw stuff, then ones that shot three balls at the same time and then the first guys start shooing fireballs, and so on. And that's not talking about the bosses which are a league of their own. These are some of the hardest bosses I've seen in a shooter and freak me out whenever I see some. Sure the Cyderdemon was cool but he's nothing compare to the Maulotaur with his giant hammer, fire attacks and charge attacks.If there's any gripes I have with the game is that the levels have a pattern. What I mean is that it's yellow key, green key, blue key in any level in that order. This cause the levels to be dull after a while.PresentationMusic is okay. there are some good tracks here, but they're nothing compare to anything from DOOM and start to sound the same after a while. The art design is mainly brown and grey but there's also a lot of blue, especially later in the game when we get to the underwater lair.Speaking of which, the Serpent Rider is everywhere. you constantly see his statues, his picture and symbol wherever you go.Also, this is one of the goriest games I've played. Almost every enemies blows into tiny bits when kill. Sure other games have some prettying graphic kill animations but I could still recognize the corpse.VerdictIt's a good DOOM clone with several improvements. If you love DOOM I recommended giving it a try.8/10			"

 Steam reports only a few minutes, but I spent 12-20hrs in Heretic using GZDoom which is HIGHLY recommended (required in my opinion). It is tough to play without a source port. Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders is a essentially a fantasy flavored DOOM, so if you played the classic FPS, then you should feel at home here, though it has it's own unique features and feel. A good Doom source port is extremely recommened, if not required to enjoy this game in modern times. The ending is disappointing, but Heretic is a classic FPS that is good as if not better than the iconic DOOM games.Heretic  is a pretty old game, and the lore isn't explained well in game, so understanind the story takes reading of the old manual and wiki pages. Gameplay wise, it is a fantasy flavored Doom - same sprite based graphics, same semi-primitive 3D Levels, similar weapons, same Midi-based music, same maze like level designs and secrets, well the same game engine. It isn't a ""reskin of DOOM"" though, it is it's own independent game in which I found pretty fun and has the same visceral enemy destruction and robust, but sometimes maze-like level design. Also, the items you recieve go into your inventory versus being used instantly, so you can save invincibility, invisibility, health potions, and even timed bombs for when you need it, but that also means you have to manage that inventory with scrolling and use keys. You also will find limited items that grant temporary flight for combat and exploration (though is only necessary for a few moments) and the Tome of Power (as mentioned in Heretic lore) that gives your weapons powerful alternate fire modes - which made the game really fun in big fights - more so than classic DOOMs in my opinion.The start of some episodes are tough due to limited ammo and weapons, so expect to kite and bait enemies, and dodge them all together at times. I enjoyed my experience with the game, but I also found the ending to be underwhelming, which throws dozens of bosses from a previous episode and ends on a cliffhanger for Heretic 2, which is not easy to obtain (pricey on stores or via abandonware sites).

												Heretic was the first licensed Doom engine game. And... it shows it's limitations at times. Both from a stylistic point of view and the technical side of things.Doom was a lot of things, but above all else the game was very polished and it felt inspired. From it's soundtrack to it's enemy design, everything felt like it needed to be there. And it genuinely felt like the developers all had a central vision they shared for what the game eventually became.Heretic on the other hand feels like it's stuck in Doom's shadow. The game mechanics feel far too similar to Doom and the aesthetic of the game, while impressive for the time did not age well. All of the weapons in Heretic feel more or less like reskins of Doom weapons. Apart from the graphics it feels like the same basic game but with a much less interesting aesthetic and soundtrack.The things I appreciate Heretic more are for it's historical context like how it was one of the first FPS games to come bundled with online multiplayer support, how it had a very large custom map community and how it serves as a prequel to the HeXen series. But I really only recommend Heretic on it's own if you're a Doom fanatic such as myself, since I unfortunately see the game as very forgettable.

												I only got around to playing Heretic recently, and I was genuinely surprised at how well it held up. The game is fun, challenging, and good throughout. Some of the controls are a little obtuse at first glance until you get used to them (and button placement is not optimal), so you might want to try to get some configuration.Some of the bosses can be a little difficult, but it's not that bad. Now the EXPANSION - that one seemed to crank the difficulty up to extremely high levels, so that might give you some trouble. However, it's only two of the five chapters included in the game, and it's all one package, so it's not a big deal.A lot of fun, and it's held up a lot better than Doom itself has.			"

												This is an old game. Do not expect it to be on par to current fps standards. It has weird controls, and it's pretty hard.But that's ok. This is a gem, one of the greatest FPS ever made with the technology the devs had at the time.It's fun and a piece of gaming history.Still here? Go on a search for gzdoom or Doomsday. These are supporting software that will give you better control, mouse support, better audio and refined visuals. Given the current native resolution of monitors, the refined visuals are specially important.			"

												Back in 90s, I loved Heretic more than its ""bigger brother"". Feeling still persists and for me, buying and playing this game again after so many years brought a lot of memories. Game consists of five episodes (2 of which were added subsequently). Each Episode has specific theme. Story is not that important, however if you get to it, it might boost your ""morale"" in-game. Thing is, you are probably only remnant of old race, killed out by serpent riders. Yostart your journey of vengeance and retribution against forces of evil. Fantasy-themed weapons (mostly in a form of magical ""staffs"") and variety of items (one of them turns several enemies in your FOV into chicken) will help you on the way. I really enjoy playing it even after almost 20 years.			"

												I didn’t play Heretic back in the time of its release. After reading up on its plot and playing through the first few levels, I found myself thinking about this exchange from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:Frodo: It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Yeah, this isn’t that kind of game. If you’re wanting to take part in some noble quest to bring peace and justice to a mythical world, there are dozens of RPGs out there that will scratch that itch. In Heretic, some conqueror types destroyed your homeland. So you’re going to repay them by wiping them out. All of them. Every. Last. One. And when you’re striding away from the smoking, carnage filled ruins you’ll have the grim satisfaction of having balanced the scales.So, it isn’t noble. Not a bit. But it is a blast to play. "

												This game, though a bit bland, is fun if you're into first person shooters from the 90s. With the episodes included and the varying difficulty settings along with an extensive amount of secrets to discover and expanisve dungeons to explore there's a lot to keep you busy. With that being said however, the game's atmosphere doesn't really stray from cobblestone-bricked castles, dungeons, catacombs and sewers. That's not to say that they're boring; a nice atmosphere of horror and Dark Souls-esque hopelessness is present here. It can just feel a bit monotonous to see recycled and similar-looking textures, battling the exact same enemies repeatedly with one or two more thrown in during each episode, and hearing the same music again and again. The overbearing use of grey isn't very appealing to the eyes either. With that being said though the maps are really big and sprawling with cleverly placed traps and treasure to run into. I'm also a huge fan of the crisp sound effects, minimalist but funny and charming voice acting, well detailed graphics and the designs of the enemies and environments which draw obvious influence from medieval art. You'll hear the same songs again and again but the songs are admittedly catchy and fit well with the tone of the game.You can find more inventive and unique games for the same price so in my opinion it's worth having but wait until it's on sale; where you can most often get it for two dollars or less.

												This game is by far amazing, its originally a doom mod so of course you will expect alot of things from this game. The gameplay gives off that doom feeling (without respawning though those who plays Doom on nightmare mode), and the amount of enemies they added in the game is truly insane. This is something a hardcore first person shooter would have, intense action.The game is quite fun and i would definitely recommend anyone playing it. Keep noted, the setup is not like modern games so make sure you know what you are doing. Otherwise, go search up on google or check the Steam community for some help. If you know any friends that knows how to do the setup on binding keys and disabling mouse movement, let them know. Its possible to modernize some controls, but remember to put in the keys that are comfortable for you to use and easy to remember.I mean at first i was like ""meh"" because of how it looks which put me in the ""ok"" position. But dang, after playing through certain levels with bunch of enemies, the adrenaline has kicked in and I went full carnage the same way i did in Doom. The game is fun enough as it is, and its hard for me to stop until the end.Will promise you the game will be fun, just remember to set up your controls properly and if you dont like mouse movements, theres a way to disable it.This goes to people that likes something that involves fighting demons, ogres, and other creatures. Playing classic games, and first person shooter.			"

												Heretic is the first game in the Serpent Rider trilogy, and takes place on the fantasy and Elven inhabitated world of Parthoris, which has been visited by a Serpent Rider called D'Sparil, the youngest of his brothers. He manages to convince the Seven kingdoms of the world to follow him like sheep, building worship sites in his honor via D'Sparil's Sign of the Trident. The only ones immune to his infectious influence are the ancient elders of the Sidhe race, a small group of strong Elven sorcerers that have been branded as heretics and seek refuge and are ultimately pressed to weave their powerful magic and extinguish the Seven candles in order to collapse the rallied armies of the Seven kingdoms primed against them. It seems D'Sparil's plan to inherit the world had failed. Until he reveals his own personal army from the depths of the abyss, who overpower and slaughter the remaining Sidhe. Only one elf managed to escape, Corvus, who now seeks bloody vengeance from the cruel slaying of his people and corruption of his world and challenges D'Sparil to the death, even to his own terrifying home dimension.If the first Quake is more or less Doom in 3D, then Heretic is practically Doom with a fantasy skin. But what seperates Raven's game from id's is its own gimmicks and advanced engine features. You can look up and down, there's an inventory system that allows collection and utilization of various magical items at any time, a few examples like the Quartz Flask which is Heretic's take on Doom's medikit, the unique Tome of Power which is a spellbook of Sidhe origin that temporarily increases the power of all weapons in possession, the Wings of Wrath that grant the ability to fly for a short period of time, or the humiliating Morph Ovum that transforms once powerful foes into measily chickens! There's more environmental hazards than in Doom like slippery ice floors, wind currents that push you back, and regenerating spores which are effectively Doom's explosive barrels if they could respawn. Most weapons are very similar counterparts to Doom's: Gauntlets of the Necromancer (which sadly do not resurrect the dead as your own) operates like the chainsaw, the Elvenwand functions like a pistol, the Ethereal Crossbow like a shotgun, the Dragon Claw like the chaingun, Phoenix Rod is Heretic's rocket launcher, or the Hell Staff, Heretic's magical take on the plasma rifle. There's no BFG equivalent however, and like stated prior all of these weapons can be temporarily boosted to have extraordinary properties, making short work of even the deadliest creatures.D'Sparil's army consists mostly of little red gargoyles, flesh golems and undead warriors earlier on, but you'll be coming face to face with more otherworldly monsters like the enigmatic Sabreclaw, the serpentine Ophidian, and even D'Sparil's own Disciples. It's not quite as robust and memorable as Doom's bestiary but they put up a decent fight, often coming in large mobs, and can be surprisingly dangerous at times on the highest difficulties. Even though there are no hitscan enemies in the game, you will be bombarded with projectile attacks and some of these do pretty serious damage, the Disciple's attack in particular, or the alternative attack of the undead warrior in the form of a luminous red, blood dripping axe. Some monsters also come in several other variants, not simple recolors but different abilities, like some gargoyles are melee only and others throw fireballs, or Nitrogolems that cast homing magical skulls at their target. Bosses are featured at the end of each episode in traditional Doom fashion, and I'm happy to say here that none of them are really pushovers like they were in Doom. Iron Liches, Maulotaurs and D'Sparil himself are all formidable adversaries and pack a surprise or two.Heretic's level structure is just like the first Doom game, with five episodes in all. The first three consisting of the original story, and two extra that take place after the events of episode 3. Episodes 4 and 5 were added later on as a sort of expansion pack but more of an upgrade to the original release, much like the fourth episode added to Doom. It's really just more of the same, but the maps are notably more difficult to traverse and have a greater density of monsters. Only for the diehard fans, otherwise you're not missing anything if you choose not to play them. Heretic's levels are for the most part very Doom-y and straightforward, with optional side areas to visit and secret areas hidden about. Three keys are required to exit most maps and action is constant from start to finish, making even single episode playthroughs rather exhausting once finished.Visuals and audio are very well done, there's lots of color and plenty of detail in the artwork for textures and sprites, a lot of little details in fact which Raven has always been about and if you have an eye for such thing it's impressive the amount they packed into the Doom engine. It's not as dark in tone as Doom but Heretic's adventure still manages to feel oppressive and perilous. The music is done by Raven's longtime musician Kevin Schilder and has an appropriate fantasy sounding theme in each level, more or less on par with Bobby Prince's contributions to Doom. Not always as upbeat as Doom but they are often fun and catchy, with some of the gloomier pieces being very atmospheric provoking a sense of dread.My personal criticisms is the lack of texture variety, as Heretic has a strangely small set of them, but they're almost always applied well enough. Some monsters can soak up a bit too much damage, making hordes of them feel like a chore to take down, and are usually too slow in their movement to be of any real threat if you choose to run past them. Episodes 3 and 4 are off to an unusually difficult start because ammo isn't in great abundance and you're almost showered with foes, forcing you to retreat until you find enough supplies to fight back. Lastly as mentioned earlier episodes 4 and 5 are very tacked on and don't offer anything new besides more difficult levels, some of which can be pretty obnoxious (I'm looking at you E4M9). It's no doubt a fun game and a worthy counterpart to Doom but it's not nearly as fun or as well designed as Doom is, combat can be so-so at times and the balance isn't always great in regards to enemy strength or player weapon damage. Some weapons are just flat out redundant in operation, there's not one not two but three rapid firing weapons which cuts down on the creativity. The Fire Mace being Heretic's 'ultimate' weapon is lackluster at best (at least when its un-Tomed that is). Finally the amount of user content available is also very low, nowhere near Doom's or even Wolf3D, so if you turn out to really like Heretic there's only going to be so much on offer.Ultimately Heretic is a mostly solid shooter with some cool ideas and an overall nice premise and its the beginning of a very decent trilogy of fantasy themed shooters, with the sequels Hexen and Hexen II continuing and concluding the Serpent Rider trilogy. If you enjoyed Doom and want a similar game and/or wish to pursue Raven's Heretic/Hexen series then it still comes as recommended. Raven and id were best buddies earlier on and collaborated on numerous projects together and most of the games turned out well enough, with Heretic as the first major foray into Raven's mainstream successes.3.5/5			"

												While I love Doom a lot, this is far from a clone. A dark fantasy setting, weapons that aren't just reskins, and a memorable soundtrack that is worth playing just to listen to. It's also really, really hard, especially on the higher difficulty settings, which is something to be expected of games from its time, but this takes it to a whole other level. I recommend running it through GZDoom. This will allow you to potentially play the level in ways that clearly weren't intended, like jumping through some windows, aiming straight up or down, etc, but it drastically improves the controls and gives you limitless customization.One of the best shooters out there.

												While it's a Doom clone at its core, Heretic actually does a great job of setting itself apart from its Sci-Fi counterpart. The inventory powerup system, weapon alt-fires, and vastly different enemy and level design lend themselves to an experience that feels like doom in engine only, and the expansion levels especially will provide a nice challenge to any classic FPS fan.Downloading the GZDoom sourceport to run the game is strongly recommended as it will help with most issues you may have getting it to run on a modern system, and it greatly expands graphics and control options.

												Heretic is mainly a DOOM reskin. Let's get that out of the way right now.  It's the same engine, all of the controls are the same, there are three chapters with 8 levels and one secret level each, the final boss of the first chapter is two tougher-than-average enemies, all of the weapons have easily identifiable DOOM equivalents, and you even descend into Hell at one point. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is very noticeable.The fantasy setting is the main difference, but it's by no means the only one. The engine is improved, allowing the player to look up and down; the powerups are more varied, allowing the player to fly, teleport back to spawn, and give their weapons all-new attacks; and the levels are generally easier to navigate, which is always  nice A GODSEND.Heretic also has an inventory, and while it's nice to be able to pick up powerups and use them at any time, you're only allowed to carry one of each item with you between levels. If you managed to pick up 12 Time Bombs of the Ancients in one level and didn't use them (because why would you), you only get one next level. I'm guessing this was because they couldn't figure out how to make the game keep track of the quantity values, but it's still annoying, especially when you're trying to stockpile Tomes of Power or Quartz Flasks.However, Heretic is missing one very important thing that DOOM had:  an actually effective BFG the right tone. Heretic is a good game, but it's also a staid one, and it lacks the metal soundtrack, ridiculously fun weapons, anarchic mishmash of sci-fi and Satanic imagery, juvenile rebellion-for-rebellion's-sake feel, and sense of  fun  that made DOOM so memorable. That difference is why DOOM is revered and Heretic is simply fondly remembered.Still, Heretic is a very good game, and it's definitely worth your time.P.S. I played this directly after Rise of the Triad, and am reminded of how much more fun idTech 1 is than the Wolfenstein engine. It's just freer.P.P.S. The Gauntlets of the Necromancer are technically just the replacement for the chainsaw, but l like them a lot more. It's fun to just run around whimsically Emperor Palpatine-ing enemies, and with the Tome of Power it's weirdly the most overpowered thing in the game, with the ability to leech health at an alarming rate. This is the kind of thing games need more of: unbeatable Sith Lightning gloves.			"

												Incredibly fun game if you like the original Doom. The difference is you're a wizard, with spells and an inventory of magic items. I did a key rebind to tab through the magic items because the default controls were awkward. Great boss fights; way better than Doom's.			"

												While more of a rabbit hop over the bar set by Doom and Doom 2 than a quantum leap forward for the genre, Heretic nonetheless introduces some interesting new mechanics and thrives on the novelty of its medieval/fantasy aesthetic. If you don't enjoy oldschool first-person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, Heretic won't do much to change your mind, though if you are a casual FPS fan as well as a fan of medieval/fantasy RPGs, this could be the title for you. While the game contains some excellent textures (for the time), music and level design, as well as some inventive and fun inventory items, the ability to look up and down as well as the ability to fly, the weapons don't differentiate themselves as well as those in the Doom series, with limited/non-existant damage scaling and very little reason to employ a certain weapon over another in combatting the monsters. A well-designed and entertaining game that falls just short of greatness.			"

												Great game First Fps i ever played as a young kid and its still great. If u liked DOOM DOOM 2 and Plutonia Experiment(3rd DOOM) youll love this. same gameplay as doom games but heres the FPS Revolution that this game introduced first game u can look up and down save items in an inventory for later use and FLY! The game made steps toward the advancement of FPS games and one other big difference betwen this and DOOM: U CAN EXPLORE ALL AREAS AND KILL ALL MONSTERS WITH LIMITED THREAT OF RUNNING OUT OF AMMO!!!!! (even when played on the hardest difficulty.) in DOOM if u kill every monster on every level and find evey item ur out of ammo by level 15 i like not having to run away when demons deserve to die!

												Heretic is basically a re-skinned  DOOM. There are slight changes (like there is an added inventory system), but it is mostly DOOM with new paint. Some of the enemies have similar movements to the monsters in DOOM. All the weapons are also basically from DOOM, but they look different. I did enjoy the music in Heretic (for a game released in 1994). So overall, if you enjoy DOOM then you might enjoy Heretic. Or you might just want to play DOOM.7/10			"

												I was a big fan of Doom growing up in the 90's, but I somehow missed out on all of the ""Doom Clones."" I had a demo CD for the Mactintosh version of Star Wars: Dark Forces and I played a lot of Goldenye 007 on N64, but I never really played anything else like Doom.One of the friends I made in middle school introduced me to Heretic and HeXen, but I couldn't find copies for a reasonable price. Instead of borrowing or bootlegging the game, I decided to just wait until I had enough money in the future (which never seemed realistic at the time).Flash forward to today and I've somehow managed to have Heretic on my Steam account for 5 years without playing it. I had forgotten about the QuakeCon pack from 2011 that included every iD title from that moment. Much to my surprise after having a Doom craze, I had some more Doom to explore.Calling Heretic a ""Doom clone"" is doing the game an injustice, but it certainly has a lot of game feel similar to Doom. Almost every weapon is a reskin from Doom 2 and most of the monsters share similar properties to enemies seen in Doom. The designs are incredibly different (and really diverse), but it's hard to initially get out of your mind that Heretic is just Doom with a different coat of paint.Eventually, you start to pick up on some of the changes that developer Raven Software has crammed into Heretic. For starters, this is the first FPS I can think of with an inventory system. It allows for the level of challenge to be ramped up since the player can constantly hold a source of health on them.Not only that, but you can carry around various power-ups to use in sticky situations. Other shooters at the same time forced you to utilize anything you picked up then and there; Heretic puts more control into the players hand with the inventory system.It is a bit annoying how you need to scroll through and additionally select an item before using it, but I'll let that slide due to the release date (1994). That something so genre bending was even pulled off on the Doom engine is just awesome, let alone how chaotic it makes combat feel.Each weapon has a different ammo type. It solves the mini issue Doom suffered with having the pistol and chaingun share ammo; getting the chain gun made the pistol redundant. In Heretic, every weapon feels valuable at any given time. Even the dinky starter mage staff can become awesome with the correct power-up.What isn’t so hot is how predictable the game becomes. At first, you're not quite sure where to expect enemies to spawn from. Walking down corridors has walls dropping and enemies flying at you from all sides. By the time you reach the third episode, you've seen basically all of the tricks Heretic is ever going to throw at you.That may have more to do with the original game only being 3 episodes, but episodes 4 and 5 really suffer from a lack of creativity. They are definitely difficult and well built (better than the rest of the game, even), but it feels dull after having played through 24 maps with similar layouts.This is coupled with how the level design tends to have a lot of dead ends that require you to return to a centralized location. I'm guessing this was a precursor to the level design in the sequel, HeXen, where every map has a hub world. It does lend to some insanely confusing layouts, though.The sound design is also pretty lackluster compared to Doom. On its own, the music is okay and the monsters sound like monsters, but nothing is distinct and most of the enemy sounds play at the same volume. It doesn't feel as immersive as Doom, nor does it help the player distinguish which enemy is in an area with them.The overuse of the first boss is also pretty lame. Maybe that is down to me playing on the second hardest difficulty, but I do wish there was more diversity in the boss encounters. Facing three of those floating giant skulls level after level becomes grating.With all of that said, I still found Heretic to be really enjoyable. It contains enough originality that any comparison to Doom sounds nitpicky. Sure, Doom may be an overall more polished and enjoyable game, but that doesn't make anything done in Heretic not worth seeing. Heretic is also considerably harder, so Doom veterans will be in for a treat.Getting the game running on modern operating systems is also a breeze. Since id Software released the Doom source code a long time ago, any modern Doom source port works with Heretic. You can boot up zDoom and get Heretic going in any manner of resolution you want. Full mouse look is enabled and keys can be rebinded to whatever your fancy is. There is even support for internet play, which is pretty damn awesome.It also doesn't hurt that the current price is exceptional. $5 for a game that will take around 6-8 hours to finish is just solid value. If you want to spring a bit more, you can get the rest of the series on Steam for $5 more. That includes Heretic, HeXen and HeXen II. That's a lot of classic first-person shooter action for a small chunk of change.However you slice it, Heretic is pretty good. There are definitely things that Raven Software could have done to distinguish it from the crowd, but for a first attempt from an unknown developer, you could do worse. For the price, you'd be hard pressed to find much worse, though.7/10			"

												Heretic is doom with magical weapons. It looks terrible on modern displays, and many aspects of the game are hard to manually set, but there are mods that make the game playable/not-look-like-a-pixel-dump. You strafe and shoot, typically lacking for any need to look up or down, and get lost in maze-like levels as you try to find the way out. You will need to key-hunt, but keys really arn't so hard to find.Gameplay plus possible mod:

Someone wrote how did games like this ever get made because they were bloody fun is what I tell you. Looking at slick and flashed up graphics, some of today's generation of gamers might turn their nose up to it. However, ID Games were a lot of fun back in the day (man I feel old using that phrase, lol) - DOOM, DOOM 2, Quake, Quake 2, Quake 3, Castle Wolfenstein.I bought this game out of nostalgia. Sadly, it just wasn't updated to really be handled well by newer machines. So, it's good for a nostalgia buy but for gameplay it misses the mark.  "

												Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders is a great game for classic Doom fans who are looking for more of the same shooting goodness in a new environment. You have a total of 5 Episodes in the game, each of them with 8 (+1 secret) intense levels of sweet monster destruction.The gameplay is very similar to Doom 2, but with significant changes, such as Z-clipping (you can walk under and over enemies), ability to look up and down (though limited), and an inventory system that lets you keep items for later use instead of them activating on pick-up, removing the need to avoid walking over items in case you wanted to save them for later.I played the game on Skill 4 (Thou art a smite-meister) and found the game to be a decent challenge, but felt that it could have done with slightly smaller quantities of ammunition. After the first level or two in each episode, I'd be practically swimming in ammunition no matter how wasteful I got.I also played the game through the use of GZDoom due to being spoiled by modern day shooters and requiring mouselook (and the ability to use Steam overlay).Overall, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys classic FPS games and hasn't yet tried this game out.

In this game, you won't have to spend 10 minutes going in and out of cover to shoot three enemies. Nor will you need to press 30 buttons just to be able to shoot and move at the same time. In this game, you go forward, kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ collect items and keys, and find the exit. Simple as. And did I mention you don't have to wait for a checkpoint, and you can just make your own by saving the game at any time from the in-game menu? Revolutionary!!!(Really...it's like games have DEvolved in this regard over the years!)Okay, so the graphics are bad by today's standards; for 1994, though, that WAS the standard, and Hexen pulls it off wonderfully. The sound, though, IS great even by modern standards, particularly the groaning and screeching of hidden enemies. The feeling of walking around a cleared room or courtyard HEARING these motherfreakers but not knowing when you're going to run across them provides significantly more tension than any Slender-style 'horror' game (really, if you've ever been in REAL woods at night, Slender shouldn't be the slightest bit scary to you.) And once you DO find them, they are some tough cookies, even at Level 2 difficulty (Level 2 or 3 is ideal for semi-experienced old-school FPS players wanting a challenging but not overtly stressful experience.)What's more, this is the Shadow of the Serpent Riders edition, which means technically you are getting five games in one, as it contains all the commercially released 'episodes' of Hexen. With eight or so levels to plow through in each episode, this one is sure to keep you playing for a while.In short, while it does feature outdated graphics and lack the rockin' soundtrack of the original PC Doom, Hexen does everything else extremely right. The setting is both ludicrous and original for the time, mixing two of geekdom's favourite genres (sci-fi and high fantasy), locations are remarkably detailed for 1994, there's plentiful items to collect and weapons to try out, the difficulty is balanced but not overtly easy, and sound design is great. It also expands on the traditional FPS formula of the day by adding light RPG elements, with collectible items that can help you at certain junctions. This does, however, bring up another minor flaw, as at no point in-game are you told what each item does - you'll have to resort to FAQ guides for that, unfortunately. Once you do figure out each item's use, however, they are actively helpful, sometimes rendering previously impossible levels or sections significantly more manageable, thereby actively influencing and enhancing the overall experience.In short - if you're a graphics snob, require all your titles to be AAA quality, or are only in it for the trading cards, Hexen will not be for you. Anyone simply wanting an enjoyable retro first-person-shooting experience, however, can't go wrong with this one - especially if you manage to get it for pennies, like I did!Final Rating: 8/10			"

												OMFG!  Oldschool!They really dont make em like they used too.  Loved this game then, love it now.  I think this was released around the time Doom was.  Imo, this was by far the better of the 2 games.  The graphics may look a tad dated, but the game just reeks of epic.  Easily gets a 8/10 (lost a point due to its age).			"

												TIP:Use the Dosbox keymapper (CTRL+F1) to remap keys.Default is arrow keys (not WASD) while left and right arrow are TURNING , not strafing, which is unlike newer shooters like Quake.The defaults for strafing are comma and dot so just remap them to A and D.Note that it also would affect the menu.Also if you don't feel comfy with tiny windowed resolution (if you play windowed), navigate to the game folder in the Steam folder (just google or find for yourself where it sits) and edit heretic.conf to use windowresolution=800x600 or something similar. You can also edit fullscreen=true to fullscreen=false to start in windowed mode.After this, there's no real need to play source ports, of course if you like and accept that pixelated oldsch00l look in your life. Plus you'll be sure you won't be cheating (i.e. jumping).The game itself is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.			"

												Heretic is possibly the most overrated game I know of. It's above average, good but far from great.The main reason for this is simply put the level design. Possibly a fourth of my playtime consisted of aimlessly wandering around looking for what opened or what switch to push, a design choice decidedly ""old-school"", but nonetheless bad. DOOMs level design is infinitely better, because it will rarely (if ever) leave you scratching your head, wondering where to go next. The weapons (with the exception of a few) are copies of weapons from DOOM, they just feel clunkier and are less satisfying to use. Enemies can usually also be correlated to some rough equivalent in DOOM, but most of them have been changed a little bit. The worst example of this is the Iron Lich (most similar to cacademons), whose whirlwind attack (depending on the situation) can be completely unfair, or completely useless. The best example of this are the Disciples of D'Sparil, who I can't even think of a correlation for in DOOM. All that said, the art, music and sound in this game are all really great and create a forboding, dark and gothic atmosphere. If you're a fan of shooters from this era, you'd be a fool to miss Heretic. I would however recommend giving episode 4 and 5 a miss unless you're a masochist. They're not difficult in a fun way, it's just an excruciatingly slow grind of trial and error, possibly only surpassed by the likes of Final DOOM. If you don't like FPS of this era, this game has no chance of winning you over (I would recommend DOOM as a starter, it's still a great game).			"

												""Heretic"" is essentially a medieval fantasy version of ""Doom"" with a few minor (and major) improvements, such as the ability to aim/look up and down to a certain degree (there's no autoaim in this game, so mastering this skill is essential) and a basic inventory system, allowing you to carry several items which can help your progress. The original release featured 3 episodes, only one of which was playable as shareware. This is the expanded edition which was released commercially in stores following the success of ""Doom"". This new version gives you 2 additional episodes, bringing the total up to 5.Graphics - bright, vivid and colourful, which is a stark contrast to the realistic and disquieting look of ""Doom"" - the level design is well done and the enemies, items and characters represent what they are meant to represent. With that said, it CAN get creepy and even scary at times, so this game hasn't completely lost its horror atmosphere genesis.Sound - the musical score by Kevin Schilder is limited but at the same time varied in terms of atmosphere, mood and genre, ranging from enigmatic to hectic to ominous. Episodes 1 and 2 have their own music, while Episode 3 uses recycled tracks from the first two episodes except for two levels, which have their own unique musical pieces not heard in any other stage. The music from the last two episodes are the same as from the first two episodes, in the same running order. The sound effects are minimalistic and represent the most basic form of auditory feedback, while the enemies' noises can enhance or ruin the atmosphere, depending on your mood.Gameplay - as mentioned above, the inventory system and the ability to look/aim up and down breathes new life into the ageing Doom engine. The overall play style is almost identical to that of ""Doom"" - find keys to unlock doors, shoot on sight and escape to the next level. One stage of each episode has two exits, one of which will take you to a secret level - you'll have to look hard for it. Using the inventory system is crucial to survival as certain items will work in your favour, while others will have humorous effects, making the game significantly easier. You will lose your inventory upon completion of a level, so don't be afraid to use away your items.Presentation - you are greeted with a new version of the ""Heretic"" title screen upon starting the game. During the intermissions between levels, you are shown the time you took to beat the present level, amount of enemies killed on that level, items obtained and secrets discovered - a feature copied directly from ""Doom"". On the first three episodes, you are also shown a map indicating your progress from stage to stage - this feature is absent on the last two episodes, considering they were only included to make the game a commercial re-release (the original version was only available via mail-order).Conclusion - the two extra episodes may or may not take your fancy since they add nothing new to the formula (I have mixed feelings about them myself) unless you want a new challenge (they were made for gamers who had mastered the original ""Heretic"" trilogy and wanted something harder), and it's a much more enjoyable game than ""Doom"" when you take in the extra features this game has to offer.Final Score - 5 out of 5 stars.

												It has been i time since i have been after a old style shooting game. The old graphics are not the catch, nor is it nostalgy, but something that nowaday single player shooter games lacks.The game map design and logic, allows you to go deep into difficulty, sometimes into puzzle, all in a linear story. There is a secret every corner, and some monsters simply endure several of your shots with ease. The combination of this work - i insist, specially the level design - is simply awesome.(Plus, the game lasts somewhat like 2:30h~3h each chapter, to a total of 12~15h of gameplay in normal. Try playing it on hard after it.)I first played it as a child, unable to do anything without cheats due to difficulty. I recently bought this game after giving up to search for a decent 1st person shooter, and rediscovered a masterpiece. (Which i can know how to play!)If you don't care to graphics and controls, this is the game for you. If you don't care to graphics but to control, this is still a game for you, as there are many mods to alter control, even allowing mouse usage and aiming.			"

												Make sure you run ZDoom with it to experience all the beauty of HDness of things like 1920x1080 resolution!Lovely game, draws me in VERY easily because of the textures, the layout of the maps, just generally how everything looks like in the game. It's all beautiful. Except for the enemies, that is. :p Now you may wonder why ""1 hour?""...because of ZDoom, I can't run the Steam's executable so I added ZDoom's to my library. I played this game A LOT in my childhood along with many other FPS classics, hence why I find it all so beautiful, I used to be astonished and find everything just so amazing to look at when I was that young. Especially the water and the paneling on Episode 3. I must've spent over a week of gameplay in my life so far, I look forward to many more hours! Anyway, enough about my experiences, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Doom, old as the 90s' games, medieval FPSes, and I encourage everyone that enjoys FPSes simply because this is the best of both worlds. Medieval FPS that has an inventory system, (unfortunately, though, you only have one per item left in your inventory after each level's done which REALLY sucks) and its textures for the maps are just great for their age, so if anyone who's artistically interested in video games, this is one of them. Of course its old, but if you don't mind old then its great! Also has an alright replay value, its levels can be memorable, sure, but the gameplay doesn't really get old. Finish the game once, let some time pass, (whatever's necessary to make you forget how some of the levels are laid out) replay it again. How much fun, right?...but if you don't enjoy it that much then I dunno, must be my nostalgia goggles or something. :p Anyway, yeah, amazing game, (for its time? Nah, for all time. :p) lots of fun to be had, quite the cup of tea for those who enjoy (old, depending on who it is) FPSes.			"

												Often overlooked old school FPS set in a dark fantasy world. Although the graphics are obviously dated, the game has retained its charm through the years and still offers the same challenge and enjoyment as when it was first released. The brooding fantasy world is a breath of fresh air compared to modern day shooters, and the Key mechanic present in each level provides a puzzle-like feel to the game as you hack and slash your way through the undead. The game is good about throwing surprises at the player, and even in a broadly lit room I still find myself jumping from time to time. The music is highly recommended and never gets old, even after listening to it for hours on end. Those looking for a more graphically updated version might check out the Doomsday engine, which runs the old school game with new textures and updated models for enemies. Great game! Highly recommended!			"

												I played this game a bit as a kid (still have the floppy disks right next to me actually!) and it still has a lot going for it. Very creative weapons, each with a Powered Up mode that changes its functionality, as well as some creative uses of interactive environments (like flowing water that pushes you in a particular direction, ceiling crushers, and plenty of hidden secrets). What makes this game stand out from other 1990's FPS titles is the inclusion of an inventory, with loads of different items like Time Bombs, emergency health potions, and an egg that'll turn enemies (or you!) into chickens.I would, however, recommend playing this game in the free zDoom or gzDoom program, which will allow you not only to customize the controls, the UI, etc. but also run the game at higher resolutions. Simply make sure your HERETIC.WAD file (you get this when you purchase the game) is in the same folder as the zDoom executable, and you'll be good to go. The higher resolutions help sharpen in-game shadows and clarify other visuals.Pick this one up, it's a classic!			"

												Heretic was the one that took a little different way than the rest. Doom was all the hype back then and sure Doom was good, but what made Heretic excellent was its use of sound. You could almost feel the power of the weapons by their grabbing sound effects when firing, something I miss even in today's games. Hearing random laughs from the environment adds tension to the game, and that glad laugh you get from the character when you pick up a new weapon... love it.Overall it's a basic FPS in a medieval time. If you want to try something retro, this would be it.Raven software did this one very right.Reboot, please? Raven? Please?			"

												If any of you AAA whippersnappers have ever heard one of us old-schoolers groan about how FPS were way more fun in our day and wondered why we would say that, I urge you to give a game like Hexen a try. In this game, you won't have to spend 10 minutes going in and out of cover to shoot three enemies. Nor will you need to press 30 buttons just to be able to shoot and move at the same time. In this game, you go forward, kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ collect items and keys, and find the exit. Simple as. And did I mention you don't have to wait for a checkpoint, and you can just make your own by saving the game at any time from the in-game menu? Revolutionary!!!(Really...it's like games have DEvolved in this regard over the years!)Okay, so the graphics are bad by today's standards; for 1994, though, that WAS the standard, and Hexen pulls it off wonderfully. The sound, though, IS great even by modern standards, particularly the groaning and screeching of hidden enemies. The feeling of walking around a cleared room or courtyard HEARING these motherfreakers but not knowing when you're going to run across them provides significantly more tension than any Slender-style 'horror' game (really, if you've ever been in REAL woods at night, Slender shouldn't be the slightest bit scary to you.) And once you DO find them, they are some tough cookies, even at Level 2 difficulty (Level 2 or 3 is ideal for semi-experienced old-school FPS players wanting a challenging but not overtly stressful experience.)What's more, this is the Shadow of the Serpent Riders edition, which means technically you are getting five games in one, as it contains all the commercially released 'episodes' of Hexen. With eight or so levels to plow through in each episode, this one is sure to keep you playing for a while.In short, while it does feature outdated graphics and lack the rockin' soundtrack of the original PC Doom, Hexen does everything else extremely right. The setting is both ludicrous and original for the time, mixing two of geekdom's favourite genres (sci-fi and high fantasy), locations are remarkably detailed for 1994, there's plentiful items to collect and weapons to try out, the difficulty is balanced but not overtly easy, and sound design is great. It also expands on the traditional FPS formula of the day by adding light RPG elements, with collectible items that can help you at certain junctions. This does, however, bring up another minor flaw, as at no point in-game are you told what each item does - you'll have to resort to FAQ guides for that, unfortunately. Once you do figure out each item's use, however, they are actively helpful, sometimes rendering previously impossible levels or sections significantly more manageable, thereby actively influencing and enhancing the overall experience.In short - if you're a graphics snob, require all your titles to be AAA quality, or are only in it for the trading cards, Hexen will not be for you. Anyone simply wanting an enjoyable retro first-person-shooting experience, however, can't go wrong with this one - especially if you manage to get it for pennies, like I did!Final Rating: 8/10			"

												Mix a little bit of RPG with DOOM, stretch ID Tech 1 to achieve new technical standards, and create a world worth saving - what do you get? Raven Software's Heretic.Heretic is worth the measly 4.99 it will cost you. With six action packed episodes, you're sure to get your fill of guns, guts, and scares...Raven style.			"

												I played this game a bit as a kid (still have the floppy disks right next to me actually!) and it still has a lot going for it. Very creative weapons, each with a Powered Up mode that changes its functionality, as well as some creative uses of interactive environments (like flowing water that pushes you in a particular direction, ceiling crushers, and plenty of hidden secrets). What makes this game stand out from other 1990's FPS titles is the inclusion of an inventory, with loads of different items like Time Bombs, emergency health potions, and an egg that'll turn enemies (or you!) into chickens.I would, however, recommend playing this game in the free zDoom or gzDoom program, which will allow you not only to customize the controls, the UI, etc. but also run the game at higher resolutions. Simply make sure your HERETIC.WAD file (you get this when you purchase the game) is in the same folder as the zDoom executable, and you'll be good to go. The higher resolutions help sharpen in-game shadows and clarify other visuals.Pick this one up, it's a classic!			"
