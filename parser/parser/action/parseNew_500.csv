												When I first got my PC in 2008 *The day I started playing video games* Left 4 Dead was probably the third game I had in my library, I remember playing this game all the time with my brother and dad. We were obsessed with this game back then, it was the best experience for us.  I love the characters, guns, zombies oh yeah and especially the gore. Me, my dad and my brother loved to play zombie apocalypse games, this was probably our first favorite zombie game that we first started playing together as a team. I laughed when my dad thought the witch one of the special infected was like the most overpowered zombie in the game, when my dad was busy with work the day me and my brother started testing more maps out in the game we wanted to try see if the witch is invincible, turns out she died, its the day I first crowned her with an autoshotgun. Best time of life, me, my brother and my dad played this game for like 3 years none-stop. It was a very addictive game for us it was so fun for us. A few weeks after me, my brother and my dad got use to the game, I started doing research, found some cheat codes thats when I started cheating by testing out some cheat codes thats when I showed my brother and my dad about the cheat codes then we started using cheats after we finished every single map which was like throughout 2008. This game is very impressive, I miss the old times when I use to play with my brother and dad. 100/10 gg, sweetest memory I had in 2008 with my dad and brother. ♥			"

												This is my first game on Steam, which I've been playing the longest. Before I joined the steam community, I've been playing it for about half a year and then I decided to join multiplayer. I found many friends there and some of them are still around. Sadly, the game was killed by it's own developers. Porting all the campaigns and original Survivors into Left 4 Dead 2 was the last drop in the cup already full. 10/10. RIP			"

												One of my favourite games ever. You and three friends will battles against hordes of 'infected' or perhaps become the vanguard of those infected to wreak terror and death on survivors as the 'sepcial infected'. This game prioritizes team work over twitch skills and is a great game for people who like to play with a dedicated group of friends.I have not played for a few years and when I left the game was more geared for hard core players when compared to it's successor, Left 4 Dead 2. From a cursory look this still seems to be true. A great game, but for beginners I might actually suggest playing Left 4 Dead 2 first, and then perhaps trying the first game once you are a little more skilled. Getting quad capped by people will 5000 hours in game might not be your best first expereince of the game :)HOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account. I have over 400 hours played in Left4Dead 1 and 1500+ in Left4Dead  2 on my private account.			"

												Left 4 Dead 1 is a great game, but there's no reason to buy it since all the maps, weapons, characters are in L4D2 along with NEW content including the ability to mod using steamworkshop. That's right, you get all of L4D1 in L4D2, no DLC, no nonsense. I'm not sure what the downvotes in the community are for, the review system is in place asking if you ""Recommend someone to buy this game"" and no, I don't, I wouldn't point someone at L4D1 since...again the sequel contains this game and more. So go get that game instead.Edit: Since some people can't understand the review I wrote, I'll ellaborate,Left 4 Dead is a great game, it really is and I've had a lot of fun with it. The trouble is that this game, the entire game, all of it, is in the sequel L4D2 for free and it costs the same and comes with far more content including intergrated mod support. Look, I played the game for 60 bloody hours, I have a physical copy, I have both games- I'm not just saying 2 is better for subjective reasons it has the content of 1 and an entirely new game's worth of content. So no, I don't reccomend it when the sequel is the same cost and you get more including 1's content.			"

Left 4 Dead is a solid co-op first-person shooter that, while clearly showing its age, is worth the small price you can pick it up for on sale.Preface:I remember when I first started playing this game. I was scared of everything. I moved very slowly, cautiously, and ran from place to place, looking for the safest and shortest path to the next saferoom. When I finally finished a campaign and got to watch the ending cutscene roll, it felt like a real achievement.Then I tried joining my first multi-player campaign and discovered a whole new world. Having someone running along with me, giving me helpful advice, and us all generally looking after each other as a team was a great experience. This is a game where good team-based gameplay is rewarded, and where people who go rushing off alone commonly end up getting themselves killed. Left 4 Dead feels like it was built for cooperative gameplay, from the ground up. There's safety in numbers, and when you're the last one standing and trying to survive on your own, you'll really feel just how alone you are in a hostile world where pretty much everything is out to kill you.The game can be played in both single and multi-player. Up to four players control one each of four survivors as they all attempt to move from one safe area to the next. Any survivors not being controlled by a human player will be automatically taken over by the survivor bot AI. As they move through the levels in the campaigns, the survivors will encounter various enemies, including hordes of common zombies and some rarer 'special' infected. These special infected come with unique abilities that make good teamplay essential, as their attacks can disorient and even render lone survivors helpless.Level Design:Levels are premade and static, meaning they never change from game to game. After playing the same campaign enough times, you'll end up memorizing the most efficient routes through the levels. Item spawns are also preplaced, so if you find a bottle of pills behind a dumpster in a certain alleyway, then that's what you can expect to find in that location in all future games you play. There is some variation in the fact that items won't always spawn where they're available to be spawned, but that's it.At certain points throughout the game, you'll encounter various events that trigger attacks from hordes of zombies, or even spawn 'boss' infected, which helps break the monotony of simply going from point A to point B. Otherwise, the meat of the campaign mode consists of moving from one location to the next while shooting zombies and finding items. There are six campaigns; most of them have a total of five maps. In each campaign, there is constant visible evidence of the decay of society and the collapse of civilization through wrecked buildings, vehicles, piles of dead bodies, and more.Game Modes:Besides campaign, 'versus' and 'survival' game modes are also available. In versus mode, up to eight players can join a single game session. Versus mode is basically a campaign where there are two teams of human players - one team controls the survivors, and the other spawns as special infected. The survivor team must attempt to make it as far as they can before being killed, while the infected team attempts to stop them as quickly as possible. Once the survivors have been killed or make it to safety, the teams switch roles, and the map is played again. This rotation continues until the entire campaign has been completed, at which stage, points are tallied up to determine the winner.In survival mode, the survivors are trapped in certain areas found throughout the campaigns, and must hold out as long as possible against relentless waves of enemies that get more difficult as the game progresses. Gold, silver, and bronze 'medals' are awarded for lasting ten, seven, and four minutes respectively.Sound:Music in Left 4 Dead adds not only atmosphere, but is also dynamic in that it changes depending on the situation. Impending horde attacks are met with the sound of intense drumming, the presence of an attacking 'Tank' (boss infected) comes with its own 'epic' theme, unique 'terror' music plays while being strangled by a 'Smoker' special infected, and so on. Leaving the music in this game on can actually help the player maintain situational awareness.Survivors also call out and comment on things they see throughout the game, and the voice acting is generally good. Players can make the character they're controlling say certain things with the press of a button for quick communication in case they can't or don't want to type messages or use a microphone.AI:The survivor bot AI does an adequate job of keeping together and shooting enemies, but has a habit of running directly into the player's line of fire. I also noticed frequent pathfinding issues, causing bots to get stuck before 'warping' to the player's location. Sometimes, fellow survivor bots also take an inordinate amount of time to rescue other survivors from the clutches of special infected if there is even a minimal amount of zombies occupying their attention. Incapacitated survivor bots also have the uncanny ability to close doors, which is not something the player can do.The infected AI is very accurate and effective, and often 'cheats'. Hunters are able to claw survivors while in mid leap and even after getting shoved away, and Boomers instantly hit survivors once they get within range, before even completing their swiping animation, There is also some kind of oddity with hitboxes involving rocks thrown by Tanks, which allows Tanks to hit survivors round the corners of buildings.Pacing/Networking:Game sessions can be hosted on dedicated servers or locally via a player's computer. The game runs very well on a slow connection - on a connection that had a maximum transfer rate of 8.5kb/s, I've managed to maintain a ping between 50-70 on a dedicated server within the same country. Depending on how quickly players rush through a campaign, game sessions can last anywhere from 11 minutes on the shortest campaign, to up to roughly an hour for a standard one.The Good:+ Great multiplayer functionality (netcode, built-in voice comms)+ Quick drop-in, drop-out ability+ Maps have decent atmosphere and varied settings+ Great mod and add-on supportThe Bad:- 'Cheating' infected AI- Linear maps- Weapon variety is somewhat lacking- AI has slight pathfinding issues- Survivor bot AI can be annoyingly incompetentConclusion:Left 4 Dead is a game best played with good, human teammates. Survivor bots will suffice in the beginning, but as your skill increases, you'll quickly see just how deficient bots are. Linear maps limit replayability, but this may be offset by the fact that so much community-made content has been released and is readily available for download - www.gamemaps.com/l4dWhat's the point of getting this game when Left 4 Dead 2 has everything the original has, and more? The gameplay in the original Left 4 Dead feels different compared to the sequel. In Left 4 Dead 2, there is more of a focus on rushing through hordes while under continuous attack. In Left 4 Dead, the focus is more on waiting the horde out while staying in a defensible location. The maps that were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 from the original game have also been modified to reflect this.If you've got no one to play with and are just looking for a server to join, at this stage, you may have difficulty finding games online, depending on where you live. The game's lifespan can be significantly extended if custom add-ons come into play, and the game can also be tweaked using various command-line startup options. I found a lot of entertainment and cheap humour in watching the bots play campaign and survival by themselves while I spectated.			"

												Left 4 Dead is a first-person shooter game, an apocalypse survival game from Valve. The game is a zombie apocalypse game where you play as one of four survivors trying to get themselves to safety. These survivors are Bill, Zoey, Francis and Louis. They're trying to get themselves to safety as their story began two weeks after the infection. They themselves are immune to this virus while thousands of people already become hungry undead.The gameplay is almost similar to any Valve game, you can play up to 4 players with friends or people from the internet and play together. The zombies in this game are also unique, you won't just meet regular zombies, there are special infected that has many special abilities which can get you some troubles. Hunters for example, likes to leap and then pinned the survivors by surprise. The most fearsome infected could be the tank or the witch, they are the worst. Witch can take you down with only single attack despite her pity appearance. Weapons are quite good here, there are pump-action shotgun, dual pistols, submachine gun, assault rifle or hunting rifle. If you're overwhelmed, simply toss a pipe bomb and that thing will attract zombies from you and then blow them up.Graphics of Left 4 Dead is quite decent and impressive. The Source Engine has again prove its worthiness. Explosion effects, gore and blood effects, the sounds and the environment are all impressive, including the amazing ragdoll effects which makes the environment more chaotic. And still, the game runs pretty stable and smooth.Overall, Left 4 Dead is a good game to play with friends. I recommend this.+ Cooperative play.+ Good choice of weapons.+ Good graphics, engine and physics.+ Many variety of zombies.- AI team still not very improved.- Harder difficulty is too hard.Rating 8/10			"

IntroLeft 4 Dead, a series I simply cannot get enough of.Played this game to Death on the Xbox 360 before I made the switch to PC and added an additional 880 hours into the game.This review is extremely late, but I felt like it's the least I could do for one of the games I've enjoyed most.Please keep in mind that this review is based off the memories I have of this game and how it was when the game was still alive, there will be an additional botch of text at the bottom regarding the current status of the game.The GameDeveloped by Turtle Rock Studios and Valve itself, Left 4 Dead 1 was one of the first shooters to combine Cooperative gameplay with Survival First Person Shooter gameplay. No longer could you ""win"" the game by only caring about yourself. You need your teammates and your teammates need you.Pros● Unique Cooperative Gameplay in every Gamemode! (Campaign, Versus, Survival)● The Lobby/Drop-in system works flawlessy allowing players to effortlessly finding a game.● Free DLC.● Make your own Maps!● Low PC Specs required.● Get to play as Special Infected! (Yeah.. those Zombies..!) in Versus mode.● Scoring System in Versus allows for both Teams to make an insane comeback!● Very Easy to setup your own Dedicated Server.Cons● Players have to download Maps manually, they are unable to download from the Server they are joining.● No Workshop.● The Game is unpolished in regards to exploits and bugs, Valve has never responded to countless reports and complaints.● No Matchmaking, you're very likely to end up with very unbalanced teams when joining Versus games.● Ragequitting is not punished at all.The CommunityThe Community for Left 4 Dead is very comparable to Left 4 Dead 2, in Public Games you can expect to be insulted and possibly even votekicked if you're underperforming in the eyes of your teammates.There however used to be a Competitive Scene, this scene was much better in terms of actually being able to finish your games as well as making buddies. Unfortunately, it has died a long time ago.Current Status of the GameAs of this post, Left 4 Dead has an 30-Day Average of 385 Players Worldwide.You are very unlikely to find Games going on, and if you do happen to find some, they're likely going to be unenjoyable.The only way you're going to really enjoy this game, is if you find a couple of likeminded buddies and get Campaign + Survival going. Pushing your way through Expert mode will always remain fun. :)If you're feeling lucky and you're not prone to ragequitting or shouting accusations (Trust me, nobody cheats in Left 4 Dead anymore) you can give Versus a go. 4 Players is already half of what you need!Final WordsLeft 4 Dead currently costs $20, just like Left 4 Dead 2. They however have a much different feel to the game and I'd still buy both versions.I recommend adding it to your wishlist until it gets on Sale though. ;)			"

												Left 4 Dead is a CO-OP first person shooter game. The game uses Valve's well known Source engine, released in 2008.  The game is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, you take control of one of four protagonists, which will be known as the ""Survivors"". They will be pitted against hordes of infected zombies in four different game modes, a single player mode which the three other characters are controlled by the AI. A co-op campaign mode,  an online versus mode and a four player survival mode. the game play focuses mainly on cooperation and working as a team. You will see all the regular features included in other FPS games, such as outlined teammates throughout the world, so you know where they are all the time. A cool feature which I found to be a nice surprise was if a member of your team were to fall off a ledge, they won't automatically plunge to their death, they will manage to hold onto the ledge and the other team members may go and ""Help them up"" much like you would do if you were healing them. The campaign mode has six levels, each containing anywhere between three and five individual chapters in them. Each of the chapters takes place in a set environment which allows the player to explore around to find little Easter eggs, pick ups - such as medi-packs, pain pills,  weapons and ammo. These points are supposedly randomly generated so each time you play, they will be scattered around in different spots. There are tons of rooms, tunnels and buildings to explore on every level, and there is no time limit either so you can roam around to your hearts content, provided you don't mind the odd zombie jumping out of the closet to try and eat your brains every now and again. Each of the Survivors are individually voice acted very well; and you can communicate with your team using quick menus. Some voice commands will sound off automatically such as when you are reloading, you'll let the rest of your team know so they can cover you. This to me was a small addition but added to the realism of the game. Throughout the game you will encounter a number of different zombies which have their own special attack or mutation, such as The Boomer, which is a bloated zombie that will spit bile onto the Survivors which attracts other zombies to your location. This again adds a lot of variety to the game so you don't feel as if you are just mowing through hoards of regular zombies all the time. The graphics, while are running on an engine which is a number of years old now, still look awesome, and games today sometimes struggle to present them selves as well as Left 4 Dead. Even with settings right the way down on low, it still looks impressive - meaning any rig or potato will be able to run this. I played the single player campaign on normal mode; while I had no real issues finishing the game, apart from the last level, I still was satisfied with the level of challenge which was on offer, I can imagine the hard and advanced levels will be completely mind fumblingly hard though. I tried to play the campaign mode online, but sadly there weren't many games available at the time, but it is something I really want to try just to experience the co-op side of things on this game. Pretty much every one owns Left 4 Dead already, and most will have probably already played it; but I really suggest people that haven't played it or at least purchased it but not tried it to play. You will not be disappointed and this is one of the classics of our generation that you need to experience. P.S - if anyone would like to have a play through the campaign with me, please add me or hit me up as I would welcome any opportunity to give it ago! If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												Finally time to write a more complete review (I will be editing this a few times) of l4d.I got l4d in a no-steam version years ago, played on a 4 player italian server and loved the game directly, after a while i spend lots of time on an modded 8 player called |ELITE| this was back in the days version 1.0.1.4. when this server went down I started my own server and modding them.nowadays -=HERO=-[www.l4d-hero.nl] (the community that got started) has 7 servers including 1x l4d2.While l4d1 and 2 can be modded, yet I am talking about a vanilla game at this point. Why do i like/love this game is that the details, the gameplay (smoothness, way things move, design, charathers) are just very good.. you see they spend time in it to make it a good game, not what valve did with CC and Sacrifice, that was just lazyness.Yet people will tell you that l4d2 has the same maps as l4d1, in a way they do, yet they are not the same, they used a few versus maps instead of the original ones to make it different, yet not in a good way.In a while you will be able to download the l4d2 maps in l4d1 which makes it just an even better game that it is so you do not need to buy l4d2 ;)The game gets more interesting when modding begins, while l4d2 has more options and run on a better engine then l4d1 iin my eye's it doesn't make it a better game.. Modding l4d1 bring lots of fun while it is easy and not to complicated, to make the game even more interesting.A friend discovered that there are hidden upgrades in l4d1 that only can be achieved through plugin(s) Survivor UpgradesAll in all, I say get l4d1 over l4d2, when it is in a discount buy both and try it out.

												This game is balanced so that teams pretty much *have to* work together to survive. Players who run ahead are typically targeted by the game, and the game is harder with few players (so it's important that you *AND* your teammates survive!). Therefore this game--in my many years of experience with it AND in comparison to my many years of Counter Strike experience--tends to have a friendlier and more team-oriented group of players to interact with. I appreciate the game dynamics in L4D very, very much.			"

												Left 4 Dead is evil. It's gaming experience is dark, viserally frightening and frequently so intense that it will have you looking over your shoulder just to confirm there isn't a zombie behind you.That is why it is so incredibly awesome!So, without any further delay here are my top 10 reasons for why you should definitely buy Left 4 Dead:1. The survivor characters are well thought out and very relatable.2. The game has excellent replayability, even in campaign mode.3. The achievements are carefully crafted, challenging and completely addictive.4. It does what a zombie game should do: scare the crap out of you.5. Multi-player is encouraged, rewarding but not always necessary.6. The varying difficulty levels actually make a difference (just look at my hours on expert)7. You can play as special infected in multiplayer mode!8. The level and campaign design is amazing.9. It's one of the best zombie FPS games ever.10. It's just so much bloody fun!My only criticism is that sometimes the available weaponry options feel restricted and limited, but that just adds to the challenge.You don't just play Left 4 Dead, you experience Left 4 Dead.So experience it today!

												I am happy to recommend this game, though I have to admit it's best to purchase the sequel instead. Why? Because currently it is priced around the same level and the sequel has all the campaigns from the previous game included! This means more than a dozen levels with continuous zombie shooting!In any case, this, just like its sequel, is an excellent game. Although it was released more than 5 years ago I believe it aged well - the game still looks good thanks to the well-developed Source Engine. Years later Valve released many updated including DLCs that expand upon the campaigns - the latest, The Sacrifice, came out in 2010.Left 4 Dead is a great game! It is a coop-based, action-oriented survival horror game. It is pure fun to get rid of the continuous hordes of zombies with friends game after game! A highly recommended game and not just for the fans of the genre! "

												A strange infection suddenly started at Pennsylvania which was causing mutation to the body cells and loss of higher brain functions. After two weeks of this green flue caused by the highly contagious pathogen four immune survivors Bill a Vietnam veteran, Zoey a college student, Louis an IT analyst and Francis an outlaw biker were making their way through the city of Fairfield. After avoiding all the infected finally survivors were rescued from the Mercy Hospital roof but unfortunately they found the pilot is an infected too. Zoey killed him and the chopper crashed in an industrial district outside the city. Fortunately they found a vehicle full of weapons and so they went to the riverside. While their way after crossing road blocks they arrived to the local church. When they encountered some lunatic infected in the church they realized that the city is overrun. Then they decided to rush to the nearby boathouse for rescue. From there they reached the city of Newburg on the other side of the river but they got that most part of the city is in flames. So, the large nearby greenhouse was their shelter. But then when a military C-130 Hercules passed overhead they tried to follow it by travelling through the city’s business district towards the Metro International Airport. After arrival they found that the military had bombed the airport while infected pilots crashed planes in an attempt to land. Finally they managed to escape by the C-130.But it crashed again and survivors found themselves on the outskirts of Allegheny National Forest. From there they made their way to a functioning yet abandoned military outpost. From there they were rescued to Northeast Safe Zone Echo which is supposed to be the only uninfected area not yet overrun. Although they were immune but yet they are carriers of the infection, so they were temporarily hold by the military. But the four escaped via train and travelled south by Bill’s insistence. Bill had belief that they can get long term safety at islands of Florida Keys. They found a boat by raising an old rusty bridge powered by a very old generator at portside town Rayford. The machinery noise of the process alerted a horde of all types of infected. But then the generator gave out. Bill sacrificed himself to restart it so that the other three can reach at safety.If you like up to this then surely you are going to like the game. If you have already played it then may be your liking may increase. Moreover you may feel oneness with the characters by role playing! :)			"

												Left 4 Dead (L4D) is a co-op zombie apocalypse first-person shooter that uses VALVe's famous, but dated, Source engine. Well developed, straight-forward gameplay, L4D features everything that you would expect from a zombie shooter. The game is focused on its multiplayer aspect, but also includes single player campaign. L4D does have some shortcomings such as a limited selection of weapons and predictable enemy spawning. Still, L4D has become a sensation and a standard for zombie-styled co-op.			"

 My Review : Rate  : 11/10, would hug Tank and date witch!  Game Information :Genre : Action, Survival Horror, FPS, Multiplayer, Co-opEngine : Source Developer : Valve Platforms : Windows, MacRelease Date : 17 Nov, 2008Number of active players : 300-1000Left 4 Dead or what we fans call 'L4D' is an action based horror FPS game developed by Valve in 2008. ""Green Flu"" a highly contagious virus causes extreme aggression, mutation to the body cells and loss of higher brain functions. Two weeks after the infection four immune survivors : Bill, a Vietnam veteran, Zoey, a college student; Louis, an IT analyst and Francis, an outlaw biker make their way through the city fighting infected, dangerous mutations. There are 2 types of infected, special infected like hunters, boomers, smokers and tanks and other type is common infected that aren't playable. There is one more special infected called 'witch', you can't choose her in Versus Mode. There are originally 20 maps and 10 weapons. Not all L4D1 achievements and maps are ported to L4D2. And not all of us play L4D2 as much as L4D1. So I recommend buying L4D Bundle, it better for you to decide which one is your type.So there are 4 ways of playing this game : ● Single/Offline Mode : You and three AI bots play through campaigns battling against hordes of common infected & 5 special infected through many chapters divided into smaller maps. ● Multi/Co-op Mode : You and your 3 friends/online players play through campaigns battling against hordes of common infected & 5 special infected through many chapters divided into smaller maps. For the newbies, don't directly jump to expert servers as people there wouldn't care much to teach you what's right/wrong and will simply vote kick you. I'll cover this part at the end.● Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, either playing as a human trying to get rescued or as 4 playable special infected.● Survival Mode : You survive in a closed area and hold out against the infected horde and special infected as long as possible and compare your stats with your friends. There are 3 medals : Gold, Silver and Bronze based on your survival time. This game requires you to work with your teammates and help them and get help in return. When you get pounced on by a hunter or get dragged by smoker or generally incapped by an infected, only your friends can revive you so make sure you treat them nicely. Only thing I see people complaining here is that they get vote kicked for not doing anything. Here is a list of things you should consider and follow to not get kicked by others. ● If you see an incapped survivor, based on situation if its possible and easy to revive them then help them, don't simply leave them there. I know its called Left 4 Dead :D ● Make sure you don't hurt your teammates. In case you hurt them, heal them with your kits or give them your pills [Pills Here!] Least you can do is apologize before they call a vote.   ● Don't start the events. Events are those situations where you press a button or open the door and hordes rushes at you. Just wait for all players to arrive at that spot and make sure all are ready. If you really want to press those buttons then ask if they are ready and then start it.● In the Versus Mode, it is important to work as a team. Since it is 4v4 (or same level), all the players have to incap all the survivors at the same time. One survivor is enough to ruin others attempt. you will likely get kicked if you stay apart or just roam around as an infected.   ● Don't change your team in Versus Mode, not just kicked, admin might ban you too. (Personal Experience :P) Even after following all the rules and you might still get kicked. Don't get disappointed if someone kicks you, even players with 1k hours still get kicked. Sometimes, people just kick you to help their friend get a slot or if you have very high ping.  If you like my review, please upvote it so more people can read it. Groovy!If you are interested, you can read the Left 4 Dead Comics over at http://www.l4d.com/comic/ Final Review : This game is worth playing.			"

												There are such games which don't differ an interesting plot or a gameplay, but remain in the hearts of players on long and for many years. One of the brightest representatives of such peculiar exception to the rules - Left 4 Dead shooter from the Valve company. All game consists of four (a standard set) big missions which are subdivided into five collateral. Everyone begins and comes to an end in special shelter where players can take breath. Any the check points on a course of passing of collateral missions - lost - be so kind as since the beginning. It adds also a headache and the aggressive drive, especially when you play on the maximum complexity, and opponents, well very strong and cunning. In such rooms always there is an opportunity to dolly up wounds, to take the new weapon, to fill up quantity of cartridges or to take a bomb with Molotov's cocktail. Here such here game)) (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

Left 4 DeadOriginally released on the 17th of november, 2008, is Valve's first co-op zombie game. Originally developed by Turtle Rock Studios.Now you may ask, ""Why would I want to buy this game when it's ported in Left 4 Dead 2?"". Well little Timmy, the reason is that Valve butchered it in Left 4  Dead 2. A lot of the levels are a lot easier due to more weapons, or harder due to more special infected. Certain character lines and events are missing, common infected look out of place, and so on. Honestly, I prefer only having 5 special infected. (Smoker, Hunter, Tank, Witch, Boomer.) The Spitter, Jockey, and Charger just seem so out of place in Left 4 Dead 2's Left 4 Dead campaigns. Anyway, to close things off, I do recommend this game. The community that still plays this game is quite small, but I still manage to find a game when I do play.10/10. Buy L4D2 if you want more players, buy L4D if you want better gameplay (In my opinion) "

Posted: December 15, 2016
The Game As An IndividualDespite the likelihood of this game lookng simplistic to people who have yet to play Left 4 Dead the game is much more than that. Valve took the simple premise of a zombie apocalypse first-person shooter and added mechanics to make it more unique and interesting so it isn't a game where you just mow down endless hordes of zombies with nothing else to it (although you will be doing a lot of mowing down zombies). First off it's multiplayer but instead of going against other players and comparing skills (although there is a versus mode) it requires teamwork. As in teamwork is not helpful in this game but rather it is absolutely vital to be able to survive with teamwork in this game. Special infected which are zombies with ""special powers"" will invetiably constrict or pounce teammates or yourself and the only way to break free of the grasp of special infected is to have a teammate help you out. (So basically without at least 1 teammate you're completely f*cked) There are many other things to take into account while playing the game such as how much damage or how effective a certain gun will be in different maps and against different enemies, situations where it's appropriate to use pistols (unlimited ammunition) or primary weapons (limited ammunition), when to use pills (quick boost of health but health is only temporary) or a med kit (slower boost of health and health is permanent, so it will be a requirement for a teammate to cover their teammate while he or she is healing). There are three modes to play through on this game which are campaign, survival and versus. Campaign is pretty straightforward: you progress through maps, kill zombies and special infected until you get rescued by a rescue vehicle near the end and there are four difficulties on this mode to suit to your skill level. There's versus mode which is essentially the campaign but this time players get to take control of the survivors and the special infected so the special infected team's job is to make it difficult as possible for survivors to survive and the survivors job is to try and get through and beat the level. Survival is the last mode and in my personal opinion the most fun especially if you have skillful players on your side. It requires the most strategy and teams need to formulate shooting positions for all teammates based on how much room they have to kill the infected and how far away ammo and resource runs are. Certain players are still attempting to break records on this map. Which leads me to the biggest con of the game which isn't really the fault of the game itself but the community and not the fault of the community itself but rather the lack of community. While there still are active communities who still play the original Left 4 Dead they are in the rarity. Finding partners to play with particuarly as a newcomer is difficult and annoying. Relying on searching for online lobbies is near useless now since you probably will never find a group of people on and when you do they're already full. If you are an active player yourself you could post a comment saying ""feel free to add me"" to make it easier for people wanting to play with others. Comparison To Left 4 Dead 2The most prominent reasoning for this game receiving a ""not recommended"" review is usually because Left 4 Dead 2 has all the campaign and versus mode maps from here ported over with the addition of new maps exclusive to the sequel and it has increased choice for weaponary including melee weapons and more special infected. However in my personal opinion I prefer the original to the sequel, not to say the sequel isn't any good in fact it's definitely worth getting. The thing about this game is it has a different ""feel"" to it in terms of gameplay which I can't particuarly describe, this version just feels better. It's almost like Left 4 Dead was different in its approach to how it would be played while the sequel has adapted to the feel of modern shooters. Another plus is this game has better survival maps and the workload of zombies is much more bearable and reasonable instead of having a ton of special infected and tanks up your bum within the first minute of playing so this way you can go for much longer without constantly failing. But even if you like Left 4 Dead 2 better you have to admit the community is much less toxic than in the original and this is a huge positive on Left 4 Dead 1's behalf because seeing as it is a co-op game the community is an extremely important part of how enjoyable the game is going to be. Being a beginner or rather anything under being an expert player will have you kicked in Left 4 Dead 2 but the Left 4 Dead 1 community is much more supportive and friendly and will more than likely try to help you out and play with you regardless of skill level. As for the characters they're more likable in this game in my opinion but I suppose that isn't really a valid reason since you can play as them on the maps in the original. All in all I can't say for certain that I recommend this game to ""you"" because it depends who you are. If you absolutely loved Left 4 Dead 2 I recommend buying this game or if you want to pursue bigger feats like in survival and are considering becoming an expert player I recommend buying this game but if you're just looking for a game to play casually with friends then I would recommend the sequel over this. PS if you're an achievement hunter like me it gives you more incentive to perform certain challenges and makes playing the game feel more worthwile and rewarding. It's definitely a great game to complete, it's challenging but it isn't unbearably difficult. "

												The zombie apocalypse is here and that's the entire story you need to know in this cooperative first-person shooter and all the story you're ever told. You play as 1 of 4 survivors (Zoey the college student, Bill the war veteran, Francis the biker, Louis the IT guy). The character doesn't seem to matter, it's just a different voice and skin. They will talk to alert you of things like health, weapons, reloading and where you should go next. Left 4 Dead is geared toward online multiplayer, but you can play solo through the game where your computer partners are competent enough, but need to be guided by you. Instead of online multiplayer where the other players seem to just run right through each level.The controls are simple, point and click to shoot like any first person shooter, right mouse button is for melee for when foes swarm around you and they will. You have a long range weapon (shotguns, oozies, assault rifles and so on), a pistol (or 2) with limitless ammo, a medipack to restore your health or someone else's, pain pills that will temporarily give you a health boost and finally an explosive thrown weapon like a flaming cocktail or pipe bomb. You can jump or crouch for better weapon accuracy and that's it. The combat feels very limited because of this.The big drawing point to the game is some sort of smart engine called the director that will generate random zombies to come at you, so no play through is the same twice. Such as a zombie that was at point A of your first play through might be a wall of zombies or no zombies, or a female zombie in your next play through. These zombies will race toward you after a few moments of shuffling their feet that might result in your terror, but an entire game of zombies running to you gets old very quickly. Zombies can climb up areas, go under truck trailers and the animations are good in general. Weapons and ammo scattered outside of safe rooms will not be in the same place twice.The game is broken into campaigns and levels that you can access any one at any time. The campaigns are brief and really take you out of the action when you need to load a new campaign after completing one. The levels have good atmosphere, dark, spooky, but it gets old very quickly. Most every level feels the same with generic buildings, generic exteriors, generic trucks.Between the levels are safe rooms. Leave a safe room and make it to the next safe room to cap off the level. Then at the end of the level, you see your score and how you did against the other players. Who killed the most zombies, who took the most damage. Stuff like that.To be honest it's not that good. It feels very one dimensional. Within the first few levels, you've seen all the game has to offer. You will quickly see all of its small variety of enemies zombies run straight at you, witches that stay huddled until you put a light on them, stalkers pounce on you until you are saved, smokers use a tongue to strangle you until you are saved and explode smoke, exploders that vomit on you and tanks that can throw you and take a giant amount of punishment. You will really need to rely on others for survival. The computer players will be very willing to help you, but the players in multiplayer may not be as willing or can't when you've been left behind or gone ahead.That's it. The game isn't very long and for a game that touts its random enemy generator, it doesn't make me want to replay the game again and again. Combat is simple, enemy variety is lacking, but the game plays very smooth. Essentially left for dead is about mowing down tons of zombies and if that's your thing, this is the game for you. If you need puzzles in your FPS or weapon depth, it's not for you.			"

												This is such a nice co-op game. Most of the people on Steam have Left 4 Dead 2 due to the free giveaway, but I can say I am lucky to have this and L4D2. This game, while not being highly modable like L4D2, still has the gameplay we have come to accept and love. We all love this game. People who play this game are usually older players, people who had this before L4D2 came out. This game takes Left 4 Dead to its roots, where it was more about the gameplay and teamwork. This game also comes with the Sacrifice, which is a really nice plus. You should all play this game. Add me if you want to learn this game better.			"

												Same idea as L4D2 ofc, but the fact that some things are missing can change the deal.  -  No melee weapon, which means that hordes are MUCH more effective agaisn't survivors, and that the boomer gets even more useful  -  The best weapons are the hunting sniper, the M16, and an automatic shotgun, which make it harder for the survivors.  -  There is no 1. Spitter (makes it a good thing to hide in small rooms for survivors in all the cases) 2. Charger (much less insta kills possible) 3. Jockey (♥♥♥♥ yeah I hate them)  -  Knowing the last 3 infected, being alone as survivor is even more dangerous (hunter is probably the best one to get alone survs, and with the smoker its really easy and it can make quite much damages too. Unlike the jockey who makes less damages, or the charger with whom its much harder to get one single person)  -  Some items are missing such as adrenaline, defibs, laser sights or fire ammo.So in the end L4D1 lowers the tactic possiblities as infected (pretty much always the same idea with these 3 ones) but also makes it more complicated for survivors on many levels, which is a good thing knowing how they're OVER ♥♥♥♥ING POWERED in L4D2. Many peaple hate L4D2 and just like L4D1, that's understandable, the first one is fairer in the realtion survivors / infected, but the second one has much more fun items, and much better maps too as for me.

My personal favorite game of all time. It's absolutely fun when you play it with friends. Even if you don't have friends to play with, it's very easy to make a friend on Left 4 Dead by just being nice/using teamwork. That's all. Teamwork is key. Even when you join a random game on your own, people will still use teamwork. Just don't rush; you WILL die. A Smoker will lick your *ss. You have to co-operate with your team! That's what I like so much about this game.The AI Director will try to punish you for going solo by having the (special) infected target you.Left 4 Dead is a very dynamic game as well. It never gets repetitive because of the AI Director spawning guns, items, ammo and (special) infected on different places, depending on the situation. The characters are perfect and the way they interact with eachother is a really fun and nice touch. I like them all, but my favorite is Louis. Because PEELZ.The game only has a few guns (6, with pistol included), but the gunplay feels silky smooth. Especially because of the satisfying gore L4D has. Spraying with an autoshotgun through a horde of infected feels niiice.I don't know about you, but animations are a very important part in a game for me.Third person animations in L4D1 are smooth unlike in L4D2 whereas it is choppy. You may think that this is just a miniscule thing but you will definitely notice this if you've played both L4D1 & 2 for a while.I personally think that the Jockey in L4D2 is an absolute b*llsh*t of an infected. He has the most jacked up hitbox ever. The hitbox is WAY infront of him than his actual model. L4D1 doesn't have the Jockey so that's another reason of buying L4D1 over 2. (lol)People tend to think that there are no differences between Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.A lot of them also say that L4D1 is not worth buying anymore only because L4D2 has L4D1's campaigns. And yes, this is true, but Valve has changed the layout of the original campaigns in L4D2. Certain buildings are gone/changed, certain pathways are gone/changed, certain holdout spots are gone/changed, etc. Also, L4D1 has this gritty and dark atmosphere and really embraces the feeling of being set in a apocalypse with the help of dark maps, whereas L4D2's atmosphere is brighter and less serious. Valve went with a more comedic style in L4D2. This is mostly noticeable if you listen to the quotes that the characters say in-game.All in all, Left 4 Dead is an amazing co-op first person shooter that's fun, easy to get into, and takes a while to master. I've been playing this game since 2009 and I'm still playing almost daily. L4D2 is amazing as well, don't get me wrong. I just think that L4D2 is inferior to L4D1 and that people should give L4D1 a chance. Even though L4D1 has the same price tag as L4D2, it's so much worth it. Definitely recommended to play with friends.Left 4 Dead - 10/10Left 4 Dead 2 - 8.5/10 (Mods are fun though)- Calamity "

												Left 4 Dead is a co-op, first-person shooter video game, with survival horror elements thrown into the mix. Just like Castle Crashers, this game is for that special friendship group, composed of four friends. With this game, you will find a bounty of endless fun, especially when setting the game's difficulty to an all-time high, as it really gives you that experience of being an endangered species, with the more stronger zombies wanting you dead, thus extinct. From my point of view, you can already tell I hold this game in high regard. Probably due to the fact it is developed by Valve.The story takes place in an unamed location, within Pennsylvania. A highly contagious virus known as th ''Green Flu'' swarms the state, causing heavy mutation to human body cells and brain functions, resulting in the loss of humanity, meaning yes, the birth of zombies. Two weeks after the infectious outbreak, four survivors, William ''Bill'' Overbeck, a bold, Vietnam veteran; Zoey, a sassy college student; Louis, an optimistic IT technician, and Francis, an aggressive outlaw biker, the four heroes of this game make their way through perilous cities, discovering along the way that the virus is causing more dangerous mutations. On a side note, the story of this game is split into campaigns, going in chronological order from top to bottom and progressively, the story is carried out on to the games sequel.The player takes control of one of the four survivors; only if human players are not involved, thus the survivors are controlled by the CPU. The main objection of the game is to reach the safehouse after each level of the campaign. Beware to watch out for the special infected. These types of zombies are the strongest of the common infected and if you get incapitated by one, you won't be able to shake them off, but unless one of your fellow survivors lends a helping hand and kills the attacking zombie. So, this just goes to show that teamwork in this game is the key of getting farther and staying progressively stable to continue playing.Guns and other types of defense and weaponry, (in the shapes of molotovs and first-aid kits) are scattered among the map, usually on different occasions. This mainly happens after holding off an entire zombie horde, where they break through from left, right and centre. All of these weapons that you find are frequently random, but you can stick to the weapon you like the most. Just make sure to search for ammo at a seldom pace, especially if you're playing on a much higher difficulty. When outnumbered, just remember to always keep your health up, along with your teammates, as every chip of HP is precious into reaching the end of your goals.This game is simply fantastic, but is usually overshadowed by its sequel, Left 4 Dead 2; possibly due to the inclusion of all campaigns found in this one and carried out in its said sequel. The one thing I personally prefer from this game is the feel of the slightly tighter controls it has when compared to Left 4 Dead 2. I would say this one is for the competitive players and the sequel is for the casual players. Considering you could just mess around, with the Shrek mod and all, and don't tell me you bloody haven't. It's a lot of fun and of course, the modding community adds to Left 4 Dead 2's advantage, much to this games' disadvantage.In closing, I definitely recommend this game to all who are fans of survival horror video games and those itching to test their own determination and teamwork with one another. If you have have the sequel, I would still recommend getting this first game, just for its originality and or the fact you can add it to your godly Valve collection.			"

												This is one of the best zombie games that I have ever played and it will always be the game I go to if I want to kill some zombies. Sure the AI is stupid but that just adds to the fun of Expert mode, especially when playing with friends to try to get to that last campaign done on Expert or get that one annoying achievement that has annoyed you for ages.Long story short it is one of the funnest games I've played and I will always come back to play it. I'd suggest getting this along with L4D2 on a sale if possible, best of both worlds then.			"

												Left 4 Dead is simply a classic for me. Compared to the sequel Left 4 Dead 2 it offers less content and less possibilities like gamemodes but the feeling you get when playing Left 4 Dead 1 is still completly different and Left 4 Dead 2 is not able to give that certain feeling that you get when playing Left 4 Dead 1. If you´re thinking of buying Left 4 Dead 2 and you´re looking at this now I would say Left 4 Dead 2 is the better game and gives you more content. But I can surely tell you Left 4 Dead 1 is worth a shot especially if you can get a few friends to play it with you. If it´s on sale and you have a few bucks left this is definitly an option even if you already have Left 4 Dead 2. The feeling when playing this classic can never be reproduced by Left 4 Dead 2 even that it is the better game in general and also offers all Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns to be played there as well.Also a personal plus for me is it was my first actual game on steam (not the reason I signed up on steam though) 20 Euros however seems way too expensive for a game that is very good but as well 8 years old already. 5-10 Euros sounds more reasonable to me. Try to grab it on sale.			"

												Very good game, I personally prefer it to Left 4 Dead 2 because I feel like the gameplay is more refined. It's also probably the oldest game I still play regularly (I got it on steam recently, most of my time was on xbox)Pros:Better bot AI (may be wrong about this but it feels like it does)More punishing than 2 (harder)can't be pushed off roof easily in no mercy finale (bigger issue than it seems)The small community that's left isn't half as cancerous as 2Very fun with friendsNot many hackersNo endless hordesMod supportRuns great on my potato PC, better than 2 does. If it can run on mine it can no doubt run on yours. My specs are shamefulBetter atmosphere than 2Can see your legsInfinite shoveCons:Small playerbaseMods need to be downloaded manually (this isn't an issue to me personally but it may be an issue for someone)Final score: 9/10The core game is one of the most enjoyable things i've ever played but the only thing stopping it from being a 10 is the tiny playerbaseAll in all I'd say that this game is very good and I prefer it to l4d2 , however they ported the content from this game into that game but it doesn't feel the same. I recommend buying the bundle if you want to play the games, as it's the best deal. Or play this before you buy l4d2, on sale it's usually $5.			"

												If you're anything like me (and judging by the sales of books like World War Z and The Zombie Survival Guide, you are), you spend a good portion of each and every day wondering what a zombie outbreak might be like, and most importantly, how to survive it. Now that L4D has hit shelves, we no longer need to wonder.As it stands, L4D has few real faults, if any. Its gameplay is typical Valve, which is to say it's been polished to a glimmering sheen. No other game before this one has captured the teamplay aspect quite like L4D, resulting in an absolutely thrilling and utterly fun experience, whether you're playing with friends or strangers. It's easy to get into and gets more rewarding the deeper you go. And while L4D certainly isn't a long game any way you look at it, it has replay value far surpassing that of any game I have ever seen, Valve has another winner on its hands with Left 4 Dea			"

												I don't care who you are, how old you are, where you come from or what your gaming experience is. You need to play this game.In my opinion, this game completely reinvented (maybe even pioneered) cooperative multiplayer. You can expect hundreds of hours of fun with friends.This game isn't only about how good your aim is, how fast you are, or how well you know the level. It's mostly about how well you know your friends, tough decision making skills, and whether you can stick together and work together as a group.There's a random generator concept included in level design, meaning enemies don't spawn in the same places when you play a level. This keeps the game interesting as you're never sure what the expect. Level design is excellent, the characters are great and lovable. The story is simple but enough to get you hooked.If I have to find something negative about the game, I would say that it lacks a good soundtrack.			"

If you want the real  experience, please do buy this game, there are  different types of game modes such as Campaign, Versus and Survival. It's an awesome team game which never gets boring and it is always a different experience every time you play it.So if you're a fan of zombie apocalypse games, then this game is for you.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED			"

												NOTE: Review based solely on campaign mode 4-player co-op. You can play with 1-4 real players, with the rest of the slots being filled up with adequate AI.TL:DR; If you can find some decent people to play with co-op, the other elements of the game won’t matter.L4D is a first person co-op shooter published by Valve. The cooperative nature of the game makes it somewhat tricky to review as one needs to differentiate between the game itself and the people you’re cooperating with. A good game played with poor players tends to sour the game while a poor game with good players tends to elevate it.The game was built on the source engine; the same engine Half-Life 2 uses. There were times playing L4D that it felt like you could have been playing Half-Life and I found that a little distracting.The graphics themselves were on par with Half-Life 2; they weren’t pushing any boundaries but nor were they terrible. If anything, the graphics felt a little dated, but were smooth and allowed for relatively quick load times. It’s a trade-off.You’re given a limited array of items / weapons to use in the game. It basically boils down to which playstyle you prefer: Long range sniper, mid-range assault rifle/submachine gun or close up shotgun.  All these weapons use up a limited ammo supply with the option of pistols with unlimited ammo also exists (still needing to reload however).  Also available are support items such as Molotov cocktails, zombie luring pipe bombs, medkits and pain-suppressing pills. Some additional variety in items wouldn’t have hurt, but it doesn’t detract from your experience.  (This is addressed in L4D2)On the topic of limited array of things; the enemy types also suffer somewhat from this. At the end of the day however, you’re fighting zombies, so what do you expect? They’re a relatively slow-moving, minor inconvenience, offering limited threat…until they swarm. A music cue heralds the arrival of a swarm, often followed by an amount of swearing by the players, as players steel themselves against a brief onslaught of fast moving, swarming zombies. This threat can be a little more troublesome. Audio cues precede another kind of enemy; a special infected. These inflected also cause players to pay attention and cry an alert as they often throw a spanner in the works of an otherwise simple turkey shoot. Some of them can be easily dealt with or in one case avoided entirely while others can pose a significant threat, an equivalent to a boss in other game franchises. Lastly, the story. Normally the story would be one of the first items I’d address, but in the case of L4D it’s only a minor part of the game. If story is what you’re chasing, you won’t sate your desires here. It exists, but mostly in an overarching chapter introduction, justifying the setting of the map. In most (all?) cases, it requires the players to get from point A to B, usually with a pre-set, player-triggered  swarm encounter somewhere in the middle and another at the end. The story does allow for some interesting, oft throwaway lines of dialogue by the characters however, that allow some entertainment.While L4D may not be the best game in and of itself, but it’s a good co-op. If you can get some friends together and battle your way though it co-op, you should get a lot of enjoyment from it.			"

												Note: I have around 1500 hours in L4D2 at the time of writing this review.Left 4 Dead is a well-known zombie shooter set in a variety of locations. Each campaign has 4 survivors, who have to reach the safety vehicle or area on the other side and have to fight their way through tons of infected. There's also a versus and survival mode.PROS: + Teamplay can make a real difference. Good communication and teamwork seem to be more important than skill+ It's not too much the same as L4D2; some mechanics, items, statistics, sounds and visuals are different + The game is nearly a decade old and still does not feel obsolete or outdated. It's also not completely abandoned, either. If anything, this game should have won or at least end up as a finalist of the ""Test of Time"" Steam award+ The Source engine and console make adjusting the settings to your likings easier and is a comfortable engine to play withCONS - While L4D seems to be less dense in hostile population than L4D2, there's still a fair share of people who aim to ruin your fun - The game is, unavoidably, largely inferior to L4D2, especially since the content is nearly halved in comparison if you ""downgrade"" to this game (half the maps, half the infected, half the weapons, half the items and no mutations)- While you may find some people to play with, the servers can be a little empty, especially if you want to avoid the lower difficulties - Unlike the sequel, addons in this game are just as annoying to configure as in most games. Don't expect the same support L4D2 has to offer Some consider L4D to be completely inferior to L4D2 due the lack of content, while veterans find it to be the complete opposite. I find both games really enjoyable either way and I often find myself launching L4D when playing the old maps, just for the nostalgia or refreshment.One tip, you can't block trolls like in L4D2, so if you encounter a troll, just kick or shoot them.My rating: 8.5			"

There is Zoey, a young woman; Bill, the grizzled veteran; Louis, the middle-class office worker and Francis, the biker. Armed with weapons, these survivors must battle their way through the undead.In each of the game scenarios, you must battle your way to a series of safe houses that lead to a rescue point. You can have up to four players in a game, controlling each of the characters, or the AI can fill in and control the bots.Each scenario is presented like a movie. At the beginning there is a movie poster showing the cast. If you survive, the ""credits"" display the statistics for the game, like who killed the most zombies, who inflicted the most headshots, who delivered the most friendly fire, and so on. The final credit shows how many zombies were killed in the making of the film and also the film is dedicated to the memory of those survivors who did not make it to safety.The zombie horde that you battle is based on the ""fast"" zombies. Besides of the zombies there are also special infected. There is the hunter, which can leap across large distances to pin a survivor to the ground. Then there is the smoker, which has a frog-like tongue that can grab a survivor by the throat. The boomer is a corpulent zombie that vomits or explodes to spray survivors. Getting hit by the substance will not only temporarily blind survivors, but it drives the zombie horde into a feeding frenzy. Last but not least there is the tank, he is brick of a zombie that can take an enormous amount of damage and dish out a fair amount. And finally, there is the witch; she is an enormously powerful zombie that can take down a survivor with a single swipe. All maps of Left 4 Dead are available now in the sequel, so it would be cheaper to buy only Left 4 Dead 2.Still I would say that Left 4 Dead is an incredible and highly replayable multiplayer experience that is definitely worth checking out.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												L4D is a great game with many features such as a weight to your character and objects in the world. It can become a big challenge becoming to hectic so make sure you play the game a good amount so you can fully get it down! Heavily teammate based I have a great time with close friends and randoms! Only complaint is I wish the community was less TOXIC!			"

												The mother of Left 4 Dead 2. Without melee weapons, this game is all about teamwork with firearms.While there is less kinds of special infected, less numbers of them drops ingame, making the game pace slower, which is quite good for me.The special infected bots are also more stealthy in singleplayer campaigns than L4D2.One more thing, there is no more official valve servers which hosts online lobbies of this, as L4D2 became the majority of Zombie slayin' in Source engine. Only recommended if your friends already got / going to get this game, so that you or your friends can host a local lobby and play together.			"

												L4D is a very fun game, great to play online in the co-op mode where it's you and your mates playing through the game levels, it can be very hard but great fun all the time. The versus mode is great too where you get a chance to play as the zombies themselves, it’s a lot harder to play as them though because you need to use tactics and play very carefully or you die easily. The game itself is a mostly online multiplayer game which encourages team work as you keep each other out of harms and rescuing them from certain death which is inflicted by the different types of enemy you face. You can play it offline too which is a nice touch but to really achieve the full experience it is best to access online.Overall it's a great game to play, but doesn't last long enough, you will get through the main campaign pretty quickly, so there will be a lot of repetition as you play the same levels over and over again. Thankfully there are custom campaigns to download and play, and modded servers can be used which can change the gameplay experience.  "

												I'm giving this a positive because it began such a great series but if you are going to buy this one buy L4D2 as well because this game is just not as polished, there are many issues with bot AI as well as issues with random intense frame drops after restarting a chapter.The game is also far more difficult due to a lack of melee weapons, but that could also be one of the draws of the game as it isn't as easy as L4D2 but also is a little easier due to not having to deal with Charger's, Spitter's or Jockey's			"

												Well... the game's awesome, and i'm afraid it's becoming my bad habit for many months. The greatest shoot-and-bash experience and comfortable phisics, nice zombies and other monsters, very impressive characters even with this little told about them, pleasant graphics... I like very much almost everything it consists of. Excluding one damn thing - it's singleplayer on expert is too-damn-senselessly hard, mostly due to three stupid AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, which know how to screw up player's best efforts. They could at least obey commands like ""Wait![you three idiots, damn you]"", and keep close when they are most needed, that'd do it. Spent a hundred hours in single on expert, completed most missions, but ain't managed to beat no final mission on this difficulty, thou there was many almost beat ones(. Mostly screwed up in the end by those three friendlies. Of course i can look for tricks in internet, but that won't change my negative impressions from this, as of a player with enough experience of killing bots on hardest difficulties(. My apologies for any inadvertent mistakes in english i could have made.В общем классная игра, вполне подходящая для того чтобы ей надолго увлечься. Боевая часть очень понравилась, как и физика игры в целом, зомбари и прочие уроды тоже радуют, персонажи впечатляющие, хотя о них в игре толком и не рассказывается, общий вид неплохо отрисован. В общем почти все круто. Кроме одного неприятного момента - местами бессмысленной сложности и соответственно низкой проходимости синглплэера на эксперте. В основном из-за трех тупых ботов, периодически критично обгаживающих все усилия игрока. Могли хотя бы подчиняться командам типа ""Ждите[три тупых урода мать вашу!]"" и держаться строго рядом когда они больше всего нужны, этого было бы достаточно.Проторчал в игре часов сто, прошел большинство миссий, но ни одной финальной - хотя почти до конца проходил и их(. Можно конечно подсмотреть как это делается в инете, но подпорченности ощущений от прохождения это уже не отменит, мне обычно хватает собственного опыта на максимальной сложности из других игр, чтобы разбираться самому. Чисто боем без трюкачества финалы в сингле л4д на эксперте близки к непроходимым на концах, боты все портят(.			"

												The original L4D still worth owning.  The original campaign was glorious, while you can play an altered version in L4D2 the 2nd game altered many of the maps to slow down the game play in multiplayer.  L4D2 the campaign version is the same as the multiplayer version.  The 4th map of Blood Harvest, The Train Station, is one of the best examples why owning the first game is still worthwhile.  They put a fence across train tracks leading to a bridge, they added crows to call a endless horde but no verbal spoken cues to tip off the player that an endless horde is coming, they closed off garage doors to force the player to take more scenic routes which use to be optional areas, put dressers in front of windows to prevent shortcuts from being taken.  The original had a darker less joking around atmosphere.  If you never owned this classic, play it the way it was intended to be played before all the alterations were forced onto it.			"

Then lfd 2 came out with new weapons and even melee weapons! Suprisingly, they kinda have simular yet different ways of playing!

Eventually I found myself with 3 random people playing through Story line co-op in one night and these was best experienced 6 hours from both L4D's. Meanwhile there wasnt such things that was missing from gameplay or visual look. Its awesome there is people out there who prefer play first L4D in 2016 and its says something about games beauty.

												  Although it is a bit old, it still holds its reputation as a successful team oriented based game where completion most often depends on how well you and your party of four co-operate with one another.  I have spent much time with other groups fighting through hordes of the infected and map levels both official and fan made and have had varying experiences.  There would be groups so dysfunctional that I found it hard to get out of the door without being shot in the back or, no pun intended, found myself left for dead so that my character may attract the horde and my team may get away.  Such groups have their novelties and fun, but it can get frustrating when you want to complete the map.    Then, there are the dream teams.  You may die a few times, but you have fun along the way.  You look out for one another and everyone leaves with a good experience that has you coming back for more!  I have found and made many friends here and played many successful missions.  I am especially thankful they put up with my antics.  Such a game has about it a certain magic that one can only experience for themselves.  To describe any further would do it no justice.  The only real way of experiencing things is to gather some friends and brave it yourself, but you must then ask yourself if you can trust them to get you through. Have fun!			"

												As of this review, this game is 8 years old, and is still as amazing as it was when it released. I played this game for years on my Xbox 360 before I finally got it on Steam when I got my first computer a year ago. It's a shame I missed out on how much better this game is on PC, graphics and game play wise. Great game for friends. Sidenote: All the maps from L4D are avaliable on the Steam port of L4D2, which I did not read anywhere before I bought this game, so I would not bother purchasing this game due to its improved counterpart, Left 4 Dead 2.

												Part I: 8 February 2014I remember my first contact with Left 4 Dead. Saw one of many (at that days) gameplays and walkthroughs on YouTube and after watching first 5 minutes I watched next video, and next, and next… After 2 hours I was sure: I'm definitely gonna buy this game. I haven't had good enough PC that time, but first thing I did after getting new computer was installing Steam and… meh, buying L4D2, what I regret. 3 weeks later I bought L4D1 and I couldn't believe that game could be so much messed up after just 12 months. The only bug I encountered in L4D1 is that Zoey's animation gets stuck in weird position after loading shotgun (but it's fine when it was empty or only one shell was loaded), and only if playing by Zoey. In L4D2 the most, huh, „critical” bug I got was having all Survivors invulnerable for a few minutes after I somehow managed to shove Jockey off my head (big shame I didn't record it then).Besides this, L4D2 feels like it's just not polished – dumb Survivors animations, even more overpowered weapons, cartoonish feeling, annoying behaviour of Special Infected… L4D1 is free of this flaws – and that's why it's my favourite. Heh, in L4D1 I have only my own weapons sound mod in constant use, while L4D2 has about 1 GB of mods throw on it and I still can't get as much fun from it I get from L4D1. Big shame Valve practically dumped it in favor of money they get out of L4D2.Part II: 18 November 2016It appears after all these years I've been playing this magnificent game I'm one of the very few that still enjoy playing just a normal, casual game with bunch of known people in classic vanilla coop. Despite having pretty much only one friend still being around here and sharing my preferences, I am unable to forget about this game, even when I'm not playing it. It just had so big impact on my real life I just can't. Left 4 Dead gave me everything: great moments with good players and even better people, chance to meet really good people not only in game or as a voice in my speakers, but also in real life. It learned me how to treat people so they will be straight with you and honest, but also how to „read” them. How to love and how to hate. Gave me the only one opportunity to meet someone I cannot forget despite I've been trying and wishing to. It gave me depression and suicide thoughts. At one time in my life L4D was the only thing that was keeping me away from madness. I've seen in this game so many different stories and heard so many things about people I could easily write a small book about it. In my case Left 4 Dead was like a soap opera, except that I was one of actors in it. It really changed my life and me as myself. I guess I went too deep into this game and I've never noticed when it was too late. Maybe I'm too sensitive. But still, after all these almost 3000 hours I am a different person than I was before. The bad thing about that is that I'm worse, even though I know myself better than ever before. This may look like a joke, but I'm really f♥cking serious here. Left 4 Dead created and then destroyed me. And here I am now: alone, forgotten, having problems with almost every aspect of my life except my health – a bad thing never dies.And I guess that's why there are still people playing this game.

												Hello,This game is the first in the series of left 4 dead games, and has largely been overtaken by the release of left 4 dead 2. There is however still enough of a playerbase for you to jump on at any hour of the day and organize a full group (4 players).Despite what you may have read, left 4 dead 2 is not exactly the ""same game"" as left 4 dead, there are many differences, such as the assortment of enemies and overall gameplay.Left4dead is much more pure and vanilla, it has 4 primary special infected instead of the 8 in left4dead2, no melee weapons and less map event triggers/sidequests.It would be accurate to classify Left4dead2 as an updated version of this game, but with that you're losing the simplistic gameplay of the first, for a much more contrived chaotic version of itself.As far as the gameplay goes:- This is NOT entirely what I would consider a survival game, it is not team based Resident-Evil, it is an episodic action shooter.- It is a team based game, while it is possible to operate solo within a map, you're more or less dependant upon those you play with, whether its AI or PC's.- The graphics and sounds effects are good for when it was released, no complaints there.- Level layouts are done pretty well, there are always a few bonus areas to explore, you will never find you're stuck wondering where to go or what to do, but because of this the game feels largely linear... I suppose this was the intention of the creators as it is broken down into goal oriented episodes/chapters, as a result this game can start to feel rather repetitive after playing through a particular map a few times.- The game is never boring, it is constantly throwing enemies at you, and you're constantly rushing to finish the current map, there is very little ""downtime"" other than the starts and ends of each map.- There are also two different modes of play offered apart from the regular ""movie"" mode. Survival, where you have to survive in a set location for as long as possible while the difficulty increases and Versus mode, where one team takes control of the zombies as the other team works its way through the map.- There can be a few bugs in the game, such as those regarding players falling off buildings and teammates attempting to rescue them, but largely the game is not full of any bugs that directly affect gameplay.- Personally I feel both L4D & L4D2 should have more weapons, but you never get bored with what you're given.- Regular zombies in this game are ""runners"" they're not the classical slow / shuffling Romero zombies, headshots are not required to kill them. In fact these are not ""zombies"" at all, they're infected/mutated humans, so shooting anywhere can result in a kill.- The amount of zombies/infected is determined largely upon the players movement through the map, there is no significant set amount of zombies within each map, player progress results in map triggers that spawn hordes of infected that rush to the players location. So moving slow, keeping quiet , etc will be of no real benefit if you're trying to avoid detection.- It has a few additional items one would expect, med kits, pain pills, molotovs, pipe bombs, gas cans and propane tanks...all spread out rather liberally across any map, irregardless of difficulty, although it does significantly change in expert mode.- The game offers various difficulty levels, the difficulty level does not affect regular zombie health, instead it changes the the DMG they inflict on a player when hit. Special infected on the other hand are given HP & DMG increases. With each increase in difficulty the available additional items, weapons and ammo on a given map will decrease. If you're wanting to play this as a ""survival"" game, setting the difficulty to ""Expert mode"" may offer the play experience you're seeking.- L4D & L4D2 also seem to have a large map making community, so there will always be something new you can decide to download and play through.- This series is not ignored by the company Devs, and they don't hesitate to fix problems or show community support.I would recommend buying L4D/L4D2 as a bundle, if you're interested in playing. If you're seeking community numbers I would not advocate purchasing this game over L4D2, as most L4D players have migrated there.If you enjoy team based gameplay and blasting away zombies to the point of nausea, then this is probably the game for you.These are well made games that are supported by their company, you will never feel as if you had wasted your money, even if you don't particularily like the game.Enjoy :)			"

												Left 4 Dead is still a classic I will never forget nor stop playing. I used to play this on my Xbox 360 and have ever since. I recently bagged this and Left 4 Dead 2 on a bundle deal for £5 ($7) on Steam.It was great to finally get to play this game on my MAC. It works superbly and runs great... and with the Steam Edition you get FREE DLC as a pose to Xbox which you must pay for each bit of DLC. General Gameplay The general gameplay is great. It runs very smooth on my MAC and the campagins are brilliant (Full Specs at end of review). I'd have to say that the campagins on this game are better than Left 4 Dead 2's campagins, but that's just my opinion. Community The Community on Left 4 Dead is decent... everyone is friendly and you rarely come across stuck up people who's aim is to troll. Left 4 Dead isn't as active as Left 4 Dead 2 (800 Players v 15,000 Players) but there is still some servers active and enough people to play the game with (although single player works just fine). Overview In general this game meets everything that I look for in a game. It has great graphics and great gameplay. For a classic game it's deffinetly a great buy and I would reccomend this to anyone who had a notion of buying it. What I will say is I do think you should wait until this is on a deal. As I said I got this game and L4D 2 for £5 together instead of £22. Deals happen ocassionally on this game. But when you catch it on SALE I suggest buying it.Rating:  1. Must Buy   2. Get on Sale   3. It's alright  4. Not worth it  5. Avoid  "

												I've played Left 4 Dead since it came out on xbox 360 in 2008. To me, this game is a favorite classic. Sure, you can get the same maps and characters on Left 4 Dead 2 nowadays, but there is nothing better than the original zombies and weapons. I've played this game for years, and I always come back to it. The darkness and eariness throughout these campaigns are amazing. The survivals are extremely fun. And the versus and servers are also a fun competitive experience. The game can be glitchy, and there are plenty of loopholes found in the game, but overall, this game is definitely worth the buy.

The important thing is that this game really makes you shed a tear and laugh out loud because of its fun moments both online and offline or single player or multiplayer, its active servers really make this game go awesome at a very powerful rate. If you guys haven't bought this game yet I suggest you should buy it right now and invite your friends and have fun!Spoilers: This game gives you even more intense fun if you play this game on all hollow's eve(AKA Holloween).

												I play this game for an entirely different reason than I would play Left 4 Dead 2. Both games are meant to be cooperative, but after getting rather good at L4D1, I feel that it's somewhat broken in terms of your partners being indispensable. In L4D2, you absolutely need to work together as a team in order to accomplish your goals. If there's inexperienced people on your team or if you end up playing with bots, the challenge becomes much more difficult. Some of the guns have been nerfed in order to reinforce the need for partners. Also, you can't melee forever, like you are able to do in the first game. Your character eventually fatigues and your character will start to melee more slowly after a while. The maps are designed to prevent the group from hunkering down in a corner and waiting out the horde. Instead, you are meant to run and gun, trying to lessen the amount of damage you will take, since you can't hide in a corner and melee, which would allow you to prevent taking any damage at all. The finales are much more varied and definitely require some teamwork. Without human players backing you up, the finales on some of the new maps would be near impossible.In L4D1, on the other hand, the infected are pretty easy to dispel if you stay in huddled in a single squad. All you need your partners for is to give you a shove to save you from the occasional special infected. As long as you stay in a team, you can save each other from any hazard. The game is simplistic and pattern based. All you need to do is follow audio cues to know what to expect. Hear some piano keys playing? A Hunter is nearby. Hear a howl? A horde of zombies is coming. It's at that point that you just look for the nearest building corner and crouch. Then, you melee and shoot until the horde eventually dies. The game is extremely simplistic, once you've learned how to read its cues. The finales are also a very simple pattern of horde, Tank, horde, Tank, followed by the rescue, at which point you have a horde and a Tank at the same time.It's for this reason that I play it, though. I enjoy playing it while talking to friends or use it as an opportunity to make friends. I can spend hours talking to people while killing zombies. For me, it's like a chatroom with a teambuilding exercise built into it. When I play L4D2, on the other hand, I spend so much time focusing on the task at hand, that I can't stop and chat. Not to mention that it's an entirely different gaming experience, which I have yet to acclimate to. In other words, I still suck at L4D2, so I can't easily chat and play at the same time. So, for how I use it, I definitely recommend L4D1.			"

												Hello Fellow Survivors,I love Left 4 Dead! It has a great storyline with the great character development of the survivors of a zombie apocalypse, and it's one of the most well-done games that follows the zombie premise. Definitely a great precursor to an even better game, Left 4 Dead 2! I definitely recommend playing both as they are both great games, and the cutscenes make it all that much better! The series is personally my favorite zombie series of all time so I strongly recommend giving it a shot, it's honestly worth every penny!-Kyle James			"

												Left 4 Dead is the definitive zombie game that still holds up to this day. The maps are fun and memorable the animations really bring out the weapons. However the characters are for the most part dull and uninteresting. Also since the game was released so long ago Left 4 Dead does not support the Steam workshop. But if you can look past all that than I think you will enjoy this amazing title. I would go as far to say that Left 4 Dead is better than it's sequel. All in all this is a great game from a great fanbase. PDHD gives this game a 9/10. Fantastic.			"

												If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead 2, this is basically the same game but streamlined. For the uninitiated, Left 4 Dead is a multiplayer FPS where four survivors must work together to survive a zombie apocalypse, fighting hordes of fast-moving Common infected and Special infected with unique abilities.In this original iteration, only the Hunter (fast pouncer), Smoker (long-range snarer), Boomer (kamikaze horde summoner), Witch (extremely dangerous if alerted) and Tank (it is what it sounds like) appear.There are four modes in L4D: Campaign (play through one of a number of 'campaigns' in the story), Versus (like Campaign but additional people can control the Special infected), Survival (the hardest mode, where you must hold out for as long as possible against the Infected and set time records), and singleplayer (Campaign with bots on your computer).The gameplay is directed by an AI system named The Director, who spawns items & enemies, and changes the level depending on the status of the survivors. The harder the difficulty, the more contempt it has for you.The presentation, as befitting most Valve games, is stellar. The campaigns are presented as movies, with 'credits' after the end displaying gameplay stats and a separate music Director controlling the incidental music. It does a good job of creating a zombie-film like atmosphere.Only thing of concern is the community. It's not abysmal, but it's relatively small and you'll run into some toxic players, given how cooperative and intense this game can be. If you want to play Expert at all, be prepared to do some janky metagame stuff to fit in - killing players who are below 50 health when they reach the safehouse so they respawn at 50 being one example.Now you might be wondering: with all of the official L4D campaigns ported over to the sequel, why should I play this? Well, there are a number of differences that for make L4D unique and worth playing for me and others even today, and even if it lacks Workshop mod support.Regarding weaponry and equipment:* The weapon animations are simply better than the sequel's. Fortunately, there are mods that port some of them to L4D2. There is also an HD port mod for the pump shotgun.* The pistols are M1911s, which I much prefer over the L4D2 pistols. There is also also an HD port mod for them.* There are less guns, which means more meaningful weaponry choices. Tier one only has the pump shotgun and Uzi; tier two has the auto shotgun, M16 and hunting rifle. The shotguns function the most different: if you reload them from an empty magazine you must rack the chamber before firing. This makes a difference on the harder difficulties.* The melee in non-versus games does not suffer from fatigue; you can keep doing it as long as you need. This is helpful when there are no melee weapons to choose from!* There are only pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails; and no adrenaline shots, defibrillators or ammo packs. Which, again, can make for more of a challenge.Regarding your enemies:* Less Special infected (no Jockey, Charger or Spitter) make for a different and some say harder experience, not in the least because the SI that remain are more dangerous here.* The Common infected appear different and more true to what Valve had in mind.Regarding performance:* The game runs better than L4D2.* The HUD is streamlined and looks better.Regarding aesthetics and other stuff like that:* There are different achievements in L4D; for example you do not get achievements in L4D2 for beating the original campaigns on Expert. If you want credit for doing so, you'll want to do it here.* The little touch to the bot AI's weapon selection is missing in the L4D2 ports. In L4D2, Zoey uses assault rifles as well as hunting rifles, Louis uses shotguns, and Francis uses snipers. This is in contrast to their behaviour in L4D, where Louis would use the Uzi/M16, Francis uses shotguns, and Zoey would usually pick up the hunting rifle.* L4D2's campaigns and aesthetics are action-horror oriented. L4D's are more horror-oriented. While this is largely carried over in the L4D2 ports of the original campaigns, the optimal experience is playing them in L4D.* For those who enjoy glitches, there are a number in the original campaigns that have not been fixed. The Jesus Rock in Death Toll's finale is a prime example.* You can see your legs when you look down.Basically, Left 4 Dead distills the formula to its essence and consequently makes this first entry into the series a classic. I suppose this right here is why it's still being played in a nutshell.Not to say that Left 4 Dead 2 isn't bad, because apart from the weapon animations and its larger but more toxic community it's really not worse - just different. If you want a different Left 4 Dead experience, or you want to ease your way into the franchise by picking it up at the source, I'd recommend this.			"

												Great game 9/10! But you dont have any reason to buy it, because all this stuff is in left 4 dead 2. The only reasons you have to buy this is:1 - To see your character legs, mainly Zoey(you perv!)2 - if you want your left 4 dead with green cover3 - if you want to waste money in a game you probably will never play like the other 100 games you have in your steam. 4 - Finance valve for they make half life 3			"

												The original Left 4 Dead was much superior to Left 4 Dead 2 in terms of stability and gameplay.Too bad Valve wants this game to rot, now. There are no official dedicated servers, the third party servers run like♥♥♥♥♥♥(you'd be better off on a local server), and only an average of about 700 people play (There are only about 9 open lobbies for the entire game itself, including all game modes).Yes, I am aware that all of L4D1's content was ported to L4D2. That could be the reason why the original Left 4 Dead is ""left for dead"". BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME. Left 4 Dead 2 will never be as good or as better as the original.It's strange how Valve can advertise the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a game, then completely forget about it a few years later.The game isn't strong and popular as it used to be, but it still holds a strong position in my heart.9/10			"

												If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead 2, this is basically the same game but streamlined. For the uninitiated, Left 4 Dead is a multiplayer FPS where four survivors must work together to survive a zombie apocalypse, fighting hordes of fast-moving Common infected and Special infected with unique abilities.In this original iteration, only the Hunter (fast pouncer), Smoker (long-range snarer), Boomer (kamikaze horde summoner), Witch (extremely dangerous if alerted) and Tank (it is what it sounds like) appear.There are four modes in L4D: Campaign (play through one of a number of 'campaigns' in the story), Versus (like Campaign but additional people can control the Special infected), Survival (the hardest mode, where you must hold out for as long as possible against the Infected and set time records), and singleplayer (Campaign with bots on your computer).The gameplay is directed by an AI system named The Director, who spawns items & enemies, and changes the level depending on the status of the survivors. The harder the difficulty, the more contempt it has for you.The presentation, as befitting most Valve games, is stellar. The campaigns are presented as movies, with 'credits' after the end displaying gameplay stats and a separate music Director controlling the incidental music. It does a good job of creating a zombie-film like atmosphere.Only thing of concern is the community. It's not abysmal, but it's relatively small and you'll run into some toxic players, given how cooperative and intense this game can be. If you want to play Expert at all, be prepared to do some janky metagame stuff to fit in - killing players who are below 50 health when they reach the safehouse so they respawn at 50 being one example.Now you might be wondering: with all of the official L4D campaigns ported over to the sequel, why should I play this? Well, there are a number of differences that for make L4D unique and worth playing for me and others even today, and even if it lacks Workshop mod support.Regarding weaponry and equipment:* The weapon animations are simply better than the sequel's. Fortunately, there are mods that port some of them to L4D2. There is also an HD port mod for the pump shotgun.* The pistols are M1911s, which I much prefer over the L4D2 pistols. There is also also an HD port mod for them.* There are less guns, which means more meaningful weaponry choices. Tier one only has the pump shotgun and Uzi; tier two has the auto shotgun, M16 and hunting rifle. The shotguns function the most different: if you reload them from an empty magazine you must rack the chamber before firing. This makes a difference on the harder difficulties.* The melee in non-versus games does not suffer from fatigue; you can keep doing it as long as you need. This is helpful when there are no melee weapons to choose from!* There are only pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails; and no adrenaline shots, defibrillators or ammo packs. Which, again, can make for more of a challenge.Regarding your enemies:* Less Special infected (no Jockey, Charger or Spitter) make for a different and some say harder experience, not in the least because the SI that remain are more dangerous here.* The Common infected appear different and more true to what Valve had in mind.Regarding performance:* The game runs better than L4D2.* The HUD is streamlined and looks better.Regarding aesthetics and other stuff like that:* There are different achievements in L4D; for example you do not get achievements in L4D2 for beating the original campaigns on Expert. If you want credit for doing so, you'll want to do it here.* The little touch to the bot AI's weapon selection is missing in the L4D2 ports. In L4D2, Zoey uses assault rifles as well as hunting rifles, Louis uses shotguns, and Francis uses snipers. This is in contrast to their behaviour in L4D, where Louis would use the Uzi/M16, Francis uses shotguns, and Zoey would usually pick up the hunting rifle.* L4D2's campaigns and aesthetics are action-horror oriented. L4D's are more horror-oriented. While this is largely carried over in the L4D2 ports of the original campaigns, the optimal experience is playing them in L4D.* For those who enjoy glitches, there are a number in the original campaigns that have not been fixed. The Jesus Rock in Death Toll's finale is a prime example.* You can see your legs when you look down.Basically, Left 4 Dead distills the formula to its essence and consequently makes this first entry into the series a classic. I suppose this right here is why it's still being played in a nutshell.Not to say that Left 4 Dead 2 isn't bad, because apart from the weapon animations and its larger but more toxic community it's really not worse - just different. If you want a different Left 4 Dead experience, or you want to ease your way into the franchise by picking it up at the source, I'd recommend this.			"

												Left 4 Dead! Ah, a classic fun 4 player Co-Op survival horror game. This game is probably the best most fun game Valve has ever created (besides Half-Life). You choose between a set of four characters: Zoey, Bill, Francis, and Louis. There are different gamemodes such as Single Player Campaign, Co-Op Campaign, Versus, and if you're feeling lucky, Realism Versus and Realism Campaign. Realism is pretty much no hud, you can't see the survivors if you are infected in realism versus, in Campaign you can't see where Meds are, weapons, ect. It's pretty much for those hardcore gamers out there who say ""I'm highly skilled in the arm of killing."" Now, Let's talk about all that comes with this game.Single Player/Co-Op Campaign: Left 4 Dead expands on six campaigns. No Mercy, Crash Course (Free DLC) , Death Toll, Dead Air, Dam It (Originally Cut) , Blood Harvest, and the most depressing DLC that is now free to play (depressing in a good way) The Sacrifice. No Mercy, Death Toll, Dead Air, and Dam It are all five leveled campaigns while Crash Course is two levels and The Sacrifice is three levels. Each level has a finale where you have to fight on hoards of infected and special infected such as Smokers, Hunters, Boomers, Witches, and of course the biggest baddest infected, The Tank. No! Not a military Tank! It's more like a special infected that took way too many steroids and is buff as f**k. Boomers puke on you or blow up on you if someone shoots him (looking at you Francis) and draws hoards of infected onto whoever has the green goop on them. The Smoker has a very long tounge that grabs you and either strangles you, or if he's close enough he claws at you. Hunters basically pounce on you and claw the hell out of you where someone would consider it♥♥♥♥♥♥ Witches are pretty easy to get by, but if you shine a flashlight at them or shoot at them, or ever startle them, RUN LIKE F**KING HELL!!! Verses: Four survivors Vs. tons of special infected players. There are two rounds per level on a single campaign. One round you will be a survivor where you fight off other players and infected while round two You will be the special infected and hunt down the survivors. Whoever has the most points once a campaign is finished wins.The Verdic: Left 4 Dead is a fun Co-Op/ Single Player survival horror game that you can play for hours and hours. It's a classic and is still amazing and fun to this day to not just me, but the gaming community. In fact, once you get the hang of this one buy Left 4 Dead 2 for even more fun with new special infected, new campaigns, new survivors, and more. My final verdict for Left 4 Dead is a solid 10/10. Now that Left 4 Dead is over 10 years old and it has been a little over 9 years since Left 4 Dead 2 released, I think it's about time for Valve to release Left 4 Dead 3 this year.			"

												Good game engine, often feeling like a multiplayerversion of Half-Life, but 3 times better. Broad support for modding and addons, and plenty of those to be found on the web. Good fluent shooter gameplay with some dynamic stuff i.e.: items and pick-ups placed randomly (still at pre-defined locations though). Few glitches and a good overall stability. The game content is  mostly gore not horror, nothing really scary in there just disgusting.Sadly the gaming community is the worst of all i encountered in any multiplayer game. There are players to have a good game with that is roughly 20-30% of the average gamer population for this. The rest of them are egomanic loners who love to waste your gaming experience by either rushing, sabotaging, or even outright teamkilling you. The former are the most frequent type, making you wonder why they even bother playing this with others when they would be much better off playing the game single player. Often you will find they set up fake accounts to ""troll"" those who simply wish to enjoy an imersive campaign and play with a good team. (Votekick usually wont work, so just let them rush and wait until they get incapped and killed by a special infected or tank, then they usually leave because you did not save their royal butt.)So, if you get this either have 4 or more friends you will be playing it with or be prepared to play this singleplayer more frequently than multiplayer. On a bright side the entire game can be finished in singleplayer and AI is okay as well, just a bit stupid-ish.			"

												Such a instant classic. I put sooo many hours into this game on the 360 and thought, why not get it for pc?Fantastic game series (one of my favourites) simple game play, so much replayablity (although I loose intrest in a game very quick if there isnt any progression or customization this is a exeption) This is probably one of the only games that I find I need to be sticking with my team and feel like I relie on them alot of the time to save my♥♥♥♥♥from hunters and smokers. Great unique characters, had a fantastic sequel and cant wait for the rumored l4d3 which is rumored to realese this year which I would be suprised if that werent true.Only thing is I wish it could have more campains but there is left 4 dead 2 which has new campains with the old too and the workshop which freshens the game.Overall a must have for anyone into the fps genre.There is no excuse to not have this game in your libery now if you are into fps, zombie games, horror, survival or all of the above.

												Left 4 Dead is an arcade styled game, with fast paced combat & a lovely campaign that is a thrill with friends. I can recommend the game to those who do not care about zombies that have special abilities. Overall the game is fun, & the story is just as fun, even with friends. I originally got the game to mount on Garry's Mod, but rather than let money go to waste I gave it a play & completed it.TL:DR; It's fun for what it is, I can recommend it.			"

												The original L4D improved on with L4D2 but still a classic in it's own right. A great place to start if new to the co-op shooter genre. the characters are well written the voice acting is awesome and the maps are intricate and damn near perfect. I have nothing but fond memories of this game and would highly recommend it.It only gets better if you have friends playing. The mod support is also great so you can get it looking just the way you like it.After playing hearing someone shout ""Tank"" will never be the same.Highly recommended.			"

												Nothing else than a masterpiece, but what else to expect from VALVe? Left 4 Dead was the flagship of the zombie apocalypse genre. With a fairly interesting story-line, as interesting as it can get when zombies are trying to eat you. The game is split up into episodes, or movies, where the four protagonists make their way through all imaginable zombie infested areas.I think Left 4 Dead didn't start the zombie culture, as there were books much earlier, but the game obviously did a great part of magnifying the genre, not only for games but for movies and TV-shows as well. The game has a lot of gore and darkness flowing through it, and I remember being terrified in my first play-through of the game. Looking back - this game didn't have a long lifetime, not as it's ""competitor"" Killing Floor, that is still kicking.Valve kind of screwed Left 4 Dead over with Left 4 Dead 2 being released only a year after the original. The sequel wasn't even close to having the same atmosphere as it's predecessor, with all that darkness and grain film filter. Valve later ported over the whole Left 4 Dead into the sequel, which gives no reason to play the first game at all, which is very saddening, indeed.			"

												Left 4 Dead is in one word, fun. Its my favorite zombie game, but that doesnt mean theres not flaws...... because there are. For example your kills will be stolen very easily when playing online with people, this can become very frustrating. Another flaw is other players can shoot you and it will take health points away, i guess its for realism but its hard to take that seriously when your hanging on a cliff for an hour waiting for someone to revive you. Also storywise theres not too much to offer, grinding through countless maps with little variety can get kind of boring, but every cloud  has a silver lining. One of those silver linings is the exhilarating moments, the ones where your rescue arrives and hundreds of zombies start chasing after you, its a race for your life and if you do its upsetting but can actually be quite funny with you and your group. To sum this up Left 4 Dead can be played by pretty much anyone, its a fun experience especially with friends and i would certainley recommend it. 7/10would get thrown off a cliff by a tank again			"

												(The good) of this game is the world and the end of the world with the undead trying to kill you at every given chance (The Bad) The AI are terrible if you are trying to beat all expert levels!           The players are not any better by any means and love to quit after they fail a couple of times.          If you are going to fight by my side on expert, stop quiting! It can take up to 5 hours or more               I'm not going to K.I.C.K you for failing a few times, as long as you are trying your best            It amazes how far this game has gone down since its release in 2008 with these nasty            Players.          I beat one expert level with rookies who didn't give up just resent but it took us around 5           Hours but we did it even after trying over and over again.           You have to have patience sometimes but you try telling that to kids under 18          If you plan on beating this on expert. Get friends or make some, because you won't be            Able to.          Still a great game but you will get bored real fast with most of the players being nasty          People and ruining it for you GOOD LUCK			"

												IMPORTANT!!! This is not a bad game by any means. It is, in fact, a very good game. It's just that Left 4 Dead 2 has everything this game offers AND a whole lot more. If you are looking to get a Left 4 Dead game, just get Left 4 Dead 2. I suppose you could get this game and Left 4 Dead 2 for the sake of bragging rights, but that's really about it. The only reason I have this game in my library is because I preordered Evolve, which, as I said in my Left 4 Dead 2 review, is probably one of the biggest financial mistakes I've made in my life to date.UPDATE:Looking at people's reactions to this review, I'm a little unsure whether I should keep this review up to encourage discussion or if I should go ahead and give Left 4 Dead 1 the old thumbs up so people don't get so butthurt.Also I am a wondering if people were mislead by my ""biggest financial mistake in my life to date"" ramble. Evolve was what I was dissing, not Left 4 Dead 1. And I'm not gonna go comdemning people who have purchased Left 4 Dead 1 even if I didn't like it, because how you spend your money is none of my business.Look, I'm not gonna go lying about how I feel about this game. Yes, there are enough differences between the two games for them to technically pass as two separate games. The differences just aren't substantial enough for me to justify trying to sell this game as being infinitely better like the entire planet seems to think it is. I will not deny that Left 4 Dead 1 is an absolute masterpiece. I will not deny that there were plenty of changes made from L4D1 to L4D2 that were most certainly NOT for the better (most notably, IMHO, the ridiculous camera movement when being damaged). But I am BAFFLED by the fact that people compare these games like they have zero similarities to each other, completely ignoring the fact that both games are built on the EXACT same engine, have the EXACT same base gameplay mechanics, and even use many of the EXACT same in-game assets.It's not like I'm never going to play this game. I will absolutely pick this game up on occasion and play for a while. Like I said, I don't think the game is bad at all. I've even gone so far as to make a point (which EVERYONE has made a point of missing) that it is, in fact, a fantastic game. But the lack of any truly substantial game-changing tweak from L4D1 to L4D2 on top of the fact that L4D2 has more characters, more guns, more campaigns, Steam Workshop integration, better zombie gore, even melee weapons... I'm sorry, the appeal of zombie games to me is the killing of the zombies in itself, and L4D2 provides more options in that respect than L4D1. While I absolutely understand that many other people have many other reasons to play zombie games besides the zombie killing in itself (such as atmosphere, story, horror, etc.), the fact that L4D2 delivers better on the sheer joy of murdering zombies than L4D1 is exactly that. You know, a fact. And at the end of the day, why else are we even playing any Left 4 Dead game? The atmosphere? Maybe. The story? Meh. The horror? You've gotta be kidding me.But seriously. If you think you have something to tell me that you think will change my opinion, please let me know. And no, whining about how you are so insulted by my review will not accomplish anything. If anything, it would probably be worth noting that the L4D1 community consists mostly of butthurt children who would rather be antagonized by any critical statement in regards to their precious little game, instead of freaking the ♥♥♥♥ out about the fact that right-winged Adolf Hitler 2.0 is running for president of the United States. You know, like any halfway decent excuse for a human being would.Good day. :)			"

Left for dead is valves genius answer to a new way of playing a zombie co-op video game.There may not be much of a story with left for dead, as in the terms of a single player story, but left for dead is a game which doesn't require it, as the replay value of multiplayer is beyond excellent.I can play left for dead for hours on end and not get bored. There's many different types of modes to play including versus, survival, single player, or the multiplayer campaign. Not only is it fun to use your voice to communicate with your other team members, but It's also fun to work together with strangers to reach your goal.I love left for dead. I love the way It's a different style of zombie game. I love the way you have to co-operate with your other team members to survive each campaign and game mode. It's a great way of meeting new friends, and having a good blast.Left for dead is a must buy for any gamer.			"

												I remember being sooo hyped for this game when it came out. The game consist of 4 special zombies including a tank,smoker, hunter, and a boomer. The game has around 5  chapters and each chapter has about 5 parts to each chapter. The game is addicting and really fun.. If you get left 4 dead 2 you will get all of left 4 dead 1 maps on that game.. So why would you buy left 4 dead? Ill tell you. On left 4 dead 2 you deal with new special zombies jockeys, spitter, and charger. These special zombies are really annoying in 2. Also in left 4 dead their are no melee weapons.I recommend left 4 dead whenever it goes on sale in a bundle. Game is totally worth it and there is no steam workshop on the game, but their are some amazing mods to the game!! "

												TL;DR at the bottomWow. Coming from a guy who spent a lot of time playing Left 4 Dead 2, I can personally say this game is actually really awesome. Some people simply don't play this game, because everything that's in this game is in Left 4 Dead 2. Which is true to a degree, however there are some differences. First of all, there are only Left 4 Dead campaigns (which is obviously expected). Second of all, There are no melee weapons either. Third of all, the community is almost dead.Ok so why the hell would I recommend this game? Well, it feels like a better game. Let me explain. Valve wanted to create an amazing 4 player co-op zombie survival game and they did! It was pretty damn scary, it had great characters, the tone of the game was really dark, and it was a ton of fun! On top of that you could actually see your own legs! Left 4 Dead 2 just feels like an upgrade of the game by adding new campaigns, characters, and melee weapons. Left 4 Dead never got the attention it deserved (in my opinion) because Valve decided to release L4D2 way earlier than it was supposed to be released.hat I'm trying to say is, Left 4 Dead feels more like a classic Valve game and feels like a simple game compared to Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game, but Left 4 Dead is simply a classic.TL;DRLeft 4 Dead is a great FPS game created by Valve that's taken place in the Zombie apocalypse. It's an amazing 4 player co-op game that anyone can enjoy! If you're still not satisfied of what this game has to offer, go buy L4D2.Overall rating 9/10			"

												If you don't have Left 4 Dead and you're a fan of any kind of zombie-apocalyptic type of game, you're missing out one of the best experiences ever. This game has satisfied the thirst of any zombie-killing fan out there. There are even modes to play as zombies where you are special infected and you can attack the survivors with your team mates. A must-have!			"

												I love Left 4 Dead. The atmosphere, the visuals, the pacing, the humor, the maps.Valve reinvented co-operative gameplay with this title. Sure, there have been multiplayer games that let you mash bad guys as a group, but never done as thoroughly as L4D does it. Your team's survival depends on teamwork. And yet, it's never complicated. L4D rewards you for behaving exactly as you should behave if there really was a zombie apocalypse. Stay together as a group, watch each other's back. Share resources.The Versus mode exemplifies these themes too, in that the infected team works best if the individuals cooperate and coordinate. All of this adds up to an awesome ""beer & pretzels"" alternative to your usual hardcore fare.L4D2 one-ups L4D in many ways, but the atmosphere of the original is much darker. When Valve adapts all L4D maps for L4D2, there will be little reason left to buy this game... but still. It's on sale all the time. Enjoy a little piece of history.			"

												Good game made great by playing with friends. If you have played L4D2 before actually playing this one (like me) then you might think it is a bit lacking in the SI, weapons, specials department and that is to be expected, but if you can look at it apart from the sequel you will appreciate it for the outstanding team based gameplay it offers and challenge, this game actually seems slightly more difficult than it's follow up, but that is not a bad thing, just makes you have to be more situationally aware.9/10			"

												Very great game, tactical co-op at it's finest. L4D2 has everything this game has to offer and much more, all the campaigns from this game are remastered and get this, some layouts of the maps are changed to provide more challenge. So not everything is the same.AI acts very differently in this game. The survivor bots AI is laughable, mediocre, you put some nasty word here. Let me elaborate. Bots in this game are so advanced they can commit friendly fire, yes, it's possible, and you thought bots from the 2nd game were bad. Comparing bots from this game to bots from the second is like comparing the 1st computer ever made to a highly advanced computer of today's modern age. Yeah, they're that bad. They will never be around you, they will rather focus on a zombie that's too far away and circle around him than to provide cover for you. When you get incapped by a special infected it will take them ages to find you and free you, especially on the higher difficulties.Like the survivor AI, the infected AI is here, but, that AI is slightly, shall we say, improved. You remember that strategy for the tank, igniting him with a molotov and then running and gunning? Well, it won't work anymore, in this game, setting a tank on fire will boost his speed making him a force to be reckoned with on expert. Capable of obliterating the entire team in seconds. Which of course will make you think of the new strats to take on him. Hunters, smokers and boomers, they all come in the most unfortunate moments, like when you're incapped, or you're in the middle of a horde attack. They tend to spawn out of mid air too, see, you're, let's say in this alley right now, you turn a corner to pick up pills, you turn around and there they are, even though, they weren't there in the 1st place. Another shi*storm sent there by AI Director.Lots and lots of abusable glitches in this game, for survival, for campaigns, you name it. Note that all these glitches present are good glitches which can help you if you learn how to exploit them. No bad glitches so far.You know your general setup of guns, other gear, and campaigns. Campaigns are beautifully crafted, level design are out of this world, how well made are they. Each time you play, the game will be different than the last one you played each time providing a challenge. Thanks to the AI Director which controlls all the item and infected spawns in those campaigns.Also, apart from the 2nd installment, you can carry more ammunition for some guns, mostly starting shotgun and tactical/combat shotgun. Now, after all I've said, let's move onto the community. This game has at least 200-600 people playing daily, you'll find maybe 2-3 campaigns on which you can join from the selection menu, maybe 1 or none versus game, and here and there a couple of survival games. Community is small, not a lot of people are playing this game anymore because the sequel is superior in most ways. Even though the community is small, you'll still find griefers(trolls), so some form of cancer is still present in this game. Versus community is as toxic as that of the 2nd game. One mistake and you're gone. So stay away till you know you can handle yourself. You'll meet a couple of really nice people here and there, my advice, friend them, and stick close to them. Best way to play this game is to play with friends, isolate yourself from the griefers and just enjoy and have a blast.One last thing for you gun fans out there, there are no workshop add-ons in this game, workshop for this game is non existant. So, just a heads up. This game is purely old school.Now, after all I've said, you can either take my words for it, or go and try it yourself, you decide if you want this game or not.With every bad thing this game has, I love it with all my heart. Played it back in the day on x360, and bought it here for nostalgia sake only to find it on brink of it's death. Still it's pretty fun with the right crowd.			"

												This game is an absolute gem, a must-have for any Left 4 Dead fans out there.The first Left 4 Dead game I've ever played was Left 4 Dead 2. The only time I've played the original (this one) was with my cousins but it was only for a measly 30 minutes or so, I can't vividly remember.Coming from a person who has technically never played this original masterpiece, I can confirm that this♥♥♥♥♥♥is better than Left 4 Dead 2 in many factors. The game's atmosphere is much darker than L4D2 (Like It's supposed to be). The Common Infected sound so much better, same with the special infected. There are also small soundtracks that you may not have heard in the sequel, you can find one of them at the last level of No Mercy after you beat the first tank.All in all; for it's price right now @ Summer Sales (or any sales out there really), buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game if you're a true L4D fan. It's worth the money.			"

												There's an answer of great playing if you don't pretend your own mirror to the others.Well, the first sentence is about general behaviour when playing. What about my overall recommendation of Left 4 Dead? Let's remind some convenient facts about the game:1. Left 4 Dead and all its software was not created to judge players or annoy people by amoral playing. Although we have our own rules and expectations, we should not pretend bad or unpleasant habits, that may be gain from another players or from our personal skills.2. Left 4 Dead is a co-op game and the players should help each other in their team, no matter the level they are. Feeling of completed competition or game is very appreciated and everybody can do. Realize its right intention and have a good experience of playing.3. Left 4 Dead was a game made for everyone, so it means that even 18- people can buy it and play it. What I'm not satisfied with - almost every person under 18, or let me say - a child, doesn't know all the useful tactics or hasn't learned them yet. I recommend team-playing.4. Left 4 Dead should be a competitive game, and it really is. Although, the players are not so competitive, or they don't think properly when playing. This is the main reason for mistakes and unpleasant fails. But to have a fun is also not so bad.5. And the last important thing to write about is, my closest, making a progress in game by yourself. Well, having your achievements done day by day is good, but the biggest award is given by playing itself. As the days went on, I felt myself stronger and happier.Don't forget to enjoy your game, no matter which one it is...Thank you for reading.Pro 'Yester(Matúš)			"

												I'm only recommending this if you have played L4D2 already, if you haven't played/bought that, please buy L4D2 rather than L4D1 since they cost the same amount anyway.Anyway, ever since when the campaigns from L4D1 got ported to L4D2, this game got more and more less played. For a reason, it's more enjoyable though to play a single game as a party with campaigns from two games, rather than always switch between 2 games if you want to play different campaigns.Campaigns itself and the whole scenario in L4D1 are better though, probably they aren't really that much different from what they are in L4D2 though to some people, so in case if you don't already see any difference between them yourself, you should just stick to the sequel.The versus game on this one has more idea than in L4D2, since on L4D2 you just run to the safe room and that's it, with this you all have to maintain your health as good too rather than crawl to the safe room as a group.Still, with that there's the one problem you would notice if you have played both games, there's half of the special infected that you can use in versus since there are more added zombies in the sequel. It's kind of like a preference if you don't like Chargers, Jockeys or Spitters, but I would find 2 Hunters, Smokers or Boomers a bit unfair altogether.There are some things that you might miss from L4D2, like special weapons or throwables, or even some of the gamemodes. Making mostly only the Campaigns the core of this game, which it mostly is though of course. I don't think you would be able to get more than 4 people to get to play this in these days anyway now.This is still a great game though, but I don't see any reason to spend money on this for the story, since as said, all the same campaigns are already in L4D2. There's even more story between The Sacrifice and The Passing than almost at any other part of the game and those both campaigns were added to L4D2 in the first place too.Only thing that this has what L4D2 doesn't, is a one survival map. So if you're dying to get that, feel free to spend 20€ to get that rather than to search a custom map file for it somewhere for L4D2.			"

Ну  и  как  сказал  давно  уже   лет 500 назад :)   всегда  буду  поддерживать  эту  игру, того  кто  недаёт  игре  загнуться  ,  тех  кто  играет  в  чистый  лефт           При  входе  в  игру  всегда  делай  так-   ,,Привет)),,       при  выходе  -  ,, спасибо  за  игру)) ,,      .

Наверное  поэтому чаще  приходится  в  играх  говорить  ,,привет)),,  вместо  ,,удачи,,     .  и   напрощание   - ,, спс  за  игру,, вместо  того ,чтоб  с  грустью промолчать(     вот  ща  инф  для  про-про поймут			"

This is what the end result of it is: A story of four characters making their way from point A to B without dying(hopefully) and survive.As of right now, L4D 1 and 2 is kinda dead because I can barely find a game with randoms playing(you'll be lucky if you even find one random game going on - I guess it could be the time of day), but if you got friends already playing or don't mind giving it a run for old times sake or whatever, then this is a great zombie killing and escaping exerpeince(especially with surround sound)!================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD displayPlayed on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro | Win7 x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												Well,let me review this great game.Is from 2008,which i like older games.There is 4 protagonists that they need to survive a zombie apocalypse.Bill:An old man which was in military.Francis:A biker.Louis:A polite and positive man which was worked in a IT programs before the zombie apocalypse.Zoey:A 18-19 years old women which she was in a university,which at her home she has seeing how his parents become zombies but she was saved by Bill.Dramatic soundtrack which shows that the game is sad.Versus:In this mode you can play first as Survivor or an Special Infected.(I prefer to play with my friends instead of random players)Survival:Frsutation on this mode,seriousily.Campagin:You can play with bots or with friends.Achievements:Is hardly most of achievements with bots or random players only,i require to get with friends.Difficulty:If you are a begginer to zombie games i recommended to play on easy or normal difficulty.If you know zombies games very well you can try Advanced and Expert.On Expert i can say the nickname of mode:Hell difficulty because a normal zombie can deal 10-20 damage per hit and you can die very easy,mostly if a horde is on your way.And Special Infected,yes you heard Special Infected which they can put you down in 5 seconds if you are not careful.Smoker:A guy that smokes a lot before he was zombie and like to drag Bill mostly.Boomer:A guy that was eating a lot before the apocalypse and he can vomit on you,Euchhh.Hunter:A guy which was a parkour guy before the apocalypse and he likes to pounce Zoey mostly and he is boyfriend with the Witch.Tank:He is Chuck Norris zombie version.Witch:She cries,a LOT,she can kill you very easy on Expert mode.NOTE:Some of the words was a jockey,uh i mean joke.I wish this is more played because it was simply unfair,after the release in 8-9 months was released L4D2,i dont have problem with the sequel but is unfair in my opinion.Final note:9/10			"

												Left 4 Dead will be forever in my heart. It is such a shame that this game didn't get so much attention as counter strike for example. I have edited this review because the old one didn't describe the game much. So here we go...Left 4 Dead is a zombie themed cooperative, multiplayer game. It has its faults/bugs, but its just because Valve did not pay much attention to it aaaand it also has few game modes:- survival, campaign, versusIf there were some new players coming (which is highly unlikely), id say: ""have fun, go to campaign mode, try out survival and play some versus. All of these are best played using ... no not an xbox controller :D ... your friends! Campaign is just something you are going to walkthrough and never play again. I used to play it with my friends for races (whoever gets 1st to safehouse gets points etc...) Survival is great if you are the type of player who's looking for challange or wants to break some kind of records. It might be totally boring for many many players around...The main thing what makes Left 4 Dead the ultimate and unforgetable game to me, is the versus mode. Spent many hours playing and the only regret is that I did not get into this game earlier when the player base was bigger (I dont even think there is one nowdays).4v4 co-op, 4 survivors vs 4 special zombies, its not only about how good you are at shooting zombies, its about cooperation as survivors as well as the zombies and tactics... Yeah okay not while playing public games haha.But the thing I wanted to say is, that this game had so BIG potential for a competitive scene! But I think its too much for Valve to run Counter Strike and something else next to it.score: 10/10old review here:If you like teamplay, cooperation with others, action and zombies, you will totally love this game. It will be maybe difficult to get used to it and to learn things... but if you're going to listen to more experienced players, there is a huge chance that you'll discover the secret of this game... best coop ever... trust me			"

												To me, this game is the staple to all zombie-shooters. It's easy to learn and play, takes tons of practice to master but suits difficulty for everyone.It's insanely addictive and co-op with friends or even just random people is a refreshing experience and a great way to make friends to play along with in later games.Keep an eye and ear out for the special infected, tanks and witches. They will definitely test your ability to work with your teammates and make you feel truly rewarded when you kill them.Worth every cent.			"

												Don't let my small time listed here mean anything. I've mainly played it through the Left 4 Dead 2 interface. That being said, if you are an achievement hunter, don't do that. The achievements don't unlock for this game if you play it that way. When this game came out in 2008 it was a breathe of fresh air. A Co-op zombie FPS for a genre that really didn't have many Co-op games at the time. While I'm not a fan of FPS that don't offer ADS, this was a really challening game, especially on the harder levels. Randomly spraying and praying could get you booted out of a game because hitting your teammates could kill them. Another breathe of fresh air from other FPS where you generally could not harm your teammates gave this game a bit of realism. And since I'm posting this review in 2017 you may ask why bother buying this game now, well because of the extensive modding community and the fact that the graphics still stand up well today almost 10 years later. If you have a group of friends and want a game you can play with each other every week, this is a great game to choose. I highly recommend.			"

Left 4 Dead was one of the first online co-op games that I played during my console gamer days. I played with a good group of friends, which we played casually and competitively. The versus mode is incredibly fun, with each 'class' feeling like a unique experience of play. The weapons are simple and different enough to each play their own role. Level-design is brilliant and well-structured. Another good example of game design.			"

Posted: January 10, 2015
												I highly recommend this game to fans of co-op games. Even though Left 4 Dead 2 is technically better, the original still manages to be a pretty awesome game in it's own terms. The game is split up into a bunch of campaigns, each split into five chapters/levels (excluding two campaigns). The first four levels require a team of characters to progress to a safe house. Along the way, you encounter or are attacked/ambushed by hundreds of zombies, and while they are pretty to defeat, the sheer number of attacking enemies can be overwhelming. Teamwork is a key element when playing on normal difficulty or over. Adding to the enemies are a number of minibosses, which require different strategies to defeat. Some are pretty easy, while others keep you on your toes. The fifth and final level/chapter in the campaign is normally some kind of extraction from the area, which requires players to defend themsevles in a certain area for a set amount of time. It can get pretty intense.There are four characters to choose from before the start of the campaigns. There's a computer guy, a biker, a war veteran, and a college girl. There's not much of a difference with who you choose, it's more of a personal preferance. But even so, there's quite a bit of dialouge for each character, some for scripted events in the campaigns, and a ton of comments/quotes for player use during gameplay. This is useful for players who don't have a microphone during multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, there's an interesting versus mode, where some players play as the survivors, while the others take control of the game's minibosses. And not to mention a survival mode.The graphics are pretty good. Even though this game is from 2009, it still holds up in today's standards. Lighting and flashlight mechanics are impressive. Textures are mostly high quality. Depending on your rig, the game maintains a good-maximum framerate, even when you have thirty zombies running around in your field of vision. I was surprised that the game ran so well, since I have a pretty bad graphics card for gaming. I managed to put almost all settings to max. On the negative side, I see black spots like a radius around fire ingame, although I'm sure it's just my graphics card (Intel 3000 integrated).All in all, I think this a great game. I myself play mainly solo, but this is certainly best played coopertatively. Worth the money. 9/10. "

												To me, this game is the staple to all zombie-shooters. It's easy to learn and play, takes tons of practice to master but suits difficulty for everyone.It's insanely addictive and co-op with friends or even just random people is a refreshing experience and a great way to make friends to play along with in later games.Keep an eye and ear out for the special infected, tanks and witches. They will definitely test your ability to work with your teammates and make you feel truly rewarded when you kill them.Worth every cent.			"

												The inclusion of Spitters proved a nice challenge.  I am pretty new to the Left 4 Dead franchise, but I gotta say, I love what I've seen (L4D, and L4D2).  For the most part, the online community is great, as well.  Seem to be welcoming to new players, and hepful when possible.Anything with the words ""Left 4 Dead"" in the title is now my favorite game!To the Developers, Writers, and the rest of the Staffers involved:  ""Thanks for everything!!!

												Well, I'll get right to it.This game is the best one of the two games in the series as of right now.Things it has that L4D2 does not:+ambiance+mood+color scheme+animations+hunter mechanics - bhopping the hunter, rooftop access in almost all areas, etc.+minimal hud elementsAll of these go together to make L4D1 a much more 'crisp' feeling environment.Things about the game I don't like:  (Bear in mind not many of these are the game's fault - and most of these issues fall right on Valve)- Lack of support from the developers, as it seems mainly, to pun, ""left for dead"" in sake of the sequel by Valve. I mean the game doesn't even have trading cards and early access titles on steam that are purchasable Alpha-stage games DO. What's that say? - Also, no steam workshop.- There are a number of exploits in the first game that are left totally unchecked by the default game developers - such as crouch glitching a hunter in versus off of a collision-enabled object such as a moveable car [punchable]. (too many to list here)- No competitive mode ever instated in the game: I.E. a rebalancing mode that would work much like the Rotoblin sourcemod plugin - removing tier 2 weaponry or limiting them, as well as items and health items.- No SOURCETV or HLTV equivalent!!!- Extremely locked-down engine, with SO many commands being set to literally ""DEVONLY"" tags in the source code itself - making them invisible inside the engine without removing the ""DEVONLY"" tags or using Sourcemod.- No easy or simple way to remove all of the elements of the hud visually [Ilncluding visual recoil] during demo recording, for good smooths, for stable recording that feels more 'camera-like', as POV demos can be somewhat messy, and a cleaning up is always in order when cfging, and you must write a config to record them smoothly, ((and while this is nice of them as a company to let us use the developer console, this is the best kind of game in that arena, and Valve has always held steadfast to that for their older games)); meant solely to increase the popularity of their games that much more.  :/ Come on its a glorification for a fan to dedicate some of their time on earth to the personal creation of something like that, and when done right they are very entertaining.

												Left 4 Dead will be forever in my heart. It is such a shame that this game didn't get so much attention as counter strike for example. I have edited this review because the old one didn't describe the game much. So here we go...Left 4 Dead is a zombie themed cooperative, multiplayer game. It has its faults/bugs, but its just because Valve did not pay much attention to it aaaand it also has few game modes:- survival, campaign, versusIf there were some new players coming (which is highly unlikely), id say: ""have fun, go to campaign mode, try out survival and play some versus. All of these are best played using ... no not an xbox controller :D ... your friends! Campaign is just something you are going to walkthrough and never play again. I used to play it with my friends for races (whoever gets 1st to safehouse gets points etc...) Survival is great if you are the type of player who's looking for challange or wants to break some kind of records. It might be totally boring for many many players around...The main thing what makes Left 4 Dead the ultimate and unforgetable game to me, is the versus mode. Spent many hours playing and the only regret is that I did not get into this game earlier when the player base was bigger (I dont even think there is one nowdays).4v4 co-op, 4 survivors vs 4 special zombies, its not only about how good you are at shooting zombies, its about cooperation as survivors as well as the zombies and tactics... Yeah okay not while playing public games haha.But the thing I wanted to say is, that this game had so BIG potential for a competitive scene! But I think its too much for Valve to run Counter Strike and something else next to it.score: 10/10old review here:If you like teamplay, cooperation with others, action and zombies, you will totally love this game. It will be maybe difficult to get used to it and to learn things... but if you're going to listen to more experienced players, there is a huge chance that you'll discover the secret of this game... best coop ever... trust me			"

Left 4 Dead was one of the first online co-op games that I played during my console gamer days. I played with a good group of friends, which we played casually and competitively. The versus mode is incredibly fun, with each 'class' feeling like a unique experience of play. The weapons are simple and different enough to each play their own role. Level-design is brilliant and well-structured. Another good example of game design.			"

												Don't let my small time listed here mean anything. I've mainly played it through the Left 4 Dead 2 interface. That being said, if you are an achievement hunter, don't do that. The achievements don't unlock for this game if you play it that way. When this game came out in 2008 it was a breathe of fresh air. A Co-op zombie FPS for a genre that really didn't have many Co-op games at the time. While I'm not a fan of FPS that don't offer ADS, this was a really challening game, especially on the harder levels. Randomly spraying and praying could get you booted out of a game because hitting your teammates could kill them. Another breathe of fresh air from other FPS where you generally could not harm your teammates gave this game a bit of realism. And since I'm posting this review in 2017 you may ask why bother buying this game now, well because of the extensive modding community and the fact that the graphics still stand up well today almost 10 years later. If you have a group of friends and want a game you can play with each other every week, this is a great game to choose. I highly recommend.			"

												One of the most fun games around, Left 4 Dead offers an excellent (and often hilarious) multiplayer experience, especially the Versus mode. Very highly recommended (plus the online player base is fairly decent) and, by the way, 9.3 user rating on metacritic after 3000+ ratings. That's quite a testament to the quality of this game.Although I've rated it up, if you can afford Left 4 Dead 2, I suggest you buy that instead (actually it's the same price as L4D as of Feb 2015). The prequel has been completely superseded and by now, L4D2 contains all the campaigns that were there in L4D.			"

So buy that instead.Price : $19.99Recommended price: $9.99 or less. But you're better off buying the sequel unless you can't run it.My rating: 7 / 10 Great game. But Sequel does better.

												L4D is a nice game for shooting some zombies with three friends. It has special infected species and you can control them in multiplayer as well, which is awesome to see! In Single-Player, you still have a hard time as there will be hordes of zombies each 5min, that test your quality as a Saviour of teammates and as shooter of masses. Cool game, try it ;)			"

GameplayThe gameplay is absolutely flawless in this game! Everything is very smooth; and since the game uses a thing they call the ""AI Director"" each time you play a map the enemies will be in different locations. Making it enjoyable for a long time! I've been playing this game since 2009 when it came out and I have yet to be bored of this game unlike the second one.Player BaseThere aren't much people playing this game anymore sadly, since everyone has moved to L4D2. But the people who do have this game are usually very fun to play with. You do have your ""occasional"" child gamer or troll, but other than that most players are mature and fun to play with as stated before. Versus is usually dead while Survival and Campaigns usually always have at least a few servers joinable.ModsSince this IS a Valve game, mod support is here, it's a bit tricky but once you get the hang of it it's very easy. So no, unless you use an actual hack you can't get banned for using a mod on here. There's a few annoying modded servers on here as well. I find them annoying but I get some people would find them enjoyable, who knows?StoryThere isn't much of a story since Valve messed up the game when they acquired it from Turtle Rock (the original creators of L4D which people call the ""beta""). But the jokes of the survivors and great voice acting make up for it somewhat.ConclusionOverall if you're looking to kill some zombies, have a few laughs, and have a good time with friends; I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you want a bit more, like more guns, special infected, and gamemodes than try out L4D2. Me personality, I don't really care much for L4D2. But back to L4D1, the survivors are lovable, the special infected are great and not annoying (unlike L4D2, and the maps are very fun. Besides the fact that there's a whole bunch of custom maps you can download from the internet. So yes, I highly recommend this game and give it a solid; 9.5/10  "

Valve made a big step when they made L4D2 but L4D1 is still a great game to play.However, I would not suggest you buying this game without having other friends that have it, the servers are still up and there are still people playing this game.

												Left 4 Dead.  What can I say?  I'm finally atoning for past sins by FINALLY PURCHASING THIS GAME ON STEAM.  I've put countless hours into this game before buying it so don't mistake my mere number of hours logged on Steam for lack of time playing.  If you enjoy killing hordes of zombies that were once people with kids, families, wives, husbands, bakers, bankers, lawyers (I mean come on now, what kind of zombie would a lawyer be without ACTUALLY being a zombie?), this game is definitely for you.  Even for being about 10 years old this game is still a treat to play.Pros:+ The game has aged surprisingly well in the past 10 years.  Like wine, this game gets better with age+ graphically still pleasing on the eyes+ HORDES OF ZOMBIES+ ""The director"", an internal AI piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that sends an♥♥♥♥♥ton of zombies at you if it deems you haven't been in trouble for awhile+ Running gags in-game that each chapter of the campaign is its own little movie+ Is a little terrifying when you don't know what's going to happen+ co-op is always a plus and it comes from the days when LAN was still a thing+ surprises around every corner+ Teamwork is truly a thing in this game but remember it's not Killing Floor or KF2Cons:- for people who enoy ADS in their FPS games, there isn't any.  It's like UNLOVED in that aspect (personally I don't mind this)- the graphics HAVE AGED a little but they're not BAD, and in fact are still good (so not so much of a con)- the modest selection of weapons is a little bland but it's not a dealbreaker (pistols/dual wield pistols, shotgun, M16/M4, .22 hunting rifle)2008/2008: would play  10 year old game for hours on end to kill hordes of the undead.

Zoey is my favorite character, and the hunter is my favorite infected (You Can See by my profile picture =\).

												Can I get better recommendation to any game that I've played it 3764 times, spend in game more than 2600 hpurs in nearly three years?And this is only some basic facts that  cannot adequate describe my in-game feelings. Many times I've asked myself whati in this game is so adoictivelly immersive, that I've to spent so much time, allthough I posses more than 100 verg good games'Finally I can say that L4D is grounded on the deeply humanistic orientated and composed game I've ever personally meet. Even if you play it single, there are so good (and funny) dialogues that feel some kind of deeply socialised partnership. Actually, after few trials you somehow know that you are usual member of the ""apocalypticcy survibal crew"" . Additionally, every NPC has own style, personality, and recognizable value system, belief and precipously portretet character. NPC-s are never boring, you'll not noticed any kind of fepetitioning sequence, even if I recognized appropriate sentence, because it is usually happened in a kind of new situation.Also, this game is somehow react on your way of playing, so sonmetimes you'll find a lot of unexpectzed situation - as you usuali have on higher level. In my opinion this is very good, because on that way game cannot become a kind of boring content.I warmly  recommend L4D to any gamer (not only to FPS lover, 'cause I'm personally NOT FPS lover...)), In my opinion, L4D1 is bacsed on deeply humanisticly oriented game, warm stoy of usual humans, who give us a hope, even that things go worse. Aččthough it seems to be uncorrest - but legitimate - previously written L4D1 recomendation CANNOT be used as a concept of L4D2 RECOMENDATION, but rather as very opposite. Just say onestly: L4D2  is deeply missing tragic atempt, basic on idea that something what is actuaslly perfect, can be renewed to be ""more"" perfect?			"

The Start of a Great Zombie Shooter SeriesThe game has turned a concept that has been done over time and time again, that is moving from section to section killing dozens of zombies, into endless hours of fun. The use of teamwork in this game is critical as the zombies come at you at what seems to be lightning speeds in the heat of moments. This game is definitely one to get for all zombie shooter fans. I would have to say the thrills of other well known zombie games such as the Call of Duty zombie modes....NotesAll the content that is in this version of Left 4 Dead is available in ""Left 4 Dead 2""			"

Yes, i love games with zombies and apocaliptic climate in background. It is a game for everyone who like zombies - Killing like and playing as them. U have 4 playable main characters, which u choose ? It's your decision !. On Versus mode u can play as zombies. U have 5 zombie ""Bosses"" which 4 are playable. 3 are random everyime and 1 - Called Tank - choosed for any player in infected team. All is random.Then now i choose good and bad atributes of L4D.Good Sites:+Great climate.+Best Multiplayer Mode focused on teamplay.+Two sites in Multi.+ZOMBIES !.+Some effective weapons.+AI are good.+Play with friends !.+Much Campaigns, u can download more if u want.Bad Sites:-Not much weapons.-Some bugs.-Not open world. U just have to go from 1 point to 2nd point...-Valve forgot about it some time ago, and do not want make any patches / Bux fixes for it anymore.I look on hours played too.

												Time and time again, I can always go back and have a good time either by myself or with friends. Understandably frightening and scary for some given the theme and spooky level designs, it is always amusing for me. Left 4 Dead established the norm for zombie shooter games and really made something special. It is the kind of game that can leave you with some great memories, especially if you play with friends. I know I still reminice with my friends of some of the great games we played together. A staple game to be part of any PC gamer's collection.			"

												A game which puts you in a fast paced zombie apocalypse, where teamwork is essential and mindless actions often result in tragic consequences. This game is a timeless classic and probably the best example of how a co-op shooter should work.  As a team you are really dependent on your team to progress forward  –  this is extremely true in Versus mode in which botched planning or a disorganized team can result in death. But when it all does go all wrong it’s a hell of a laugh and in the end that’s what this game is, it’s you trying to survive a zombie apocalypse with your somewhat incompetent friends helping you.  Definitely worth playing and should be on any person’s steam list			"

												Classic ""can't put down."" If I'm going to recommend why you should play Left 4 Dead, I have to convince you right here, right now why it is better than Left 4 Dead 2. I'll do that by making comparisons.Left 4 Dead is the nostalgic zombie game of the twenty-first century.Mod friendly and complete capability for customization of game play.There's an ambiance in the original L4D which you can not find in the first.I've had 700 hours of gameplay in both games and I can tell you the AI director is different in both games.  Let us say the AI director in Left 4 Dead is GOD. In Left 4 Dead 2, the AI director is GORDON RAMSAY.Let me say there is nothing wrong with the Introduction of new infected. However, the Jockey and the Charger exaggerate a new issue in L4D2: spawn location. pawning infected in checked rooms, cleared areas, is one thing. However, spawning special infected in a checked room/closet/space right after leaving that space makes no sense. If that is supposed to make the game more challenging, it is a very lazy way of doing so.  Let alone add two new infected that have an extremely fast gap closer, spawning them in the closet you just closed based on a rule of ""20 feet"" or so is not fun. In Left 4 Dead 1, Spawns for infected started at a distance and because of clever level design, were able to move in and sneak up. Spawning right on top of your location is not clever or sneaky. It is annoying. That is how left 4 Dead 2 works. Wherever you are, the zombies are. The zombies spawn based on your location, instead of being apart of the ambiance.With that said, I will briefly summarize the pro's and cons of each game right here so you can choose what you want for yourself. Keep in mind what I am about to tell you are facts. Writing reviews based on opinion is as pointless.Left 4 Dead Pros: 1. Ambiance2. Pace (Zombie spawning)3. Difficulty4. Streamlined (complete game)5. Mod Friendly6. Can see your own feet.7. Easy hosting and server set upCons:1. Need for new infected role (Spitter, NOT charger or jockey)2. Need for new Gameplay Mechanics and guns (Adrenaline, grenade launcher)3. Community player base demolished since release of sequel.Left 4 Dead 2 Pros:1. Great Versus Mode2. Very Mod Friendly3. New Infected Roles change game dynamics4. Large Community Playerbase5. New, exciting game modes6. More jokesCons:1. Horrible AI spawns and game pacing2. Lack of Ambiance3. Sometime too difficult because of bad spawning4. Can't see your own feet5. Difficult server set up, local servers limited6. Large number of unusual behaviors by zombies coined as ""random, planned.""			"

												Left 4 dead is the best part of shooters aout zombies. Plot of the game, zombiez, special infected, heroes and sound make Left 4 dead better, more colourful, moving, interesting. If You want to relax, just swith on Your computer and kill zombies. Left 4 dead is the best co-operative game. You can play it with Your friends. I will put this game 10/10.

Well Half-Life is great too but nothing beats palying LFD with friends and blasting zombies. An unbelievably full and rich gaming experience that will have you learning, trying, and doing more things in a video game for years and years. Never will you get tired of this one. 10 stars way up!			"

												Left 4 Dead is a spectacular first person cooperative shooter, and it's largely given rise to the massive coop and party game focused generation we have right now. Before Left 4 Dead the only major coop exclusive games were mods like Sven Co-OpHowever, as much as I liked Left 4 Dead it was an imperfect game that was only improved upon gradually through patches and DLC. One of the features that makes Left 4 Dead and it's successor interesting is the AI Director. Valve must have realized Left 4 Dead would be exclusively a rental unless they spiced things up to the player. What the AI Director does is decide where zombies and items in the world are depending on the player's progress and how well they work together. Every time you play the game it is completely different, especially depending on who you play with.The biggest factor to buying Left 4 Dead is wether or not to purchase the second instead. I believe the campaigns from L4D1 have already been ported to L4D2. As a result Left 4 Dead remains just a curious bit of history and only a purchase if your not a big fan of Valve's big budget changes with L4D2.			"

												Left 4 Dead offers the best zombie fighting experience I've had gaming and with great play functionality allowing gamers from all walks of life to start playing without experience. The more casual gamers may sadly get tired of the repetitiveness that zombie killing produces even with several campaigns on offer. Online multiplayer does however offer fun extras to the game as does the variety of zombies included in the storymode. And who doesn't love a great zombie slayer game?8/10Pros/Cons+ A good variety of zombies (provided by the ""specials"") and the multiplayer mode mixes up gameplay.+ The decent graphics and well integrated audio make for a well-rounded gaming experience.+ Killing zombies  is a hugely fun novelty compared to most of the modern FPS games of today.+ Smooth game mechanics with a brilliant pick-up and play style make this an excellent game for all. - There is no doubt a lack of content given that this game relies on replaying the campaigns.- Even the different campaigns get slightly repetitive as you play them through for the first time.

												This is another game that I have played hundreds if not thousands of hours on, I played them on Xbox so I was glad I got the chance to play some Left 4 Dead again on pc this time. All the stuff you love is there, the co-op the zombies, the survival, the versus, and now that I am playing on pc, there are mods! Sadly something else also remains the same, votekick abuse. It is a real issue I assure you, there are far to many random kicks, but I will say this. Can you imagine how bad things would be without it? Either way its great to see the game again after so many years of playing. One thing I can say for certain is that it was a good port for xbox, its a great pc game, one of the best co-op games and an amazing addition to your library.			"

												It's pretty much dead at this point, which is unfortunate. It seems most L4D fans have moved onto l4d2, especially considering that one has all of the original maps. This is my second favorite steam game of all time, the first game I bought on steam. I don't recommend you buy it at this point, though, as the player base at this point seems pretty dead, especially in comparsion to l4d2.5/5			"

												Left 4 Dead is a zombie-themed cooperative (or competive) team FPS made by Valve and Turtle Rock Studios, released in 2008 for PC. You play as one of the four survivors who have to get from point A to point B, while defending themselves from hordes of 'fast' zombies and search corners for supplies. Or you can play as special infected too, in more competive mode. Don't mind ""Game of the Year Edition"" over the banner, it's just there for coolness, not some complete edition. It did have three ""free DLC"" / big updates that added survival mode, Crash Cource and Sacrifice campaign since it came out.Multiplayer community is still quiet alive, even though most moved over to Left 4 Dead 2. You will not always find exactly what you want, but you will still find some people playing the game. Aside from Survival mode, that part is empty, everybody was overrun by zombies it seems.And well, it's a pretty great game. It got great setting, with a great atmosphere of always being set at night. With four likable characters. Simple yet deep gameplay. It is simple compared to L4D2, you don't have much choice, variations, in weapons for example. Feels more refined too. Somehow I dig it more. It even has two grenade types, which are actually useful and tactical in this horde based game.The best thing about it is AI Director. In other words, it's a system that keeps track of players ""stress level"" and then would change position of items, zombies and other small changes. It's quiet clever in that it both serves as randomizer and also follows general rules of pacing. No, it's quite predictable. Moment of rushing zombies and wandering zombies change around, when it gets quiet that it means that something heavy is coming or that you barely survived previous challenge. And that it doesn't spawn zombies so good, so in Versus modes people just rush forward.And while it's predictable, the different pacing still makes it much more addictive. The question is not what, but how soon and when.But there is one thing which would make it hard to decide if to recommend it or not. All the campaigns ended up being included in L4D2! Not only that, but they were expanded with all the new stuff that L4D2 added. Weapons, special infected types. Not only that, but if you want more original experience, then you can run the mutator that limits content back to L4D1. Though it's a bit uneven. But still.The only different things would be nitpick, like some slight level alternation, or not being able to see your body when moving camera down, or if you hate watching flying gibs from explosion for some reason.And well, most people should just purchase L4D2 instead, as it has all that L4D1 got. The first one still has it's own appeal, to be honest, in small changes. Very small differences. But eh, leave it to purists of sorts. Otherwise, if you are core gamer of sorts, then buy it, It's awesome game by itself.			"

												Left 4 Dead is a 4-player co-op survival FPS set in a world full of infected that crave your flesh.You play as either Zoey, Bill, Francis, or Louis (depending on who you choose to play as) and with your friends (online) orNPCs (if being played offline) along with you on your side, plowing through hordes of the infected whilst trying to reach the safehouse. The final level of each chapter has you escaping in a vehicle of some sort. Each chapter usually contains 4 levels. The game contains 9 chapters.  This is how the main game mode is played.But besides killing common, there exist other dreaded creatures....The special infected! Unlike the common infected, these guys have their own unique abilities. The Smoker, a tall slender infected with a long tongue that's ready to grab you!The Boomer, a bloated ball of puss, ready to puke on you! Which attracts a horde of infected, so don't get too close!The Hunter, a hooded covert that pounces and mercilessly claws through your flesh! You'll know when he's near, once you hear his dreaded growl.The Witch, a sobbing woman that gets enraged when you get to close! Keep your distance, or else she'll shear you into pieces!And the worst of all.... The Tank!A giant mass of muscle and speed, ready to smack you to Timbuk2! Killing him usually requires a group effort!But besides killing infected until you reach the safehouse, other fun modes exist! Other game modes, such as Infected, has you either play on a team of survivors or special infected, all being controlled by live players, duking it out until one team has been completely wiped out. Survival mode is a horde mode where you and others fight through countless waves of infected, the goal is to survive as long as you possibly can! This is an online game mode as well, but it's possible to play this one offline. Even though this game was released 6 1/2 years ago, it holds up extremely well! This is a title that you shouldn't pass up on!			"

A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends / family / homeless / Your Pets.I am happy to Recommend this game that i been playing for over 7.0 years now as of 03-07-2017.I'm at 2,543Hrs on record as of 03-07-2017 and i still love it.Left for dead 1 / Left for dead 2 are not better than each other what it comes down too is what one you love more because of that , I recommend you buy both and see which one you Truely will love and you should spend at least 1K+ hours in Each before you Judge them(at least 250+ hours in single player mode & 500+ hours in VS Mode & 250+ Hours in Others) You should spend these hours in-game with friends not just idle it / playing with bad teammates.You will learn that in the end both games are great to play with others , with that said its a good idea to make some good friends to play with and join them when playing both games.what i learn after playing this for over 7 yearsThe Tank gets mad because the group farted in his food and messed with him why he is with his girlfriend but in the end the group remembers the tank just Wants a Hug.The Hunter wants Zoey because she mooned him because they both enjoyed it.The smoker wants bill for his beard & smoking habit because he loves it.The Boomer wants Francis because  the boomer wants his coat so he can sell it on ebay to buy stuff to help him lose weight.The witch wants Louis but he rejects her for being a cry baby about his flaming farting in bed "

												 When it comes to the question ""Which is better? L4D or L4D2?"" I will say every single time Left 4 Dead is better. The game looks better, it plays and feels better. It's also harder than L4D2 and has some gameplay features that is not in L4D2 that makes it harder. For example, Tanks that are on fire in L4D become much faster and can completely murder you're entire team, where as in L4D2, there is no increase in speed. It is of my own opinion also that I think L4D2 just feels more like an arcade game where you can just rush through the campagin. No challenge, not hard at all unless you're playing a modded map that is solely created TO be hard as it possibly can. Now if you looked at how many hours I have on L4D2 and think I am a hypocrite, then I ask you to stop right there and pull the head that is yours out of you're♥♥♥♥♥ I've quit L4D2 many times because of how sick I've gotten of the player base(trolls and teamkillers) but I've gone back because of the mods. I know people buy L4D2 over L4D because it has all of the maps, characters and special infected and weapons and other content, but then they're introduced to the world of L4D2s literal ♥♥♥♥ing hive of teamkillers and trolls. Yes there are griefers in L4D1 but not NEARLY as much as there is in L4D2. So to the question of ""Which is better? L4D or L4D2?"" Left 4 Dead is the answer, it'll always be the answer.			"

												Watch out for the Incredible Purple Hulk (you’ll see what I mean!)Play L4D at your peril! This game is completely addictive – at least it is for me. Shooting zombies is just so much fun, especially when it’s made possible by such a well-crafted game. The premise is very simple: you and three fellow survivors have to make your way from one safe house to another until you are finally rescued. Along the way you have to fight off hordes of slavering zombies. In single player mode the AI is pretty good, although your teammates don’t always behave as you might wish them to during the incredibly hectic campaign finales. There are 4 campaigns with 5 maps to each one. Replay value is good due to the fact that the AI changes the zombie attacks and spawn points with each play, so you never know where the horde is going to come flooding from or where the bosses are lurking. When you get bored with the maps supplied there are loads of 3rd party maps and campaigns available on the web. On top of all this you can even play as one the various types of zombies (on a random basis). Personally I find this less satisfying, but it is worth a go just to get the other perspective. This is a simple but truly great game. L4D2 here I come!5/5			"

												I bought this game as part of the Summer sale (yeah, I know, a million years after everyone else.) my only previous experience with it was a friend brought it over on the Xbox once, I didn't do too well then either. Upon buying it, perhaps unwisely I jumped straight into a multiplayer campaign, to my (pleasent) surprise, I had a blast, the controls are well designed to the point where a tutorial is almost completely unnecessary, the atmosphere is extremely effective (to the point that whenever I was firing an assault rifle for any length of time I found myself almost involuntarily screaming ""SUPPRESSING FIIIIRE!"" until I was done or out of ammo. and the great thing about getting into this game late is, lots of people still play it, odds are you will end up on a team with far more experienced people, and as long as you can avoid accidentally shooting them (six times on the first level) you won't feel like you're slowing them down and, hopefully you'll get into the swing of things as I did and feel a valuable member of the team before the campaign is over.All in all, very fun game, there is definitely a reason that this still costs more than some other, more recent shooters I've seen			"

												Left 4 Dead is an amazing game. I am a lover of all things Valve, and a sucker for games that make you feel epic in every aspect possible, and this game delievered exactly these things. My interest in buying this game came from the Steam Halloween sales...I knew not much about it except for a pretty cool trailer I saw for it, and was also considering Killing Floor. I got both, and gotta say I love L4D over twice as much. I've never really played a multiplayer co-op before but this just took me by the balls and made them produce a cournucopia of ♥♥♥♥ due to the amazing factor. It brings together players easily and in very cool ways. CONSIDERING L4D2 OVER THIS?? Grab this one. The characters are so much more fun imo, and I think the hype of new weapons is unnecessary, as I have never felt a shortage or care of weapon diversity. And melee weapons are cool but more of an extra, and will kill you if you buy a game for that! Also L4D is very populated!! (My first impressions in comments)			"

												When I do finally fulfill my lifelong dream, I hope that instead of becoming fodder for Chuck Norris, I get to test my skills against the other greatest throw rag: Zombies. This game might well be the greatest tribute to the zombie horror genre. With memorable moments such as standoffs in levels that include holding up in a house that is being utterly swarmed to holding off said horde until the arrival of your rescue chopper, not to mention one of the greatest multiplayer systems to date. With all of these great qualities, it truly makes me wonder why we haven't just given in and let the zombie apocalypse happen.			"

												I remember playing Left 4 Dead on the 360 with my friends, and I'm glad I got back to the game again on PC. I can say that the experience is much fun on PC. But the game is fun on both platforms nonetheless; and it's more fun when playing with your friends. Because both games feel the same to me with the exception of some newly added features in the sequel, I can switch between this and Left 4 Dead 2 no problem; the difference being that the first is easier than the second.

												A game which puts you in a fast paced zombie apocalypse, where teamwork is essential and mindless actions often result in tragic consequences. This game is a timeless classic and probably the best example of how a co-op shooter should work.  As a team you are really dependent on your team to progress forward  –  this is extremely true in Versus mode in which botched planning or a disorganized team can result in death. But when it all does go all wrong it’s a hell of a laugh and in the end that’s what this game is, it’s you trying to survive a zombie apocalypse with your somewhat incompetent friends helping you.  Definitely worth playing and should be on any person’s steam list			"

												 When it comes to the question ""Which is better? L4D or L4D2?"" I will say every single time Left 4 Dead is better. The game looks better, it plays and feels better. It's also harder than L4D2 and has some gameplay features that is not in L4D2 that makes it harder. For example, Tanks that are on fire in L4D become much faster and can completely murder you're entire team, where as in L4D2, there is no increase in speed. It is of my own opinion also that I think L4D2 just feels more like an arcade game where you can just rush through the campagin. No challenge, not hard at all unless you're playing a modded map that is solely created TO be hard as it possibly can. Now if you looked at how many hours I have on L4D2 and think I am a hypocrite, then I ask you to stop right there and pull the head that is yours out of you're♥♥♥♥♥ I've quit L4D2 many times because of how sick I've gotten of the player base(trolls and teamkillers) but I've gone back because of the mods. I know people buy L4D2 over L4D because it has all of the maps, characters and special infected and weapons and other content, but then they're introduced to the world of L4D2s literal ♥♥♥♥ing hive of teamkillers and trolls. Yes there are griefers in L4D1 but not NEARLY as much as there is in L4D2. So to the question of ""Which is better? L4D or L4D2?"" Left 4 Dead is the answer, it'll always be the answer.			"

												Never has there been such a timeless classic with such a fitting name as this game, Left 4 Dead. In a game that revolutionized the emphasis on teamwork between players, watch as your teamates each play the hero and go on their own, inevitably having to be left for dead due to their foolish bravery. Cowardice prevails when the survivors are faced with a tank, when the aforementioned bravery is cast to the wind and instead of standing their ground and downing the tank before it can do any real damage, they choose to be divided and then conquered.Still better than L4D2!

												It's hard to recommend a primarily coop game that has such a small community, but I still give it a buy.You should still be able to find a game most of the time, there just is little selection in what game mode, difficulty, etc. due to the small player base. Personally, I prefer this to its successor, and perhaps that's just nostalgia from the days playing this on my 360 and having a blast with my friends. I do think the game has excellent campaigns and the atmosphere when you hear the music pick up and you know the horde is coming you get such an adrenaline rush that is rarely matched in video games.Pick it up if you can snag it on sale, it's well worth the sales price.

												For all fans of the zombie apocalypse this is worth more than a try.It's worth having.A variety of enemies (some are not really zombies per se but super enhanced mutations like the tank and the hunter)to fight against and die from.But at least you're not alone, misery loves company and there are four of you fighting and dying together.AI controlled buddies do a good job covering your♥♥♥♥♥and healing you.They are smart most of the time at least, but without them you don't survive for very long.Life in this game is a struggle or a fight to get from one safehouse to another, in a genuinelycreepy atmosphere.The graphics in this game really gives a good definition to the word ""Desolation"".Going thru deserted streets and buildings that remind you of a war torn scenario really adds to the game's flavor.The scenes are a work of art.Weapons and ammo are plentiful in supply so you don't have to go far being defenseless.This game is a good lesson in teamwork because without it you're dead in this apocalypticuniverse.This world is not for the rugged individualist.If you are the loner type then go to Dead Island but if you want to rely on others for yoursurvival then this is the place.The world of LFD.

												Here's a little story, one day I was just sitting down casually playing Left 4 Dead until I got into a lobby that had 2 elitists and 1 noob. 10 minutes into the gameplay, I accidently shot one of my teamates(one of the elitist) and I apologized for shooting him. In return, he kills me and spawn traps me continuously until he died. The level restarted and I brought it upon myself to get revenge. I killed him and both him and his butt buddy decided to kick me just for simply getting revenge. If you ever run into these type of people just report them and leave. Overall the game is pretty darn good. The community is ""eh"" it has good sports that don't get mad just because you accidently shoot them, and bad sports that get mad just because you accidently shot them once. I rate this game 8/10			"

												Left 4 Dead offers the best zombie fighting experience I've had gaming and with great play functionality allowing gamers from all walks of life to start playing without experience. The more casual gamers may sadly get tired of the repetitiveness that zombie killing produces even with several campaigns on offer. Online multiplayer does however offer fun extras to the game as does the variety of zombies included in the storymode. And who doesn't love a great zombie slayer game?8/10Pros/Cons+ A good variety of zombies (provided by the ""specials"") and the multiplayer mode mixes up gameplay.+ The decent graphics and well integrated audio make for a well-rounded gaming experience.+ Killing zombies  is a hugely fun novelty compared to most of the modern FPS games of today.+ Smooth game mechanics with a brilliant pick-up and play style make this an excellent game for all. - There is no doubt a lack of content given that this game relies on replaying the campaigns.- Even the different campaigns get slightly repetitive as you play them through for the first time.

												If you ever needed a game that combined friendly voice chat and blood curdling zombies it will always be Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.Left 4 Dead is a scientific marvel of what combines co-operative play with survival: If you are a Zombie fan and you like Zombie games but do not own this game... prepare to be shamed cos this game has probably beaten anything that game threw at you to try and ""scare"" you.  Sometimes you can be in total silence, nearing the safe room door. Not a zombie in sight, sweat glacing down your forehead: all you team-mates are down you're on your own and getting closer and closer and suddenly ""AAAAAARRRRRHHHH!"" and you pace yourself two steps back because a hunter just jumped on you.The game features an eerie soundtrack that can sometimes be laughable at times, it's a game you can sit down with and have a good laugh with anyone in your friends list (if they don't own the game there's bound to be someone still playing it to this very day).I love this game.

Still a great time with friends, but I emphasize WITH FRIENDS. Pairing up with other players randomly will only result in an awful experience where no one seems to know how to work together or even know what their objective is.

This game is about fun, fast-pased, intense action preferably with friends. The community isn't as bad as they say it is. I have met quite a few good people on here already and few bad ones. I think this game is great, especially on sale or something. A classic.			"

												Never has there been such a timeless classic with such a fitting name as this game, Left 4 Dead. In a game that revolutionized the emphasis on teamwork between players, watch as your teamates each play the hero and go on their own, inevitably having to be left for dead due to their foolish bravery. Cowardice prevails when the survivors are faced with a tank, when the aforementioned bravery is cast to the wind and instead of standing their ground and downing the tank before it can do any real damage, they choose to be divided and then conquered.Still better than L4D2!

												I don't know why the original is the same price as L4D2, but its still a pretty fun game. Going back to L4D1 really makes you appreciate how much extra detail they put into the sequel.There are no jockies so I'm obligated to actually like this one better.			"

												Top game:This game was a great steam even at its full price, which is around twenty dollars. It's a great game that I keep going back to on a regular basis, even though I have the second title in the series. This game mainly focuses on teamwork, which makes the experience even better. The AI is challenging and the weapon selection makes you adapt depending on what you like. A great game to play at any time, and if you have three friends in a LAN party, it's even better.			"

Posted: November 1, 2011
												Arguably the best FPS for its year.  L4D is one of those games that punishes you if you try to be a lone wolf and go out by yourself. In fact, one of the many strengths of this game is that you live or die by your team and the weakest teammate can even be a liability (because you're always saving them or they're not covering their corners or they're using all the team healing resources up). No matter how good you are at this game you can still get capped by a Special (i.e. something tougher than a zombie) and the only way to be saved is by one of your teammates. Additionally, it's almost impossible to do the finales by yourself (especially on any difficulties above normal) so, again, I like that the team is vital to the success of the mission. Weapon selections are tiered as you progress through the campaigns (which vary in length from half an hour to many hours, especially if you die and keep repeating chapters) and there are nice goodies to help you against the zombie hordes such as Molotov Cocktails, pipe bombs, gas cans, propane tanks, oxygen tanks but none of these matter much if you don't follow one of the cardinal rules of positioning yourself strategically. This is a game that also rewards you for positioning your team in the most strategic positions when you are attacked by random zombie hordes or at various chapter finales. In fact, if you aren't very good at protecting your teammates and putting your back to a solid wall when the hordes come, well, you probably shouldn't be playing on advanced difficulty and certainly not the unforgiving expert level. Healing resources are limited to health packs and pills and in the higher difficulties there's never enough. In fact, sometimes it makes sense to let a few teammates die so that the others can make it to the safe house chapter where everyone who died spawns for the next chapter. That way, you don't all have to die and repeat the chapter. If someone died soon enough in a particular chapter they respawn in one of the many closets up ahead but a teammate has to ""rescue"" you. Spawned characters start at moderate health and lose some of their resources, especially a favorite main weapon.But the real pleasure of this game is the multiplayer. In fact, if you don't MP your gaming experience may dwindle after a time. Yes, it's true that the director of this game changes elements even if you play the same campaign over and over with the bots but the dynamics of playing with real people and not just bots throws in so many variables. Weaker players will make the campaign harder and sometimes that can be fun. Stronger players will make it easier and they'll also show you tricks that you're unlikely to read in the cheat books. In fact, chances are good that you'll start to have favorites that you like to play with regularly and as you get to know your particular team better you will react better to them when they need help. Compare that to when you play with new people for the first time, even if you all have microphones for faster communication.  Other nice things about MP (at least, on Steam which is my experience) is that you can do different types of coop scenarios that fans have created.  They're free to download.  If you're tired of the same maps this can be a lot of fun.  Additionally, if you want something different they have survival games in which a group holds out for as long as possible but the real attraction, if you want something different, is the versus games. Each side takes turns playing the Specials and try to stop the other team from reaching the safe house. Victory points are all determined by how far the survivors have gotten, how much damage was inflicted on them, whether health packs were used or not and several other variables. Interestingly, people who are very good at coop games are usually not very good at versus games as its a totally different beast.SOME OF THE BAD/CRITICISMS: the AI, compared to L4D2, is sometimes slow to respond.  They don't always save you in time when they should and they won't always help you defend at unique positions during chapter finales; some argue a lack of melee weapons is a problem but I think it's not an issue and just makes it a different type of strategy game. In MP you can get some real low quality people showing up in the public rooms but a nice thing is that a majority of people in agreement can kick the bad player out of the game. Worse case scenario you just leave and look for another game.In closing this is an awesome game for FPS fans, especially if you want an action horror video game. Unlike a lot of other video games the achievements are unique and sometimes entertaining. A nice thing about them is that you get to show them off to your friends on Steam. These days I typically look to whether a particular player has achieved the expert status achievement.  If they have then I know they're likely going to be a tight player.BTW, playing this on Steam and other multiplayer sites make this a lot harder than your Xbox. A couple of friends who played it on the Xbox jumped on to Steam with me and couldn't even handle normal difficulty until they practiced some. Just a fair warning.MUSIC/SOUND:  A minus ; EASE OF CONTROLS/USES:  A minus to A  ; GRAPHICS FOR ITS YEAR: A;  DIALOGUE/VOICE ACTING/CHARACTERS: B to B plus (even though it's limited as to be expected for a FPS); ATMOSPHERE: A to A plus; REPLAY POTENTIAL Ato A plus (on MP);  GENRE: Horror Action Adventure; OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.

												Left 4 Dead has never ceased to be fun. Playing the game now it's clear it's aging. It's a great game that's just been made shallow by other newer co op experiences. Still a great time with friends, but I emphasize WITH FRIENDS. Pairing up with other players randomly will only result in an awful experience where no one seems to know how to work together or even know what their objective is. Save yourself the frustration and only play with friends.			"

												It's hard to recommend a primarily coop game that has such a small community, but I still give it a buy.You should still be able to find a game most of the time, there just is little selection in what game mode, difficulty, etc. due to the small player base. Personally, I prefer this to its successor, and perhaps that's just nostalgia from the days playing this on my 360 and having a blast with my friends. I do think the game has excellent campaigns and the atmosphere when you hear the music pick up and you know the horde is coming you get such an adrenaline rush that is rarely matched in video games.Pick it up if you can snag it on sale, it's well worth the sales price.

												For all fans of the zombie apocalypse this is worth more than a try.It's worth having.A variety of enemies (some are not really zombies per se but super enhanced mutations like the tank and the hunter)to fight against and die from.But at least you're not alone, misery loves company and there are four of you fighting and dying together.AI controlled buddies do a good job covering your♥♥♥♥♥and healing you.They are smart most of the time at least, but without them you don't survive for very long.Life in this game is a struggle or a fight to get from one safehouse to another, in a genuinelycreepy atmosphere.The graphics in this game really gives a good definition to the word ""Desolation"".Going thru deserted streets and buildings that remind you of a war torn scenario really adds to the game's flavor.The scenes are a work of art.Weapons and ammo are plentiful in supply so you don't have to go far being defenseless.This game is a good lesson in teamwork because without it you're dead in this apocalypticuniverse.This world is not for the rugged individualist.If you are the loner type then go to Dead Island but if you want to rely on others for yoursurvival then this is the place.The world of LFD.

												Here's a little story, one day I was just sitting down casually playing Left 4 Dead until I got into a lobby that had 2 elitists and 1 noob. 10 minutes into the gameplay, I accidently shot one of my teamates(one of the elitist) and I apologized for shooting him. In return, he kills me and spawn traps me continuously until he died. The level restarted and I brought it upon myself to get revenge. I killed him and both him and his butt buddy decided to kick me just for simply getting revenge. If you ever run into these type of people just report them and leave. Overall the game is pretty darn good. The community is ""eh"" it has good sports that don't get mad just because you accidently shoot them, and bad sports that get mad just because you accidently shot them once.

												The 2016 Steam Awards made me notice I still have to review the game that made me the gamer I am today. The game that started it all. That started my own personal experience with Steam. Come with me down memory lane, to a time when I only had this game in my library and I thought I was going to forget about Steam the day I was going to stop playing it. How wrong I was! Many games, friends, sleepless nights and gaming hours later I am still here. I cannot forget how this marked the beginning of an era and a personal milestone in virtual zombie bashing. A landmark actually. The first planck of the tree house I built (and keep upgrading) on the Steam tree.But enough with the metaphors already and back to the review! When achievements weren't there and detailed game statistics where yet to come (the gaming hours I have on record for this game are way less than the actual hours I spent playing it!) I had a lot of fun with L4D, becoming quickly addicted to it. It was a breakthrough experience in multiplayer and co-op. It was the game where to make friends and the versus mode is still one of my fav game modes ever.Yes, if you own Left 4 Dead 2 you can basically play all this game has to offer since all the campaigns have been ported over but the lack of Jockeys, Spitters and Chargers in the original game can still give you a different kind of experience. More cozy. So, if you don't have this game yet or if you spent many hours on Left 4 Dead 2 already and think you can pass on this, do yourself a favor and give it a try. Own a piece of Steam history!For me, it still is and it will always be a 10/10 game. Oh, the memories! And it surely has the ""Villain Most In Need of A Hug"" in it (Hint! Hint!).			"

												Great game, cancer community. Don't dare play this game unless you have at least two other friends or only want to play singleplayer. Everytime I've played a supposedly ""friends only"" match with only one other friend, our server will get hijacked by two others who will force our difficulty up all the way and kill us instantly basicly not allowing us to do anthing. Happened every time I played with only one other friend. Absolutely rediculous. 8/10 game 0/10 community.			"

												Whether you prefer to beat back the crazed hordes with your friends, total strangers, or AI Bots, there is always something challenging enough to keep you on your toes and continually checking your heart-rate in Left 4 Dead.All the elements of the game - the plot, design, music and of course, the characters' personalities and banter - come together to create a stunningly cinematic experience, and you'll quickly find yourself being drawn into the hellish shambles of the world it has created; even as paranoid as the higher difficulties can make you, it will still find a way to knock you off balance and leave you to get back to your feet before the next onslaught comes down upon you - but never to the extent where you'll be put off the game; indeed, said paranoia serve to draw you into the game even further.Intense, witty, action-packed, and made of handpicked, locally-grown organic Whoop♥♥♥♥♥ I highly recommend L4D.

												Overall, I would say this is a pretty solid game, and a great co op experience.But, there are problems. one thing that really sticks out to me is the AI for the other survivors in single player. The AI is so dumb that it makes expert difficulty almost impossible, and its not even that hard otherwise. the AI tend to stand out in the open, barely moving or dodging zombies, just spraying. this may not be a big deal on easier difficulties but it pretty much forces you to play co op if you want to do it on harder difficulties. BUT, no one plays this anymore. you wont find anymore matches. so you need to convince 3 friends to buy and play the game with you. which is a problem for me since... well, i dont have friends.Apart from that, this game is really fun. L4D2 is more fun and has more players, but i personally prefer the characters in this game.			"

												Left4Dead is a badass zombie game which has gotten many things right:+ The 4 characters to choose from effectively map the players preferences+ The choice of weapons forces you to choose a unique approach+ Whereas it's a good game in singelplayer, it shines in multiplayer. Gather a friend or two if you wanna get the most out of it.+ The helping/reviving system was a great idea+ The way the game gets tougher is well balanced+ It's almost an arena-type of game with almost secluded areas where you have to fight off a horde of enemies. Because of that I tried to do it Quake 3 style - constantly moving around and shooting left and right as I go. To my extreme pleasure it didn't work. Why's that a good thing? Because Quake 3 style is not realistic. If you wanna survive, you have to stick close to the other survivors and hold the fort. Every time I went berzerk I got quickly overwhelmed and ran down. + The urban environments look great and vary just enough.+ The arena approach offers good replay value+ I loved the balance between a horror game and an action shooterSome things I would have liked differently:- Only 6 types of zombies throughout the game. - The build up to encountering a Witch is one of the best I've seen in any video game. You can hear the cry from distance, then the frantic piano starts and the NPC's start to comment that there's a Witch somewhere. Such a good build-up for a tough battle, yet once you encounter her and she attacks, it's a short-lived gunfight. I so wished that the battle itself was times harder.- It's still an extremely primitive shooterVerdict:In it's simplicity it's an attractive game that gets the basics right. Because of that a brief but pure amusement is easy to achieve. It seems to be the kind of game that I will come back to every now and then. "

												""GAME OF RHE YEAR EDITION"". Эта строчка хорошо вписывается в игру, ибо я согласен с ней. Игра типа ""Беги, стреляй, зомбии!"". Да, мясо присутствует! Как и кровь. Но сюжет ""Добраться до безопасного места"" смущает, да. Ещё один минус: Мало типов зомби, но в следующей части игры это, слава Богу, исправили. Сетевая хорошая, ибо зомби можно играть. Краски игры подкачали, всё серое и неинтересное. Но задумка хорошая, как и графика... относительно. Френсис: ""Я ненавижу лестнцицы. Я ненавижу заправки. Я ненавижу зомби. Я ненавижу Луиса!!!"".

												Forever a must play...(All my own opinions/experiences/joys)As an avid fan of zombie games, I can honestly say this is the one I have enjoyed the most!Once you've got your sensitivity set, you're set to take on the hordes of seemingly endless zombies, alongside your three friends (don't take it personally when they shoot you in the back, they're probably just trying to shoot the zombie that's about to swipe at you). I highly recommend getting up to three other people on board that you can speak to via headset. I say this due to the fact (and you may be surprised how often this occurs) they may not realise that you've been pounced on by a hunter, pulled away by a smoker or thrown up on by a boomer (...thus resulting in being molested by a horde of horny zombies, that want to rip your clothes off) and you will end up typing things like “jyghk!!!11!” in the chat, just to be abandoned, angry, on the ground, bleeding out, shooting wildly into the crowd of gropers around you.So in short, get a headset... (And some friends)After getting into the swing of sticking together and (although you may hate it) helping out your teammates, picking them up when they go down and parting with your precious pills to prolong their lives, you will  become a pro. You'll be running the Expert level campaigns, crowning witches, burning tanks, sniping hunters in the face mid jump, generally winning at the game.Versus is another story... A lot of fun, however it's hard to find a normal server these days, so you'll be thrown into a 20 vs 20 game which is both hilariously fun and rage quittingly frustrating. So again, private games with friends trumps crazy hacker filled custom servers.From playing Left 4 Dead for nights on end on the Xbox 360 with my buddy (MrSneakyMan), listening to Rammstein in order to pump ourselves up to fight the horde, to finally downloading it on PC and pouring even more hours into it. I still keep coming back to this game, sometimes for a quick versus match, other times to replay entire campaigns with the strangers of the internet (yeah, you...).Just buy it... :)			"

												Left4Dead is a badass zombie game which has gotten many things right:+ The 4 characters to choose from effectively map the players preferences+ The choice of weapons forces you to choose a unique approach+ Whereas it's a good game in singelplayer, it shines in multiplayer. Gather a friend or two if you wanna get the most out of it.+ The helping/reviving system was a great idea+ The way the game gets tougher is well balanced+ It's almost an arena-type of game with almost secluded areas where you have to fight off a horde of enemies. Because of that I tried to do it Quake 3 style - constantly moving around and shooting left and right as I go. To my extreme pleasure it didn't work. Why's that a good thing? Because Quake 3 style is not realistic. If you wanna survive, you have to stick close to the other survivors and hold the fort. Every time I went berzerk I got quickly overwhelmed and ran down. + The urban environments look great and vary just enough.+ The arena approach offers good replay value+ I loved the balance between a horror game and an action shooterSome things I would have liked differently:- Only 6 types of zombies throughout the game. - The build up to encountering a Witch is one of the best I've seen in any video game. You can hear the cry from distance, then the frantic piano starts and the NPC's start to comment that there's a Witch somewhere. Such a good build-up for a tough battle, yet once you encounter her and she attacks, it's a short-lived gunfight. I so wished that the battle itself was times harder.- It's still an extremely primitive shooterVerdict:In it's simplicity it's an attractive game that gets the basics right. Because of that a brief but pure amusement is easy to achieve. It seems to be the kind of game that I will come back to every now and then. "

												I own both of the Left 4 dead games, and they'll both have a place in my heart. Yes, I know L4D2 has the content from this game now, but I like this one still for the atmosphere, and some other factors. Basically this one feels like more of a horror/shooter game to me. I haven't seen a online game going on, but trust me, its best to play with friends. Hopefully this game will bring you hours of fun and shootin' like it did for me!			"

												Left 4 Dead, one of MY personal favorites of all time, I played it on the xbox when it first came out back in 2008. It really was a milestone in FPS zombie shooters. It had characters that'd grow on you in a instant, a good setting, and good graphics at the time. I have had many good memories with this game. This is a MUST HAVE for any zombie buffs out there.

The original, and still the best game of the series Left for dead is still a great play, and while I liked L4D2 typically I always come back to first. The game really is at it's best with four friends working together. Co-op is at the heart of L4D, and it's greatest strength. What valve really nails is the simplicity of the game. There aren't many controls, items, or weapons. You know all you need to know in 5 minutes. But learning, and dealing with certain situations gets better with practice. The verse mode is great, troll your friends with one of the “special infected” zombies. Each with it's own special ability. L4D does a great job randomizing enemy spawn points, and mobs seem to trigger right when they should. The atmosphere, and music are on point for this type of game. The graphics can be scaled back, and I find you can run this on practically any PC (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine). The only drawback I find in the PC version is the lack of split screen co-op. This can be done with a command from the dev console, but I think valve should have put it in the menu like they did on Xbox 360. Here is a link if you want to play local split screen. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=745113If you haven't played this one yet and enjoy blasting Zombies with your friends, check it out.OLDER GAMER APPROVEDPOTATO PC CERTIFIED Visit our Currator Page "

												Overall, I would say this is a pretty solid game, and a great co op experience.But, there are problems. one thing that really sticks out to me is the AI for the other survivors in single player. The AI is so dumb that it makes expert difficulty almost impossible, and its not even that hard otherwise. the AI tend to stand out in the open, barely moving or dodging zombies, just spraying. this may not be a big deal on easier difficulties but it pretty much forces you to play co op if you want to do it on harder difficulties. BUT, no one plays this anymore. you wont find anymore matches. so you need to convince 3 friends to buy and play the game with you. which is a problem for me since... well, i dont have friends.Apart from that, this game is really fun. L4D2 is more fun and has more players, but i personally prefer the characters in this game.			"

												Forever a must play...(All my own opinions/experiences/joys)As an avid fan of zombie games, I can honestly say this is the one I have enjoyed the most!Once you've got your sensitivity set, you're set to take on the hordes of seemingly endless zombies, alongside your three friends (don't take it personally when they shoot you in the back, they're probably just trying to shoot the zombie that's about to swipe at you). I highly recommend getting up to three other people on board that you can speak to via headset. I say this due to the fact (and you may be surprised how often this occurs) they may not realise that you've been pounced on by a hunter, pulled away by a smoker or thrown up on by a boomer (...thus resulting in being molested by a horde of horny zombies, that want to rip your clothes off) and you will end up typing things like “jyghk!!!11!” in the chat, just to be abandoned, angry, on the ground, bleeding out, shooting wildly into the crowd of gropers around you.So in short, get a headset... (And some friends)After getting into the swing of sticking together and (although you may hate it) helping out your teammates, picking them up when they go down and parting with your precious pills to prolong their lives, you will  become a pro. You'll be running the Expert level campaigns, crowning witches, burning tanks, sniping hunters in the face mid jump, generally winning at the game.Versus is another story... A lot of fun, however it's hard to find a normal server these days, so you'll be thrown into a 20 vs 20 game which is both hilariously fun and rage quittingly frustrating. So again, private games with friends trumps crazy hacker filled custom servers.From playing Left 4 Dead for nights on end on the Xbox 360 with my buddy (MrSneakyMan), listening to Rammstein in order to pump ourselves up to fight the horde, to finally downloading it on PC and pouring even more hours into it. I still keep coming back to this game, sometimes for a quick versus match, other times to replay entire campaigns with the strangers of the internet (yeah, you...).Just buy it... :)			"

Its one of the best zombie fps games you can play as well as one of the best co-op games you can own, so don't hesitate because of its age, it's graphics are very good considering and it has full controller support too.

												The 2016 Steam Awards made me notice I still have to review the game that made me the gamer I am today. The game that started it all. That started my own personal experience with Steam. Come with me down memory lane, to a time when I only had this game in my library and I thought I was going to forget about Steam the day I was going to stop playing it. How wrong I was! Many games, friends, sleepless nights and gaming hours later I am still here. I cannot forget how this marked the beginning of an era and a personal milestone in virtual zombie bashing. A landmark actually. The first planck of the tree house I built (and keep upgrading) on the Steam tree.But enough with the metaphors already and back to the review! When achievements weren't there and detailed game statistics where yet to come (the gaming hours I have on record for this game are way less than the actual hours I spent playing it!) I had a lot of fun with L4D, becoming quickly addicted to it. It was a breakthrough experience in multiplayer and co-op. It was the game where to make friends and the versus mode is still one of my fav game modes ever.Yes, if you own Left 4 Dead 2 you can basically play all this game has to offer since all the campaigns have been ported over but the lack of Jockeys, Spitters and Chargers in the original game can still give you a different kind of experience. More cozy. So, if you don't have this game yet or if you spent many hours on Left 4 Dead 2 already and think you can pass on this, do yourself a favor and give it a try. Own a piece of Steam history!For me, it still is and it will always be a 10/10 game. Oh, the memories! And it surely has the ""Villain Most In Need of A Hug"" in it (Hint! Hint!).			"

Before getting this game on Steam; I have played the second game for a few hours at some friends' houses. I would recommend getting this game first to get you started. But I think if you already have the second game, or just really familiar with the series, don't get this game (unless you're a big fan of L4D.) Although the first game is really fun, it has less to offer than the second game.			"

The original, and still the best game of the series Left for dead is still a great play, and while I liked L4D2 typically I always come back to first. The game really is at it's best with four friends working together. Co-op is at the heart of L4D, and it's greatest strength. What valve really nails is the simplicity of the game. There aren't many controls, items, or weapons. You know all you need to know in 5 minutes. But learning, and dealing with certain situations gets better with practice. The verse mode is great, troll your friends with one of the “special infected” zombies. Each with it's own special ability. L4D does a great job randomizing enemy spawn points, and mobs seem to trigger right when they should. The atmosphere, and music are on point for this type of game. The graphics can be scaled back, and I find you can run this on practically any PC (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine). The only drawback I find in the PC version is the lack of split screen co-op. This can be done with a command from the dev console, but I think valve should have put it in the menu like they did on Xbox 360. Here is a link if you want to play local split screen. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=745113If you haven't played this one yet and enjoy blasting Zombies with your friends, check it out.OLDER GAMER APPROVEDPOTATO PC CERTIFIED Visit our Currator Page "

												Left 4 Dead, I'd say, was definitely a hit classic to bring Valve's infamy up through the charts - it most certainly did revitalize the zombie genre for games, which has been much needed for some time! While not like most general zombie games, it's something casual enough for any sort of video-game fan to pick up! It's very clean (minus the blood and guts) with its UI and very easy to get a handle on, yet its additional features can make it more difficult for any seasoned player! 7/10!			"

												I remember the days of playing this on console, trying to find groups of people to do the insanely annoying achievements and to complete expert.One of the best zombie games in existence, this fast and non stop zombie shooter faces you versus untold hordes of infected humans, once alive and like minded, they have succumb to a rage virus, destroying the minds of those infected.You play 1 of 4 survivors, immune to the rage virus for unknown reasons and must survive the thousands of mindless ""undead"" and the special infected, humans that have undergone odd and dangerous changes to their anatomy based on their past lifes. Many different gametypes and achievements will keep you busy, making you team up with like minded people to complete annoying and tough challenges. For all the achievement hunters out there, they will be a good collection.Solo play is also enjoyable, allowing you to just relax and kill zombies at your own pace.Steam approved sites and other third party websites have skins, maps, sounds and other mods that are perfectly fine and legal to use whenever you feel bored with the original game. Just stay away from the hacks, no one likes a dirty hacker.Personal Rating: 4/5			"

												Currently still the best co-operative FPS game in existence, in my opinion. It may look a little dated now, but the source engine still feels good to play in, and the game is just hard enough to remain a bit of a challenge unless you are really paying attention. It's a very limited content game, just 5 or so hour-long campaigns for co-op play, but somehow I'm still playing the game occasionally with the same guys 6 years after release. Unlike Borderlands, the guns actually feel like they are doing damage, the panic can be real and you need a decent strategy to beat the campaign finales. Unlike Left 4 Dead 2, it is not entirely random and a good, careful player can sometimes make it through the game with barely a scratch, giving a real sense of achievement.			"

												The game itself is addicting and terrific. The gamer community that plays it however, sucks as human beings. Very noob-unfriendly, and you can expect your angry teammates to either kill you, kick you within 5 minutes, or both. Or ridicule you and laugh as they watch you die, rather than come revive you. Seems to be about 70-80% of the players are a-holes, and take winning far too seriously. You do meet the occasional player who's actually fun to play with. Frankly, everyone pays to play. It sucks for noobs who are constantly kicked as it makes it harder for them to actually improve. Especially, because there are many times that there might only be one room in versus mode. That means if you get kicked from that lobby, you're SOL on getting anymore time in for a while.			"

												To put it in one sentence, L4D is a challenging FPS with great replayability and one of the best co-ops there are. Pros:-Clean graphics, smooth gameplay experience-Challenging AI-Co-op which really feels like co-op - acting as a team is crucial for completing the campaigns-Good replayability, each session is different even on the same map-Although there are only five kinds of enemies, they are dressed according to the environment, thus complementing the gameplay-Available add-on maps from the communityCons:-It's possible only to equip two weapons at the same time (option 1: a pistol/two pistols with infinite ammo; option 2: sniper rifle, assault rifle, shotgun, military shotgun or machine pistol with limited ammo)-Too often there are situations when zombies catch you by surprise (especially, smokers and hunters) - but's maybe it's just me being a noob-In order to have a better aim, you need to crouch and that's inconvenient-Friendly fire is a mandatory optionMy overall rating: 8/10			"

Left 4 DeadLeft 4 Dead is my ultimate favorite Zombie game! The story line keeps you playing, and the cinematics are amazing!!Being able to choose from 4 characters, Zoey is my favorite. Zombies come in all shapes and colors, having 5 main Zombies with special skills and one being incredibly creepy.. the Tank. It also has co-op campaign, so you and up to 3 of your friends can play together!			"

												► Game: Left 4 Dead► Genre: FPS, Action, Zombie-Apocalypse► Rating: ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ 5/5▲ Favorable Aspecps:After watching, in the past 6 years, all that ""boom"" of Zombie themed games, specially those where you blow they head off, I can easily assure you that Left 4 Dead, launched in 2008, was one of the biggest responsible for that exponential growth, if not the main responsible. The zombie theme wasn't new at the time, but it never had a solid oportunity at the gaming world, much less in a FPS game. Valve used their best at the time to create this game, and what is it that Valve can't create and automatically become a classic?Well, they did an excelent work again in this title, put extremely easy and soft controls, gave us hordes of zombies to kill, not only weak and rotten zombies, but special ones, with specific abilities, which guarantees different gamestyle, when you're trying to avoid them. Every character has it's own personality, line of words, thinking, and are at some point even funny to hear. For some, that may break some of the tension that the game can produce.Other huge step in the making of this game is the addition of the Cooperative mode, which is undeniable required to survive. Any effort will be useless if you don't have on your side some good mates to release you when get caught by some nasty infected, for example. There are also some other game modes like Versus (player vs player) and Survival (player vs time).Left 4 Dead is that kind of classic that can be played at any time, by any generation, and will always bring you that same joy and fun that you had when you played it by the first time. A real masterpiece. Without a doubt.▼ Negative Aspects: After giving that huge statement in favor of Left 4 Dead, it is hard to point out some minor imperfections, but they always exist. There are two things that I believe they could take better care on this game: the lack of weapons, by that I mean variety, there aren't many different guns to kill, specially melee. And the second is that they didn't launch a lot of official campaigns, or maps. Fortunately, L4D2 came out just one year later.► How much is it worth to pay: [●] Full Price [ ] 75% [ ] 50% or Less			"

												To put it in one sentence, L4D is a challenging FPS with great replayability and one of the best co-ops there are. Pros:-Clean graphics, smooth gameplay experience-Challenging AI-Co-op which really feels like co-op - acting as a team is crucial for completing the campaigns-Good replayability, each session is different even on the same map-Although there are only five kinds of enemies, they are dressed according to the environment, thus complementing the gameplay-Available add-on maps from the communityCons:-It's possible only to equip two weapons at the same time (option 1: a pistol/two pistols with infinite ammo; option 2: sniper rifle, assault rifle, shotgun, military shotgun or machine pistol with limited ammo)-Too often there are situations when zombies catch you by surprise (especially, smokers and hunters) - but's maybe it's just me being a noob-In order to have a better aim, you need to crouch and that's inconvenient-Friendly fire is a mandatory optionMy overall rating: 8/10			"

												Is it worth buying Left 4 dead or should you just buy Left 4 dead 2?Well, it all depends on what kind of person you are, and your personal preference.Know that Left 4 dead 2 has all of the maps that Left 4 dead has, as well as all its new maps. Left 4 dead 2's multiplayer is infinitely more active than 1, but that's not to say 1's online is dead.Although the old maps are in 2, the new zombies and weapons will also appear. This is a bit of an immersion-breaker for me, because those zombies weren't supposed to exist until L4D2. Playing with four weapon types and no melee weapons is a completely different experience than L4D2, and although I love the new weapons introduced in L4D2, especially the melee weapons, I think I actually prefer how the game feels with the streamlined weapon selection.L4D2 has access to the workshop, but 1 has plenty more mods that you can access online. There are plenty of quality fan-made campaigns out there to download.If you're thinking of buying both, I highly recommend buying both.If you're going to buy one, buy L4D2.			"

												Left 4 Dead. The real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to zombie shooters. This was a fantastic game at the time, but since the release of Left 4 Dead 2, there is not much reason to buy this game. All content that was featured in L4D1 is implemented in L4D2. However, L4D1 does feature a slightly *darker* atmosphere and horror. When you look down you actually see your feet, and admittedly the L4D1 survivors featured in L4D2 have slightly buggy animations. All in all, if you want the authentic Left 4 Dead 1 experience, I will recommend this game. Before the release of L4D2, I would highly recommend this game. There's not much reason to get this game.

Versus OnlyIf you're new and play versus, you will most likely get kicked 90% of your games.Great game, Good memories. Nowadays it may be dead but when it was in full stride it was one of the best games you could ever play. From a experienced player who has been playing since 2009, its really competitive and fun at the same time. This game is mostly dependant on teamwork but if you are good enough to skeet hunters, spot smokers before they pull you and know how to avoid tank attacks then hey, do your thing, run your♥♥♥♥♥to the saferoom and watch porn or take a smoke break until your team manages to get there. If you are good enough to do that but still want to cooperate with your team to win together then that makes you a even better player. Better to die together then be caught by hunters all alone thinking to yourself how you should of avoided it then ragequit blaming your team. All in all, This game is really good if you have a group of friends willing to play with you if you are new, if you are somewhat experienced. go ahead and spend 10 hours looking for a game\lobby and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ i know there are lot of good players out there who still play.Pros +Good competitive games.Easy to learn.Chill players.Fun with friends.Good game if you want to kill time.Cons -Games can be too competitive if you stumble upon certain players.Hard to master.Alot of toxic\rage players.Can be boring without friends unless you talk ingame.Will ruin your life if you play too much.Most players judge you by how many hours you've played.Barely anyone plays anymore.Stay positive, have fun and dont forget! Always attack as a team, the feeling of getting a quad is awesome :D "

												Having played l4d2 for four years, i did not actually play the original Left 4 Dead game but i'm glad i did. This game defintely has a different feel than Left 4 Dead 2. Here are some notable differences i have noticed playing Left 4 Dead:- 2 Tanks can spawn in one chapter (This is unlike Left 4 Dead 2 where only 1 Tank is allowed to spawn on non-finale chapters)- It is much easier to startle a Witch in Left 4 Dead as compared to Witches in Left 4 Dead 2.- You can friendly fire your teammates with pistols while your incapped (This is absent in Left 4 Dead 2)- If you fully discharge your shotgun you will perform an additional pumping action before you can shoot again.- It feels like Hunters attempt to sneak up to you more often as compared to Left 4 Dead 2.- Ai Bots can shoot car alarms, gas cans, propane tanks and oxygen tanks.The question many people wonder is if they should get Left 4 Dead since Left 4 Dead 2 has such a large fanbase with the workshop. If your looking to grasp the feel of the original game i would say go for Left 4 Dead, but because of how little people play i would advise buying this game only on sale. Left 4 Dead 2 is still the better game but defintely did not regret checking out the original feel of the game. "

												To me this game is pretty good and here is why.But as I always say these are my thoughts you can have your own but these are mine.The goodsFour playable characters such as Bill/Francis/Louis/and Zoey (Not a big fan of zoey for my own reasons.)A pretty good amount of levels to play around in.The game does take team work.Three game modes to play such as Campaign (The Storyish Mode.) survival fighting a never ending amount of zombies and alike and vs where you vs players in human vs special infected matchs.I do like how they made the levels also.Can see your own legs (Opionion)Ragdoll deaths for survivors (Opionion)People made custom Campaigns. (will also be a part of this in the bads area.)The badsNot as many players as Left 4 Dead 2May have levels created by other people but does not have steam workshop. So you will have to do more work going on sites and downloading levels and placeing them in the right spot. (Yep i said there would be a part to that one up there that was going to be in the bads.)Now and again on expert you will get a random person who joins and kills the whole team for fun. Or even worse kills them all when the rescue arrives at the end of a campaign and then wins by them selfs and quitsSome times have to use to much team work and every one else may want to try to be a super soldier and fight on there own.hit box can be a little off at times but not the worse.The Vote Kick System can be awful not because of the system it self, But thing is based on how people act. In other words people who say vote kick is the answer to every thing will abuse it.What Left 4 Dead has That Left 4 Dead 2 does notIts own survival mode levels While Left 4 dead 2 has two of no mercys and all of the sacrafices survival levels the rest of the Left 4 Deads survival Levels are only in Left 4 DeadCan see your own characters legsRagdoll deaths For SurvivorsTanks were less nice if they knocked you down most of the time they would beat you to death rather then go for the others. Meaning that most of the time you would have three and not four people now. Also tank ran faster on fire so burning him would mean he can run faster then you now.All the weapons and special infected have different stats.OverallI say give it a try if you have friends to play with because all the campaigns from Left 4 Dead made it into Left 4 Dead 2. But you will not have the stuff that was only in Left 4 Dead and the level lay outs are a little Different for these levels in Left 4 Dead 2 but keep in mind you only get all of the survival maps from Left 4 Dead if you own Left 4 Dead While in Left 4 Dead 2 you still get two of No Mercys and all the Sacrafice ones from Left 4 Dead. What i am trying to say mostly get Left 4 Dead if you have a few friends who will play it you want to see how Left 4 Dead was compaired to Left 4 Dead 2 or you Like Survival Mode. "

												This game is definitely one of my top favorite games, I've been playing this game ever since it has come out and it never gets old in my opinion, because of all the stuff to do. sure you can play single player or play campaign with others online, but also you can do versus, where you are the special infected trying to kill other online survivors, or vice versa. Another great thing about left 4 dead if the originality and unique types of zombies there are, this is not just your typical zombie game, you will be watching out everywhere for dreaded hunters, who jump very far just to tackle you and rip at you with their sharp fingers, Smokers, Who will constrict you with their tongue and hold you as you get hit by other zombies or as it claws at you. and boomers, who puke bile, attracting the common infected horde to attack you while you can barely see anything. And don't forget the witch, the scary thing is that your first time playing it, you would probably not have guessed she'd do what she did. Then there is the tank, who was once a roid head who is now probably the most feared thing in the game. Point is this is and always will be a classic zombie shooter game and has many thing to do and many ways to do them, and is definitely worth the buy.			"

												I've always liked this game =w= but I don't wanna sound like a complete nerd who studies this game like a textbook on the last week near an exam but yea, I am. The survivors are Louis, Zoey, Francis and Bill. Francis is a cool, biker dude who hasa funny scream when he gets incapped. Louis is a manager or IT analyst, I forget... but he seems to be the most positive character in the game and my 2nd favorite out of the bunch c:, Zoey, who is a earlier college student who has a knack for zombie and horror genres because of her dad, seems to know what she's doing as she is always the first bot to kill me in Versus! She is my No.1 favorite character because she seems the most relatable out of the four. And last but not least, Bill a Veitnam War veteran with awesome combat skills. He seems to be the most mature out of the group and basically the ""Dad."" He is my 3rd favorite character cause he is just cool. :o There is also 5 Special Infected to stay away from! The Boomer:The Boomer is a disgustingly mutated human able to vomit stuff that comes from the liver called ""bile.""If  you get doused in it and a horde of zombies go for whoever came in contact with said ""bile"".The Hunter:My 1st favorite Special Infected c: but, The Hunter seems to be an agile, young man turned into an animal-like creature fixated on ripping your guts out. I'M SURPRISED HE DOESN'T DO MORE DAMAGE. His main method of attack is to crouch and then jump on Survivors with a loud shriek, then he commences to rip your guts out. Yummy.The Smoker:The Smoker seems to be a tall male, who maybe smoked a lot? Well, whatever, he ensares Survivors with his long tounge. His main tounge, this dude has like 7 tongues he doesn't use. lol. Upon attack, the Survivor caught will try to fight away the tongue but fail horribly resulting in one of your teammates to knock the tounge or kill the Smoker itself. I don't want a zombies tongue around me :<The Tank:The Tank is a huge, muscular zombie who's music is over-the-top dramatic. He throws debris and knocks the crap out of Survivors in his way. Better stock up on molotovs for this big jerk c:The Witch:I don't like killing this infected mainly cause she cries. I'm a coward k. The Witch can usually be ignored out in the open and she is known for her cry. Reason she is crying is still sorta unknown but I'm sure it must have been sad. Gunshots pointed at her, flashlights in her face, and people standing too close can♥♥♥♥♥♥her off and she goes into a rage slashing the hell out of any Survivor who harassed her. On rare occassions she can be in a tight, hallway and needed to be killed. I dislike doing it myself since I usually suck at strategy and timing so I ask the nearest friend to do it for us. Make sure those nails don't come in contact with you.Conclusion:Left 4 Dead may not be as interesting as it's sequel Left 4 Dead 2, which retains all the survivors from L4D and all the same Infected and Special Infected. I recommend anyone who doesn't already have this game to get it. And people do still play so yea. Happy Thanksgiving and Happy zombie killing! :)			"

												Ah Left 4 Dead. I admit I played this on Xbox 360 more than PC and that's rather obivous. But I enjoyed that rather much and more than any other infection game on the market. I enjoyed the COOP theamed gameplay but at the same time still having a story that made your back tense and wish only for more. This game has made me realized that a true infection game isn't about how many points you can rack up from blowing infected heads off but if you can make it to the top of Mercy Hosbitial with your teammates in one peice.

												You and some friend(s) vs thousands of zombies. They're gonna need more zombies! Grab a pistol or two, and a shotgun or automatic weapon. Kill zombies. That's it. Pick up some health or ammo along the way as you make it from safehouse to safehouse to, hopefully, rescue. There's next to no plot, and if you play on ""easy"" and don't care for achievements, people can drop in and have a fun romp without any prior knowledge of the game or thought of strategy. Can be played in a variety of co-op modes with 1-4 players (the remaining characters will be led by AI), or Versus modes with 2 teams of 4. The survivors while distinct characters in dress and recorded lines all have the same skillset, while the zombies (who are the opposing team in Versus) are specialists.Pros: Good voice acting; great number of recorded lines. Fun brainless (haha, brains) shooter. Levels tend to be linear, gear limited, and operation straight forward. Go-to game for playing with people who don't play much, or who you don't have many games in common with (as it's often cheap, and there isn't much to learn, you can just get going -- you may wish to get L4D2 instead though). Can in theory be played alone (to survey the ""lay of the land"" before playing online) -- the AI is competent enough for that.Cons: If you're in the above situation, fine. Otherwise, the game can feel a bit basic (especially compared to other zombie-related titles). Many achievements are extremely hard to gain in single player as the AI players will mess it up by not being in on your private plan, or just generally being too slow. Being swarmed by hordes can get a bit old, especially by fast zombies (says Zoey in the game, ""I'm calling zombie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that!"") that are in fact so fast that they can overtake you and block your path -- as if it weren't enough that them hitting you while you're running away from them also stops you.Much as I enjoyed the game in its day, I've moved on to more recent titles, except in the ""drop-in game to play with people who can't or won't put in a lot of time to gain expertise first"" case. Before writing this review, I've revisited the game after a very long pause to gain some achievements I wanted, and after a few days I feel seriously L4D'd out. I might leave L4D2 on disk in case of an impromptu casual romp with some friends, but don't expect to come back otherwise. Greener pastures.Recommendation: Review your use case carefully; don't buy for single player experience or story. Compare carefully against Left 4 Dead 2. Wait for sale, or pick it up on the rare days when it's free.			"

												Left 4 Dead is still a great game.  There are plenty of custom campaigns that you can download from the GameMaps website.  Many of those campaigns are exclusively for Left 4 Dead.  It's impossible to predict what will happen while you are playing Left 4 Dead.  The game never gets old because of that.			"

												One of the best co op games out there and one of the best zombies game out there, Left 4 Dead is fun when playing online with random people, but the true delight comes when playing with friends. Hearing your friends panic when you know there's a witch nearby, coordinating when to us certain valuable supplies, ad communicating the locations and actions of the zombies together makes for an incredibly fun friday night at a friends house.

												When this came out, I played the beta at my friend's place and built a new PC to be able to run it. Six years later, got together with 3 friends on-line, and it is still amazing. $20 for a 6 year old FPS is a bit steep, but worth it. Catch it at $10 and you will feel great about it. L4D2 was inferior imo. Edit: It says I only have 20 hrs. on record on this game. That's Gabe's servers being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I had a couple hundo on there when this thing came out.			"

												This is a genuine classic and it has been adored by many audiences. I personally can not get enough out of this game. I love it. The game is super fun to play with friends and just fun to play with random people too but it is best played with friends. The main goal of this game is to survive the campaign that you have chosen and not die. This game semelessly never ends as you keep doing campaigns over and over. If there were any flaws Left 4 Dead 2 fixed them. So this kinda leaves me at  a 10/10. Great work Valve :D			"

												Man, I think I've played this game daily for over 6 months, maybe even more. It's so awesome, I think it's better than L4D2, and that's mainly because of the atmosphere. They kinda ruined that in 2, so I really hope they'll revert back to the creepy atmosphere in L4D3. The fact that the AI Director changes things on-the-fly adds lots and lots of replayabilty. There was just so much to do; the achievements were definitely a part of the challenge. Getting medals was also quite fun and challenging.And after we finished the entire game as survivors, we tried the Versus game, just for fun. And guess what ? It was just as much fun as playing survivors, sometimes even better. Ah, good times :D No... scrap that, great times ! :DI have so much love for this game ♥ Buy it, play it, love it !! Love it !!![Rating: 94/100]			"

												Say bye to your sanity in this game. Unless you like bots, you can play with friends and that's forging bonds.  And because the soundtrack is great (as in L4D). And because Zoey.... well, Zoey is a strong girl you love to protect and to play.Left 4 Dead is a co-op game where you and three friends will have to survive hordes of infected people. You can be Bill, the old veteran, Francis, the biker, Louis, the IT guy and Zoey, the student girl. You can also play alone while the rest of the teams are bots. You will have to survive infected people but also special ones like the Smoker that can grab you with its tongue, the Hunter, that jumps on you, the Boomer, that vomits on you, making you attract infected, the Tank, the big bad boy that is hard to kill or the Witch, that you shouldn't disturb if you don't want to be on the ground.Indeed, the game allows you to be incapacited for a few seconds. People have to help you else you're dead. And you'll respawn in a closet further in the game. Also, you can be healed as there are health packs. You can also boost it thanks to the famous pills. You have few weapons (sniper rifle, shotgun, rifle and pistols) but you can also push the enemies back if needed. You have also pipe bombs and molotov cocktails.The infected are mainly attracted by loud sounds, so you bet that when you have to activate generators or move bridges or anything else, you'll have an horde on you. Generally, this is a moment where you have to battle until you can escape. The end of a campaign is generally the biggest fight. But the best is the AI director that will change the experience each time: if you're doing well, expect more difficulties, if you're not, less enemies will be there for example.You have initially four campaigns. Since then, there are two campaigns that were added: one called Crash Course, with 2 levels only but they're kinda long and another called the Sacrifice, that was tied to Left 4 Dead 2.You have also a versus mode where you're against a human team: at each turn, one will be special infected and the others the survivors's team. So you can be a Boomer, Smoker, Hunter or even a Tank! The goal is to prevent the survivors reaching the safehouse while as survivors, well, it's to reach safety.The graphics are quite good and the soundtrack is excellent.Left 4 Dead is an excellent FPS, single or co-op game. Humor is there, the adrenaline is there and given the different difficulties, it's for novices like hardcore gamers.			"

												Ah Left 4 Dead. I admit I played this on Xbox 360 more than PC and that's rather obivous. But I enjoyed that rather much and more than any other infection game on the market. I enjoyed the COOP theamed gameplay but at the same time still having a story that made your back tense and wish only for more. This game has made me realized that a true infection game isn't about how many points you can rack up from blowing infected heads off but if you can make it to the top of Mercy Hosbitial with your teammates in one peice.

												When this came out, I played the beta at my friend's place and built a new PC to be able to run it. Six years later, got together with 3 friends on-line, and it is still amazing. $20 for a 6 year old FPS is a bit steep, but worth it. Catch it at $10 and you will feel great about it. L4D2 was inferior imo. Edit: It says I only have 20 hrs. on record on this game. That's Gabe's servers being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I had a couple hundo on there when this thing came out.			"

												A very simple plot; you start at point A, you have to get to point B alive! Takes a few minutes to learn, and hundreds of hours to master! It is a beautifully executed piece of software, but it does have weaknesses; There are a relatively small number of maps, a very limited number of gun types, and no secrets or surprises, and no bosses!!! It's the same zombies just about every level. Despite that, it is still a superb game, and in my opinion far better than the sequel; L4D2, which is more intense. One of the nice things about L4D is that it gives you time to chat to your friends. L4D2 you have to concentrate all the time. Solo play is OK, but the game comes in to it's own in coop mode. On the higher difficulties, the game demands team-play. In fact most failures are simply because people aren't working as a team. Random people aren't so good at this, and if you want to play on expert it really helps if you have a few people you know! "

												The game itself is great but the community makes the game a horrible experience.I do not reccomend this game unless you have people you can play with. I bought this game when it first came out. Back then the community was much more vibrant and decent. After taking a few years off for school, I came back just to witness bullying and angry people. Pros+Balanced Game: 4 infected and 4 survivors in versus mode+Graphics are decent+There is campaign and survival mode besides versus+Mods+Downloadable user made mapsCons-People can still use hacks in this game-Would be fun if there are more objectives-Limited use of weapons COMMUNITY--------------------------------------------------Buy this game at your own risk. Only 3% of the people who still play this game are patient and reasonable. The other 97% are pedophiles, toxic people, attention ♥♥♥♥♥s and losers. If you dont know how to play people will kick you out. If you know how to play, others will accuse you of hacks and kick you out. If you are a girl, older men in their 60s or 30s, 40s will try to lead you on. If you are a boy, older girls will try to befriend you and suck up to you. Cyberbullying at its finest. People who spread rumors to get rid of you. Girls who are adults but act like middle schoolers. Girls (adults) who try to date as many boys as possible in this game. Boys who cry but are adults and act like middle schoolers. Boys (adults) who will try to date as many girls in this game as possible. Hence why this game is only for losers. But hey! If youre a loser and you love drama then this community is defintely for you!Your risk. Your choice. If you still want to play then I suggest you to find decent people to play with. I would avoid the community as much as possible unless you love drama. I love this game but the people who still play it make this a horrible experience. I am glad I never came back during my college years.			"

												Incredibly enjoyable game, everything really was just splendid in this game. The characters, the simplicty, weapons and enemies. It was a very nice mix with enough thinking for players as to keep it interesting and difficult enough to keep me playing for 100+ hours.Unfortunately I doubt the community of this or L4D2 has remained as fun as it was, considering not long after release L4D2s went to crap and stayed there. So if you can, play with freinds. Theres singleplayer, but dont expect the bots to make it as fun as real people. I hate the L4D2 character set with a passion, its awkward and just crappy as heck...just wanted to put that in.Also though L4D2 has all the L4D1 ""content"" technically, there are diffrences that make enough of a deal for me to prefer one. Even the art style and way graphics are rendered in one I just like more than two.If you have a fun group you want to play a good coop game with, this maybe good as you can probably get it on sale with 2 for a deal thats worth it. If its just you, there are better single player games to look at as you can easily look up why L4D is a bad SP game. And if you just want to play with random people it maybe random as to finding good people or any for that matter.			"

												The game is one of the best ever. BUT because it depends a lot on teammates it's no good now days. Too often you find players who kill teammates. There are even groups on steam dedicated to troll people, groups that steam will do nothing about. There's no way to block them from your game so unless you have a set up with friends this game is useless.			"

												Absolutely solid game that doesn't try to pretend it's not just that - a game. Valve puts intense labors of love in creating a believable, logical, and eerily gorgeous setting, then piles stashes of health packs and unrealistic armories of guns and ammo... and it feels fantastic. Can be played both casually with no regard to story or characters alongside other players paying close attention to the world-building details of the world and the quirks of each individual player character, with full satisfaction on each end.So good on XBawks I bought it on Steam too, and never regretted it.

So there is no point of actually getting this game. Save your money for L4D2. Unless you want the true game then buy it but let me warn you; you get more of L4D1 in L4D2. Still, its a great game.

												This is Left 4 Dead at its finest. An overall better experience than L4D2 or L4D1 campaigns on L4D2.An atmospheric fast zombie coop shooter, with an emphasis on shooting. If only the game could have kept up with the common spawning to counter the rushing strategy of versus mode, this would be a highly played game to this day. The z_common_limit 30 was an unfortunate reality of 2007 hardware, I hope L4D3 will address this major shortfall from both l4d1 and l4d2.			"

												Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 ReviewsBoth of the Left 4 Dead games are great examples of what the zombie survival genre is like. Two of the greatest zombie games created. Although some time has passed since their original release dates, Left 4 Dead (2008) and Left 4 Dead 2 (2009), they are both high quality survival games. One flaw with both games is the sheer repetitiveness. There are several different campaigns in both games, but in Left 4 Dead, the outcome always seems the same: Wait for someone to rescue you. Although Left 4 Dead 2 has more to do, it always seems the same. However you can find yourself playing the campaigns several times, playing survival mode countless hours and killing thousands of zombies as soon as you pick up a copy. Since they were made nearly five and six years ago, the graphics are no longer considered high quality, but are in no way an eye-sore. Both Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 have a great replay value, and are easy to learn, making them fun and exciting games. Both games feature four players whether it is offline or online with a common goal in mind. Keep moving, kill everything that moves, and get to the next safehouse or escape route. The weapons are fairly simple, in Left 4 Dead there are assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, pistols and submachine guns, whereas Left 4 Dead 2 has all the same, plus a variety of melee weapons. The stories of both games are fairly simple but overlooked, you will find yourself being more interested in killing hordes of zombies rather than who is on their way to save you.Personally I would like a third game to be made, just like every other L4D fan, including fellow editor Wilson2234 who has logged in more than 22 hundred hours into these games on Steam. I myself have played both versions on Xbox 360 and PC and have to say they run well on both and are a great purchase on either system. Perfect game to play with friends to either waste some time, or play on Expert and strategize how to make it out alive. Overall Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 are two of the greatest survival games on the market.

												For most people, I would just recommend grabbing Left 4 Dead 2 instead, because it has all of the original Left 4 Dead campaigns. However, I strongly recommend trying out both games and seeing which title you prefer. There are enough differences in both Left 4 Dead titles to justify playing the original over the sequel.I honestly prefer playing Left 4 Dead over Left 4 Dead 2 and that's just my preference. Try out both games and see which one feels better for you. I don't want to debate which game is better because it's just personal preference. I will just say one thing: I'm glad there are no jockeys in this game.			"

												I instantly fell in love with this when I first played it and it became my favorite game of all time and I had well over 600 hours in it until L4D2 came out, now I have 1800+ in that. Although I have 700+ games on Steam now, this is actually the 4th game I ever owned on Steam. If you care about seeing how it all got started, try this first. Otherwise, every campaign and character from this is in L4D2, and L4D2 is a thousand times better because it adds a buttload of things this game didn't have, like melee weapons for instance.Still, 9/10			"

Posted: May 15, 2014
												It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.----o0o---- As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.'...What's that smell?'Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.----o0o---- Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(			"

												An original co-op zombie game. Fight the zombies or be a zombie. This is the first game that really makes you rely on teammates for assistance. Most players have moved on to L4D2, which certainly adds a lot of variety to the game, but L4D2 still feels incomplete and lacking in many ways. See my L4D2 review for more details. If you're trying to decide between L4D and L4D2, go with L4D.*Update: although I believe L4D1 is better than L4D2. At this point in time L4D1 is pretty much dead. Most servers are empty. Versus is almost always empty. If you can find players for L4D versus most of them brazingly cheat, act like aѕѕhоles, grief and/or crash the server via ddos or an exploit when the game doesn't go in their favor. I personally contacted Valve two times about patching vulnerbilities in their vanilla servers to prevent ddos. I believe the exploit that can cause a server to crash can also be patched. Valve has ignored my pleas. By the looks of it Valve has abondoned all support for this game.I remember when L4D versus gaming was a fun, rewarding socializing experience. Now its just full of bullying, rude and unfriendly behavior.			"

												Once an awesome multi experience from Valve is now but a shell, with practically no fan base left. Fun if you have friends for the campaigns, but mainly, the Versus is where the honey was to be found in this game. Unfortunately Left 4 Dead 2 diluted the fan base between the two games and it's never been the same since.If you can round up 8 people for a versus game, it's worth buying when cheap. But if not, avoid. Without the multiplayer, this once fun game is a shadow of its former self. Sad, but true.			"

												This game started the whole craze over Left 4 Dead series. It's bare bones when compared to it's sequel: Few guns, no uncommons, not as many special infected. But, it is a start, and that's what matters. Co-op or solo, it's a nice game. What alot of people take to is the VS and Survival gameplays, which can be quite brutal on one's confidence. But, it's a nice early nostalgic feel when going back to it from L4D2, thus, it gets a 3/5.			"

												This is an amazing game,Sure L4D2 has this within it and morebut when I play this its not just,""Oh the second game has it, screw this one.""no I play it because I get a nostalgic feel when I play it,its satisfactory and it has more of an eerie creepier feel more than the second one,the second felt like a loud bloodbash,this one is a quiet SCARE THE CRAP OUT OF YOU kind of feel and its great,its basic and I reccomend it to anyone.I remember playing back when I was younger around 2009 and it was what I was used to,even though the second one has this within it and more (yes I know I'm repeating) It just has sentimental and nostalgic value that you can't beat any other way.I do have a fare warning,if you didn't grow up with this one first and have no feel towards the nostalga I wouldn't reccommend it,if thats how you feel about it,(no nostalga) then just get the second one and have fun with mods and stuff.Also,if you feel that way about that,this would be that kind of game where you have nothing left to buy and just say, ""screw it"" and you buy this,just to have in your library,who knows? maybe one of your friends has this one and not the second one because he bought this when it came out,now you can play with that friend,(if he doesnt already have the second one) BUT HAVE FUAN AND ENJOY LADDIES			"

												It's really a shame L4D1 Is so much better than L4D2 it was less buggy more fun better animations you could actually see your legs but then valve just left it and ported the campaigns to L4D2 making them worse and most people who only have L4D2 don't realise that			"

												This is an amazing game,Sure L4D2 has this within it and morebut when I play this its not just,""Oh the second game has it, screw this one.""no I play it because I get a nostalgic feel when I play it,its satisfactory and it has more of an eerie creepier feel more than the second one,the second felt like a loud bloodbash,this one is a quiet SCARE THE CRAP OUT OF YOU kind of feel and its great,its basic and I reccomend it to anyone.I remember playing back when I was younger around 2009 and it was what I was used to,even though the second one has this within it and more (yes I know I'm repeating) It just has sentimental and nostalgic value that you can't beat any other way.I do have a fare warning,if you didn't grow up with this one first and have no feel towards the nostalga I wouldn't reccommend it,if thats how you feel about it,(no nostalga) then just get the second one and have fun with mods and stuff.Also,if you feel that way about that,this would be that kind of game where you have nothing left to buy and just say, ""screw it"" and you buy this,just to have in your library,who knows? maybe one of your friends has this one and not the second one because he bought this when it came out,now you can play with that friend,(if he doesnt already have the second one) BUT HAVE FUAN AND ENJOY LADDIES			"

This is the good Left 4 DeadThis is the L4D that does a good job of portraying that Zombie Movie feel that the game was supposed to have. The AI Director is much more inteligent, Does not spam (easily killed) Special Infected, and does not consistantly try to overwelm the players. Unfourtunately; this L4D has a smaller playerbase and does not have workshop. However, the map design of this game is much better then L4D2's.			"

												Classic Left 4 Dead. Sure, it's just another zombie game, but back in the day it was pretty fun. That said it's entirely overratted and there are much better crapshoots to spend your time on. Of course if you have the left 4 dead bug you'd probably be playing the 2nd one (which I believe has some of the levels from the first one ported) anyway. One thing I'll always remember from left 4 dead was playing the demo (the hospital level, mercy something, too lazy to use google) over and over and over again. It was fun. I think I played that single level more times than the rest of the game combined.			"

												Once an awesome multi experience from Valve is now but a shell, with practically no fan base left. Fun if you have friends for the campaigns, but mainly, the Versus is where the honey was to be found in this game. Unfortunately Left 4 Dead 2 diluted the fan base between the two games and it's never been the same since.If you can round up 8 people for a versus game, it's worth buying when cheap. But if not, avoid. Without the multiplayer, this once fun game is a shadow of its former self. Sad, but true.			"

												An original co-op zombie game. Fight the zombies or be a zombie. This is the first game that really makes you rely on teammates for assistance. Most players have moved on to L4D2, which certainly adds a lot of variety to the game, but L4D2 still feels incomplete and lacking in many ways. See my L4D2 review for more details. If you're trying to decide between L4D and L4D2, go with L4D.*Update: although I believe L4D1 is better than L4D2. At this point in time L4D1 is pretty much dead. Most servers are empty. Versus is almost always empty. If you can find players for L4D versus most of them brazingly cheat, act like aѕѕhоles, grief and/or crash the server via ddos or an exploit when the game doesn't go in their favor. I personally contacted Valve two times about patching vulnerbilities in their vanilla servers to prevent ddos. I believe the exploit that can cause a server to crash can also be patched. Valve has ignored my pleas. By the looks of it Valve has abondoned all support for this game.I remember when L4D versus gaming was a fun, rewarding socializing experience. Now its just full of bullying, rude and unfriendly behavior.			"

												Left 4 Dead 1 is one less than Left 4 Dead 2, but despite that is still an ace game.There was a lot of stuff added in the second game, but the formula was already perfect. And that's not to say the sequel is bad, it's not, both of them are fantastic games.Still, I don't know if it's worth buying the first game anymore. There's a 'Left 4 Dead 1 coop' mutation for L4D2 that literally just makes the game play just like the first one. On top of this, all of the campaigns have been officially ported over by Valve themselves, so... I guess if you REALLY BADLY want that PURITY of Left 4 Dead 1, you might consider buying this, but otherwise just grab the second game.That said, they changed some things with weapons around in the second game, most notably I don't think you actually have to count your shotgun rounds off if you're using the XM1014, because the reload is always the same speed. And the addition of 'more guns' is nice, but again, you only need the five or so weapons that L4D1 offers. You have your M16, your XM1014, Uzi, pump shotgun. That's really all you need. Anything more just 'bloats' the game, in a way.Sometimes, less is more.Either way, I can't possibly not recommend this game, because, come on, it's Left 4 Dead, the sceond game releasing didn't MAGICALLY warp time and space and cause the first game to be bad.

												Ahhh yes the first true Action/Survival Horror zombie game that was worth a crap. Not to mention one of the VERY few co-op games to grace the genre at the time. I remember the many hours myself and many of my friends spent playing this thing and then staying up all night talking about the ""Zombie Apocalypse"" and planning our next run through of the game only with higher difficulty. Never did beat all the levels on expert but needless to say i purchased it again for pc even after L4D2 was released (a sale came up shortly thereafter and i got L4D2. thus so few hours.). I always loved the original story more than the second.However even with all the wonderful moments this game has brought too me i simply cannot reccomend anyone purchase this game. Reason being that they have added the first story and all dlc plus steam workshop integration all into L4D2.. So obviously it is not that this game isnt any good or that i did'nt like it. Whybuy it if you can get everything and then some through a better, cheaper alternative(an upgrade really).			"

												***WARNING***Buy Left 4 Dead 2; it has the same exact weapons, characters, and maps plus more for literally the same exact price.It IS a fun game, though. Also, look for it on sale because they both usually go down to about $5 during the big Steam sales.But for real, I wasted $5 on this game. There's no real value to this one since L4D2 is just a better version of it in every way.SERIOUSLY, THERE IS NOOOOOO POINT TO THIS ONE. EVEN THE SAME EXACT CAMPAIGN AND MAPS FROM HERE CAN BE PLAYED IN L4D2			"

												I do not thumb down for the game itself. The L4D franchise is an amazing coop license. But if like myself you already had L4D2, do not buy L4D, because all L4D missions are present in L4D2, and furthermore, L4D2 have way more weapons than L4D.So yes, this is more a warning than an real test, but I do not want other people to fall into the trap and think L4D have other mission and since you liked L4D2, you'd buy the first one.

												RU Скажу честно, я играл сначала в неё принуждённо! Был 2015 год, я восстановил стим и вспомнил что купил the orange box, я закачал эту игру из-за того что 2 часть не шла (из-за ошибки с файлами).Я этого не жалею! Первое ощущение что ты реально в центре событий игра: очень сильная атмосфера(я очень испугался когда увидел ведьму), красивая(на 8 год) графика и конечно же ощущение того что тебя прикроют напарники дает уверенности. Если вы хотите купить эту игру, то она это заслуживает.Плюсы:+Атмосфера+Хорошая графика+Отличные компании+Возможность загрузки доп. контента+Неплохие напарники+Хороший ИИ+В игра есть Режиссёр(ИИ) он расставляет вещи и зараженных в зависимости от игры, можно перепроходить ходить компании бесконечно.+Особые заражённыеМинусы: -Если вы играете на эксперте, то нубы (обычно они имеют ники пиратов: by Pioneer,I am noob, noob_(И двухзначное число любое), noSTEAM.ro) начинают мешать( френдли фаер, тим килл и т.д.)-Игра уже старая поэтому в неё уже меньше играют(но всё равно игроков много).Итого: эта игра заслуживает чтобы её купить(не пиратить!!!)! Уверен, она надолго останется в ваших сердцах( она лучше 2 части).Спасибо за внимание!EU To be honest, I played it compulsively! Was 2015, I repaired steam and remembered that I bought the orange box, I've downloaded this game due to the fact that part 2 was not (because of an error with the files).I do not regret it! The first impression that you're really in the center of events the game a very strong atmosphere(I was very scared when I saw the witch), beautiful(8 year) graphics and of course the feeling that your back gives teammates confidence. If you want to buy this game, it deserves it.Pros:+Atmosphere+Good graphics+Great company+The ability to download additional content+Good companions+Good AI+The game has a Directed(s) he puts belongings and infected, depending on the game, you can replay go to the company indefinitely.+Special infectedCons: -If you play on expert, then noobs (they usually have nicknames pirate by Pioneer,I am a noob, noob_(And any two-digit number), noSTEAM.ro) get in the way( friendly fire, team kill, etc.)-The game is old, so it has less play(but still a lot of players).Total: this game deserves to buy it(not pirate!!!)! I'm sure it will long remain in your hearts( it is better than the 2 parts).Thank you for your attention!			"

Been playing this a long time, between xbox and computer. Good community. Some of the usual griefers, but made a bunch of friends just from L4D alone.			"
