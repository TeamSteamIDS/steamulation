												This game works fine with windows 7. Just download a new .exe here: http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/882811/manhunt.exe and replace the one in your steam folder. Then patch it with the patch here:  http://gzwn.net/manhuntpatcher/Enjoy.A brutal cat and mouse game. Very well done. One of the best stealth games, it has a great atmosphere, it's a classic.			"

												I'll admit, it's a bit messed up that I started playing this when I was just a kid, but I'm certainly glad that I didn't miss out on it. It's one hell of a game and stuff can be as brutal as you want it to be (my favorite). Manhunt has brought me many moments of terror and countless adrenaline rushes, and it would probably still do that if I were to play it today. Despite how controversial the game is because of it's content, it's not any worse than most of the games that kids are still currently playing. Although, this remains the only game where I have snuck up on a guy and carved a hole into his stomach with a sickle, so I could watch his intestines poor onto the ground. He deserved it though.My Rating: 7.5/10			"

												Hello everyone,I just bought Manhunt 2 for my eight year old son. He said that he really wanted the game. So, I went and bought the Wii version of it for him. I gave the game to him and watched him play. I was astonished at how good the graphics were and how kid-friendly the game is. I was so proud of him when he acted out the murders of multiple people on the screen. My favorite was when he wrapped the telephone wire around one of the character's neck and choke him to death. After he was done with the game, I tried it out and loved it. The thrill of a kill is amazing. I am recommending to every parent here to buy Manhunt 2 for their children. It is fun for the whole family!--Ginathis video game should be banned because 1. violence (Even though movies are ok)2. school shooters (even though so far none have played this)3.

												''Come on, Cash!,You're stacking those corpses up like it was Judgement Day!''It isn't a horror game such as killing zombies in Resident Evil but something darker, more sinister.The plot involves a criminal who was seemingly executed by lethal injection but wakes up in a room later to find out it was just a strong sedative. He finds this out from a voice over the intercom. The voice (Brian Cox) is that of the ""director"" and he next tells our antihero to put in an earpiece so that all future communications are quiet. The game being played is ""the most dangerous"" one and if he survives the night, he will supposedly be let free. The catch is that the ""director"" is filming everything, not only for his own sadistic pleasure but to create snuff films to sell to his elite customers. And what snuff films they are! He directs you on what to do so that his productions turn out to be top quality, as well as gets rather excited himself for each successful murder. As you creep about the prepared areas, you find various gang members who are getting paid to hunt you down. Of course, you turn the tables on them. Using a plethora of weaponry such as plastic bags, shards of glass, bats, and crowbars (and much more, plus guns in later levels), you sneak up on a thug and kill them. Brutally. In fact, each weapon has three levels of mayhem, depending on how long you can hold down the button while tracking them. After releasing the button, the screen turns into a home video-type view and you watch the execution unfold. A bat at level three has you choke the guy until he unconsciously falls to his knees, then you crack him full swing in the head, realistically spraying skull, brain, and blood against a wall. A glass shard allows you to stab your prey directly in the face several timesblood splatters on the screen. You get the idea. All this carnage actually relies on stealth and quietude, which makes the game all the more disturbingly somber. The graphics, sound, and music are all quite fitting. Anyway, I'm not much of a gamer anymore but I still may occasionally pick up a game if it catches my eye. Manhunt is a pretty cool game despite a plot dealing with sadistic voyeurism and its overall graphic and disturbing nature. In fact, that's what makes it interesting to play.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Graphics: 8.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Sound: 9/10 Challenge: 9/10 Overall: 8.8/10 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  + Great dark atmosphere designed to evoke claustrophobia and paranoia + Great use of lighting and the 'dark spots' blend in neatly with their surroundings + Looks great artistically as well as technically.+ Cleverly crafted minimalist soundtrack that sets just the right mood of eeriness + Great darkly humorous dialogue from nearly all the non-playable characters in the game + Nicely implemented, stealthy trial-and-error gameplay that requires brains - During certain levels, particularly shootouts, the difficulty feels unnecessarily tweaked - HUD is quite minimal, and the ""Hardcore"" difficulty in the game features no HUD at all..- Despite its sheer depth, the game is extremely linear.________________________________________________How to run Manhunt on Windows Vista, XP, 7, 8, 8.1, 10

												The original Manhunt is a very surreal game. It's almost practically forgotten about by most and only really brought up for it's political controvercy when it came out. It's a sadly overlooked game I think deserves more attention because of just how good it really was and how immersive of a game it is.In Manhunt you don't play as a heroic character. You play as a convicted murderer sentenced to death, who is saved at the last moment by a sociopathic movie director. Who puts you into a walled off section of this ruined city called ""Carcer City"" which is essentially based on Detroit, to murder gang members and other undesirables while he films you doing it. What the game does well that is strangely not talked about is how immersive it is. The world of Manhunt is not a pleasant one. You walk through long abandoned sections of a ruined city. And you're entirely alone throughout the game.The soundtrack to the game is also lots of ambient tracks that reflect how creepy and disturbing it all is. Every character in the game comes across as vicious and nasty, and it always feels like the main character is the most vicious of them all. Thankfully the developers also understood exactly how to create a game like this. Manhunt is a well made stealth game (largely, I'll touch on that) where the main character is almost like a slasher villain. Inorder to kill enemies you must aquire weapons, and almost all of them are household objects. Plastic bags, bricks, shards of glass, almost anything you can find. And you get rewarded for killing enemies without being seen and for stalking them for a long period of time. It reminds me of Thief in terms of how it plays (having sound and light based stealth), except being focused on killing enemies. It is sick, sadistic, brutal, and paints a picture where there is no escape from the world you inhabit. That being said it's not a perfect game. Later on in Manhunt parts of the game devolve into shooting sections that are frankly less interesting than the stealth sections. I think Rockstar added them in to inject variety but it comes off as unnecessary. But that being said it's a fantastic game, and there isn't anything else quite like it. I think it should be played largely because it shows a different side to humanity than most people are willing to feature in games. But it isn't for the faint of heart. You play as the most dangerous animal, a hunter of man, and it's time to go to work.

												Even though you're told there are fixes to make the game run you're better off just emulating it. Regardless of the excuse, there are games older than this that run just fine on modern computers and the compatibility option is there for a reason. Even the compatibility modes are useless. The game itself is one of the most underappreciated and unique games you can play and buy but because Rockstar is simply too lazy to make a quick fix it would be better to save your money for something that doesn't have game breaking bugs 12+ years later. I recommend the game itself wholeheartedly but not the Steam version.			"

												This game is one of the most original action stealth games ever.  Surrounded by controversy, it didn't shy away from a dark subject matter and a beautifully squalid level design.The game is like a cross between a snuff film and The Warriors(and/or Running Man).  A game to be played in the dark with the volume turned way up.  The goading narration from Brian Cox and the sinister music by Craig Conner add to the atmosphere.			"

Note:Don’t feel discouraged by the game Notice that states it can’t run on Windows Vista, 7 or 8. There are unofficial patches that allow the game to run for modern computers. Thanks to them I managed to run the game on my windows 7 computer with no issues whatsoever. They are not complicated to install as you might think, and it’s rewarding in the end.

Ultimate Manhunt Configuration & Fix Guide for Modern Systems! 
A Guide for Manhunt
By: Oblivion2500

			This guide contains all the steps-by-steps needed to get Manhunt working on the modern hardware and operating systems such as Windows Vista, 7, and 8/8.1.		


https://steamcommunity.com/app/12130/discussions/0/828939978361803059/http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Manhunt#Essential_improvementsWithout a doubt this is the most under rated and polemic game Rockstar has ever made. I was never big into stealth games but this tittle has completely changed my mind on the genre. Is not to say it’s an easy game, it requires patience and it will take a while for you to get used to the mechanics, but once you do you’ll get immersed into a gritty world and you’ll be cornered into many terrifying moments.Its very niche and it won’t be everybody’s cup of tea, hence why it has a small (But strong) following. But for a game that has a big controversy behind it is not tasteless or immature, in fact the topics the game deals with are done in a very credible way, and that keeps the plot engaging. Is not heavy in plot, but it has very fascinating plot elements and horrifying implications. It’s extremely well made and it saddens me that many of its strong elements are almost over shadowed by its strong violence. It’s truly not a game for the squeamish, it might be old, but it has aged pretty well and the executions that make this game get its reputation are brutal and cold.The sound design is incredible, the use of dynamic music adds amazing depth to the experience and the enemy gangs have excellent voice acting that adds great characterization and back story to them, but doesn’t make them more likeable, after all, they are scum, just like you. This added with the level design and gameplay creates for a unique experience. You might be fighting other human beings, but they are stronger and outnumber you. Some levels demand the use of stealth and wits while others require you to go gun blazing. I’d argue the third person shooting is a bit dated, but with some practice I was able to pop down enemies and feel like an action film hero. This game demands dedication and doesn’t hold your hand, after all it’s from a very different era, which some will love and others dislike.But more importantly the controls work amazing on a Keyboard. You can freely customize the controls and they were never an issue for me. It controls and plays like a charm, and I love it. It makes fantastic use of a keyboard and mouse, so this is in fact a very solid PC port (Now if only they were gentle enough to make it friendly on newer operative systems so you didn’t had to mess around for a product you just paid for).And if that wasn’t enough, the game has some very good replay value, it has two difficulty settings, and the hardest setting only removes the enemy radar. So it’s very balanced difficulty wise, and any mistake you go through will be your fault. But being able to unlock concept art, cheats and extra game modes is something that makes playing through this game more rewarding. You’ll spend 40 hours and more trying to 100% it.So, whether you’re buying this to revive the PS2/Xbox memories or to get into it for the first time, I heavily recommend it, especially if you are into stealth and subtle psychological horror.

												If you are using windows vista, 7, 8 or 10, then the game will crash once you reach a certain part in the tutorial. However this is an easy fix, as all you got to do is download this patcher, run the patcher on your Manhunt steam game file, and then replace the exe. file in the download with the exe. in your steam game folderthe game will then run seamlessly without crashing or game breaking bugs.Now for the review. If you played Manhunt on the PS2/Xbox and you enjoyed it, you'll find this a good reason to revisit .The player movements are alot more refined in the PC version. No more awkward camera angles from the console version. The stealth system is fun, even if its a little broken. The AI is  kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but their ridiculous lines of dialogue combined with hilarious executions makes it funThe HD resolutions for the game, let this dated and shadowey game look artistic, and I find that the graphics were pretty nice to look at for a game that was made in 2003. Overall, this is a good game and a great waty to either revisit this game or play it for the first time. JUST MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE PATCHER			"

												One of the most underrated titles from Rockstar Games. Manhunt is a brutal stealth game that heavily relies on the player to execute their enemies by sneaking up from behind. At the time, the game's premise and tone were unique for being quite depressing and brooding, causing massive controversies that continued with the release of its sequel, Manhunt 2. Yet inside of Manhunt's nihilist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t was a solid stealth/action game that directly engages and intimidates you. The only massive problem with Manhunt is its age, with its primitive cover and shooting mechanics, yet they are easy to adapt to after playing for a while. Even if you're not interested in Manhunt's gameplay, it's perfectly acceptable to own it as a piece of history, when video games were significantly pushing the envelope on the portrayal of violence. Whether you like it or not, Manhunt is one of the most important games of the last decade, and owning a copy is highly recommended.			"

												I remember enjoying this game when it first came out. I wanted to reminisce the experience, but the Steam version is broken. You have to go through additional steps to make it playable (editing some game codes, installing some programs, avoiding malware, etc). I managed to play a little bit, but game kept crashing and scripted events didn't trigger ... I don't recommend buying it on Steam, try GOG.
