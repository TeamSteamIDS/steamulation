												Cute, silly, and violent. This game is a fun introduction to the world of the Rabbids and the hijinks they get up to. Consisting of a variety of minigames, this is the perfect game to try with your friends (locally only), or if you feel like having a good laugh. The story is mildly important, but I really didn't care too much about it with all the crazyness erupting from the Rabbids on a regular basis.			"

												People typically hate on this game for inevitably being the decent of Rayman games for half a decade, and that is actually true. Though I do wish this turned out to be the full fledged ""Rayman 4"" that it was supposed to be, this game is still fun. I grew up a huge Rayman fan because of the characters, they were so entertaining. The Rabbids are an entertaining group, as proved by a line of sequels, mainstream merchandise. and a television show. Since Rabbids are your only source of character selection here, you'd think it'd be sub-par, alas the Rabbids continue to entertain with their outlandish behaviors.If you want to play Rayman 4 the way it was initially planned, just buy the DS version. It's literally unchanged from it's initial standpoint. Of course it's not the full Rayman 4 PC experience as it would have been, but it's the original idea of the game as it was intended for the DS (suspicion leads me to believe they were almost finished the DS version and didn't want to re-make it as a mini-game collection so finished it up as Rayman 4 style). It's actually a pretty fun game, too. The sequels on the DS however are understandably just mini-game collections, which are, for the most part; dull.So that wraps up my long-ish but comparatively short opinion on Rabbids overflowing the series. Do I recommend this game? As a standalone title; yes. It's fun and can be revisited from time to time.Do I recommend this as a Rayman game and to Rayman fans? Not to the full spectrum, but some of the nostalgic enjoyment can be found here.			"

												The very first Rabbids game. I've been a Rayman fan all my life so of course I fell in love with this game as soon as it came out.There's not too much of a difference between the Wii version and this one. It's still really fun, the controls translate nicely for mouse and keyboard and the Rabbids are hilarious, like they always are.			"

												It is this kind of games that makes you wish that it existed a ""Neutral"" button for the recommendations. But since there isn't, I've got to be more harsh. I will review this under a gamer perspective and with a Rayman fan perspective.Rayman Raving Rabbids is not very far for accomplishing a decade (already?) since it was released in the market for different platforms including PC. Did it pass through the test of time? I'm affraid not.To start, this game carries a sad history of development. Ubisoft originally planned to make a real sequel to Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc (Please bring this game on STEAM, guys. Consider also other titles. I am sure many people will be pleased.) for the platforms of the time until one day the development kit of the Wii console arrived to the team's hands. This was the beginning of the end. A very tight deadline for the release of the game along with the console and the discovering of the potential of motion controls were the main reasons why the ambitious ""Rayman 4"" project saw its canceling. The final result was transforming a main title to a spin-off title. From a platformer to a compilation of party mini-games.Storywise, the game is underwhelming: Rayman is captured by a horde of Rabbids and trapped in their colosseum for 15 days and nobody understands why (it was never explained what was their real intention). You entertain them by beating up their challenges and eventually start loving you instead of wanting to shread you in pieces. As a reward for entertainment they offer you plungers. And during your progress, Rayman releases that plungers are the key to his freedom. The ""story"" itself isn't what it is truly underwhelming, but yes the way the game ends. As a Rayman fan, I was very sad to see such a disappointing ending as I don't really find it worth the effort of beating the game (and dignifying to the main character too). It leaves an ambiguity too but I won't explain it here as it is not the main focus of this review.Graphicaly, this game does not surprise much even for its time. Obviously, it is one of the versions with best graphical presentation along with the Xbox 360 port. It is probably the only thing I can recommend people to play this version instead of Wii's. The scenarios are really random pretty much as a result of picking up the leftovers of a canceled game, varying since western backgrounds until graveyards. But they don't vary that much so you'll naturally ask often to yourself ""Have I seen this before?"". Since this was the very first game where the Rabbids appeared, it is normal that their in-game design is very dated. Rabbids in more modern games are much better modeled and much more expressive. Though as a Rayman fan I am very critic towards the chosen design for the Baby Globoxes. It truly makes me wonder what happened in the design process as they look radically different from the Rayman 2 models, not to mention they became much uglier! And I am not just talking about the lack of scale texture.Musically, the game offers a decent soundtrack but expect some repetitions. Remember this is a party game. As for the sound effects, it is the same opinion but with an extra note: the iconic and fun screams of the Rabbids will quickly become as unpleasant and irritating as drawing a line with a chalk on a blackboard.For the gameplay itself, being this transformed game originally developed for the Wii console it makes sense that the gameplay works fine there. After testing the PC version, I can guarantee that while some mini-games become much easier to play thanks to the advantages of a keyboard (and mouse for some occasions) for the quickness of response and reduction of physical effort, other mini-games became much more difficult than in Wii. I can give ""Bunnies can't fly (Part 1 and 2)"" as the biggest example of frustration, especially for Part 2 as I am not being able to pass the 185 meters even with the jet boost by the time I am writting this review. It is also expected that the mini-games are fun to play in the platform originally developed for (and it is if you are really new to the Rayman Raving Rabbids trilogy like I was back in the teenagehood) but does it means that it is for other platforms? I confess that the motion controls is what it makes the game more interesting to play. For normal gaming peripherals like a keyboard+mouse it is not that fun and there is very few variation in the controls. In other words, I think the PC port and its equivalents were totally pointless to make despite of the obvious plan of trying to reach most players as possible. It is not fun. If skeptical, I suggest to try out the Wii version and I am confident you will feel the difference. Being this a party game, the mini-games are also much more fun to play in large groups (3 or 4 players) but I hadn't the chance to test this in the PC version though I calculate that unless the players optate for controllers each player must play by turns in order to use the keyboard+mouse. The game features few fun mini-games that are enjoyable, but others are pretty much boring and strange (Bunnies are Ticklish wins the trophy for this category. Really, what the heck was this?). There is a lot of repetitivism too as some minigames will re-appear but with minor changes to make it ""more difficult"" to play. After finishing the story mode you can replay the minigames to aim for better scores but these are also dated to a certain point as the online leaderboards of RRR do not exist anymore for around 6 years.Finally, for the longevity and replay value, the game's story mode is easily cleared in less than one week to not say in few hours. Though, I have my doubts that you will want to bother trying out the score mode as it is impossible for the common of mortals to perfect all the mini-games with 1000 points. The unlockables are all content you can find online after few research to the matter. Once you're done with the story mode, you'll more likely nevermore touch the game.I really have difficulties to recommend in plain year of 2016 a 2006 game port originally developed for the Wii console. The market is oversatured with casual and party titles (very impulsioned by the Wii phenomenom, and recently with the smartdevices boom) and despite of that problem there is a good thing in it: you have a lot of variety to pick with and I am absolutely sure you can find better multiplayer games to play with your friends than this (regardless the plaftform in question). And if it is a game to play alone, the list of games to pick is equally gigantic. In my gamer perspective, this game already has seen better days and I do think you should look for anything else unless you are really really bored and decide to kill time alone or with your local friends (or that you are a great Rayman/Rabbids fan and really want to try out but I think you are not missing much). In a Rayman fan perspective, I ensure you there are much better titles to play. I would rather recommend you (according to the current offer in STEAM by the time I write this review) to purchase Rayman Legends: the game is fun either alone or with friends and the quality is much superior (and no Rabbids are included!). Though, ideally I would recommend Rayman 2: The Great Escape if it was available for purchase on STEAM. I find very strange the original trilogy not being available for purchase, those are the best games.To sum up everything I've written above, I do not recommend this game as there are much better alternatives to choose from Ubisoft's hands. You'll thank me later!			"

												A note on compatability: the game seemed to run fine on both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, and mostly does the same on Windows 10. It did seem to develop an issue with the upgrade wherein the first time it was played on Windows 10, and intermittedly thereafter, it had some issues with the visual rendering. That is, while the game runs fine, it might have an issue with the screen being black except for the menu options. If that happens, just go into the display options menu and up the brightness and contrast settings until everything is visible again. On the same count, if the mouse mysteriously stops being detected, simply use the keyboard to go into the controls options and toggle the mouse sensitivity in any direction. That seems to make it suddenly start working again. These may be minor annoyances, but are nothing game breaking or even terribly frustrating.As for the game - it is a party game built around a series of mini-games. There's not really much story to it beyond that. Basically, it all depends whether you're a fan of games like Mario Party or not. There are upgrades you can unlock and bonus features you can earn by playing and doing well, but essentially there is just a limited selection of mini-games that will assign you different goals to reach in order to beat them, as well as other different game modes to play. While it is a fairly old game at this point, though not terribly so, it is definitely one of the better offerings in the genre, with decent graphics and music that still hold up and an appropriate mixture of fun and challenge within the games themselves.

I thought it would be fun but now that we are at a next level in gaming, I find it boring. It used to be epic 10 years ago, but now its boring. So if you want to buy it because you played it in your childhood, then buy it but wait till it goes on sale, because on full price you can buy better games. But now its 2016, so I think you shouldn't try it, its boring. Honestly, I got dissapointed, I thought it would be more fun.Rating for 2006: 8/10Rating for 2016: 4/10			"

												""Since 1997, my computer-based communication system has been sponsored and provided by Intel® Corporation. A tablet computer mounted on the arm of my wheelchair is powered by my wheelchair batteries, although the tablets internal battery will keep the computer running if necessary. My main interface to the computer is through an open source program called ACAT, written by Intel. This provides a software keyboard on the screen. A cursor automatically scans across this keyboard by row or by column. I can select a character by moving my cheek to stop the cursor. My cheek movement is detected by an infrared switch that is mounted on my spectacles. This switch is my only interface with the computer. ACAT includes a word prediction algorithm provided by SwiftKey, trained on my books and lectures, so I usually only have to type the first couple of characters before I can select the whole word. When I have built up a sentence, I can send it to my speech synthesizer. I use a separate hardware synthesizer, made by Speech Plus. It is the best I have heard, although it gives me an  accent that has been described variously as Scandinavian, American or Scottish. Through ACAT I can also control the mouse in Windows. This allows me to operate my whole computer. I can check my email using the Eudora email client, surf the internet using Firefox, or write lectures using Microsoft Word. My latest computer from Intel also contains a webcam which I use with Skype to keep in touch with my friends. I can express a lot through my facial expressions to those who know me well.I can also give lectures. I write the lecture beforehand then save it to disk. I can then use a part of the ACAT software called Lecture Manager to send it to the speech synthesiser a paragraph at a time. It works quite well and I can try out the lecture and polish it before I give it. I keep looking into new assistive technologies, and I have experimented with eye tracking and brain controlled interfaces to communicate with my computer. However although they work well for other people, I still find my cheek operated switch easier and less fatiguing to use. ""Stephen HawkingOh yeah and the game is okay I guess..			"

												This game is still good after not playing it for a long time. Definitly worth getting. It makes me wish some of the other rabbids games were on steam so i could get them.			"

												I purchased this game recently and just applied for a refund because it is not entirely compatible with my gamepad, all other rayman games work fine with my logitech gamepad F310, but this one doesn't. Not interested playing it with keyboard or mouse. "

												I'm gonna be honest. I didn't like this game at all. The controls are terrible at some Minigames, Most of the Minigames are boring and those that aren't you either get to play all the time till you get bored of them too or you barely get to play them at all and the graphics are pretty bland for a game that came out on the Wii and a year later on the Xbox 360. I played the game to 100% Completion and I'm going to say right away... the ending is not worth it.I would not recommend this game to anyone. Spend your money on another Rayman Game like Rayman 2 or Rayman Origins.			"

												A broken piece of crap game, made by a game studio that only cares to produce crap and then hide from customers, refusing to fix well known and documented issues. For example, you cannot finish some games due to glitches. Some common controllers are not supported. You cannot get a refund. Bought this game for my kids, in the day where we have emulators that can accept four inputs on a PC with great hardware, and its free a paid game studio/publisher can't make a single game work correctly. Vote with your wallet.			"

												Cool game. If you have 10 extra dollars, you should get it. Mostly it's just minigames, but they're really cool. The game runs smoothly even on a bad computer like mine, so you should get it.			"

												I really like Rayman games. But for this one for certain mini-games. I find are frustrating. Particulary if the game isn't controller supported. So I'd like you to make this game to support controllers please. I will give this game a thumbs up as I do feel certain you can make the game controller supported. Plus I am a fan of Rayman games.P.S. Please also release on Steam Rayman 2 The Great Escape as that is still the best Rayman game.			"

												You get to use a cow instead of a ball and chain at an ""olympic"" hammer throw event.  If that doesn't interest you in the slightest bit, I don't know what will.			"

												I nominated this game for est use of farm animals. The insane rabbids are one thing, but they toture their fellow sheep, cattle and pigs. They get thrown, beaten, humiliated and so forth. And they mostly force Rayman to do it (or maybe he does it willingly?) All in all, this game is great fun, with nice minigames, however 2 player sucks on this version (doesn't even support 4 players) get it for PS2 or Wii if you want that. It's still fun to play alone.Oh, and the animals all look weird and crazy.			"
